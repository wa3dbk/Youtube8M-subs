guitar<00:00:26.060> lesson<00:00:26.480> today<00:00:26.720> I'm<00:00:26.840> going<00:00:26.930> to<00:00:26.990> talk

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
guitar lesson today I'm going to talk

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.249 
guitar lesson today I'm going to talk
about<00:00:27.700> string<00:00:28.700> skipping<00:00:29.000> and<00:00:29.360> hybrid<00:00:30.020> picking

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
about string skipping and hybrid picking

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.319 
about string skipping and hybrid picking
and<00:00:30.680> the<00:00:31.550> first<00:00:31.759> thing<00:00:31.910> I'm<00:00:32.029> going<00:00:32.119> to<00:00:32.210> talk

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
and the first thing I'm going to talk

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.150 
and the first thing I'm going to talk
about<00:00:32.480> also<00:00:32.930> uses<00:00:33.320> some<00:00:33.500> alternate<00:00:33.950> picking

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
about also uses some alternate picking

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.639 
about also uses some alternate picking
which<00:00:34.489> we<00:00:34.610> talked<00:00:34.850> about<00:00:35.000> in<00:00:35.239> the<00:00:35.270> first

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
which we talked about in the first

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.319 
which we talked about in the first
lesson<00:00:36.649> in<00:00:36.829> which<00:00:37.010> we<00:00:37.160> also<00:00:37.309> used<00:00:37.730> a<00:00:37.940> bit<00:00:38.210> in

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
lesson in which we also used a bit in

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.420 
lesson in which we also used a bit in
the<00:00:38.420> second<00:00:38.809> lesson<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:39.860> it's<00:00:40.010> also<00:00:40.130> going<00:00:40.370> to

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
the second lesson and it's also going to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.220 
the second lesson and it's also going to
use<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:40.760> familiar<00:00:41.270> shape<00:00:41.780> if<00:00:41.989> you've<00:00:42.110> been

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
use the familiar shape if you've been

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.799 
use the familiar shape if you've been
watching<00:00:42.350> along<00:00:43.100> with<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:43.370> lessons<00:00:43.760> it's<00:00:44.600> it

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
watching along with the lessons it's it

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.620 
watching along with the lessons it's it
which<00:00:45.050> is<00:00:45.230> a<00:00:45.790> second<00:00:46.790> position<00:00:46.910> of<00:00:47.450> the

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
which is a second position of the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.020 
which is a second position of the
harmonic<00:00:48.320> minor<00:00:48.470> scale<00:00:49.280> starting<00:00:49.640> on<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.850> D

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
harmonic minor scale starting on the D

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.410 
harmonic minor scale starting on the D
string<00:00:50.060> and<00:00:50.950> in<00:00:51.950> the<00:00:52.400> a<00:00:52.430> harmonic<00:00:52.970> minor<00:00:53.120> this

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
string and in the a harmonic minor this

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.270 
string and in the a harmonic minor this
time<00:00:53.630> which<00:00:53.780> is<00:00:53.810> the<00:00:53.990> same<00:00:54.170> shape<00:00:54.560> that<00:00:55.040> we<00:00:55.070> use

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
time which is the same shape that we use

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.700 
time which is the same shape that we use
for<00:00:55.310> the<00:00:55.580> very<00:00:55.760> first<00:00:56.000> lesson<00:00:56.450> so<00:00:57.110> hopefully

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
for the very first lesson so hopefully

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.710 
for the very first lesson so hopefully
you've<00:00:57.980> been<00:00:58.070> watching<00:00:58.250> along<00:00:58.580> and<00:00:58.910> picked<00:00:59.600> up

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
you've been watching along and picked up

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.480 
you've been watching along and picked up
on<00:00:59.900> some<00:01:00.110> of<00:01:00.200> that<00:01:00.230> stuff<00:01:00.560> so<00:01:01.220> it<00:01:01.280> will<00:01:01.370> help

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
on some of that stuff so it will help

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.580 
on some of that stuff so it will help
you<00:01:01.670> with<00:01:01.790> this<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:02.230> here's<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:03.320> first<00:01:03.440> look

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
you with this and here's the first look

okay so what's going on here is we're

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.919 
okay so what's going on here is we're
gonna<00:01:41.250> start<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.640> D<00:01:41.789> string<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:42.750> this

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
gonna start on the D string with this

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.730 
gonna start on the D string with this
year<00:01:44.330> we're<00:01:45.330> going<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.509> skip<00:01:46.110> over<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.560> g

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
year we're going to skip over the g

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.710 
year we're going to skip over the g
string<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.250> do<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> same<00:01:48.000> shape<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> B

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
string and do the same shape on the B

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.419 
string and do the same shape on the B
string<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.560> you're<00:01:49.740> picking<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.280> be

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
string so you're picking is going to be

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.429 
string so you're picking is going to be
exactly<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.360> same<00:01:51.390> as<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.840> normally<00:01:51.960> would<00:01:52.200> be

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
exactly the same as it normally would be

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.850 
exactly the same as it normally would be
with<00:01:52.649> an<00:01:52.770> alternate<00:01:53.159> picking<00:01:53.310> up<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.270> scale

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
with an alternate picking up a scale

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.809 
with an alternate picking up a scale
except<00:01:55.860> you're<00:01:56.009> going<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.190> skip<00:01:56.369> over<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> g

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
except you're going to skip over the g

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.309 
except you're going to skip over the g
string<00:01:59.420> okay<00:02:00.420> then<00:02:00.659> we're<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.959> go<00:02:01.110> back

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
string okay then we're going to go back

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.710 
string okay then we're going to go back
to<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.560> g<00:02:01.830> string<00:02:02.039> plug<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.459> same<00:02:02.640> shape<00:02:02.939> skip

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
to the g string plug the same shape skip

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.120 
to the g string plug the same shape skip
over<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.049> b<00:02:04.200> string<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.679> do<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:04.920> other

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
over the b string and do this other

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.760 
over the b string and do this other
shape<00:02:05.429> on<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.789> e<00:02:06.209> string<00:02:07.020> which<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.590> a

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
shape on the e string which is a

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.190 
shape on the e string which is a
slightly<00:02:08.429> different<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:08.940> just<00:02:09.119> play<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.539> 8th

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
slightly different we just play the 8th

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.930 
slightly different we just play the 8th
fret<00:02:10.560> instead<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.950> an<00:02:11.039> unfair<00:02:16.430> i'm<00:02:17.430> tucking<00:02:17.700> my

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
fret instead of an unfair i'm tucking my

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.610 
fret instead of an unfair i'm tucking my
ring<00:02:18.239> finger<00:02:18.420> under<00:02:18.780> there<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.230> can<00:02:19.440> see

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
ring finger under there so you can see

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.900 
ring finger under there so you can see
what<00:02:19.739> i'm<00:02:19.799> doing<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:20.130> little<00:02:20.310> clearer<00:02:22.819> let<00:02:23.819> me

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
what i'm doing a little clearer let me

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.610 
what i'm doing a little clearer let me
slide<00:02:24.150> up<00:02:24.299> one<00:02:24.510> fret<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.019> we<00:02:25.140> go<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.440> this

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
slide up one fret and we go to this

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.410 
slide up one fret and we go to this
shape<00:02:25.860> right<00:02:26.069> here<00:02:26.599> on<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.780> e<00:02:27.810> string<00:02:29.329> let<00:02:30.329> me

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
shape right here on the e string let me

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.520 
shape right here on the e string let me
skip<00:02:30.660> over<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.019> B<00:02:31.140> string<00:02:33.079> back<00:02:34.079> to<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.320> same

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
skip over the B string back to the same

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.920 
skip over the B string back to the same
shape<00:02:34.769> on<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.040> g<00:02:35.280> string<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.790> then<00:02:36.480> back<00:02:36.780> to

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
shape on the g string and then back to

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.569 
shape on the g string and then back to
this<00:02:37.049> shape<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.739> we<00:02:37.769> just<00:02:38.040> used<00:02:38.220> on<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.489> e

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
this shape that we just used on the e

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.090 
this shape that we just used on the e
string<00:02:38.609> but<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.150> time<00:02:39.299> of<00:02:39.359> the<00:02:39.540> B<00:02:39.690> string<00:02:40.100> we

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
string but this time of the B string we

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.500 
string but this time of the B string we
skip<00:02:41.340> over<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.670> eastern<00:02:42.030> you're<00:02:42.180> getting<00:02:42.450> go

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
skip over the eastern you're getting go

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
skip over the eastern you're getting go
to<00:02:42.690> these<00:02:44.030> back<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.180> our<00:02:45.299> original<00:02:45.420> shape<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.290> I

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
to these back to our original shape so I

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.340 
to these back to our original shape so I
know<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.310> might<00:02:47.609> sound<00:02:47.640> overly<00:02:48.600> confusing

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
know that might sound overly confusing

00:02:49.350 --> 00:03:01.149 
know that might sound overly confusing
but<00:02:49.500> here<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.769> is<00:02:49.890> all<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.670> way<00:02:50.790> through<00:02:51.000> slow

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.190 

so<00:03:02.159> that's<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.659> ok<00:03:03.659> I<00:03:03.690> also<00:03:03.840> want<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.140> show

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
so that's that ok I also want to show

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.770 
so that's that ok I also want to show
you<00:03:04.349> a<00:03:04.409> little<00:03:04.500> variation<00:03:05.129> on<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.280> lick<00:03:05.780> this

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
you a little variation on that lick this

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.509 
you a little variation on that lick this
time<00:03:07.019> only<00:03:07.200> in<00:03:07.379> the<00:03:07.500> ascending<00:03:07.890> direction<00:03:08.040> but

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
time only in the ascending direction but

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.220 
time only in the ascending direction but
that's<00:03:09.120> some<00:03:09.239> little<00:03:09.450> turnaround<00:03:09.720> swear<00:03:10.110> it

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
that's some little turnaround swear it

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.080 
that's some little turnaround swear it
it<00:03:10.409> goes<00:03:10.769> back<00:03:11.040> down<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.280> little<00:03:11.519> bit<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.819> back

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
it goes back down a little bit and back

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.210 
it goes back down a little bit and back
up<00:03:12.299> it's<00:03:13.080> just<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.319> little<00:03:13.440> variation<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.129> the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
up it's just a little variation on the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:22.340 
up it's just a little variation on the
same<00:03:14.400> kind<00:03:14.549> of<00:03:14.670> idea

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:36.569 

ok

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.220 

can<00:03:37.579> we<00:03:37.670> using<00:03:37.909> the<00:03:37.969> same<00:03:38.209> shape<00:03:38.540> same<00:03:38.749> scale

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
can we using the same shape same scale

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.170 
can we using the same shape same scale
that<00:03:39.349> we<00:03:39.469> used<00:03:39.620> for<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.889> other<00:03:40.040> way<00:03:40.189> this<00:03:40.939> time

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
that we used for the other way this time

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.619 
that we used for the other way this time
we're<00:03:42.019> going<00:03:42.139> to<00:03:42.200> go<00:03:42.879> the<00:03:43.879> first<00:03:44.120> six<00:03:44.329> notes<00:03:44.510> of

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
we're going to go the first six notes of

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.429 
we're going to go the first six notes of
the<00:03:44.659> same<00:03:46.569> then<00:03:47.569> we're<00:03:47.659> gonna<00:03:47.750> turn<00:03:48.170> around

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
the same then we're gonna turn around

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.410 
the same then we're gonna turn around
right<00:03:48.560> there<00:03:48.769> and<00:03:48.920> come<00:03:49.040> back<00:03:49.159> down<00:03:49.219> and<00:03:49.670> keep

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
right there and come back down and keep

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.720 
right there and come back down and keep
going<00:03:50.659> down<00:03:50.750> this<00:03:50.810> just<00:03:51.290> going<00:03:51.709> on<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.549> g

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
going down this just going on to the g

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.089 
going down this just going on to the g
string<00:03:56.260> okay<00:03:57.260> then<00:03:57.469> once<00:03:57.650> we<00:03:57.769> get<00:03:57.889> to<00:03:57.950> the

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
string okay then once we get to the

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.319 
string okay then once we get to the
lowest<00:03:58.249> note<00:03:58.519> and<00:03:58.700> g-string<00:03:59.030> we're<00:03:59.150> going<00:03:59.269> to

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
lowest note and g-string we're going to

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.670 
lowest note and g-string we're going to
turn<00:03:59.419> back<00:03:59.599> around<00:03:59.780> and<00:03:59.989> come<00:04:00.169> back<00:04:00.200> up<00:04:00.379> and

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
turn back around and come back up and

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.099 
turn back around and come back up and
skip<00:04:00.919> the<00:04:00.980> B<00:04:01.219> string<00:04:01.459> again<00:04:01.609> and<00:04:02.079> do<00:04:03.079> our

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
skip the B string again and do our

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.369 
skip the B string again and do our
little<00:04:03.409> shape<00:04:04.189> on<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.430> E<00:04:04.579> string<00:04:05.090> and<00:04:05.379> slide

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
little shape on the E string and slide

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:20.300 
little shape on the E string and slide
up<00:04:06.560> through<00:04:06.709> our<00:04:06.799> f<00:04:06.980> note

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.710 

and<00:04:20.459> I<00:04:20.609> want<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.000> talk<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.299> you<00:04:21.359> about<00:04:21.480> the

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
and I want to talk to you about the

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.670 
and I want to talk to you about the
hybrid<00:04:21.989> picking<00:04:22.169> thing<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:22.590> little<00:04:22.680> bit<00:04:22.889> and

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
hybrid picking thing a little bit and

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.810 
hybrid picking thing a little bit and
basically<00:04:25.680> what<00:04:25.919> hybrid<00:04:26.220> picking<00:04:26.340> is<00:04:26.639> is

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
basically what hybrid picking is is

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.120 
basically what hybrid picking is is
using<00:04:27.180> some<00:04:27.330> finger<00:04:27.660> picking<00:04:27.900> as<00:04:28.680> well<00:04:28.950> as

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
using some finger picking as well as

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.230 
using some finger picking as well as
using<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.490> pick<00:04:29.700> and<00:04:31.430> it's<00:04:32.430> also<00:04:32.820> used<00:04:33.090> to

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
using the pick and it's also used to

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.420 
using the pick and it's also used to
basically<00:04:33.810> do<00:04:34.230> string<00:04:34.530> skipping<00:04:34.770> so<00:04:35.160> this<00:04:35.310> is

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
basically do string skipping so this is

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.960 
basically do string skipping so this is
another<00:04:35.639> string<00:04:36.000> skipping<00:04:36.240> lick<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:37.970> this

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
another string skipping lick and this

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.629 
another string skipping lick and this
time<00:04:39.150> we're<00:04:39.300> going<00:04:39.389> to<00:04:39.480> use<00:04:40.139> the<00:04:40.980> middle

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
time we're going to use the middle

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.280 
time we're going to use the middle
finger<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.090> pick<00:04:42.419> all<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.810> notes<00:04:43.020> that<00:04:43.200> we're

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
finger to pick all the notes that we're

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.900 
finger to pick all the notes that we're
going<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:43.440> put<00:04:43.560> in<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.740> high<00:04:43.860> E<00:04:43.889> string<00:04:44.070> which

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
going to put in the high E string which

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.090 
going to put in the high E string which
will<00:04:45.060> be<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.300> G<00:04:45.510> note<00:04:45.540> here<00:04:46.200> because<00:04:46.919> it's<00:04:47.040> a

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
will be the G note here because it's a

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.800 
will be the G note here because it's a
pivot<00:04:47.460> lick<00:04:47.850> which<00:04:48.030> means<00:04:48.270> that<00:04:48.330> every<00:04:48.690> other

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
pivot lick which means that every other

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.129 
pivot lick which means that every other
note<00:04:49.080> will<00:04:49.260> be<00:04:49.350> this<00:04:49.530> geno<00:04:49.919> and<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:51.810> tape<00:04:51.990> will

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
note will be this geno and the tape will

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:53.750 
note will be this geno and the tape will
play<00:04:52.260> everything<00:04:52.470> else<00:04:52.800> so<00:04:53.190> here's<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.610> first

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
play everything else so here's the first

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:04.520 
play everything else so here's the first
leg<00:04:54.000> of<00:04:54.120> a<00:04:54.330> look<00:04:54.510> at

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:21.030 

okay<00:05:05.530> so<00:05:05.590> here<00:05:05.949> is<00:05:06.099> slow

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.570 

okay<00:05:22.040> so<00:05:22.100> this<00:05:22.340> is<00:05:22.520> G<00:05:22.820> major<00:05:23.060> and<00:05:24.580> we're

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
okay so this is G major and we're

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.310 
okay so this is G major and we're
playing<00:05:25.760> like<00:05:26.180> I<00:05:26.210> said<00:05:26.480> G<00:05:26.720> note<00:05:26.930> on<00:05:27.170> every

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
playing like I said G note on every

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.070 
playing like I said G note on every
other<00:05:27.560> note<00:05:27.830> but<00:05:28.520> for<00:05:29.420> the<00:05:29.510> bottom<00:05:29.840> part<00:05:29.960> of

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
other note but for the bottom part of

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:46.930 
other note but for the bottom part of
the<00:05:30.140> link<00:05:30.350> it's<00:05:30.500> going<00:05:30.560> to<00:05:30.740> be<00:05:30.860> this

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.850 

okay<00:05:47.990> so<00:05:48.990> it's<00:05:49.110> pretty<00:05:49.260> simple<00:05:49.530> and<00:05:49.710> that's

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
okay so it's pretty simple and that's

okay so it's pretty simple and that's
that<00:05:50.070> and<00:05:50.340> here's<00:05:51.000> a<00:05:51.060> little<00:05:51.200> variation<00:05:52.200> on

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
that and here's a little variation on

00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:04.029 
that and here's a little variation on
that<00:05:52.350> theme

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:13.670 

so<00:06:05.039> here<00:06:05.189> is<00:06:05.219> slow

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
ok so the same the same kind of idea

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.769 
ok so the same the same kind of idea

with the pivoting link on the B nope at

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:28.469 
with the pivoting link on the B nope at
the<00:06:19.870> bottom<00:06:20.199> loop<00:06:20.379> will<00:06:20.560> do<00:06:20.740> this<00:06:20.889> with<00:06:27.479> and

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
the bottom loop will do this with and

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.200 
the bottom loop will do this with and
that's<00:06:28.659> that<00:06:28.870> so<00:06:29.800> I<00:06:29.830> hope<00:06:30.490> you<00:06:30.639> enjoyed<00:06:30.939> it<00:06:31.090> and
