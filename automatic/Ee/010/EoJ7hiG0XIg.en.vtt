could<00:02:46.739> rotate<00:02:47.010> but<00:02:47.820> because<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.120> them

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
could rotate but because of them

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.440 
could rotate but because of them
material<00:02:49.350> there's<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.400> little<00:02:50.670> bit<00:02:50.790> but<00:02:51.209> it

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
material there's a little bit but it

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.840 
material there's a little bit but it
does<00:02:51.600> go<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.140> out<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:53.220> could<00:02:53.430> swallow<00:02:53.670> the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
does go in and out it could swallow the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.630 
does go in and out it could swallow the
bicep<00:02:54.239> but<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.750> know<00:02:54.840> because<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.500> was<00:02:55.640> the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
bicep but you know because it was the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.670 
bicep but you know because it was the
armor<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.269> stuff<00:02:57.510> but<00:02:57.989> he<00:02:58.050> bends<00:02:58.380> at<00:02:58.650> the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
armor and stuff but he bends at the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.759 
armor and stuff but he bends at the
elbow<00:02:58.860> on<00:02:59.870> can't<00:03:00.870> really<00:03:01.140> do<00:03:01.290> double<00:03:01.590> joint

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
elbow on can't really do double joint

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.500 
elbow on can't really do double joint
because<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.190> gets<00:03:02.340> bum<00:03:02.550> bum<00:03:02.880> ah<00:03:03.000> but<00:03:03.269> still

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
because it gets bum bum ah but still

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.690 
because it gets bum bum ah but still
pretty<00:03:03.930> good<00:03:04.050> joint<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.590> ever<00:03:05.100> rotates<00:03:05.519> of

articulation<00:03:09.620> but<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.890> gets<00:03:11.069> hindered<00:03:11.400> a

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
articulation but it gets hindered a

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.370 
articulation but it gets hindered a
little<00:03:11.640> bit<00:03:11.790> because<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.180> armor<00:03:12.540> likes<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.260> go

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
little bit because the armor likes to go

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.670 
little bit because the armor likes to go
forward<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:13.920> back<00:03:14.430> in<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.120> out<00:03:15.470> rotate<00:03:16.470> over
