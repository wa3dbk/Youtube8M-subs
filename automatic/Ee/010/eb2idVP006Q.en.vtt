but<00:04:37.900> riot<00:04:38.320> shields<00:04:38.620> are<00:04:38.710> actually<00:04:38.919> quite<00:04:39.010> hard

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
but riot shields are actually quite hard

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.020 
but riot shields are actually quite hard
to<00:04:39.790> use<00:04:40.380> well<00:04:41.380> if<00:04:42.190> you<00:04:42.370> using<00:04:42.490> commander

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
to use well if you using commander

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.409 
to use well if you using commander
they're<00:04:43.210> not<00:04:43.330> that<00:04:43.710> hard<00:04:44.710> to<00:04:44.770> use<00:04:45.010> but<00:04:45.250> I<00:04:45.490> think

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
they're not that hard to use but I think

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.640 
they're not that hard to use but I think
that<00:04:46.600> you've<00:04:46.810> got<00:04:46.930> to<00:04:46.990> be<00:04:47.050> quite<00:04:47.200> skill<00:04:47.470> to<00:04:47.620> use

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
that you've got to be quite skill to use

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.159 
that you've got to be quite skill to use
and<00:04:47.860> effectively<00:04:50.789> yeah<00:04:51.789> hope<00:04:52.450> you've<00:04:52.720> hope
