pads on Android devices but I rarely

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
ever use them so in this case it really

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.249 
ever use them so in this case it really
doesn't<00:01:57.180> work<00:01:57.420> out<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.719> be<00:01:57.810> able<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.990> problem
