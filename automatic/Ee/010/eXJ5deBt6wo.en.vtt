00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.330
 Hi everyone! All right, beauty beauty. 

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.820
 move on 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:12.719
 had told health was the last video 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.940
 there is no longer this video to have 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.529
 good sense plp nÃ© 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.880
 Let's do one more video of them now. 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.880
 finished toffee 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.779
 the finished dog 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.440
 and is not waiting for him 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:45.070
 Waiting, time for him has time. 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:47.530
 're all revitalized brinon little noise 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.160
 still glued to why it shines but does not 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.030
 the table is set 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.030
 all resolved 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:02.010
 now I was a little annoyed with a 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.690
 thing we put that there shorty 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.909
 Like I said, just sell the crap. 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.490
 I do not play 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:14.920
 change the small motor here any 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:17.350
 minute a little pink water glass and I 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.830
 I even commented 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:26.049
 and the car was super well taken care of 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:28.060
 but sincerely the fifth little black 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.920
 Because I started revitalizing here to 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.700
 be revitalized even in the classics of 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.850
 motor 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.630
 there began to revitalize that the filter 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:41.410
 air filter even a little bit 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.870
 here is a bit humid and found a 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.110
 Default people say sorry for a defect 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:50.790
 very serious and seems simple but 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.790
 Defect to save there 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:59.050
 for which there is an air filter here 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.050
 no problem, right why 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.800
 the colleague instead of changing it or 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.649
 I think I vote here with a 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.220
 Clamp quiebra cede the alley 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.240
 more 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.490
 I can shake it here, I can not 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.810
 I know if I'll find it easily. 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.120
 but an alley here is not bigger here than 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.210
 come here is so for sure the party 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.940
 This is all, then no problem 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.530
 an alley button on this one but the deal 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:38.250
 is so there is this air filter here 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:41.790
 You're welcome, because it looks like I was going to 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:47.070
 I started revitalizing that hose 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:49.490
 hose skipped it here inside the 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.490
 air filter 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.250
 this is inside the bus station 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:05.920
 because the first air inlet is that 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.770
 through the filter and enters the engine clean 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.350
 this is air 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.330
 I think it's a fuel with dust 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.910
 with everything right 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.000
 he is no joke or he is not 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.709
 a joke does not make a deal 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.040
 these to do 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.660
 understood if one does not have one does not have 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.240
 fitting 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.720
 it does not fit a bar if an attitude 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.870
 simple to put alley to the state of it 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.870
 on here 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.950
 I came back and now go there 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.170
 and has a pipeline of the order of 16 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.190
 It's all oil there. 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:59.140
 all this is, look, I came back to clean now 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:04.500
 all this here all this here is one 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.500
 body of the butterfly donor in a country 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.580
 When I take this one out, we 'll see how 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.180
 is it going to be this misery and this 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.380
 surprise because one should not install 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.890
 good thing 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.419
 finally a mechanic who receives a car 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.620
 these 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:28.240
 that you notice that the owner takes care 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.780
 extreme and makes a mistake like that 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.780
 because a loot mistake is even 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.360
 compromise the entire valve seal 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.510
 a little air without it around here 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.010
 Fuel goes in here beats there 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.310
 that's cute baby 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:48.180
 on the cylinder head and what makes the 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.340
 are the valves 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.380
 Then I started paying attention to another one. 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.190
 thing 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.190
 Look at this belt. 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:08.620
 the amount of crack that has this 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:12.420
 run down there from the bottom we go 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.420
 see if I can count on you 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.840
 not just before 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.940
 but it's a bit of a crack this 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:38.770
 in fact totally unnecessary 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:42.750
 totally unnecessary frankly I 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:47.080
 frankly very unnecessary this does not 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.770
 I did not find it convenient to find a mistake. 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.259
 these 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:54.099
 we have to talk to it really 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:57.669
 with a certain way because if she 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:06:00.009
 I trusted my colleague very much and if the 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:04.599
 my colleague really did not hesitate to 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:09.190
 An illegal mate in a chat is talking 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:10.900
 so but who does an oil tunnel 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.550
 inside the air duct 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.949
 I'll tell you something not really. 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.190
 I was not very satisfied 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:20.620
 so let's change the wires already with 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:24.460
 sure I think if I put a 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:30.789
 alley I can learn this one 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:34.090
 decently quiet because the business 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.889
 You are here to stay tight here okay i love 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.690
 She's going to play that role quietly. 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:43.060
 I'm going to clean it all this way and I'll open the 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:46.479
 butterfly and we will see what it is 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:49.330
 The surprise I have here is not people. 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:51.370
 so let's see if this is the last video 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:55.860
 Unfortunately , he's left with a scolding. 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:07:00.960
 then colleague mechanics who got a 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:03.009
 vehicle under these conditions to be 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.979
 Not one of them gives you access. 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:07.979
 so this is hug and let's work
