00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.490
 more to my channel to the terror channel saw game 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.160
 and welcome to a new video of 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.589
 fucking hell ultimate team but focused 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.300
 to fifa 16 as you see the title in 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:20.060
 miniature there is practically done the 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.529
 existence of a new one is killer of a 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.599
 new player with five stars in 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.570
 watermarks for next year for the 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.250
 new fifa game and in the 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.920
 updates of the template has 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.550
 given by looking in forums and I read that 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.220
 had gotten into milan a while ago 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.010
 to a player who in real life is a 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.890
 magician of value is a very young lad an 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.230
 player who wants it half europe the 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.540
 he is a very talented boy 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.900
 and filigree is an authentic 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.150
 show as I say plays in the Milan 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.250
 let's go now in a game let's go 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.170
 to get to team management and we're going to 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.540
 see all the way down and are 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.670
 players more tours if I 'm not mistaken 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.580
 name does not put it 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.530
 good total is this guy that as you see 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.909
 here has five stars in watermarks 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:14.990
 has average 66 but that I think it 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:18.259
 the up the statistics are something 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.289
 loose on the subject of ball controls 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.360
 and things with the ball on the feet the 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.789
 true that he has them quite well but 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.170
 and as you can see are not 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:31.130
 nothing of the other world but it is that it has 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.810
 mean 66 but is that this player the 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.869
 it would be a delight to have him in 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.390
 last 16 because it is that it would be very 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.730
 very valued because it has fame and this 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.130
 player 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.040
 her fame is for being so good at doing 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.980
 watermarks and juggling the ball like this 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.350
 that it would be a total luxury to have it in 116 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.000
 ultimate team I do not say in the game anymore 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.500
 yes because I focus more on what is 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.870
 mode truth ultimate team game 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.470
 that as I say it would be very bought and very 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.270
 much loved by the players the way 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.980
 besides that a very good position that 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.980
 deserves or I think that they play bands 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.160
 but it's not mc or the truth much better 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.570
 although you play in the center you can do 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.940
 authentic breakdowns and destruction 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.420
 rival defenses with this player because 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.610
 he has to have a pretty good dribble 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.520
 he has 75 dribble but he has half 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.270
 66 ie is fine and if you go up 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.910
 and it reaches an average 70-71 is that it's going to be a 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.980
 cucumber of the best silverware surely 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.440
 and the most used so nothing 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.910
 guys to the extent that I found out about 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.280
 new players that may be in 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.920

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.240
