polishes<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.180> I'm<00:00:45.450> using<00:00:45.629> these<00:00:45.809> polishes

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
polishes and I'm using these polishes

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.750 
polishes and I'm using these polishes
the<00:00:46.410> past<00:00:46.620> two<00:00:46.829> months<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.309> really<00:00:47.579> love

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the past two months and I really love

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.819 
the past two months and I really love
the<00:00:47.940> formula<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.480> these<00:00:48.600> polishes<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.590> very

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
the formula of these polishes the very

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.920 
the formula of these polishes the very
opaque<00:00:50.340> oh<00:00:50.399> one<00:00:50.730> coat<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.149> all<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.449> need<00:00:51.629> and

opaque oh one coat is all you need and

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.410 
opaque oh one coat is all you need and
I'd<00:00:52.170> say<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.649> drying<00:00:53.100> time<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.789> about<00:00:53.940> five

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
I'd say the drying time is about five

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.020 
I'd say the drying time is about five
minutes<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.289> I'm<00:00:55.980> literally<00:00:56.340> out<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.789> door<00:00:57.000> I

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
minutes and I'm literally out the door I

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.790 
minutes and I'm literally out the door I
mean<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.360> course<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.840> don't<00:00:58.050> really<00:00:58.379> want<00:00:58.680> to

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800
