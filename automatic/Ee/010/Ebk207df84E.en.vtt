world so anything with a battery charger
is<00:00:59.730> gonna<00:00:59.910> be<00:01:00.059> dual<00:01:00.420> voltage<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.289> do<00:01:01.920> your

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
is gonna be dual voltage so do your

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.450 
is gonna be dual voltage so do your
digital<00:01:02.730> cameras<00:01:03.180> your<00:01:03.359> smartphones<00:01:04.460> tablets

with<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> battery<00:01:12.299> charger<00:01:13.020> look<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.979> it'll

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
with a battery charger look on it it'll

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.039 
with a battery charger look on it it'll
say<00:01:14.250> 100<00:01:14.729> 240<00:01:15.210> V<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.570> that'll<00:01:15.780> mean<00:01:15.869> will<00:01:16.020> be

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
say 100 240 V and that'll mean will be

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.149 
say 100 240 V and that'll mean will be
dual<00:01:16.409> voltage<00:01:17.100> okay<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.590> appliance

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.640 
laptop I would use this as an insurance
policy<00:04:20.849> in<00:04:21.510> parts<00:04:22.109> of<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.260> world<00:04:22.320> where

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
policy in parts of the world where

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.190 
policy in parts of the world where
perhaps<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.580> voltage<00:04:24.000> isn't<00:04:24.390> as<00:04:24.450> consistent

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
perhaps the voltage isn't as consistent

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.710 
perhaps the voltage isn't as consistent
I<00:04:25.380> think<00:04:26.190> it's<00:04:26.550> a<00:04:26.640> worthwhile<00:04:26.820> investment<00:04:27.150> to

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
I think it's a worthwhile investment to

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.990 
I think it's a worthwhile investment to
a<00:04:27.750> built-in<00:04:28.290> surge<00:04:28.530> protector<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.250> that's<00:04:29.670> in

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
a built-in surge protector and that's in

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.630 
a built-in surge protector and that's in
within<00:04:30.300> this<00:04:30.510> travel<00:04:30.930> smart<00:04:31.640> adapter

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
within this travel smart adapter

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.740 
within this travel smart adapter
all-in-one<00:04:33.180> unit

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
all-in-one unit

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.060 
all-in-one unit
thanks<00:04:34.170> for<00:04:34.290> coming<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.560> packing<00:04:34.890> light

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
thanks for coming a packing light

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.830 
thanks for coming a packing light
hopefully<00:04:35.640> we<00:04:35.730> can<00:04:35.850> make<00:04:35.970> travel<00:04:36.330> easier<00:04:36.570> for

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
hopefully we can make travel easier for

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.960 
hopefully we can make travel easier for
you
