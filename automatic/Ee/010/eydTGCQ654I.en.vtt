00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:09.980
 let's try together with the student decide 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:13.730
 clean tasks from point a to point b m 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.049
 the train is going out of the load by the way well 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.170
 let's say with TVs 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.010
 tape recorders vacuum cleaners where are you from 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.340
 all at the point 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.130
 that this is abroad, let it be abroad 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.009
 let's say and this is amsterdam so here and 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.339
 it is asked when these goods will arrive in 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:34.220
 point b + and if speed 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.469
 a minute and then keep a tv with them 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.649
 there are 100 of their no yes really 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.920
 sucks means b is bryansk where 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.320
 nothing is like that when it arrives 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.390
 fruit with goods so it is very simple 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.390
 need distance 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:57.239
 with dividing by speed 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.480
 we get the time right but you forgot 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.019
 about stopping at point t at customs because 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.750
 before 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.619
 imported goods will get to us and need 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.030
 check collect taxes analogue come in 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.490
 you know this question will answer you better 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.060
 Economist from the newspaper Kommersant Alexander 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.440
 piper 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.840
 if the country introduced the goods surplus 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.590
 increased taxes on imports and thus 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.700
 protects the manufacturer from cheap 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.429
 products from abroad 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.429
 if in the country the goods are few or like ours 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.410
 or how we do not have them at all 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.450
 customs taxes are reduced or 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.960
 eliminated altogether and it allows 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.700
 saturate 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.369
 stores goods imported 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.649
 origin well it is clear that the goods 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.690
 there was more government should have been 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.159
 make taxes on shortages minimal 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.650
 you will make sure now 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:53.000
 open recovery and see 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.870
 for television 400 percent same tape recorder 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.460
 500 saw 600 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.780
 really to bring these goods 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.870
 have to pay 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.200
 their 4 5 6 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.420
 multiple cost this is unprecedented 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.000
 case in world practice is coming from 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.730
 this tax we will remain without any 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.750
 import goods because of this tax not 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.110
 there will be less of them 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.330
 Well, of course, of course the director has different 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.150
 export companions costa problems with 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.940
 there is no shortage but what will they tell us 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.280
 Customs today, the flow of imports has decreased 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.590
 I think that yes decreasing decreased due to 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.870
 what is possible due to the fact that there were 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.010
 taxes imposed 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.440
 organizations began to think whether they should 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.890
 could buy a little expensive 100 to be able to 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.740
 whether they 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.860
 sow these purchases and most importantly we can 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.530
 to master these purchases we are the buyer and 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.150
 the higher the tax the higher the price 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.280
 listen to the director of small 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.660
 enterprises or another in Ukraine and know 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.560
 we take the price in dollars and that's it 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.260
 video cassette glasses 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.090
 good videotapes cost $ 2 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.610
 multiply by a factor 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.560
 about 30 of our wooden ruble 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.209
 It turns out 60 rubles it is ours 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.160
 wonderful customs will take us 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.250
 tax with 130 percent for this here 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.450
 cassettes and so the price will be 8 100 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.000
 rubles yes it does not matter decided the Allied 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.840
 government is the task of saturating our 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.860
 poor market and by the way how is our 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.920
 the task is when will the train come to us from 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.230
 amsterdam you under never have them 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.590
 would not have Ramon lived will get 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:39.379
 you pro upstairs again did so 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:41.830
