Europe and grows on lawns it has

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.130 
Europe and grows on lawns it has
opposite<00:00:22.020> leaves<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.590> leaves<00:00:22.740> are<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.040> pairs

long leaf stalks there's another species
without<00:00:27.270> the<00:00:27.510> long<00:00:27.690> leaf<00:00:27.960> stalks<00:00:28.320> that's<00:00:28.590> just

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
without the long leaf stalks that's just

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.970 
without the long leaf stalks that's just
as<00:00:29.070> good<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.820> leaves<00:00:30.480> are<00:00:30.960> shaped<00:00:31.800> like

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
as good the leaves are shaped like

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.660 
as good the leaves are shaped like
spades<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.469> there's<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.559> tiny<00:00:34.860> white<00:00:35.219> flower

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.080 

now<00:00:43.260> earlier<00:00:43.800> somebody<00:00:44.310> said<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> leaves<00:00:44.880> of

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
now earlier somebody said the leaves of

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.740 
now earlier somebody said the leaves of
the<00:00:45.210> burdock<00:00:45.810> look<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.380> little<00:00:46.590> like<00:00:46.920> rhubarb

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
the burdock look a little like rhubarb

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.119 
the burdock look a little like rhubarb
however<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.050> don't<00:00:50.600> identify<00:00:51.600> which<00:00:52.440> family

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
however you don't identify which family

however you don't identify which family
a<00:00:53.160> plant<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.090> by<00:00:54.629> its<00:00:54.930> leaves<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.590> need<00:00:55.770> to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
a plant is in by its leaves you need to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.830 
a plant is in by its leaves you need to
look<00:00:56.040> at<00:00:56.220> it's<00:00:56.370> at<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.790> flowers<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
look at it's at the flowers and the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.280 
look at it's at the flowers and the
seeds<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.760> legumes<00:00:59.760> all<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.390> P<00:01:01.050> like

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
seeds so that legumes all have P like

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.140 
seeds so that legumes all have P like
flowers<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.100> they<00:01:02.190> have<00:01:02.370> pods<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.940> look

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
flowers and they have pods that look

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.080 
flowers and they have pods that look
like<00:01:03.300> some<00:01:03.629> form<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.170> pea<00:01:05.070> pod<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:05.850> learned

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
like some form of pea pod we learned

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.790 
like some form of pea pod we learned
that<00:01:06.240> from<00:01:06.479> Linnaeus<00:01:07.020> he<00:01:07.200> was<00:01:07.350> born<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.740> think

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
that from Linnaeus he was born I think

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.620 
that from Linnaeus he was born I think
302<00:01:08.729> years<00:01:09.060> ago<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:11.030> massive<00:01:12.030> plants<00:01:12.420> kept

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
302 years ago and massive plants kept

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.139 
302 years ago and massive plants kept
coming<00:01:13.050> in<00:01:13.200> from<00:01:13.470> all<00:01:13.650> over<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.070> world<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.910> his

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
coming in from all over the world in his

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.870 
coming in from all over the world in his
day<00:01:15.390> travel<00:01:15.990> finally<00:01:16.590> became<00:01:16.979> more<00:01:17.310> possible

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
day travel finally became more possible

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.600 
day travel finally became more possible
than<00:01:17.940> it<00:01:18.210> was<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> Middle<00:01:18.869> Ages<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.610> you

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
than it was in the Middle Ages and you

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.779 
than it was in the Middle Ages and you
couldn't<00:01:20.940> just<00:01:21.119> give<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:22.530> French<00:01:23.220> name<00:01:23.550> an

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
couldn't just give a French name an

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.840 
couldn't just give a French name an
English<00:01:24.180> name<00:01:24.390> an<00:01:24.630> Italian<00:01:25.289> name<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.890> five

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
regional names for the same plant that

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.880 
regional names for the same plant that
it<00:01:29.759> would<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.030> was<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:30.539> too<00:01:30.750> much<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.590> he

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
it would just was just too much so he

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.469 
it would just was just too much so he
studied<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.460> plants<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.060> instead<00:01:33.330> of

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
studied the plants and instead of

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.260 
studied the plants and instead of
categories<00:01:34.550> categorizing<00:01:35.550> things<00:01:35.789> according

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
categories categorizing things according

categories categorizing things according
to<00:01:36.420> whether<00:01:36.600> they<00:01:36.840> were<00:01:36.899> useful<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.740> humans<00:01:38.130> or

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
to whether they were useful to humans or

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.790 
to whether they were useful to humans or
harmful<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.360> humans<00:01:39.899> so<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.560> word

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
harmful to humans so like the word

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.179 
harmful to humans so like the word
vermin<00:01:42.110> includes<00:01:43.110> rodents<00:01:43.679> and<00:01:43.979> insects<00:01:44.750> and

those terms were not even were not even

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.050 
those terms were not even were not even
formed<00:01:49.290> back<00:01:49.830> then<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.250> was<00:01:50.369> all<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.820> was<00:01:50.970> all

have the same needs will develop similar

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.259 
have the same needs will develop similar
leaves<00:02:16.470> but<00:02:17.070> you're<00:02:17.430> not<00:02:17.519> going<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.790> go<00:02:17.940> from

leaves but you're not going to go from

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.210 
leaves but you're not going to go from
four<00:02:18.570> of<00:02:18.600> petals<00:02:19.140> on<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.320> flower<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.980> five

sunlight the bricks protect it from the
cold<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:53.490> little<00:03:53.820> bit<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.300> they<00:03:54.750> absorb<00:03:55.110> the

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
cold a little bit and they absorb the

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.380 
cold a little bit and they absorb the
sunlight<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:55.950> re-radiate<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:57.209> in<00:03:57.300> the

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
sunlight and re-radiate it so in the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.880 
sunlight and re-radiate it so in the
middle<00:03:57.630> of<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.780> winter<00:03:57.990> when<00:03:58.320> everything<00:03:58.350> is

middle of the winter when everything is
frozen<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.550> look<00:03:59.730> at<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:01.320> border

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
frozen you look at the the border

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.199 
frozen you look at the the border
between<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.220> bricks<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.640> your<00:04:02.730> garden<00:04:03.120> you

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
between the bricks and your garden you

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.150 
between the bricks and your garden you
may<00:04:03.360> find<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.780> row<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:04.080> chickweed<00:04:04.350> growing<00:04:04.950> only

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
may find a row of chickweed growing only

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.000 
may find a row of chickweed growing only
only<00:04:05.940> there<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:06.810> with<00:04:07.050> climate<00:04:07.350> change<00:04:07.800> and

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
only there and with climate change and

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.360 
only there and with climate change and
global<00:04:08.100> warming<00:04:08.400> we're<00:04:09.239> having<00:04:09.690> milder

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
global warming we're having milder

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.250 
global warming we're having milder
winters<00:04:11.370> there's<00:04:12.360> going<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:12.690> be<00:04:12.780> a<00:04:12.900> lot<00:04:13.230> more

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
winters there's going to be a lot more

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.800 
winters there's going to be a lot more
of<00:04:13.770> it<00:04:13.890> so<00:04:14.250> this<00:04:14.400> this<00:04:14.670> has<00:04:14.910> more<00:04:15.150> vitamins

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
of it so this this has more vitamins

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.080 
of it so this this has more vitamins

easy<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:31.140> get<00:04:31.320> pneumonia<00:04:31.980> or<00:04:32.100> some<00:04:32.310> other

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
easy to get pneumonia or some other

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.940 
easy to get pneumonia or some other
secondary<00:04:33.419> infection<00:04:34.260> while<00:04:34.740> you're

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
secondary infection while you're

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.600 
secondary infection while you're
recovering<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.729> then<00:04:35.880> die<00:04:36.710> and<00:04:37.710> herbalists

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
recovering and then die and herbalists

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.990 
recovering and then die and herbalists
would<00:04:39.030> give<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:40.430> convalescence<00:04:41.430> some

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
would give the convalescence some

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.740 
would give the convalescence some
chickweed

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
chickweed

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.960 
chickweed
are<00:04:43.380> actually<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:43.830> lot<00:04:44.100> of<00:04:44.250> chickweed<00:04:44.520> and

are actually a lot of chickweed and

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.670 
are actually a lot of chickweed and
they'd<00:04:45.210> notice<00:04:45.720> it<00:04:45.870> would<00:04:46.020> rebuild<00:04:46.470> their

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
they'd notice it would rebuild their

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.320 
they'd notice it would rebuild their
strength<00:04:46.979> no<00:04:47.190> one<00:04:47.340> knew<00:04:47.460> what<00:04:47.640> vitamins<00:04:48.150> were

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
strength no one knew what vitamins were

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330 
strength no one knew what vitamins were
but<00:04:48.840> it's<00:04:49.050> because<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.740> vitamins<00:04:50.250> that

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
but it's because of the vitamins that

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.760 
but it's because of the vitamins that
were<00:04:51.240> probably<00:04:51.570> deficient<00:04:52.290> in<00:04:52.380> people's

depleted by the illness that this plant
this<00:04:59.550> plant<00:04:59.610> replaced<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.510> vitamins<00:05:01.020> and

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
this plant replaced the vitamins and

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.940 
this plant replaced the vitamins and

then throw in the chickweed turn the
heat<00:05:47.160> to<00:05:47.190> mix<00:05:47.849> everything<00:05:48.210> together<00:05:48.569> turn<00:05:49.139> the

heat to low and cover the pan the water

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:56.600 
heat to low and cover the pan the water
that<00:05:54.620> clings<00:05:55.620> to<00:05:55.889> the<00:05:56.009> leaves<00:05:56.280> of<00:05:56.520> the

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
chickweed after it's been washed is

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.240 
chickweed after it's been washed is
enough<00:05:59.190> to<00:06:00.229> steam<00:06:01.229> the<00:06:01.740> chickweed
