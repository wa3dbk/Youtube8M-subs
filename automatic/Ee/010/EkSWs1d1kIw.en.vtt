00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
reasons for the backache and had a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.069 
reasons for the backache and had a
suggestion<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.820> should<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.600> an<00:00:57.719> enema

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
suggestion that I should have an enema

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.860 
suggestion that I should have an enema
so<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.070> did<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.430> an<00:00:59.550> oral<00:00:59.879> enema<00:01:00.270> today<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
so I did have an oral enema today and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.410 
so I did have an oral enema today and
that<00:01:01.170> reminds<00:01:01.500> me<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:02.430> think<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.969> second

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
that reminds me that I think the second

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.649 
that reminds me that I think the second
vlog<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.110> did<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.619> spoke<00:01:05.430> about<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.210> oral<00:01:06.479> and

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
vlog I did I spoke about the oral and

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.080 
vlog I did I spoke about the oral and
I'm<00:01:06.720> Oh<00:01:06.840> without<00:01:07.189> precisely<00:01:08.189> describing<00:01:08.939> what

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
I'm Oh without precisely describing what

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.700 
I'm Oh without precisely describing what
it<00:01:09.210> was<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:10.860> essentially<00:01:11.159> today<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.580> took<00:01:11.880> 2

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
it was so essentially today I took 2

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.940 
it was so essentially today I took 2
tablespoons<00:01:13.710> 2<00:01:13.920> teaspoons<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:15.000> sea<00:01:15.930> salt<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.530> 1

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
tablespoons 2 teaspoons of sea salt in 1

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.480 
tablespoons 2 teaspoons of sea salt in 1
liter<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.369> water<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.180> drank<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.259> bottle<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.250> it

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
liter of water and drank a bottle of it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.480 
liter of water and drank a bottle of it
in<00:01:20.729> one<00:01:20.900> rokka<00:01:21.900> rokka<00:01:22.049> guard<00:01:22.890> all<00:01:23.040> right<00:01:23.280> down

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
in one rokka rokka guard all right down

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.440 
in one rokka rokka guard all right down
when<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:25.250> essentially<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.520> flushes<00:01:27.030> right

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
when and essentially it flushes right

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.260 
when and essentially it flushes right
through<00:01:27.659> your<00:01:27.780> body<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:29.119> someone<00:01:30.119> thought

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
through your body and someone thought

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.969 
through your body and someone thought
that<00:01:30.509> maybe<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.930> toxins<00:01:32.420> near<00:01:33.420> my<00:01:33.750> lower<00:01:34.680> back

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
that maybe the toxins near my lower back

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.410 
that maybe the toxins near my lower back
would<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.220> flushed<00:01:35.579> out<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.090> would<00:01:36.270> help

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
would be flushed out and that would help

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.170 
would be flushed out and that would help
it<00:01:36.900> was<00:01:37.020> also<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.290> comment<00:01:37.829> about<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.610> being

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
it was also a comment about it being

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.749 
it was also a comment about it being
related<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.140> my<00:01:40.530> kidneys<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.189> me<00:01:41.610> not

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.200 
drinking i'm going to research slightly
about<00:01:58.229> adding<00:01:58.649> maybe<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.979> little<00:01:59.219> bit<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.490> lime

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
about adding maybe a little bit of lime

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.170 
about adding maybe a little bit of lime
water<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.510> tiny<00:02:01.049> little<00:02:01.320> bit<00:02:01.620> even<00:02:02.400> Gandhi<00:02:02.940> did

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.340 
being a perhaps little too hardcore this
year<00:02:28.800> where<00:02:29.069> I'm<00:02:29.480> really<00:02:30.480> really<00:02:30.690> sticking<00:02:31.050> to

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
my first week to give myself some room

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.710 
my first week to give myself some room
and<00:02:40.680> be<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.070> little<00:02:41.220> more<00:02:41.489> gentle<00:02:42.090> with<00:02:42.150> me<00:02:42.510> and

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
and be a little more gentle with me and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.290 
and be a little more gentle with me and
have<00:02:43.070> peppermint<00:02:44.070> tea<00:02:44.400> for<00:02:44.610> example<00:02:45.030> which<00:02:45.150> is

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
have peppermint tea for example which is

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.259 
have peppermint tea for example which is
quite<00:02:45.510> good<00:02:45.750> for<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.110> body<00:02:47.030> weighed<00:02:48.030> myself

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
quite good for the body weighed myself

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.660 
quite good for the body weighed myself
yesterday<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:49.800> way<00:02:49.980> would<00:02:50.190> be<00:02:50.220> different

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
yesterday so this way would be different

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.460 
yesterday so this way would be different
today<00:02:50.820> but<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.239> am<00:02:52.640> 83.3<00:02:53.640> kilos<00:02:54.510> or<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:54.930> hundred

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
today but I am 83.3 kilos or a hundred

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.270 
today but I am 83.3 kilos or a hundred
and<00:02:55.800> eighty<00:02:56.010> four<00:02:56.400> pounds<00:02:57.500> so<00:02:58.500> we<00:02:58.650> see<00:02:58.950> that

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
and eighty four pounds so we see that

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.270 
and eighty four pounds so we see that
that<00:02:59.910> has<00:03:00.150> been<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.569> slight<00:03:00.989> reduction<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.830> think

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
that has been a slight reduction I think

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.479 
that has been a slight reduction I think
it's<00:03:02.400> almost<00:03:02.519> 10<00:03:02.850> pounds<00:03:02.880> or<00:03:03.510> in<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:04.470> area<00:03:05.010> of

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
it's almost 10 pounds or in that area of

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.150 
it's almost 10 pounds or in that area of
since<00:03:06.269> day<00:03:06.510> one<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:07.560> i<00:03:07.620> might<00:03:07.890> be<00:03:08.010> weighing

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
since day one so i might be weighing

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.460 
since day one so i might be weighing
myself<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.670> little<00:03:08.760> bit<00:03:09.000> more<00:03:09.329> as<00:03:09.570> we<00:03:09.750> go<00:03:09.930> on<00:03:09.959> i

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
myself a little bit more as we go on i

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.729 
myself a little bit more as we go on i
remember<00:03:11.190> reading<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:12.500> real<00:03:13.500> weight

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
remember reading that the real weight

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.100 
remember reading that the real weight
loss<00:03:14.040> but<00:03:14.400> some<00:03:14.820> major<00:03:15.390> weight<00:03:15.690> loss<00:03:15.870> can

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
loss but some major weight loss can

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.680 
loss but some major weight loss can
happen<00:03:16.470> after<00:03:16.709> day<00:03:16.890> 10<00:03:17.220> which<00:03:18.209> actually

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
happen after day 10 which actually

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.030 
happen after day 10 which actually
contradicts<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.440> little<00:03:19.650> bit<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:19.769> what<00:03:19.890> I've

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
contradicts a little bit of what I've

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.580
