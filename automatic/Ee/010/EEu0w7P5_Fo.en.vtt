one neat feature of the Omni o is the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.650 
one neat feature of the Omni o is the
included<00:02:22.650> remote<00:02:23.040> control<00:02:23.700> which<00:02:24.210> enables

included remote control which enables

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.510 
included remote control which enables
you<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.780> switch<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.410> light<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.800> or<00:02:26.130> off<00:02:26.310> and

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
you to switch the light on or off and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.150 
you to switch the light on or off and
adjust<00:02:27.210> its<00:02:27.390> brightness<00:02:27.450> if<00:02:28.110> you've<00:02:28.650> got<00:02:28.860> more

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
adjust its brightness if you've got more

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.080 
adjust its brightness if you've got more
than<00:02:29.220> one<00:02:29.430> light

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
than one light

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.500 
than one light
they'll<00:02:30.240> all<00:02:30.450> be<00:02:30.480> switched<00:02:30.990> at<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.290> same<00:02:31.470> time

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
they'll all be switched at the same time

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.870 
they'll all be switched at the same time
