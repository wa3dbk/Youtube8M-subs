00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
concrete filler block this is just a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.289 
concrete filler block this is just a
four<00:01:07.920> by<00:01:08.070> eight<00:01:08.100> by<00:01:08.189> sixteen<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.610> solid<00:01:08.909> pad<00:01:09.119> to

cut him exactly in half and you see how

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.940 
cut him exactly in half and you see how
they<00:01:11.549> fit<00:01:11.760> dead-on<00:01:12.380> same<00:01:13.380> thing<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.740> top

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
they fit dead-on same thing on the top

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.580 
they fit dead-on same thing on the top
there<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.810> doesn't<00:01:15.810> always<00:01:16.020> happen<00:01:16.110> like

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
there that doesn't always happen like

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.370 
there that doesn't always happen like
that<00:01:16.970> this<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.119> just<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.600> liquid<00:01:18.810> nailed<00:01:19.140> to

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
that this is just a liquid nailed to

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.320 
that this is just a liquid nailed to
this<00:01:19.500> platform<00:01:20.430> here<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.880> ain't<00:01:21.090> going

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
this platform here I ain't going

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.899 
this platform here I ain't going
anywhere<00:01:21.920> we're<00:01:22.920> gonna<00:01:23.040> cover<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> with<00:01:23.700> them

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
anywhere we're gonna cover it with them

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.270 
anywhere we're gonna cover it with them
white<00:01:24.720> vinyl<00:01:25.200> coil<00:01:25.530> stock<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.100> looks<00:01:26.220> like

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
white vinyl coil stock so it looks like

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.590 
white vinyl coil stock so it looks like
one<00:01:26.490> big<00:01:26.520> base<00:01:26.909> cap<00:01:28.009> got<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> shutters<00:01:29.400> on

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
one big base cap got the shutters on

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.630 
one big base cap got the shutters on
which<00:01:30.600> was<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.960> lot<00:01:31.229> more<00:01:31.259> difficult<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:32.549> I

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
which was a lot more difficult and I

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.980 
which was a lot more difficult and I
thought<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.939> would<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.180> sometimes<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.869> whoo

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
thought it would be sometimes the whoo

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.530 
thought it would be sometimes the whoo
easy

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
easy

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.690 
easy

there shot it to the wall stuck out over
it<00:05:39.800> and<00:05:39.890> I<00:05:39.920> made<00:05:40.070> like<00:05:40.190> a<00:05:40.250> little<00:05:40.460> castle

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
corner it looks like it belongs there

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.080 
corner it looks like it belongs there
that<00:05:43.640> fit<00:05:43.850> very<00:05:43.940> well<00:05:44.150> on<00:05:44.420> top<00:05:44.660> that<00:05:45.080> was<00:05:45.200> good

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
that fit very well on top that was good

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.870 
that fit very well on top that was good
he's<00:05:47.390> there<00:05:47.570> 8<00:05:47.720> inch<00:05:48.130> hollow<00:05:49.130> aluminum<00:05:49.700> Raider

he's there 8 inch hollow aluminum Raider

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.440 
he's there 8 inch hollow aluminum Raider
for<00:05:50.000> about<00:05:50.180> 27,000<00:05:51.020> pounds<00:05:51.110> each<00:05:51.440> but<00:05:52.450> with

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
for about 27,000 pounds each but with

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.910 
for about 27,000 pounds each but with
only<00:05:53.540> two<00:05:53.690> of<00:05:53.930> them<00:05:54.050> let's<00:05:54.320> say<00:05:54.440> for<00:05:54.590> example

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
only two of them let's say for example

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.680 
only two of them let's say for example
that<00:05:54.950> van<00:05:55.250> was<00:05:55.490> to<00:05:55.730> back<00:05:56.000> up<00:05:56.180> and<00:05:56.330> knock<00:05:56.420> one<00:05:56.480> of

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
that van was to back up and knock one of

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.320 
that van was to back up and knock one of
those<00:05:56.810> out<00:05:57.700> it'll<00:05:58.700> be<00:05:58.790> kind<00:05:58.970> of<00:05:59.060> catastrophic

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
those out it'll be kind of catastrophic

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.719 
those out it'll be kind of catastrophic
to<00:05:59.919> cut<00:06:00.919> the<00:06:01.010> house<00:06:01.130> a<00:06:01.160> little<00:06:01.340> bit

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
to cut the house a little bit

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.070 
to cut the house a little bit
so<00:06:02.300> we'll<00:06:02.419> probably<00:06:02.630> add

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
so we'll probably add

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.869 
so we'll probably add
two<00:06:03.169> more<00:06:03.379> when<00:06:03.620> the<00:06:03.710> money<00:06:04.220> comes<00:06:04.460> we'll<00:06:04.759> put

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:04.879 
two more when the money comes we'll put

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:06.249 
two more when the money comes we'll put
two<00:06:05.000> more<00:06:05.120> columns<00:06:05.330> in<00:06:05.629> there<00:06:05.750> just<00:06:05.960> to<00:06:06.110> add

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
two more columns in there just to add

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:10.540 
two more columns in there just to add
redundancy<00:06:06.919> to<00:06:07.129> it<00:06:08.830> step<00:06:09.830> steps<00:06:10.189> worked<00:06:10.400> out

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
redundancy to it step steps worked out

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.390 
redundancy to it step steps worked out
real<00:06:10.759> good<00:06:11.740> really<00:06:12.740> good<00:06:12.860> back<00:06:13.039> here<00:06:13.069> same

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400
