inches and I wanted to talk about these

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.980 
inches and I wanted to talk about these
varieties<00:00:17.699> because<00:00:18.000> anybody<00:00:18.300> can<00:00:18.630> grow<00:00:18.840> these

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
varieties because anybody can grow these

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.120 
varieties because anybody can grow these
and<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.230> can<00:00:19.380> grow<00:00:19.560> them<00:00:19.710> just<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
and you can grow them just in the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.220 
and you can grow them just in the
container<00:00:20.520> like<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.970> flower<00:00:21.300> box<00:00:21.539> that's

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
container like this a flower box that's

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.170 
container like this a flower box that's
maybe<00:00:22.470> ten<00:00:22.769> inches<00:00:23.070> deep

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
maybe ten inches deep

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.880 
maybe ten inches deep
this<00:00:24.420> has<00:00:24.630> three<00:00:25.019> tomatoes<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.560> here<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.769> let

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
this has three tomatoes in here so let

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.230 
this has three tomatoes in here so let
me<00:00:25.920> just<00:00:26.160> start<00:00:26.340> with<00:00:26.490> these<00:00:26.609> these<00:00:26.880> are<00:00:26.939> all

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
me just start with these these are all

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.359 
me just start with these these are all
determinate<00:00:27.869> varieties<00:00:28.019> first<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.800> all<00:00:28.890> which

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
determinate varieties first of all which

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.060 
determinate varieties first of all which
means<00:00:29.640> they'll<00:00:29.820> get<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.119> set<00:00:30.420> size<00:00:31.070> flower

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
means they'll get to a set size flower

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.069 
means they'll get to a set size flower
and<00:00:32.430> they'll<00:00:32.550> set<00:00:32.730> fruit<00:00:33.030> over<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> couple<00:00:33.870> week

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
and they'll set fruit over a couple week

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.540 
and they'll set fruit over a couple week
period<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.649> then<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> plant<00:00:35.100> will<00:00:35.250> die<00:00:35.280> out

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
period and then the plant will die out

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.310 
period and then the plant will die out
just<00:00:35.790> like<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.480> die<00:00:36.780> out<00:00:36.960> is

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
just like this so this die out is

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.350 
just like this so this die out is
perfectly<00:00:37.980> normal<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> Tiny<00:00:39.059> Tim

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
perfectly normal this is the Tiny Tim

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.569 
perfectly normal this is the Tiny Tim
tomato<00:00:39.719> they<00:00:40.290> get<00:00:40.469> about<00:00:40.649> twelve<00:00:40.980> inches<00:00:41.100> tall

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
tomato they get about twelve inches tall

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.700 
tomato they get about twelve inches tall
and<00:00:41.820> they<00:00:41.969> take<00:00:42.180> about<00:00:42.329> sixty<00:00:42.840> days<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.079> mature

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
and they take about sixty days to mature

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.560 
and they take about sixty days to mature
and<00:00:43.860> again<00:00:44.129> these<00:00:44.670> are<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:44.969> determinate

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
and again these are all determinate

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.750 
and again these are all determinate
variety<00:00:46.050> Tomatoes<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.370> see<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
variety Tomatoes and you can see the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.900 
variety Tomatoes and you can see the
plant<00:00:48.090> really<00:00:49.050> got<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.530> about<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.129> size<00:00:50.430> and

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
plant really got to about this size and

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.549 
plant really got to about this size and
it<00:00:51.210> set<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.629> lot<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.020> fruit<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.260> there's

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
it set a lot of fruit and there's

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.490 
it set a lot of fruit and there's
probably<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.660> mean<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.750> probably<00:00:55.050> will<00:00:55.350> get

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
probably I mean I probably will get

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.709 
probably I mean I probably will get
thirty<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.070> forty<00:00:56.550> maybe<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.239> little<00:00:57.390> bit<00:00:57.570> more

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
thirty to forty maybe a little bit more

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.200 
thirty to forty maybe a little bit more
cherry<00:00:58.590> tomatoes<00:00:59.039> off<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.670> plant<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.180> you

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
cherry tomatoes off of this plant so you

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.119 
cherry tomatoes off of this plant so you
put<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.660> three<00:01:00.930> plants<00:01:01.199> into<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> box<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:01.949> this

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
put in three plants into a box like this

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.889 
put in three plants into a box like this
you<00:01:02.370> get<00:01:02.489> well<00:01:02.699> over<00:01:02.940> 100<00:01:03.270> cherry<00:01:03.480> tomatoes

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
you get well over 100 cherry tomatoes

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.719 
you get well over 100 cherry tomatoes
you<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.110> really<00:01:04.530> grow<00:01:05.220> them<00:01:05.400> pretty<00:01:05.670> easily

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
you can really grow them pretty easily

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.870 
you can really grow them pretty easily
in<00:01:06.360> any<00:01:06.479> type<00:01:06.780> container<00:01:07.340> to<00:01:08.340> set<00:01:08.610> up<00:01:08.729> your

fertilizer you could go organic you

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.359 
fertilizer you could go organic you
could<00:01:30.990> go<00:01:31.110> chemical<00:01:31.650> but<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.890> want<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.189> set

could go chemical but you want to set

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.730 
could go chemical but you want to set
this<00:01:32.490> up<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.880> would<00:01:33.090> also<00:01:33.210> put<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.740> maybe

this up and I would also put in maybe
two<00:01:35.009> tablespoons<00:01:35.220> or<00:01:35.909> handful<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.570> lime<00:01:36.930> in

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
two tablespoons or handful of lime in

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.130 
two tablespoons or handful of lime in
here<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.380> want<00:01:37.590> calcium<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.490> your<00:01:38.640> soil

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
here you want calcium to be in your soil

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.609 
here you want calcium to be in your soil
container<00:01:40.140> tomatoes<00:01:40.710> often<00:01:41.490> are<00:01:42.590> hit<00:01:43.590> by

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
container tomatoes often are hit by

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.160 
container tomatoes often are hit by
blossom<00:01:44.340> end<00:01:44.490> rot<00:01:44.549> which<00:01:44.820> really<00:01:45.119> means<00:01:45.390> it's

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
blossom end rot which really means it's

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.899 
blossom end rot which really means it's
not<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.470> disease<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:46.920> blossom<00:01:47.460> end<00:01:47.610> rot<00:01:47.670> is

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
not a disease but blossom end rot is

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.270 
not a disease but blossom end rot is
when<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> tomato<00:01:48.509> can't<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:49.140> calcium<00:01:49.770> out<00:01:49.979> of

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
when the tomato can't get calcium out of

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.130 
when the tomato can't get calcium out of
the<00:01:50.579> soil<00:01:50.850> or<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.180> don't<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.600> calcium<00:01:52.079> in

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the soil or you don't have calcium in

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.319 
the soil or you don't have calcium in
the<00:01:52.229> soil<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.710> lime<00:01:52.950> will<00:01:53.490> put<00:01:53.700> calcium<00:01:53.939> in

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the soil so the lime will put calcium in

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.649 
the soil so the lime will put calcium in
there<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.560> want<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.770> water<00:01:56.009> this

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
there and then you want to water this

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.880 
there and then you want to water this
regularly<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.780> course<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.380> want<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.619> feed

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
regularly of course but you want to feed

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.219 
regularly of course but you want to feed
it<00:01:58.920> at<00:01:59.430> least<00:01:59.939> every<00:02:00.360> two<00:02:00.570> weeks<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:01.200> a

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
type of containers really suck the life

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.710 
type of containers really suck the life
out<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.490> soil<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.030> really<00:02:21.420> want<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.600> be

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
out of the soil so you really want to be

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.809 
out of the soil so you really want to be
putting<00:02:22.050> in<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.380> liquid<00:02:22.800> feed<00:02:23.040> at<00:02:23.250> least<00:02:23.459> every

putting in a liquid feed at least every

putting in a liquid feed at least every
two<00:02:24.000> weeks<00:02:24.240> but<00:02:24.540> that's<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:25.020> general

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
two weeks but that's just a general

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.820 
two weeks but that's just a general
principle<00:02:25.500> but<00:02:26.220> these<00:02:26.400> were<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.300> Tiny<00:02:27.569> Tim<00:02:27.900> 3

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
principle but these were the Tiny Tim 3

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.160 
principle but these were the Tiny Tim 3
Tomatoes<00:02:29.310> they<00:02:29.760> take<00:02:29.940> about<00:02:30.120> 60<00:02:30.660> days<00:02:30.810> and

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
Tomatoes they take about 60 days and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.720 
Tomatoes they take about 60 days and
I'll<00:02:31.380> be<00:02:31.410> harvesting<00:02:31.770> all<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.400> these<00:02:32.550> off

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
I'll be harvesting all of these off

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.229 
I'll be harvesting all of these off
there<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.090> they<00:02:33.330> look<00:02:33.540> good<00:02:33.890> they're<00:02:34.890> not

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
there and they look good they're not

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.880 
there and they look good they're not
super<00:02:36.239> sweet<00:02:36.450> they're<00:02:36.870> sweet<00:02:37.170> they're<00:02:37.200> really

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
super sweet they're sweet they're really

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.080 
super sweet they're sweet they're really
really<00:02:38.069> worth<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.489> but<00:02:38.640> these<00:02:38.790> are<00:02:38.940> nice

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
really worth it but these are nice

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.030 
really worth it but these are nice
Tomatoes<00:02:39.690> some<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.500> them<00:02:40.590> are<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.709> little<00:02:40.800> bit

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
Tomatoes some of them are a little bit

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.340 
Tomatoes some of them are a little bit
correct<00:02:41.310> but<00:02:41.489> that's<00:02:41.550> okay<00:02:42.170> really<00:02:43.170> nice

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
correct but that's okay really nice

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.860 
correct but that's okay really nice
Tomatoes<00:02:43.890> other<00:02:44.880> ones<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.300> I'm<00:02:45.390> setting<00:02:45.780> up

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
Tomatoes other ones that I'm setting up

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.300 
Tomatoes other ones that I'm setting up
are<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.290> totem<00:02:46.739> this<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:48.350> 70<00:02:49.350> day<00:02:49.590> tomato

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
are the totem this is a 70 day tomato

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.610 
are the totem this is a 70 day tomato
that<00:02:50.670> will<00:02:50.820> get<00:02:51.000> 10<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.660> 12<00:02:51.930> inches<00:02:52.230> tall<00:02:52.440> and

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
that will get 10 to 12 inches tall and

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.190 
that will get 10 to 12 inches tall and
again<00:02:52.860> these<00:02:53.010> are<00:02:53.160> cherry<00:02:53.459> types<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.900> a

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
again these are cherry types this is a

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.160 
again these are cherry types this is a
bush<00:02:55.610> 5<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.790> 6<00:02:57.030> bush<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.600> I'm<00:02:57.959> going<00:02:58.110> to

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
bush 5 of 6 bush and I'm going to

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.570 
bush 5 of 6 bush and I'm going to
probably<00:02:58.319> just<00:02:58.560> leave<00:02:58.680> 2<00:02:58.950> plants<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.430> there

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
probably just leave 2 plants in there

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.080 
probably just leave 2 plants in there
but<00:02:59.819> this<00:03:00.000> again<00:03:00.360> will<00:03:00.959> only<00:03:01.140> get<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:02.090> 18

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
but this again will only get to 18

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.860 
but this again will only get to 18
inches<00:03:03.390> maybe<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.840> little<00:03:04.019> bit<00:03:04.260> taller<00:03:05.660> here<00:03:06.660> is

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
inches maybe a little bit taller here is

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.220 
inches maybe a little bit taller here is
a<00:03:06.900> Red<00:03:07.410> Robin<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:08.100> takes<00:03:08.340> 55<00:03:08.940> days<00:03:09.300> so<00:03:09.989> if<00:03:10.110> you

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
a Red Robin this takes 55 days so if you

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.910 
a Red Robin this takes 55 days so if you
notice<00:03:10.590> this<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.769> 55<00:03:11.459> days<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.940> was<00:03:12.090> 60<00:03:12.480> days

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
notice this is 55 days this was 60 days

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.460 
notice this is 55 days this was 60 days
70<00:03:13.920> days<00:03:14.100> 62<00:03:14.880> days<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.840> still<00:03:16.110> have<00:03:16.230> time

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
70 days 62 days so you still have time

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.710 
70 days 62 days so you still have time
in<00:03:16.650> July<00:03:16.800> if<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.250> have<00:03:17.340> enough<00:03:17.579> warmth<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.540> go

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
in July if you have enough warmth to go

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.680 
in July if you have enough warmth to go
at<00:03:18.870> least<00:03:18.900> another<00:03:19.290> 60<00:03:19.769> 80<00:03:19.950> days<00:03:20.360> so<00:03:21.360> this<00:03:21.510> one

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
at least another 60 80 days so this one

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.770 
at least another 60 80 days so this one
again<00:03:21.900> will<00:03:22.140> get<00:03:22.350> to<00:03:22.890> eight<00:03:23.579> actually<00:03:24.269> only<00:03:24.540> 8

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
again will get to eight actually only 8

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.330 
again will get to eight actually only 8
to<00:03:24.959> 12<00:03:25.200> inches<00:03:25.290> tall<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:25.709> this<00:03:25.980> is<00:03:26.130> even

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
to 12 inches tall so this is even

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.729 
to 12 inches tall so this is even
smaller<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.630> is<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.810> tumbler<00:03:28.260> variety

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
smaller and this is a tumbler variety

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.190 
smaller and this is a tumbler variety
determinate<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.850> is<00:03:30.060> already<00:03:30.600> taller<00:03:30.959> than

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
determinate that is already taller than

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.440 
determinate that is already taller than
these<00:03:31.320> this<00:03:31.500> will<00:03:31.620> get<00:03:31.799> I<00:03:32.040> think<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.030> about<00:03:33.209> 2

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
these this will get I think to about 2

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.539 
these this will get I think to about 2
feet<00:03:33.750> but<00:03:34.260> it'll<00:03:34.470> drape<00:03:34.739> over<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.160> container

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
feet but it'll drape over the container

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.860 
feet but it'll drape over the container
and<00:03:35.940> this<00:03:36.390> only<00:03:36.570> takes<00:03:36.810> 45<00:03:37.200> days<00:03:37.799> so<00:03:38.570> you<00:03:39.570> can

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
and this only takes 45 days so you can

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.400 
and this only takes 45 days so you can
grow<00:03:40.260> cherry<00:03:41.190> type<00:03:41.430> tomatoes<00:03:41.910> in<00:03:42.540> containers

grow cherry type tomatoes in containers
about<00:03:44.160> this<00:03:44.400> size<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:45.030> in<00:03:45.180> anywhere<00:03:45.570> from<00:03:45.630> 45

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
about this size and in anywhere from 45

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.800 
about this size and in anywhere from 45
to<00:03:46.260> 60<00:03:46.769> days<00:03:46.799> you<00:03:47.549> can<00:03:47.730> have<00:03:47.850> masses<00:03:48.299> of<00:03:48.480> cherry

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
to 60 days you can have masses of cherry

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.000 
idea to think about trying container
tomatoes<00:03:53.910> that<00:03:54.030> are<00:03:54.150> dwarves<00:03:54.470> on<00:03:55.470> your<00:03:55.799> patio

will get to them pretty quickly but
something<00:04:01.560> up<00:04:01.680> here<00:04:01.950> away<00:04:02.459> from<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.030> earth
