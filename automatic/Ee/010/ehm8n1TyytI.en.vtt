00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello welcome to a new blog in the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.870
 channel this time is in June Europe and 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.540
 July is to say the readings that I have 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.360
 read in those months to the total of nine 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.929
 books so I'm going to go fast because if 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.929
 no no 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.050
 but no longer 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.689
 because he died too 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.689
 second part and since July I read 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.420
 with which in these two months I have 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.269
 read the entire trilogy 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.250
 and I have to say that this trilogy still 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:42.000
 must be 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.020
 I would do five stars out of five 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.020
 because it's amazing 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.510
 have love 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.340
 action has a lot of things that I 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.739
 they have loved it because it has been very 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.530
 complete besides the characters are very 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.720
 well elaborated and the truth is that it has 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.159
 I really like to make a video 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.470
 speaking simply of that trilogy 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.200
 because I loved it has become 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.380
 in one of my favorite trilogies like this 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.860
 Well then I'll tell you more about 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.130
 she 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.799
 the video that has approximated 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.159
 also to the month of June I read the 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.259
 lesson of something by palace rj there are already 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.030
 a review of the channel made about this 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.729
 book so do not give me the beaches either 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.399
 very much I only say that I this book 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.500
 I would put a four star on five 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.500
 is super cute super adorable 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:45.560
 and that it reads flown do not be serious if 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.320
 you want to read agile for this summer 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.840
 choosing is because it also transmits the 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.509
 very important values for life and 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.420
 I liked it very much and let's say the great 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.670
 disappointment of these two months has been a fan 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.920
 Friday of the rhythm Robert expected me 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.450
 very much more of her knowing in addition 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.770
 that had become the book 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.170
 favorite of many 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.910
 so 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.910
 I do not know why but this book 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.190
 and the truth is that yes 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.340
 I would put two stars on five 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.890
 even sample 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.890
 it seems to me a story of the simplest 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.180
 they are the most typical thing that you 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.909
 and the truth is that 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.859
 and I found it very boring of the 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.769
 next reading that I made in the month 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:47.989
 July was the national team because irak as 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.989
 which is the first part of the saga 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.730
 flip before I was giving a lot of 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.980
 she has to say that it is a book that 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.290
 it reads very fast or is short 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.090
 traviata is very very long the truth is 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.720
 that I love the protagonist has 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.080
 become of my characters 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.080
 i 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.500
 and only souls about this room 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.900
 a very curious thing has happened with this 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.900
 story that I will tell you but 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.600
 well 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.290
 I would put a three and a half on five 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.630
 If it could be put better, it could get 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.940
 to the fourth star on five but 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.819
 around there and good along with the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.100
 trilogy of the child the favorite book that 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.400
 I read after two months has been 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.370
 I had not read it yet madrid I know 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.480
 I still had not read it 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.480
 and I liked it 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.620
 I thought it was serious 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.660
 You have seen the movie 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:05.140
 also solar will see 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:09.689
 the divergent when the whole cam but 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.689
 well you know and it's 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.310
 5 5 stars 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.500
 and finally in the book 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.930
 this July has been temperance by 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.020
 Maria, ladies, this is literature. 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.110
 adult but good has not finished me 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.630
 I 'm still in the middle but this one 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.880
 is costing a lot of ermelo 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.480
 I expected a lot more than to read 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.430
 the time between seams that is one hour 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.430
 but silver in place 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.350
 I do not eat it to read and I get tired 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.350
 distance of 3 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.830
 quite 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.090
 the book 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.300
 that as much as he has finished very much for the 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.970
 half more or less and sensitive 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.830
 it's a book that I can not tell you which 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.740
 it's because he has not come out yet 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.110
 I was sold by an editorial 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.210
 venezuela that contacted me and said 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.150
 that I was just going to publish that book 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.039
 in July to mid - July and that 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.590
 I always wanted to read and pay you a visit 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.590

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.330
