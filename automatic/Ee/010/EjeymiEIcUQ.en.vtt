contraptions here we're just going to

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.869 
contraptions here we're just going to
build<00:00:58.820> a<00:00:59.030> very<00:00:59.620> basic<00:01:00.620> shape<00:01:01.129> just<00:01:01.549> so<00:01:01.670> you<00:01:01.760> can

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
build a very basic shape just so you can

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.929 
build a very basic shape just so you can
get<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.059> feel<00:01:02.299> for<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:03.049> building<00:01:03.320> mechanic

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.249 

here<00:01:07.939> I'm<00:01:08.090> just<00:01:08.720> building<00:01:08.899> a<00:01:09.110> little

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
here I'm just building a little

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:15.070 
here I'm just building a little
barricade<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:11.890> I'm<00:01:12.890> going<00:01:13.189> to<00:01:13.430> pull<00:01:14.180> it<00:01:14.210> with

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
barricade and I'm going to pull it with

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.010 
barricade and I'm going to pull it with
my<00:01:15.229> tether<00:01:15.439> to<00:01:15.830> prep<00:01:16.220> it<00:01:16.340> up<00:01:19.750> let<00:01:20.750> me<00:01:20.869> introduce

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
my tether to prep it up let me introduce

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.880 
my tether to prep it up let me introduce
you<00:01:21.500> to<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:21.740> trigger<00:01:21.979> queue<00:01:23.619> many<00:01:24.619> of<00:01:24.799> the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
you to the trigger queue many of the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.889 
you to the trigger queue many of the
cubes<00:01:25.190> in<00:01:25.369> make<00:01:25.580> have<00:01:25.850> special<00:01:26.330> activatable

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
cubes in make have special activatable

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.380 
cubes in make have special activatable
properties<00:01:27.530> you<00:01:28.340> can<00:01:28.369> activate<00:01:28.850> them<00:01:29.209> by

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
properties you can activate them by

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.289 
properties you can activate them by
sending<00:01:29.810> them<00:01:29.899> jolts<00:01:30.319> of<00:01:30.409> electricity<00:01:31.299> the

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
sending them jolts of electricity the

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.469 
sending them jolts of electricity the
trigger<00:01:32.659> cube<00:01:32.959> itself<00:01:33.110> acts<00:01:33.619> like<00:01:33.890> a<00:01:33.920> relay

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
trigger cube itself acts like a relay

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.580 
trigger cube itself acts like a relay
passing<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.569> signal<00:01:35.899> directly<00:01:36.140> to<00:01:36.470> its

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
passing the signal directly to its

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
passing the signal directly to its
neighboring<00:01:37.009> cubes<00:01:38.709> the<00:01:39.709> tether<00:01:39.979> is<00:01:40.220> kind<00:01:40.490> of

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
neighboring cubes the tether is kind of

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.980 
neighboring cubes the tether is kind of
like<00:01:40.759> a<00:01:40.819> conductive<00:01:41.420> bungee<00:01:41.869> cord<00:01:43.990> players

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
like a conductive bungee cord players

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.380 
like a conductive bungee cord players
can<00:01:45.259> use<00:01:45.590> this<00:01:45.830> to<00:01:46.190> send<00:01:46.549> signals<00:01:47.119> at<00:01:47.330> a

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
can use this to send signals at a

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.140 
can use this to send signals at a
distance

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.510 

using<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.200> tether<00:01:53.440> it<00:01:53.650> can<00:01:53.770> be<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.920> great<00:01:54.340> way

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
using the tether it can be a great way

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.790 
using the tether it can be a great way
to<00:01:54.580> introduce<00:01:55.090> timing<00:01:55.900> and<00:01:56.020> logic<00:01:56.440> into<00:01:56.620> your

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
to introduce timing and logic into your

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.790 
to introduce timing and logic into your
contraptions

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.340 

so<00:02:02.400> here<00:02:03.330> I'm<00:02:03.450> going<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.660> build<00:02:03.900> something<00:02:04.170> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
so here I'm going to build something a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.770 
so here I'm going to build something a
little<00:02:04.530> bit<00:02:04.740> more<00:02:04.890> complex<00:02:08.210> so<00:02:09.210> basically<00:02:09.660> i'm

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
little bit more complex so basically i'm

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.810 
little bit more complex so basically i'm
going<00:02:09.930> to<00:02:09.990> use<00:02:10.170> balloon<00:02:10.650> cubes<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.400> float<00:02:11.790> a

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
going to use balloon cubes to float a

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.700 
going to use balloon cubes to float a
platform<00:02:12.420> off<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.690> ground<00:02:15.380> i'm<00:02:16.380> arranging

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
platform off the ground i'm arranging

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.590 
platform off the ground i'm arranging
them<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.250> circle<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.090> they<00:02:18.270> lift

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
them in a circle so that they lift

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.100 
them in a circle so that they lift
evenly<00:02:21.200> connect<00:02:22.200> them<00:02:22.410> up<00:02:23.150> just<00:02:24.150> hooking<00:02:24.660> up

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
evenly connect them up just hooking up

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.740 
evenly connect them up just hooking up
some<00:02:25.440> connections<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.300> we<00:02:27.300> can<00:02:27.480> pass<00:02:27.720> a

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
some connections so that we can pass a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.960 
some connections so that we can pass a
signal<00:02:28.230> all<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.590> way<00:02:28.680> around<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:29.070> ring<00:02:29.280> to

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
signal all the way around the ring to

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:38.630 
signal all the way around the ring to
turn<00:02:30.180> everything<00:02:30.450> on<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:31.730> here<00:02:32.730> we<00:02:32.880> go

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.750 

so<00:02:39.510> now<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.720> platform's<00:02:40.319> light<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.490> easy<00:02:41.580> to

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
so now the platform's light and easy to

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.730 
so now the platform's light and easy to
move<00:02:42.030> around<00:02:42.150> just<00:02:42.810> by<00:02:42.930> poignant<00:02:43.380> like<00:02:43.530> this

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
move around just by poignant like this

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.090 
move around just by poignant like this
along<00:02:44.730> with<00:02:44.940> anything<00:02:45.150> we<00:02:45.360> put<00:02:45.390> on<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.840> and

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
along with anything we put on it and

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.150 
along with anything we put on it and
when<00:02:47.100> you're<00:02:47.190> done<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.640> can<00:02:48.000> drop<00:02:48.209> it<00:02:48.270> and

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
when you're done you can drop it and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.680 
when you're done you can drop it and
break<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.190> apart<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.819> reuse<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.540> cubes<00:02:53.690> so

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
break it apart to reuse the cubes so

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.390 
break it apart to reuse the cubes so
here<00:02:54.930> I'm<00:02:55.050> going<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.290> build<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.770> floating<00:02:56.100> mine

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
here I'm going to build a floating mine

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:04.360 
here I'm going to build a floating mine
and<00:02:57.060> I'm<00:02:57.180> going<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.390> do<00:02:57.570> so<00:02:57.840> using<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.680> scaffold

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.369 

now<00:03:04.940> I'll<00:03:05.120> just<00:03:05.180> rotate<00:03:05.690> my<00:03:05.840> rockets<00:03:06.230> into

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
now I'll just rotate my rockets into

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:13.940 
now I'll just rotate my rockets into
place

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.280 

inflate<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.060> balloons

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.380 

now<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:20.099> I'm<00:03:20.189> done<00:03:20.340> building<00:03:20.579> my<00:03:20.819> mind<00:03:21.090> I'll

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
now that I'm done building my mind I'll

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.149 
now that I'm done building my mind I'll
just<00:03:21.450> remove<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.170> scaffolding<00:03:22.890> from<00:03:23.040> the

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
just remove the scaffolding from the

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:29.910 
just remove the scaffolding from the
bottom

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.510

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
and boom goes the dynamite so that

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.949 
and boom goes the dynamite so that
covers<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:34.000> basics<00:03:34.390> of<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.569> building
