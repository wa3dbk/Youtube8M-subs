00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:20.039
 let's have a wall 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.730
 and we will be seeing what the intro is 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.730
 ah 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.519
 that what is going 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.150
 and others need some 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.910
 tricks and so on 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.420
 we know that he is gaining more roll 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.420
 simple 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.170
 already 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.860
 dr 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.910
 a sun is very simple let's go to what we 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.910
 interest right now 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.380
 hunter then let's make the chord 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.380
 to get 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.900
 two 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.360
 how to take the last three notes of that 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.740
 way that would be like putting a nut 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.830
 on the eighth fret the mini signal and the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.570
 finger 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.570
 has the third string 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.789
 we realize that we are thinking 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.510
 that the noticing 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.590
 Y 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.590
 let's do it 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.130
 starting with a small radio here 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.649
 d 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.320
 thereafter 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.200
 here the note is the first string 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.119
 third 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.530
 and we also make a small cold 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.530
 of the last strings 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.300
 i 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.040
 m 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.040
 they are the city 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.000
 Y 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.800
 ah 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.350
 then it's done here we can do it 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.350
 here 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.200
 third string second fret and two in 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:47.140
 the second rope first back 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.140
 side of me 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.040
 Y 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.200
 take the same you're not here then 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.200
 we go 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.260
 i 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.350
 Y 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.810
 it starts exactly the same 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.380
 ah 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.380
 or not 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.900
 the change for saying this part 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.900
 let's go what we do 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.700
 let's review 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.080
 to me 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.670
 and nothing is 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.490
 yes 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:52.020
 7th fret of the string 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:55.530
 first string fifth fret sun second 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.910
 door here eighth fret nor my link 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.910
 of a fifth string back 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.999
 thereafter 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.730
 for me 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.280
 to follow 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:27.210
 then we do not remy 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.519
 and here is a solar slider 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.519
 i 

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.519
 murray 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.380
 remy 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.950
 and so 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.890
 ah 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.020
 Y 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.919
 i 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.129
 just a song and the ending that is very 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.939
 similar to said 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.939
 see you
