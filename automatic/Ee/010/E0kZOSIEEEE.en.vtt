 before the glacier spectacle hannibal 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.869
 The construction and start 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.960
 Rehearsing under Rettbachferner 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.880
 turns into a historical stage 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.820
 the samples are looking forward to this year too 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.340
 lukas jenewein is supposed to be that again 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.180
 the young hannibal already represents 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.730
 for weeks to the big use at 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.040
 the live show is his and his 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.070
 adult colleagues and the rest 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.500
 comfort of the history spectacle still 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.570
 numerous samples before going to the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.030
 the light is built up for the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.710
 performance by Hannibal 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.309
 We have very many lamps in the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.199
 use this a very strange 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.090
 conjure up worlds and rehearse on their sides 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.520
 the scenes for example the scene in 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.010
 karthago tv where the young hannibal the 19 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.140
 years old with his father in the studio 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.570
 is invited by tatort ev and there 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.590
 tells how she was killed in the sea 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.590
 Sicily has passed 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.510
 not just for the actors 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.420
 the rehearsal work due to the sea level 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.330
 a high physical requirements there 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.150
 the dancers which the whole piece 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.670
 must be used over 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.950
 also in the days before to the se- 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.320
 Listening and to the dimensions of 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.320
 set tremendous natural stage 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.060
 on the one hand are the actors and the 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.700
 Dancers from around the world who are considered 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.550
 new mexico from holland from italy and 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.259
 if you are here at 3300 meters 3000 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.000
 meter come then comes first into the 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.740
 sniff that you need but 3dog 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.050
 so that he has acclimatized again 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.450
 and the normal efficiency new 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.580
 and the second is the people are just 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.119
 in the theater not used to outdoor 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.370
 work 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.350
 the people here are the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.060
 Actors who are already used to it 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.170
 many have been there for several years but 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.060
 it is always very special 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.380
 exciting in such a big room too 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.910
 play and the contact person 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.670
 maybe two kilometers away 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.310
 put the sample and construction work 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.310
 equally high demands on technology and 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.440
 safety must be technology and man 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.150
 be coordinated with each other 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.850
 Moreover, the vastness of the 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.940
 Rettbach remover for man and technology 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.860
 another challenge of the 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.299
 on the one hand, that is very very complex 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.860
 Not only many happen 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.450
 people involved but very many 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.670
 The scenes are sometimes far apart 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.739
 are and have to fit together 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.310
 that fit together works over one 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:57.010
 such an art storyboard that one one 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.870
 Score in which everything is in it because it 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.580
 time is right inside and now has to 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.450
 you can always imagine where is 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.799
 actually exactly 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.980
 you always have the whole fantasy 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.680
 try to imagine how 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.459
 which then looks in the evening because on 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.459
 everything will come together in the evening 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.940
 sÃ¶lden tv here you are the star
