00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.839
 Hi, my name is Zacharias 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.300
 reinhard of agents presse.de and 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.820
 welcome to a new blender 2.6 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.430
 tip video in this video I show 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.310
 you how to use gimp a 2d 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.789
 Convert logo to a 3d logo 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.489
 yes I use here blender 2 points 68th 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:39.960
 from blender point org and I use 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:42.420
 here also gimp 2.8 point 6 of georg as 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.020
 First, I'll go now my logo out 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.079
 to load 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.960
 which wants to translate into 3d ours 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.250
 agent of brothers logo and we see that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.980
 was already created that way 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.199
 background is transparent 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.180
 if you have any logo, what not 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.949
 is transparent 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.590
 then there are many different ones 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.850
 possibilities to indemnify that 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.900
 For example, if that's one now 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.450
 one can then contrast high-contrast object 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.369
 Of course here for example selection to 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.049
 choose colors if you like that 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.640
 difficult to separate only from each other 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.850
 for example the path tool 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.240
 use and next to it the logo or what 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.100
 always cut accordingly 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.560
 right- click on selection of 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.110
 father then you have a choice now 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.430
 then you could make a choice reversal 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.740
 or invert and then the rest 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.500
 remove and then you would have just this 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.579
 logo also cut only so as 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.579
 next to information 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.590
 I remove that level again 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.049
 select nothing and now I click here 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.270
 first time on our level with the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.780
 agents astra the logo right war on it 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.549
 selection from alpha channel then you see 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.979
 Now everything will be a color here 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.560
 worth chose and then we do 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.740
 again right click on it selection 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.439
 after Bad then this selection will now 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.740
 converted into a path that is if 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.210
 I remove the selection and back 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.860
 go to the ride go the times 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.650
 Now we have such a path here 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.720
 We can take it down and down 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.580
 We now want to export this path 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.680
 and import into blender 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.560
 I go here now right-click 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.770
 on it and at the bottom you will find a ride 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.100
 I export the window 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.069
 up right click and down here 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.420
 export then I save that 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:38.890
 whole on the desktop under logo svg svg 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.780
 stands for scalable vector graphics in 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.500
 the file is still the path data 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.620
 contain 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:49.709
 and now to change to the blender 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:54.060
 file import scalable vector graphics svg 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:57.700
 who here is the logo from import svg and 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.739
 if I have the dice remove 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.900
 we now here very small the agentes 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.080
 brothers logo I can imagine that 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:10.150
 a little bigger then I click 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:12.850
 origin geometry shift s selection 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.440
 cursor and now we have the 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.570
 Center reset in the middle 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.250
 and we see now we only have that 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.560
 path and the whole surfaces are not 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.130
 filled in and we just have to 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.110
 click on jack data shape and 2d 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.200
 and you will see everything now 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.730
 filled in and with that now also one 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.400
 a little 3d does not just work that way 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.180
 we can still find flat plate here 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:42.070
 under germany ex does that a bit 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.570
 so explode out and midcaps can 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.350
 we still have some kind of bible effects 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.299
 Add 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.549
 you can see that if you do 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.769
 strong makes here a few 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:58.150
 Error there I was that only completely 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:59.380
 small 0.0002 exactly the path you can 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.940
 of course also edit if 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.260
 any gross errors here 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.840
 you can have it somewhere 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.850
 Of course, the points also move 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.200
 and edit or just remove 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.150
 then there will not be a gap 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.690
 but then the rest of the path becomes 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.690
 simply connected 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:20.190
 yes and so fast and easy you can 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:22.509
 convert a 2d logo into a 3d logo 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.360
 Of course you can if you want to 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:27.759
 For example, all this a little bit separately 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.530
 also wanted to animate the 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:32.740
 individual parts separate by her 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.759
 simply with selected and then p 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.199
 then it will be severed so you could 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.300
 then the individual things extra 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.460
 Animate it all together 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.400
 For example, there is a thing there 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.199
 even if, for example, here the smog you see 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.810
 want to use later or 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.639
 flight simulator and so on then 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.229
 does that work with the body object 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.750
 not like you see back here when I am 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.729
 times at physik spin we have all these 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.430
 option that does not mean we have to 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:03.039
 first convert to a match object 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:07.900
 to select that just presses old 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:10.479
 and c and mash bomb elfmeters text and 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.820
 Now we see when I am in the office 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.830
 that a human object and all these 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.099
 option here are re-selectable 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.500
 This method is a logo from a 2d 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.880
 to convert logo into a 3d logo 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.650
 we also for a customer 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:30.400
 project used for the 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:32.229
 tv spot for paintball arena point ch for 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.720
 A paintball supplier from Switzerland 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:38.020
 and we have here with the help of the 3d 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.960
 trackings this logo here in this 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.530
 Teeth tracked and if we look at this here 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:50.110
 look at times more precisely and then the 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:53.199
 here also all body objects we 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.669
 then with the export worth a 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.440
 have lifted out a bit 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.509
 I also have some objects here 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.259
 built separately like these letters here 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:01.180
 in the background 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:05.259
 and then we have a chic one out of it 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:08.349
 animation made if we look at it 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:12.490
 very slowly just look at it 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:13.780
 everything so piece by piece and also 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.570
 Here I had these individual ones 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.770
 elements separated and then separately 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.770
 animated from each other 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:27.450
 you see that is really fast 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.010
 this link to this paintball spot 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.590
 you can find below in the video 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.300
 description and yes that should now 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.080
 even for this little tip video 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.430
 have been 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.050
 I hope you enjoyed it and you 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.610
 I learned a little bit and me 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:43.280
 Also hope that we are in one of our 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.280
 see you next videos until then
