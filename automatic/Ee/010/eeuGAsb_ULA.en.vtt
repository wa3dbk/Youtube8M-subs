00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
using the m14 infrared scope so this was

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.480 
using the m14 infrared scope so this was
probably<00:00:26.689> one<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.140> most<00:00:28.650> recent<00:00:29.160> kind<00:00:29.369> of

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
suggesting things have been picking up a

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.560 
suggesting things have been picking up a
lot<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.560> just<00:00:31.619> first<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.759> all<00:00:32.850> look<00:00:33.059> at<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.390> it

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
lot and just first of all look at it it

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.080 
lot and just first of all look at it it
kind<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.050> looks<00:00:34.350> like<00:00:34.530> some<00:00:35.430> kind<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.850> like

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
kind of looks like some kind of like

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.889 
kind of looks like some kind of like
sniper<00:00:36.780> rifle<00:00:37.260> like<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.680> weird<00:00:38.219> dragunov<00:00:38.899> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
sniper rifle like a weird dragunov the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.600 
sniper rifle like a weird dragunov the
tiger<00:00:40.440> cam<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.770> probably<00:00:41.040> wasn't<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.399> good<00:00:41.430> idea

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
tiger cam it probably wasn't a good idea

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.619 
tiger cam it probably wasn't a good idea
it<00:00:41.940> looks<00:00:42.059> pretty<00:00:42.239> ugly<00:00:42.719> but<00:00:44.000> nonetheless<00:00:45.000> it

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
it looks pretty ugly but nonetheless it

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.350 
it looks pretty ugly but nonetheless it
goes<00:00:45.989> pretty<00:00:46.260> well<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:47.039> i<00:00:47.309> presume<00:00:48.000> i'm

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360

the worst thing that could put an
infrared<00:02:23.219> scope<00:02:23.549> on<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:24.060> would<00:02:24.659> actually

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:24.749 
infrared scope on I would actually

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:26.989 
infrared scope on I would actually
disagree<00:02:25.319> i<00:02:25.499> think<00:02:25.650> one<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.189> LMGs<00:02:26.790> or

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:26.999 
disagree i think one of the LMGs or

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:28.489 
disagree i think one of the LMGs or
maybe<00:02:27.180> something<00:02:27.359> with<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.599> lot<00:02:27.719> of<00:02:27.780> recoil<00:02:28.019> is

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:28.499 
maybe something with a lot of recoil is

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.559 
maybe something with a lot of recoil is
back<00:02:28.709> but<00:02:29.219> i<00:02:29.250> found<00:02:29.459> worked<00:02:29.819> fairly<00:02:30.150> well<00:02:30.359> with

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
back but i found worked fairly well with

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.349 
back but i found worked fairly well with
the<00:02:31.200> infrared<00:02:31.739> scope<00:02:32.189> because<00:02:32.370> it's<00:02:32.879> a<00:02:33.000> single

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
the infrared scope because it's a single

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.699 
the infrared scope because it's a single
shot<00:02:33.659> and<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:35.250> has<00:02:35.670> quite<00:02:36.000> high<00:02:36.239> damage<00:02:36.959> I<00:02:37.379> mean

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
shot and it has quite high damage I mean

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.140 
shot and it has quite high damage I mean
not<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.430> many<00:02:38.609> people<00:02:38.939> use<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:41.030> 15<00:02:42.030> it

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
not so many people use this but 15 it

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.489 
not so many people use this but 15 it
yet<00:02:42.389> a<00:02:42.540> cure<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:42.840> you've<00:02:43.019> got<00:02:43.139> an<00:02:43.230> all<00:02:43.319> right

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:43.499 
yet a cure and you've got an all right

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.619 
yet a cure and you've got an all right
trigger<00:02:43.769> finger<00:02:44.249> you<00:02:44.760> can<00:02:44.939> pick<00:02:45.209> up<00:02:45.359> quite<00:02:45.599> a

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
trigger finger you can pick up quite a

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:46.789 
trigger finger you can pick up quite a
lot<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.900> kills<00:02:46.109> I<00:02:46.230> think<00:02:46.409> what<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.560> lot<00:02:46.650> of

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
lot of kills I think what a lot of

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.280 
lot of kills I think what a lot of
people<00:02:46.889> find<00:02:47.430> is<00:02:47.969> they<00:02:48.239> can't<00:02:48.510> put<00:02:48.810> out<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:48.989> lot

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
people find is they can't put out a lot

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.860 
people find is they can't put out a lot
of<00:02:49.409> bullets<00:02:49.829> while<00:02:50.069> aiming<00:02:50.510> kind<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.719> like

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
of bullets while aiming kind of like

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.509 
of bullets while aiming kind of like
though<00:02:52.079> if<00:02:52.319> they<00:02:52.469> shoot<00:02:52.919> a<00:02:53.099> lot<00:02:53.219> of<00:02:53.310> times

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
though if they shoot a lot of times

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.059 
though if they shoot a lot of times
they'll<00:02:53.730> start<00:02:53.969> mixing<00:02:54.180> or<00:02:54.599> if<00:02:55.409> they're<00:02:55.739> like

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
they'll start mixing or if they're like

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.890 
they'll start mixing or if they're like
trying<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.519> like<00:02:56.699> lineup<00:02:57.209> each<00:02:57.389> shot<00:02:57.719> they

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
trying to like lineup each shot they

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.240 
trying to like lineup each shot they
weren't<00:02:58.139> getting<00:02:58.349> a<00:02:58.409> shot<00:02:58.650> Sal<00:02:58.919> to<00:02:59.069> kill

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
weren't getting a shot Sal to kill

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.520 
weren't getting a shot Sal to kill
people<00:02:59.459> so<00:02:59.939> it's<00:03:00.569> a<00:03:00.689> hard<00:03:00.870> balance<00:03:01.079> to<00:03:01.379> get

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
people so it's a hard balance to get

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.789 
people so it's a hard balance to get
with<00:03:01.939> semi-automatic<00:03:03.290> is<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.560> yeah

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
with semi-automatic is it yeah

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.509 
with semi-automatic is it yeah
semi-automatic<00:03:05.579> weapons<00:03:06.239> so<00:03:07.069> all<00:03:08.069> it<00:03:08.310> takes

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
semi-automatic weapons so all it takes

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:09.979 
semi-automatic weapons so all it takes
is<00:03:08.669> a<00:03:08.730> little<00:03:08.819> bit<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.209> time<00:03:09.389> to<00:03:09.540> get<00:03:09.629> used<00:03:09.870> to

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
is a little bit of time to get used to

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.319 
is a little bit of time to get used to
it<00:03:10.109> but<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.949> scope<00:03:11.459> does<00:03:11.730> actually<00:03:11.909> give<00:03:12.209> you

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
it but the scope does actually give you

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.479 
it but the scope does actually give you
a<00:03:12.359> lot<00:03:12.599> of<00:03:12.810> versatility<00:03:13.769> you<00:03:14.010> can<00:03:14.159> get<00:03:14.280> quite<00:03:14.430> a

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
a lot of versatility you can get quite a

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.990 
a lot of versatility you can get quite a
few<00:03:14.609> long-range<00:03:15.239> kills<00:03:15.599> and<00:03:17.000> that's

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
few long-range kills and that's

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.999 
few long-range kills and that's
something<00:03:18.239> that<00:03:18.449> sometimes<00:03:19.109> with<00:03:19.290> an<00:03:19.379> ak-47

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:20.009 
something that sometimes with an ak-47

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:22.999 
something that sometimes with an ak-47
with<00:03:20.609> no<00:03:21.000> attachments<00:03:21.750> like<00:03:21.900> because<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:22.919> the

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:23.009 
with no attachments like because of the

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:25.159 
with no attachments like because of the
iron<00:03:23.310> sights<00:03:23.549> you<00:03:23.819> can<00:03:23.970> often<00:03:24.540> struggle<00:03:25.049> to

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
iron sights you can often struggle to

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.649 
iron sights you can often struggle to
get<00:03:25.259> kills<00:03:25.560> from<00:03:25.769> a<00:03:25.919> long<00:03:26.159> distance<00:03:26.659> whereas

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
get kills from a long distance whereas

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.539 
get kills from a long distance whereas
with<00:03:27.930> minute<00:03:28.590> Fred<00:03:28.769> scope<00:03:29.069> you<00:03:29.220> can<00:03:29.370> use<00:03:29.519> it

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
with minute Fred scope you can use it

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.219 
with minute Fred scope you can use it
kind<00:03:29.819> of<00:03:29.879> for<00:03:30.030> all<00:03:30.060> ranges<00:03:30.569> admitted<00:03:31.079> that

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
kind of for all ranges admitted that

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.679 
kind of for all ranges admitted that
it's<00:03:31.379> quite<00:03:31.500> bad<00:03:31.829> at<00:03:32.129> close<00:03:32.519> range<00:03:32.879> but<00:03:33.180> you

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 
it's quite bad at close range but you

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.770 
it's quite bad at close range but you
can<00:03:33.900> hit<00:03:34.259> Baron<00:03:34.799> hope<00:03:35.009> for<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.310> best<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:36.389> yeah

not<00:04:13.530> kind<00:04:14.129> of<00:04:14.219> spending<00:04:14.639> too<00:04:14.729> much<00:04:14.759> time<00:04:14.909> just

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
not kind of spending too much time just

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.270 
not kind of spending too much time just
listening<00:04:15.569> to<00:04:15.689> my<00:04:15.810> headset<00:04:16.320> because<00:04:16.650> often<00:04:17.159> I

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
listening to my headset because often I

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.249 
listening to my headset because often I
encouraged<00:04:17.669> him<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:17.940> use<00:04:18.120> UAB<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.599> Blackbird

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259 
encouraged him to use UAB and Blackbird

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.140 
encouraged him to use UAB and Blackbird
and<00:04:19.380> stuff<00:04:19.650> as<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:19.919> can<00:04:20.039> see<00:04:20.190> here<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:20.969> we're

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
and stuff as you can see here so we're

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.990 
and stuff as you can see here so we're
pretty<00:04:21.359> much<00:04:21.479> sorted<00:04:21.900> about<00:04:22.650> that<00:04:22.919> so

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
pretty much sorted about that so

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.430 
pretty much sorted about that so
yeah<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:25.270> then<00:04:25.419> scavenging<00:04:26.080> but<00:04:26.229> just

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
yeah and then scavenging but just

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.840 
yeah and then scavenging but just
because<00:04:26.560> you<00:04:26.860> can<00:04:26.979> go<00:04:27.130> on<00:04:27.220> long<00:04:27.400> killstreaks

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
because you can go on long killstreaks

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.249 
because you can go on long killstreaks
you're<00:04:27.970> using<00:04:28.150> scavenger<00:04:28.720> you<00:04:28.840> don't<00:04:29.020> run<00:04:29.169> out

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
you're using scavenger you don't run out

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.770 
you're using scavenger you don't run out
of<00:04:29.289> ammo<00:04:29.669> but<00:04:30.669> anyway<00:04:30.940> it's<00:04:31.180> kind<00:04:31.360> of<00:04:31.389> nearing

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
of ammo but anyway it's kind of nearing

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.249 
of ammo but anyway it's kind of nearing
the<00:04:31.900> end<00:04:32.050> of<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.289> game<00:04:32.320> now<00:04:32.740> so<00:04:34.259> basically

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
the end of the game now so basically

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:36.779 
the end of the game now so basically
I've<00:04:35.530> got<00:04:35.710> another<00:04:35.949> modern<00:04:36.280> warfare<00:04:36.490> 2
