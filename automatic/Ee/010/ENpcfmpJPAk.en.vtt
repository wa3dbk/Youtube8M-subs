00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
adjusting gears on your bicycle so let's

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.459 
adjusting gears on your bicycle so let's
go<00:00:10.500> over<00:00:11.090> the<00:00:12.090> things<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.630> can<00:00:12.809> adjust<00:00:13.230> if

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
go over the things you can adjust if

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.430 
go over the things you can adjust if
you're<00:00:13.740> having<00:00:14.099> problems<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:15.269> your<00:00:16.049> chain

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
you're having problems with your chain

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.830 
you're having problems with your chain
going<00:00:16.830> past<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.850> first<00:00:18.090> rocket<00:00:18.420> into<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
going past the first rocket into the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.070 
going past the first rocket into the
spokes<00:00:19.260> or<00:00:19.939> getting<00:00:20.939> into<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.359> space<00:00:21.630> here

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
spokes or getting into this space here

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.370 
spokes or getting into this space here
where<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.470> last<00:00:22.710> sprocket<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.990> that<00:00:24.990> would<00:00:25.199> be

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
where the last sprocket is that would be

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.759 
where the last sprocket is that would be
due<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.740> your<00:00:26.720> boundary<00:00:27.720> screws<00:00:28.109> there's<00:00:28.650> a

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
due to your boundary screws there's a

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.040 
due to your boundary screws there's a
high<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.550> low<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:30.029> usually<00:00:30.420> states<00:00:30.750> right

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
high and a low it usually states right

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.389 
high and a low it usually states right
there<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.560> don't<00:00:31.740> know<00:00:31.830> if<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:31.980> can<00:00:32.099> see<00:00:32.219> that

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
there I don't know if you can see that

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.510 
there I don't know if you can see that
high<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.570> low<00:00:34.489> your<00:00:35.489> high<00:00:35.700> controls<00:00:37.520> your

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
high and low your high controls your

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.790 
high and low your high controls your
high<00:00:38.730> speed<00:00:38.790> gears<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.489> I<00:00:41.489> push<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:42.800> turning

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
high speed gears and I push like turning

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.190 
high speed gears and I push like turning
the<00:00:43.980> screw<00:00:44.190> inward<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:45.600> gonna<00:00:45.750> make<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.050> so

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the screw inward it's gonna make it so

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.639 
the screw inward it's gonna make it so
the<00:00:46.500> derailleur<00:00:46.920> can't<00:00:47.340> go<00:00:47.550> past<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.930> last

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the derailleur can't go past that last

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.229 
the derailleur can't go past that last
sprocket<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:51.680> tightening<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.800> makes<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.370> more

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
sprocket and tightening it makes it more

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.799 
sprocket and tightening it makes it more
of<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.449> boundary<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.699> loose<00:00:56.699> makes<00:00:57.270> less<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
of a boundary and loose makes less of a

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.119 
of a boundary and loose makes less of a
boundary<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.469> you're<00:00:58.620> gonna<00:00:58.710> get<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.980> just

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
boundary so you're gonna get it just

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.849 
boundary so you're gonna get it just
right<00:00:59.250> if<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.670> get<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.910> too<00:01:00.059> tight<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.859> won't

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
right if you get it too tight it won't

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.650 
right if you get it too tight it won't
even<00:01:02.160> shift<00:01:02.399> into<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> last<00:01:03.000> cog<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.539> this

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
even shift into the last cog in this

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.350 
even shift into the last cog in this
case<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.049> won't<00:01:04.140> shift<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> seventh

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
case it won't shift in the seventh

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.039 
case it won't shift in the seventh
properly<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:07.770> same<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:09.049> top-end

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
properly and the same is for the top-end

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.429 
properly and the same is for the top-end
rocket<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.310> first<00:01:11.549> ya

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
rocket the first ya

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.170 
rocket the first ya
if<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.040> having<00:01:14.340> troubles<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> chain

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
if you having troubles with the chain

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.359 
if you having troubles with the chain
skipping<00:01:16.049> off<00:01:17.659> that<00:01:18.659> would<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:19.020> due<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.830> not

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
skipping off that would be due to not

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.249 
skipping off that would be due to not
enough<00:01:20.580> boundary<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.479> would<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.750> your

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
enough boundary so that would be your

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.130 
enough boundary so that would be your
low-end<00:01:23.159> boundary<00:01:23.670> you'd<00:01:24.479> want<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.780> tighten

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
low-end boundary you'd want to tighten

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.609 
low-end boundary you'd want to tighten
that<00:01:25.259> if<00:01:25.439> that's<00:01:25.650> happening<00:01:26.990> that<00:01:27.990> covers<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
that if that's happening that covers the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.270 
that if that's happening that covers the
boundary<00:01:29.040> screws<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.670> let's<00:01:30.210> move<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.630> to

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
boundary screws so let's move on to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.859 
boundary screws so let's move on to
adjusting<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.460> linkage<00:01:33.650> say<00:01:34.650> if<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.159> are<00:01:35.869> if

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
adjusting the linkage say if you are if

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.929 
adjusting the linkage say if you are if
you're<00:01:37.590> shifting<00:01:37.979> your<00:01:38.130> bike<00:01:38.310> all<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.610> way<00:01:38.880> to

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
you're shifting your bike all the way to

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.410 
you're shifting your bike all the way to
first<00:01:39.780> gear<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.680> grip<00:01:41.310> shift<00:01:41.670> or<00:01:41.939> whatever

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
first gear on the grip shift or whatever

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.289 
first gear on the grip shift or whatever
you<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.399> it's<00:01:44.399> not<00:01:44.640> going<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.119> first

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
you have and it's not going in the first

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.300 
you have and it's not going in the first
gear<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:46.590> probably<00:01:47.159> because<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:49.310> your

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
gear it's probably because you have your

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.249 
gear it's probably because you have your
linkage<00:01:50.729> got<00:01:50.970> stretched<00:01:51.360> out<00:01:51.659> or<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.020> just

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
linkage got stretched out or it's just

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.240 
linkage got stretched out or it's just
came<00:01:52.979> out<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.189> adjustment<00:01:54.500> so<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.560> fix<00:01:56.100> that

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
came out of adjustment so to fix that

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.620 
came out of adjustment so to fix that
you<00:01:56.990> can<00:01:57.990> do<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> couple<00:01:58.530> things<00:01:58.710> here<00:01:59.630> this

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
you can do a couple things here this

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.539 
you can do a couple things here this
screw<00:02:00.990> right<00:02:01.320> here<00:02:01.590> usually<00:02:02.310> there's<00:02:02.490> one

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
screw right here usually there's one

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.700 
screw right here usually there's one
down<00:02:02.820> by<00:02:03.000> your<00:02:03.060> derailleur<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:04.170> can<00:02:04.409> move

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
down by your derailleur you can move

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.580 
down by your derailleur you can move
that<00:02:04.920> out

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.589 

that<00:02:08.429> will<00:02:08.640> give<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.179> more<00:02:11.300> more<00:02:12.300> tight

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
that will give you more more tight

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.500 
that will give you more more tight
linkage<00:02:13.019> so<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.349> could<00:02:14.060> shift<00:02:15.060> up<00:02:15.269> in<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
linkage so you could shift up in the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.780 
linkage so you could shift up in the
first<00:02:15.750> gear<00:02:16.050> easier<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.950> also<00:02:17.129> there's

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
first gear easier and also there's

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.210 
first gear easier and also there's
usually<00:02:18.180> one<00:02:18.390> by<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.980> grip<00:02:19.980> shift<00:02:20.250> itself<00:02:20.959> and

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
usually one by the grip shift itself and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.729 
usually one by the grip shift itself and
those<00:02:23.220> are<00:02:23.370> more<00:02:23.640> for<00:02:23.879> minor<00:02:24.120> adjustments<00:02:24.989> if

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
those are more for minor adjustments if

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.380 
those are more for minor adjustments if
you<00:02:26.010> need<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.250> go<00:02:26.400> ahead<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.879> make<00:02:27.209> an

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
you need to go ahead and make an

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.960 
you need to go ahead and make an
adjustment<00:02:27.510> right<00:02:28.140> here<00:02:28.500> where<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.610> cable

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
adjustment right here where the cable

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.869 
adjustment right here where the cable
meets<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.480> derailleur<00:02:31.280> first<00:02:32.280> thing<00:02:32.519> before

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
meets the derailleur first thing before

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.539 
meets the derailleur first thing before
you<00:02:32.970> even<00:02:33.150> touch<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:34.860> want<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.160> put<00:02:35.340> all

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
you even touch that you want to put all

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.839 
you even touch that you want to put all
of<00:02:35.580> your<00:02:35.910> adjusters<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:37.470> as<00:02:38.099> far<00:02:38.310> as<00:02:38.370> they<00:02:38.790> can

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
of your adjusters in as far as they can

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.170 
of your adjusters in as far as they can
go<00:02:39.060> or<00:02:39.330> almost<00:02:39.690> as<00:02:39.959> far<00:02:40.170> as<00:02:40.290> they<00:02:40.410> can<00:02:40.590> go<00:02:41.180> so

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
go or almost as far as they can go so

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.289 
go or almost as far as they can go so
that<00:02:43.049> just<00:02:43.500> gives<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.950> justement<00:02:44.940> down<00:02:45.120> the

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
that just gives you a justement down the

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.630 
that just gives you a justement down the
road<00:02:45.510> when<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.900> roughly<00:02:46.290> tension<00:02:47.099> your<00:02:47.250> cable

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
road when you roughly tension your cable

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.030 
road when you roughly tension your cable
and<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.959> do<00:02:49.079> that<00:02:49.319> usually<00:02:50.069> it's<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:52.470> could<00:02:52.860> be

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
and to do that usually it's it could be

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.229 
and to do that usually it's it could be
a<00:02:53.250> nine<00:02:53.670> millimeter<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.690> ten<00:02:55.470> millimeter<00:02:55.709> or<00:02:56.700> it

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
a nine millimeter a ten millimeter or it

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.800 
a nine millimeter a ten millimeter or it
could<00:02:57.480> be<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.690> descendant<00:02:58.560> through<00:02:59.810> allen

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
could be a descendant through allen

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.110 
could be a descendant through allen
wrenches<00:03:01.430> usually<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:02.549> a<00:03:02.640> five-millimeter

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
wrenches usually it's a five-millimeter

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.960 
wrenches usually it's a five-millimeter
hex<00:03:03.599> if<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.049> is<00:03:04.370> those<00:03:05.370> are<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.579> three<00:03:05.790> most

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
hex if it is those are the three most

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.530 
hex if it is those are the three most
common<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.860> make<00:03:08.190> sure<00:03:08.220> your<00:03:08.610> bike<00:03:08.819> when

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
common so make sure your bike when

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.809 
common so make sure your bike when
you're<00:03:09.720> adjusting<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.410> cable<00:03:10.799> it's<00:03:11.099> in<00:03:11.340> the

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
you're adjusting the cable it's in the

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.710 
you're adjusting the cable it's in the
last<00:03:12.060> sprocket<00:03:13.489> so<00:03:14.489> go<00:03:14.819> ahead<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.060> shift<00:03:15.569> it

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
last sprocket so go ahead and shift it

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.210 
last sprocket so go ahead and shift it
into<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.139> last<00:03:16.380> rocket<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:19.530> would<00:03:19.680> do<00:03:19.799> that

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.680 

mine's<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.340> bit<00:03:23.489> hesitant<00:03:23.670> here<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:24.510> actually

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
mine's a bit hesitant here so I actually

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.729 
mine's a bit hesitant here so I actually
gotta<00:03:25.019> adjust<00:03:25.139> this<00:03:27.139> get<00:03:28.139> a<00:03:28.230> little<00:03:28.260> left<00:03:28.590> on

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
gotta adjust this get a little left on

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.530 
gotta adjust this get a little left on
you<00:03:28.920> but<00:03:29.069> anyway<00:03:29.370> you'd<00:03:29.639> put<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.150> your<00:03:30.269> last

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
you but anyway you'd put it to your last

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.780 
you but anyway you'd put it to your last
year<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.109> then<00:03:31.980> that's<00:03:32.280> when<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.639> would

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
year and then that's when you would

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.920 
year and then that's when you would
unloosen<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:34.260> would<00:03:34.380> loosen<00:03:34.799> sorry<00:03:35.130> this

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
unloosen you would loosen sorry this

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.250 
unloosen you would loosen sorry this
right<00:03:36.930> here<00:03:37.609> and<00:03:38.609> this<00:03:39.060> cable<00:03:39.329> is<00:03:39.569> bad<00:03:39.810> because

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
right here and this cable is bad because

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.390 
right here and this cable is bad because
the<00:03:40.470> cap<00:03:40.889> crimp<00:03:41.760> on<00:03:41.910> capsule<00:03:42.480> off<00:03:43.130> you<00:03:44.130> loose

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
the cap crimp on capsule off you loose

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.099 
the cap crimp on capsule off you loose
that<00:03:44.669> then<00:03:44.910> give<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.359> a<00:03:45.450> little<00:03:45.599> more<00:03:45.780> tension

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
that then give it a little more tension

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.539 
that then give it a little more tension
tighten<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.859> back<00:03:47.010> up<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:49.130> then<00:03:50.130> you<00:03:50.160> can

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
tighten the back up and then you can

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.900 
tighten the back up and then you can
adjust<00:03:50.669> these<00:03:51.269> to<00:03:51.329> the<00:03:51.930> preference<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.590> want

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
adjust these to the preference you want

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.050 
adjust these to the preference you want
and<00:03:54.230> I'll<00:03:55.230> quickly<00:03:55.620> go<00:03:56.010> over<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.669> front

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
and I'll quickly go over the front

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.559 
and I'll quickly go over the front
derailleur<00:03:58.040> that<00:03:59.040> covers<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.730> rear<00:04:00.090> door<00:04:00.389> let

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
derailleur that covers the rear door let

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.880 
derailleur that covers the rear door let
you<00:04:00.840> railer<00:04:01.669> and<00:04:02.669> this<00:04:03.450> is<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.750> front<00:04:03.959> one

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
you railer and this is the front one

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.530 
you railer and this is the front one
so<00:04:05.890> same<00:04:06.370> here<00:04:06.580> you<00:04:06.730> have<00:04:06.940> your<00:04:07.090> high<00:04:07.240> and<00:04:07.270> low

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
so same here you have your high and low

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.520 
so same here you have your high and low
bamboo<00:04:08.110> screws<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:10.540> Front's<00:04:11.020> a<00:04:11.110> little<00:04:11.380> less

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
bamboo screws the Front's a little less

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.860 
bamboo screws the Front's a little less
picky<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:14.970> usually<00:04:15.970> there<00:04:16.120> are<00:04:16.150> two<00:04:16.239> or<00:04:16.630> three

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
picky and usually there are two or three

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.420 
picky and usually there are two or three
chain<00:04:17.140> rings<00:04:19.680> it's<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.799> same<00:04:21.070> thing

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
chain rings it's the same thing

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.600 
chain rings it's the same thing
basically<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.150> same<00:04:22.300> idea<00:04:22.360> for<00:04:23.610> adjusting

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
basically the same idea for adjusting

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.890 
basically the same idea for adjusting
the<00:04:24.640> rear<00:04:24.910> derailleur<00:04:25.090> if<00:04:25.420> you<00:04:25.510> need<00:04:25.690> some

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
the rear derailleur if you need some

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.250 
the rear derailleur if you need some
more<00:04:26.340> or<00:04:27.340> less<00:04:27.610> slack<00:04:27.910> to<00:04:28.150> get<00:04:28.300> onto<00:04:28.420> the<00:04:28.750> third

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
more or less slack to get onto the third

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.510 
more or less slack to get onto the third
chain<00:04:29.590> ring<00:04:29.860> you<00:04:30.520> put<00:04:31.650> instead<00:04:32.650> of<00:04:32.800> last<00:04:33.070> year

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
chain ring you put instead of last year

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.220 
chain ring you put instead of last year
you<00:04:33.970> put<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:35.280> we<00:04:36.280> put<00:04:36.520> it<00:04:36.610> in<00:04:36.700> the<00:04:36.880> first<00:04:37.540> year

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.820 

on<00:04:41.230> one<00:04:41.650> in<00:04:41.830> this<00:04:42.010> case<00:04:42.250> and<00:04:43.380> then<00:04:44.380> that's<00:04:44.620> when

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
on one in this case and then that's when

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.650 
on one in this case and then that's when
you<00:04:44.920> do<00:04:45.190> your<00:04:45.400> adjustments<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:46.420> same

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
you do your adjustments and the same

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.240 
you do your adjustments and the same
thing<00:04:46.930> for<00:04:47.200> the<00:04:47.290> bounder<00:04:47.620> screws<00:04:47.860> if<00:04:48.070> you're

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
thing for the bounder screws if you're

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.550 
thing for the bounder screws if you're
going<00:04:48.430> off<00:04:48.730> your<00:04:49.420> chain<00:04:49.660> is<00:04:49.780> falling<00:04:50.170> off<00:04:50.320> when

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
going off your chain is falling off when

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.990 
going off your chain is falling off when
you're<00:04:50.650> going<00:04:50.800> into<00:04:51.010> three<00:04:51.370> or<00:04:51.550> it's<00:04:51.640> falling

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
you're going into three or it's falling

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.720 
you're going into three or it's falling
off<00:04:52.090> going<00:04:52.390> into<00:04:52.570> one<00:04:53.220> that's<00:04:54.220> probably<00:04:54.640> a

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
off going into one that's probably a

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.310 
off going into one that's probably a
boundary<00:04:55.180> problem<00:04:56.760> so<00:04:57.760> I<00:04:57.790> have<00:04:58.270> I'm<00:04:59.140> gonna

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
boundary problem so I have I'm gonna

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.740 
boundary problem so I have I'm gonna

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
having problems even after you played

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.830 
having problems even after you played
around<00:05:11.380> with<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:14.260> adjustments<00:05:14.980> I<00:05:15.130> just

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
around with the adjustments I just

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.210 
around with the adjustments I just
taught<00:05:16.840> you<00:05:17.050> today<00:05:17.200> or<00:05:17.560> if<00:05:17.710> you<00:05:17.860> already<00:05:17.950> know

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
taught you today or if you already know

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.840 
taught you today or if you already know
it<00:05:18.960> could<00:05:19.960> be<00:05:20.140> three<00:05:20.620> things<00:05:21.780> one<00:05:22.780> could<00:05:23.020> be<00:05:23.230> a

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
it could be three things one could be a

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.330 
it could be three things one could be a
worn<00:05:24.850> out<00:05:24.970> derailleur<00:05:25.510> and<00:05:25.860> that's<00:05:26.860> basically

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
worn out derailleur and that's basically

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.310 
worn out derailleur and that's basically
right<00:05:27.490> here<00:05:27.730> with<00:05:28.150> these<00:05:28.300> pins<00:05:28.630> go<00:05:29.050> through

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
right here with these pins go through

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.520 
right here with these pins go through
over<00:05:29.919> time<00:05:30.430> they<00:05:30.790> wear<00:05:31.060> out<00:05:31.270> and<00:05:31.510> they<00:05:31.570> develop

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
over time they wear out and they develop

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.000 
over time they wear out and they develop
slack<00:05:32.890> and<00:05:33.190> the<00:05:33.280> whole<00:05:33.430> derailleur<00:05:35.010> just

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
slack and the whole derailleur just

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.820 
slack and the whole derailleur just
Wiggles<00:05:36.669> around<00:05:36.760> too<00:05:37.210> much<00:05:37.390> and<00:05:37.720> that<00:05:38.020> can

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
Wiggles around too much and that can

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.830 
Wiggles around too much and that can
cause<00:05:39.010> a<00:05:39.040> problem<00:05:39.370> with<00:05:39.820> the<00:05:39.940> imprecision

like<00:06:33.050> it<00:06:33.260> might<00:06:33.410> shift<00:06:33.680> from<00:06:33.920> first<00:06:34.250> second

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640

like it might shift from first second
third<00:06:34.790> good<00:06:35.090> but<00:06:35.300> then<00:06:35.480> when<00:06:35.630> you<00:06:35.720> get<00:06:35.840> to

third good but then when you get to
fourth<00:06:36.610> it'll<00:06:37.610> skip<00:06:38.330> a<00:06:38.480> gear<00:06:38.750> and<00:06:38.930> then<00:06:39.020> fifth

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
fourth it'll skip a gear and then fifth

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.260 
fourth it'll skip a gear and then fifth
it'll<00:06:39.590> skip<00:06:39.830> another<00:06:40.130> gear<00:06:40.460> and<00:06:40.880> going<00:06:41.150> to
