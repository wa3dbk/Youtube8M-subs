00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.550
 fingerings of three strings for the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.850
 Sixth string major chord 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:14.059
 let's reduce our fingering of 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.870
 major chords sixth string at all 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.130
 possible combinations of three strings 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.130
 to cover less space 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.830
 the first second and third rope 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.240
 it does not remain with a fingering where 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.780
 we make a small seed of two 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.420
 ropes with your finger and we cover with the 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.350
 finger two 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.989
 in the immediate upper space where 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.250
 is the tonic is this note that is the 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.260
 same actuality of the sixth block 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.289
 so it's very easy to locate that 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.769
 sun this is a chord that's what 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:53.460
 that's because we're seeing is a 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.460
 chord of tomÃ¡s 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.370
 Y 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.750
 Y 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.940
 the second third and fourth string do not 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.220
 is left with this 2 1 fingering in the 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.230
 second string in the immediate fret 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.140
 superior and on the immediate rope 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.320
 top finger 2 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.850
 and on the fourth string two more spaces 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.470
 up or a space higher than the 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.900
 anterior finger 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.900
 the leonine we have this fingering 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.190
 neither 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.900
 i 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.890
 i 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.530
 We noticed that by not having a tour we were 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.690
 it makes a lot more comfortable much more more 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.370
 relaxed to play this chord 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.480
 and we can truthfully touch during 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.520
 much more time 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.400
 the combination of third and fourth 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.900
 fifth string is exactly for us 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.430
 the meditation of an open that if not 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.040
 we play strings to the air 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.930
 we can transport it without sin 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.180
 problems that fingering that was 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.180
 making surroundings would stay like that
