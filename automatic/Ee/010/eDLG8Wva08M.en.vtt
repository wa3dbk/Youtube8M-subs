00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hey guys what's up this is a video for

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.230 
hey guys what's up this is a video for
Aaron<00:00:03.959> he's<00:00:04.310> interested<00:00:05.310> in<00:00:05.430> how<00:00:05.670> he<00:00:05.730> could<00:00:06.029> be

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
Aaron he's interested in how he could be

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.100 
Aaron he's interested in how he could be
focus<00:00:06.720> recon<00:00:07.170> so<00:00:07.589> on<00:00:08.599> give<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.690> guys<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.900> little

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
focus recon so on give you guys a little

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.999 
focus recon so on give you guys a little
explanation<00:00:10.820> what<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:11.940> could<00:00:12.150> do<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:13.009> one

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
explanation what you could do and one

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.269 
explanation what you could do and one
thing<00:00:14.040> would<00:00:14.460> be<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:15.089> take<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.599> beef<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.920> glue

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
thing would be to take a beef this glue

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.340 
thing would be to take a beef this glue
joint<00:00:17.640> up<00:00:17.850> around<00:00:18.750> here<00:00:22.160> you<00:00:23.160> can<00:00:23.340> make<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.670> a

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
joint up around here you can make it a

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.150 
joint up around here you can make it a
little<00:00:25.350> thicker<00:00:26.119> stronger<00:00:27.119> hold<00:00:27.660> longer<00:00:28.199> last

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
little thicker stronger hold longer last

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.040 
little thicker stronger hold longer last
longer<00:00:30.560> you<00:00:31.560> can<00:00:31.769> actually<00:00:32.279> spread<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:33.050> glue

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
longer you can actually spread the glue

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.100 
longer you can actually spread the glue
a<00:00:34.530> little<00:00:35.040> further<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.180> coil<00:00:36.480> here<00:00:36.809> too

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
a little further up on the coil here too

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.660 
a little further up on the coil here too
to<00:00:37.440> help<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> little<00:00:38.850> more<00:00:38.969> contact

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
to help have a little more contact

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.049 
to help have a little more contact
usually<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.790> can<00:00:42.000> get<00:00:42.120> away<00:00:42.270> with<00:00:43.910> filling<00:00:44.910> in

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
usually you can get away with filling in

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.810 
usually you can get away with filling in
a<00:00:45.090> little<00:00:45.420> closer<00:00:45.770> or<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.829> little<00:00:47.160> further<00:00:47.489> out

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
a little closer or a little further out

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.770 
a little closer or a little further out
on<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.149> spider<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.989> soaks<00:00:49.260> into<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
on the spider so it soaks into the

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.610 
on the spider so it soaks into the
spider<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:53.899> and<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.989> hard<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.320> hold<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
spider out here and I hard to hold the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.330 
spider out here and I hard to hold the
camera<00:00:55.860> light<00:00:56.309> point<00:00:56.760> at<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.090> same<00:00:57.300> time<00:00:58.340> that

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
camera light point at the same time that

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.340 
camera light point at the same time that
little<00:00:59.489> inside<00:01:00.149> lip<00:01:01.109> right<00:01:01.350> they<00:01:03.140> filled<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
little inside lip right they filled in a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.149 
little inside lip right they filled in a
little<00:01:04.710> bit<00:01:04.860> more<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.489> where<00:01:06.030> there's<00:01:06.270> some

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
little bit more so where there's some

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.830 
little bit more so where there's some
well<00:01:08.159> holes<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> spider<00:01:09.090> it'll<00:01:09.450> fill<00:01:09.659> in

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
well holes in the spider it'll fill in

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.859 
well holes in the spider it'll fill in
so<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.439> hold<00:01:11.010> real<00:01:11.310> strong<00:01:12.439> so<00:01:13.439> many<00:01:13.680> cones

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
so can hold real strong so many cones

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.280 
so can hold real strong so many cones
you<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.080> fill<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.680> between<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.810> gap<00:01:19.049> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
you can fill in between the gap and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.179 
you can fill in between the gap and
spiders<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:23.780> is<00:01:24.780> what<00:01:25.020> 45<00:01:25.650> spiders

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
spiders this one is what 45 spiders

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.850 
spiders this one is what 45 spiders
there<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.670> they<00:01:27.270> can't<00:01:27.780> really<00:01:28.049> do<00:01:28.799> that

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.080 

because<00:01:31.860> there's<00:01:32.310> just

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.150 

no<00:01:36.090> way<00:01:36.330> to<00:01:36.390> giving<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:40.320> other<00:01:40.440> food<00:01:40.800> joint

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
no way to giving the other food joint

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:48.530 
no way to giving the other food joint
you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.520> beef<00:01:41.700> up<00:01:42.800> this<00:01:43.800> in<00:01:44.070> here<00:01:47.120> which<00:01:48.120> tends

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
you can beef up this in here which tends

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.300 
you can beef up this in here which tends
to<00:01:50.330> also<00:01:51.330> be<00:01:51.510> a<00:01:51.810> weak<00:01:52.110> point<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.650> some

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
to also be a weak point on some

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:01.010 
to also be a weak point on some
subwoofers<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:58.590> can<00:01:58.770> beef<00:01:58.980> up<00:01:59.190> any<00:02:00.020> substrate

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
subwoofers you can beef up any substrate

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.400 
subwoofers you can beef up any substrate
cone<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> little<00:02:01.770> bit<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:05.930> mean<00:02:06.930> unless<00:02:07.080> you

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
cone a little bit I mean unless you

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.030 
cone a little bit I mean unless you
really<00:02:07.590> mess<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:07.920> up<00:02:08.130> it<00:02:08.340> won't<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:08.700> any<00:02:08.730> harm

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
really mess it up it won't do any harm

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:17.750 
really mess it up it won't do any harm
it<00:02:11.040> will<00:02:11.130> only<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.060> some<00:02:12.270> good<00:02:16.490> yeah<00:02:17.490> so

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
it will only do you some good yeah so

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.430 
it will only do you some good yeah so
you<00:02:17.820> can<00:02:17.970> make<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.180> joint<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.960> little<00:02:19.020> bit

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
you can make that joint a little bit

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.160 
you can make that joint a little bit
stronger<00:02:19.830> if<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.280> wanted<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.850> also<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:23.160> firm

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
stronger if you wanted to also and firm

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.700 
stronger if you wanted to also and firm
the<00:02:25.170> screw<00:02:25.500> join<00:02:25.800> inside<00:02:26.430> here<00:02:27.380> now<00:02:28.380> if<00:02:28.530> you're

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
the screw join inside here now if you're

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.830 
the screw join inside here now if you're
using<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:29.100> multi<00:02:29.460> metal<00:02:29.790> epoxy<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.480> want<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.750> be

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
using a multi metal epoxy you want to be

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.460 
using a multi metal epoxy you want to be
careful<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.770> don't<00:02:32.540> go<00:02:33.540> over<00:02:34.110> any<00:02:34.380> of

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
careful that you don't go over any of

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.080 
careful that you don't go over any of
the<00:02:34.680> wires<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.280> could<00:02:35.460> be<00:02:35.550> sticking<00:02:35.970> out

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
the wires that could be sticking out

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.180 
the wires that could be sticking out
like<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.540> one<00:02:36.780> holes<00:02:37.610> wires<00:02:40.130> that<00:02:41.130> are

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
like this one holes wires that are

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.150 
like this one holes wires that are
sticking<00:02:41.520> out<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:42.270> don't<00:02:42.480> want<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.810> use<00:02:43.620> multi

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
sticking out you don't want to use multi

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.500 
sticking out you don't want to use multi
metal<00:02:44.540> epoxy<00:02:45.540> on<00:02:45.840> those<00:02:47.209> typically<00:02:48.209> you're

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
metal epoxy on those typically you're

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.610 
metal epoxy on those typically you're
going<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.750> use<00:02:48.870> CA<00:02:49.200> glue<00:02:52.940> which<00:02:54.260> you<00:02:55.260> sprain

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
going to use CA glue which you sprain

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.290 
going to use CA glue which you sprain
activate<00:02:56.190> around<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.790> gets<00:02:56.940> really<00:02:57.180> hot

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
activate around and it gets really hot

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.180 
activate around and it gets really hot
and<00:02:57.690> dries<00:02:57.989> really<00:02:58.260> fast<00:03:00.050> but<00:03:01.050> yeah<00:03:01.620> some<00:03:02.040> are

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
and dries really fast but yeah some are

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.320 
and dries really fast but yeah some are
the<00:03:02.310> glue<00:03:02.489> joints<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.150> can<00:03:03.300> beef<00:03:03.480> up<00:03:03.720> and

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
the glue joints that you can beef up and

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.940 
the glue joints that you can beef up and
I'll<00:03:06.330> help<00:03:06.570> out<00:03:06.810> make<00:03:07.140> yourself<00:03:07.530> last<00:03:07.770> a
