00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
on to the review of the jagged sell this

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.550 
on to the review of the jagged sell this
is<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:11.030> nice<00:01:11.890> kind<00:01:12.890> of<00:01:13.010> a<00:01:13.100> I'd<00:01:13.880> say<00:01:14.240> a<00:01:14.630> cross

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
is a nice kind of a I'd say a cross

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.200 
is a nice kind of a I'd say a cross
between<00:01:15.770> a<00:01:15.979> mid<00:01:16.190> and<00:01:16.430> outer<00:01:16.490> layer<00:01:16.850> this<00:01:17.060> is

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
between a mid and outer layer this is

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.020 
between a mid and outer layer this is
like<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.360> thin<00:01:18.110> kind<00:01:18.920> of<00:01:18.979> insulated<00:01:19.430> layer<00:01:19.610> so<00:01:20.000> I

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
like a thin kind of insulated layer so I

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.700 
like a thin kind of insulated layer so I
think<00:01:20.390> this<00:01:20.479> in<00:01:20.990> terms<00:01:21.200> of<00:01:21.380> when<00:01:21.530> you<00:01:21.620> would

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
think this in terms of when you would

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.080 
think this in terms of when you would
use<00:01:21.770> this<00:01:22.010> this<00:01:22.190> would<00:01:22.250> be<00:01:22.370> a<00:01:22.400> great<00:01:22.670> jacket

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
use this this would be a great jacket

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.670 
use this this would be a great jacket
for<00:01:23.299> if<00:01:23.510> you're<00:01:23.659> doing<00:01:23.990> a<00:01:24.080> lot<00:01:24.200> of<00:01:24.260> running
