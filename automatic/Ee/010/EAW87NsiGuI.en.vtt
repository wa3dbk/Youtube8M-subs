angle of almost 30 degrees and you

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.549 
angle of almost 30 degrees and you
measure<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.600> angle<00:00:42.780> by<00:00:43.050> drawing<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.500> straight

line down the back and then as such same

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.990 
line down the back and then as such same
angle<00:00:49.410> they<00:00:49.530> would<00:00:49.680> measure<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.730> writing

although<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.920> foot<00:02:30.250> pronates<00:02:31.170> are<00:02:32.170> over

although the foot pronates are over
pronation<00:02:32.920> points<00:02:33.610> outward<00:02:33.970> we<00:02:34.570> see<00:02:34.840> as<00:02:34.960> this

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
pronation points outward we see as this

pronation points outward we see as this
meteor<00:02:35.950> does<00:02:36.100> not<00:02:36.250> drop<00:02:36.520> inward<00:02:37.030> his<00:02:37.600> hips

meteor does not drop inward his hips

does<00:02:38.110> not<00:02:38.290> drop<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:41.560> second<00:02:42.010> thing<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.280> we

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
does not drop the second thing that we

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.820 
does not drop the second thing that we
notice<00:02:43.000> about<00:02:43.090> Haley<00:02:43.570> although<00:02:44.380> this<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.710> in

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
notice about Haley although this is in

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:52.080 
notice about Haley although this is in
slow<00:02:44.980> motion<00:02:47.880> will<00:02:48.880> drop<00:02:49.240> up<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:51.090> another

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
slow motion will drop up to this another

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.390 
slow motion will drop up to this another
frame<00:02:52.480> here<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:53.020> he<00:02:53.230> pulls<00:02:53.560> his<00:02:53.830> heel

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
frame here is that he pulls his heel

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.449 
frame here is that he pulls his heel
straight<00:02:55.030> up<00:02:55.239> to<00:02:55.420> his<00:02:55.570> butt<00:02:55.840> very<00:02:56.709> high<00:02:56.950> very

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
straight up to his butt very high very

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.699 
straight up to his butt very high very
quickly<00:02:57.850> if<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.239> counted<00:02:58.600> his<00:02:58.750> cadence<00:02:58.959> it

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
quickly if you counted his cadence it

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.490 
quickly if you counted his cadence it
would<00:02:59.830> be<00:02:59.920> almost<00:03:00.070> 190<00:03:01.060> steps<00:03:01.360> per<00:03:01.630> minute<00:03:01.810> so

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
would be almost 190 steps per minute so

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.270 
would be almost 190 steps per minute so
his<00:03:02.650> impact<00:03:03.100> time<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.430> very<00:03:04.209> very<00:03:04.720> small<00:03:05.280> so

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
his impact time is very very small so

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.400 
his impact time is very very small so
his<00:03:06.459> pronation<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.540> actually<00:03:08.020> nature's

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
his pronation is actually nature's

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.580 
his pronation is actually nature's
protection<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.400> his<00:03:09.610> impact<00:03:10.060> in<00:03:10.420> other<00:03:11.260> cases

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
protection to his impact in other cases

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.580 
protection to his impact in other cases
I<00:03:11.920> see<00:03:12.190> it's<00:03:12.850> usually<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.330> sign<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.630> weakness<00:03:14.020> or

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
I see it's usually a sign of weakness or

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.310 
I see it's usually a sign of weakness or
poor<00:03:14.860> technique<00:03:15.100> I<00:03:15.690> look<00:03:16.690> at<00:03:16.810> running<00:03:16.959> form

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
poor technique I look at running form

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.110 
poor technique I look at running form
