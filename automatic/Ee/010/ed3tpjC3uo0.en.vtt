00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:13.150
 it is viewed for cows today in 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.150
 another full ground 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.119
 think it is a very nice brother very 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.180
 Silly Sunday like today if it's beautiful 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.730
 weather is then a very beautiful one 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.119
 surrounding a beautiful village we pass through 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.650
 coming 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.660
 it is slightly different than for yes 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.430
 of course in Kerkrade 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.170
 that was the most selective course 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.199
 what we can have i think and 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.960
 this is bit different but equally 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:38.019
 certainly a debilitating course if you 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.720
 a number under the seal must do and 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:44.739
 think very beautiful trail to a beautiful 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.739
 competition tough competition 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.510
 i am i would put the mouse to the nk pokoe 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.030
 grams 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.710
 explore and mama a chemist finally 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.159
 love to go and then queen anne as mine 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.960
 team at the paul like what they think 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.850
 attacking what do you think 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.189
 yes myself I think that is a very debilitating one 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.110
 trail is where many people wonder 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.990
 but good now is of course like 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.759
 and we respond 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.640
 and groin in most people will like theirs 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.130
 only to know yes i think especially if 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.920
 the wind says it 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.450
 heavy demolition it goes there is not really there 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.180
 once more where made the difference 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.979
 can be but I think yes as the 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.960
 weather conditions might be something 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.520
 if something is going to blow harder then this is it 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.140
 really from the selective course and then 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.939
 I don't think that of a very large group 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.829
 will arrive 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.049
 I also think there are a lot of races 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.899
 is motivated to really stand up for it 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.310
 in a group so I do not think it 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.470
 very likely that is the thomas 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.479
 plant is but it would be a 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.920
 take away but now have a star for years 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.869
 from the region I have some offers which you can 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.729
 are extra motivated 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.369
 yes, I am extra motivated 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.480
 wanted to put here then no 10 km 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.310
 mesh and 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.520
 trainee regularly in I think you newspaper 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:06.640
 can dream by now and yes I watch 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:08.560
 from in here you katara what what 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.150
 do you expect that the van is 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.320
 there's a phoebe sidewall here so I almost 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.330
 an occasional struggle 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.120
 treat one it's never the 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.610
 mutual ship large we are with 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.110
 a large team of rabo and hope 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.960
 of course the jersey also in the team 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.430
 but it certainly wouldn't be easy 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.820
 be because we are 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.880
 are strong other teams and I think so 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.030
 it's just a matter of good good 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.600
 transport is an offensive expansion 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.590
 and 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.590
 with a good opinion
