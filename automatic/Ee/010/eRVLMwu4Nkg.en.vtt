 media cent and this stinks the brush 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.230
 from the way I do not recommend you 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.060

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.400
 expensive but i still wanted one 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.529
 chance give yes and so can I provide 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.609
 my at the foundation on my 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.609
 complete face 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.590
 It is then of paint over the 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.710
 eyebrows donate the freenet and 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.390
 fill me with my gaps and so 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.930
 then I also take from mail berlin 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.980
 This braudel and fix we thus 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.980

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.910
 Understand concealer in the paint way 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.250

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.520
 25 and wear it with a fashion 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.080
 beautiful walls and yes I think so 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.630
 that all best then namely of 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.280
 Merck the brothers duck and would have me

 thus my concealer with the highlight 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.170
 to be glad 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.180
 next with the window 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.500
 Construction sites can be seen in mine 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.970
 last video showed and to one 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.970
 mobile video 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.520
 I think that's really good for real 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.170
 smokie so it is 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.790
 really a giant brush 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.740
 I just take a black one 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.100
 matt eyeshadow and imitate otherwise 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.240
 mocki just and the layer so long 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.870
 until I think now it has the perfect 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.160
 the perfect intensity for me and 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.930
 then i also take inland brushes and 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.460
 blinds the whole thing neatly and that 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.460
 of course I do it on both sides 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.979
 so is 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.010
 power 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.640
 when I made the whole pure 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.530
 then i will take my katri stick 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.560
 unfortunately in the color 0 10 dating joe 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.570
 black and twice as a bit 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.150
 my armor with the all of them 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.900
 is blackest and namely again 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.190
 this window of music and dazzle that 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.350
 whole again with that really 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.890
 no hard or line or can you 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.890
 just gives 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.470
 from there on this mascara and 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.210
 ink my eyelashes 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.770
 that's the very first story I have 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.280
 I'll just take it that way 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.620
 vanilla tone and a flat shader bosch 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.840
 from sigma and carry me this under one 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.670
 eyebrow on it i'm sorry i'm 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.960
 extremely tired my voice sounds 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.880
 probably as if I already were 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.830
 ill for three years i hope you 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.050
 forgive me then I take as 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.420
 next the princess lesch of essens- 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.800
 and ink my eyelashes like that 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.210
 second layer I always do that very much 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.860
 like when you are almost completely 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.180
 are dry because I find somehow 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.100
 that it will be the best product 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.370
 record again, and so I'm doing me 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.320
 the upper and the lower eyelashes and 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.960
 then I also take the bender 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.330
 brush and how a bit black 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.220
 so among mine yes to mine 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.140
 lash line down and then take 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.880
 I am this brilliant brush that is 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.410
 just a very flat off 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.950
 regard, you will have an infobox 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.810
 to link 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.930
 this is really a gigantic pose 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.540
 So you can do that best 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.920
 specifically apply product and here 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.260
 again the very last layer 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.300
 that's from roccat from oskar 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.950
 I believe in the end that's the way it is 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.390
 a check and we make mine again 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.840
 clean eyelids and then I start 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.490
 even with the patrice anglo my 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.110
 Contouring the face I think so 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.920
 product very very good for it 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.300
 just a normal one 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.340
 eyeshadow brush is that i think 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.300
 and how thus control my face 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.230
 and then that is twice as a 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.739
 thicker pension 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:22.260
 so that the whole is good too 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:25.410
 distributed and well used and it 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.610
 that is me then global glow of mac 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.169
 that's actually such a highlighter 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.950
 but I take it on such a big one 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:34.950
 brush up and give media almost mine 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.560

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.130
 at the beginning only with me around and now 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.440
 I became such a big fan of it and 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.440
 then I take the lips in the color 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.180

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.800
