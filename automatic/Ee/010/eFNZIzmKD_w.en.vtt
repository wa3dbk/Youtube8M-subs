00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.320
 our project this time more than being 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.140
 a folder what we call a folder 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.820
 for dispatch from on the table of the 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.519
 good office can serve for 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.770
 office or for anything else that 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:20.480
 another function that we want to always do 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.970
 are seeing that how we are going to cover 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.539
 of paper and in the termination is not going to 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.730
 make a termination that can be used 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.890
 for things with sea water because what 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.020
 that we are going to be able to use it is for 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.569
 eat or for one other thing but everything 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.159
 let's say desktop because we 

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:40.789
 will serve for it we will use 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:43.729
 I cut some pieces cut out in 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:45.050
 dm and to the number also these papers that 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:48.440
 they are of a very special characteristic 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.749
 what is going to give us everything 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.879
 which is the drawing of the folder itself 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:56.839
 from the back we're going to put 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.989
 a few pieces of foami that what they are going to 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.999
 to do is not to slip on the table and 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.489
 We will finish the songs with paint 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.350
 acrylic as now we proceed step to 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.080
 He passed 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.360
 first we will proceed to cut the 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.640
 paper in the right size 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.799
 these are sheets of approximately 50 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.110
 x 70 with which we are going to do it 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.570
 Cut the sheet just in half to 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.840
 to give us a slightly larger size 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.030
 that our piece of dm for this what 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.759
 we do is fold it in half and now 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.830
 with a cutter simply pressing with 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.330
 be careful, then, we will leave our sheet 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.700
 just in the middle 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.830
 we now proceed to do the same with 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.040
 our second role which is the one that 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.930
 we will use to do the other 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.630
 office folder so we'll have two 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.910
 different models and we can choose the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.860
 that we like the most, we do not speak another 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.930
 once in half in this case and we come back 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.590
 to dimension with our cutter to the size 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.429
 suitable 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.549
 now we proceed to paint the songs of 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:03.189
 our pieces in one color is called 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.679
 bronze because it will not give us a 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.830
 silver color of a gold color but it goes 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:11.590
 to be a metallic hue so that 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.110
 give us a sense of elegance but 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.940
 without actually having one big brightness 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.420
 Once we have painted both songs 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.810
 We will continue with our project 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.450
 now we proceed to give a queue for the 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.360
 back of our from our 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.940
 piece of dm the tail that we have taken is 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.280
 white tail just what are we going to 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.380
 do is have two containers one with 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.380
 white tail and another with a little bit of 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.330
 water and what we are going to see is giving 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.610
 first the tail as you see below 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.350
 and with a little bit going down to the tip 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.660
 little water so that it can 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.190
 extend well if we direct it a lot with 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.560
 water the problem is that then it goes away 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.050
 to be all the paper as with small 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.030
 bubbles and if we give it very very thick 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.340
 to extend very badly and you will see 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.130
 through the glue paper then this 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.350
 it's a way for us to stay in your 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.750
 point is to say what we do is with the 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.970
 give the tail and with the water we do it more 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.660
 fluid and in such a way that we stay 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.319
 all of our part of our 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.030
 folder well covered with white glue 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.370
 we finished putting the whole tail well 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.930
 as we have said covering very well all 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.420
 our surface as you see is 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.510
 quite irregular and good now we have 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.879
 than proceed to put the paper 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.519
 decoration in Chinese before it 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.959
 dry this tail but it will not take a long time 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.170
 little bit that is also not necessary 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:36.140
 just run this is now already with 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.299
 hands had a great time for 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.790
 we are perfectly adhered to the 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.310
 paper if necessary because maybe 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.069
 we have some small bubble or something 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.690
 then you can give it with a hand dryer 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:52.640
 to warm the place where it is 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.769
 this little bubble that is fine what 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.540
 let dry well and then we will continue 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.510
 meanwhile we are going to do the same 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.730
 operation with our other folder to 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.129
 do it with the other good color then 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.810
 now we have proceeded the same is to say 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.940
 we have given the tail with a little 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.730
 water as we have seen and we will proceed 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.519
 to put the other paper as they see in the first 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.980
 what we have a series of books 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.289
 that what morel below is our 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.150
 first folder that we have done with the 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.340
 paper and we have simply put these 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.320
 nests to dry the paper with a 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.080
 weight on top that is the same as 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.990
 we will now do with this second with 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.750
 this second folder 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.090
 to accelerate the drying process a 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.610
 Once we have done the other piece we have 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.680
 lifted the books and how can you 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.360
 observe on the left side that no 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.400
 we have passed the dryer as it is 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.110
 still a little rough but where 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.900
 we have passed the dryer because it stays 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.040
 completely stretched and flat this the 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.630
 truth is that it would get some 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.550
 results waiting for another day ' 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.410
 with the weight of the books on top but in 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.390
 end if we want something faster then 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.730
 it's just going to happen to everything 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.590
 a very hot dryer so that it 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.710
 stretch all the paper and we stay 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.420
 perfectly smooth good as we see 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.580
 after I had passed I was 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.450
 already finishing with the dryer has 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.370
 remained a totally smooth surface 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.830
 perfect and now we will simply give the 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.740
 turn around and trim to the edge with a 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.720
 cutter with the cutter giving once 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.430
 we have turned our piece with 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.680
 the cutter and so on the air because this 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.230
 As best we can cut 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.139
 trimming perfectly well the 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.150
 excess edge 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:34.599
 once we have cut all the 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.249
 edges with the cutter thus to the air as os 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.650
 we have taught what we do woods 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:41.319
 with a piece of wood and a small 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.180
 sand a sandpaper that is smooth what is 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:45.460
 called sandpapers of water 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.529
 be wet I just know we're going to 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.330
 go reviewing all our edges well 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:52.590
 in such a way that we have all the 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.550
 perfectly smooth edges 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.810
 that's how our two folders are 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.190
 everything we have done up to 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.590
 now as we said at the beginning 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.260
 we will have to put something now for the 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.960
 back so it does not slip on the 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.090
 table and serve us a reason to leave it 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.940
 protected let's cut then two 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.190
 pieces of rubber eva one for each of 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.850
 our designs and in this way 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.090
 we will finish our effectively our 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.040
 draft 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.050
 to finish our project what 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.820
 We will do is the rubber eva paste it on the underside 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.070
 of our work for this we are going to 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.380
 use a silicone glue 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.900
 liquid that is special for eva rubber 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.120
 and the only thing we will do is apply for 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.669
 the edge and some points in the center and 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.860
 then we can show eva rubber 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.949
 over to finish our 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.139
 I work the same thing with the other 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:46.180
 folder that we were doing once 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:48.520
 that we have glued the eva rubber with our 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.580
 heat gun proceed to the edges 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.380
 that have left and cut us again 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.540
 how we cut the paper is to say with a 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.880
 cutter and in the air in our case the 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.040
 truth is that practically the size 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.889
 it was quite accurate and we're just going to have 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.590
 that maybe go over one or two edges 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:08.300
 As we can see, the rubber eva 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.300
 perfectly attached to the part 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:14.060
 back of our our trays 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.610
 for desktop and let's see now how 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.889
 we are going to be the complete set 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.110
 human in this case as you see has been 

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:23.569
 very well in the back and now if 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:27.289
 we turn around we see how it looks 

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:29.779
 ahead and we'll see now what effect we 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:31.219
 does effectively the two roles as 

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:33.560
 they are very rigid papers or very 

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:35.150
 strong and its use is going to be really like 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.159
 desktop material to put it 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.349
 on the desk because in principle not 

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:41.029
 we are going to fish no varnish if in 

00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:43.400
 some case we want someone 

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:45.139
 put a final varnish to ensure that no 

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.729
 be very bright because the paper itself 

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:48.680
 already has a really nice finish 

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:50.930
 Well that's how we are left 

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:54.400
 our folders for a desk 

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:56.470
 as you see one is a little more serious 

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.810
 of the dark color while that of 

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.699
 reddish brown color it is like more 

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.830
 happy but good in any case I 

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:04.509
 I think it can be perfectly in 

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.520
 any type of desktop is a 

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:09.270
 very nice work and very grateful 

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.270
 I hope you enjoyed
