00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.190
 because of the fallen you can on the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:13.019
 nothing else is scarce 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.910
 today my heart also effective they hybrid 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.160
 understands their yes today is a 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.840
 wonderful day x we have with us all 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.369
 many sunny wonderful share and me 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.869
 because the sun's the yellow sun the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.640
 actually a yellow x games social 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.289
 decide 20 times to get us here 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.550
 an games t shirt to a yellow or if 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.619
 you no I want to apply about this too 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.269
 but I do not wear over kasparek 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.130
 casement I now get millions of euros 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.719
 I guess I'm already today 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.640
 turned up again that's unhealthy 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.930
 Now it's my friends today 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.100
 I'll go to school again today 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.040
 School is a terrible one 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.059
 Nobody wants to invite a scenario 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.620
 Nevertheless , one must persuade and straight 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.640
 when you talk about then freed a 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.530
 but very much the skin is 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.520
 misunderstanding would mean you completely 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.660
 Cold often misunderstandings 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.070
 sometimes there are situations in which 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.120
 I believe that teachers are different 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.800
 Think as a student in the end 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.000
 actually do and I do not think so 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.230
 just not quite sure because 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.670
 I experienced a lot as a student 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.620
 and that's why there are a few now 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.180
 situations that you as a teacher at a 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.500
 as a student expects so confused 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.790
 for you as philipp are already known 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.600
 either because we still have it 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.770
 to go to school or to school 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.060
 You went perhaps there is also 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.260
 five-year- olds still playing the games 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.610
 we have in any case because you 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.560
 This situation is now known 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.150
 occurrences of things the teachers think 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.740
 but students actually do that 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.689
 Have fun with this video and teacher 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.640
 Since please do not be shocked los 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.229
 is the first situation that is the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.700
 rough work will be in groups though 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.470
 again and again, the result is more beautiful 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.060
 class cohesion the students can 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.770
 enjoy working together that there is 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.180
 a nice job must be mistake 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.860
 there is a lively exchange between 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.420
 the student and the weaknesses of each 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.890
 Students become through the strengths of others 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.540
 compensated and there are at the end 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.579
 also a nice result that in the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.100
 teamwork was generated is group work 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.450
 the most beautiful of the world to think of teachers 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.710
 continue to know the truth of goma 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.450
 the same time on difficult roma 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.000
 terribly horny but also completely different 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.229
 start mega cars over 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.780
 Of course not even everything nonsense 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.700
 the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.770
 do not wash and that's all you are 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.790
 does not even have to work properly because that 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.990
 just makes the class cracker the 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.690
 then you also complete the work 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.979
 Gast had noticed this way so 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.900
 Is that her just that is a mega 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.180
 misunderstanding yes as once in 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.950
 I would work as a group teacher 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.649
 Please welcome to the next topic 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.869
 the vocabulary test then become entangled 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.430
 always so and now are wonderful 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.110
 learn the bad vocabulary and 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.310
 yes people can use and if 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.930
 they have learned well then they will 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.370
 rewarded with a good note 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.600
 each student also there's at 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.430
 demo cable test such a great time 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.989
 mood the students are concentrated 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.760
 And that certainly pleases the students 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.500
 fallen in the rain as you can on the 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.030
 The ass does not mean anything else 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.950
 I have nothing but one 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.510
 a stressful night in which you might get the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.800
 learn vocabulary or not yet and 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.300
 That's why you sleep much less 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.100
 gets in the huge gramer as a player 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.540
 already has so little time anyway and then 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.830
 the worst of all everyone knows that 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.180
 Everyone should know , but it is exactly 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.830
 The guy next to a sick one 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.989
 actually wanted to write off so shit 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.140
 that's nothing like here with teachers 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.430
 on lira vocabulary test and how to come to 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.510
 next situation and you see 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.890
 I'm actually quite neutral 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.450
 Observer here I am so very much me 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.780
 just between teacher and student everything 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.160
 clear 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.570
 the next thing is the situation if 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.769
 Teacher looks like no idea about fashion 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.880
 Meeting if someone classroom 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.010
 go for a coffee or something 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.180
 we lay the hot colleagues flat 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.010
 I definitely want to know that 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.120
 the situation when teachers go out the 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.560
 teacher then imagine getting to a 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.299
 certain style work in now 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.709
 class work when the students that 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.360
 are quite hard-working players quite 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.519
 committed more difficult 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.260
 Ruling student has like full learning 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.670
 type who want to learn which are the 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.540
 will certainly do the job 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.940
 I wrote them to the blackboard 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.040
 I have you for my student to 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.450
 So unfortunately it's not completely honest 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.370
 at the teaching out of the classroom out 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.840
 That is always the mega escalation 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.519
 of the year will be paper planes 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.410
 people are being built with demolition 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.209
 paper planes thrown into the sky something 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.049
 By the way, being funny is going to be cell phones 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.700
 is caught up if any 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.560
 Mini-games in demand will be chatted 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.970
 I'll even get stuck 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.910
 The teachers have also laid points like that 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.410
 that felix i am definitely everything 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.030
 just not what you actually did 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.040
 you should do the tasks that is 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.540
 you also think students 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.280
 probably a bit over each other 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.870
 the next thing you know each other 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.159
 That's when teachers are sick teachers 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.510
 do not even think so next is also 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.280
 take my poor students who missed 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.870
 and integral calculation would need that 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.609
 yet you have so much teach yourself 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.049
 a fascinating subject inner world on 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.420
 every case a nice task in the book 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.870
 Choose a nice thing together 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.189
 makes him sure fun fun yes 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.170
 maybe spain fun 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:09.239
 that's because of all students 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.590
 they are not poor party 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.790
 year when the teacher has judge 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.370
 that actually means almost 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.440
 always being free and free means that 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.549
 is incredibly challenging because the familiar 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.959
 I have just arrived from two minutes 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.639
 write down this little christa 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.530
 has come up with the saying of the 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.310
 said the teacher is sick you are 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.810
 was grateful student can apply here also 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.310
 Of course, that the student sure everything 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.810
 well just not the task and gets 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.530
 The last point is class work 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.880
 to prepare 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.320
 they learn to be more like so 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.400
 my games are always very busy 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.750
 We have already determined with simple 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.940
 start before for the class work 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.050
 learn to take the 5 5 weeks, the 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.400
 others and a weekly schedule 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.289
 Create three hours every day 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.180
 different topics first 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.800
 Algebra geometry and the air you have 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.750
 the students up to there describes yes 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.520
 your lessons and they will be in 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.659
 they will meet, yes , against each other 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.580
 because we wait , all the more 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:55.260
 to identify knowledge gaps so that one 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.270
 my work there can be more intensive 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.669
 friends i am not an expert or 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.110
 soja but I believe as a student guide 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.789
 a little different absolutely 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.470
 interrogate each other or that is the case 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:06.240
 is then more in the background 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.530
 I'll tell you something last night 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.240
 one starts to learn I mean is mine 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.800
 best time for why the early beginning 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.880
 not bitter and I mean the last one 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.650
 In the evening you do not have to be tall 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.909
 differently should you please work great man 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.409
 but the whole reads only through the 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.720
 Hartmann to buy that's how it works 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:21.000
 namely, and write a nice 4 - 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.740
 yes running fits so meant to the student 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.940
 yes, and that's just how many games win 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.360
 I would say that the student and 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.099
 teachers so a bit over each other 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.080
 A drift you know what I mean 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.460
 and that's exactly what the video was 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.990
 I hope I liked it when you 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.159
 things seemed familiar or something in 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.629
 Of course, the direction seems first 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.979
 fat comments what you so about it 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.090
 think what you mainz and I hope too 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.620
 that you liked the video or 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.000
 at least entertained and if yes there 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.409
 me a thumbs up very happy I 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.580
 I would have given myself trouble today 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.379
 So be glad if that would take revenge 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.879
 Thank you for that and you are one 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:50.689
 another time you a wonderful now 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:51.860
 day still and prudent people now have to 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:54.250
 yes , I will not hang up this hand 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.250
 do it now too 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.259
 on
