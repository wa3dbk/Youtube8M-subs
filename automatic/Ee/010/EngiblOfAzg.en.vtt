use the turquoise clay by mixing the
clay<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.550> condition<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.180> because<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.450> always

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
clay you condition it because you always

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.330 
clay you condition it because you always
have<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.870> condition<00:00:49.140> polymer<00:00:49.680> clay<00:00:49.829> or<00:00:50.100> you

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
have to condition polymer clay or you

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.160 
have to condition polymer clay or you
can<00:00:50.489> use<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> pasta<00:00:51.059> machine<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.600> mix<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.989> either

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
can use a pasta machine to mix it either

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.189 
can use a pasta machine to mix it either
way<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.590> kneading<00:00:53.010> by<00:00:53.160> hand<00:00:53.750> then<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.930> rolled

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
way just kneading by hand then I rolled

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.500 
way just kneading by hand then I rolled
it<00:00:55.320> out<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> medium<00:00:56.160> thin<00:00:56.430> setting<00:00:56.879> with<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
it out on a medium thin setting with the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.180 
it out on a medium thin setting with the
pasta<00:00:57.840> machine<00:00:57.930> or<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.680> use<00:00:58.829> an<00:00:58.980> acrylic

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
pasta machine or you can use an acrylic

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.209 
pasta machine or you can use an acrylic
rod<00:00:59.520> either<00:00:59.969> way<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> choice<00:01:01.219> yeah

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
of a neutral color to make a cylinder of

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.500 
of a neutral color to make a cylinder of
clay<00:01:06.650> I<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:08.250> took<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.400> ball<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.820> clay<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.330> then

clay I just took a ball of clay and then
rolled<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.049> my<00:01:10.200> work<00:01:10.409> surface<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.189> just

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
rolled it on my work surface and it just

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.920 
rolled it on my work surface and it just
gave<00:01:11.490> me<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.670> nice<00:01:11.850> cylinder<00:01:12.270> how<00:01:12.600> long<00:01:12.750> does<00:01:12.869> it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
gave me a nice cylinder how long does it

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.420 
gave me a nice cylinder how long does it
take<00:01:13.200> before<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.530> gets<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.010> perfect

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
take before it gets to that perfect

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.719 
take before it gets to that perfect
circle<00:01:15.150> there<00:01:15.299> oh<00:01:15.650> yeah<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:17.009> mean<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.400> do<00:01:17.460> you

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
surface and it'll round right out

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.240 
surface and it'll round right out
perfect<00:01:21.750> then<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.500> want<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.740> take<00:01:22.920> small

perfect then you just want to take small

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.899 
perfect then you just want to take small
slices<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:24.119> each<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.290> colors<00:01:25.909> and

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
slices of each one of the colors and

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.890 
slices of each one of the colors and
really<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.600> doesn't<00:01:28.170> matter<00:01:29.060> which<00:01:30.060> which

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
really it doesn't matter which which

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.080 
really it doesn't matter which which
ordered<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.619> think<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.220> looks<00:01:32.430> good<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.850> you

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
ordered I think that looks good to you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.940 
ordered I think that looks good to you
and<00:01:33.329> then<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:34.140> take<00:01:34.290> each<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.829> those

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
and then you just take each one of those

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.170 
and then you just take each one of those
stripes<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.790> adhere<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.750> your<00:01:36.900> cylinder

the raw state you can just adhere it now
I've<00:01:50.369> used<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.670> double-ended<00:01:51.119> knitting<00:01:51.570> needle

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
I've used a double-ended knitting needle

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.300 
I've used a double-ended knitting needle
and<00:01:52.140> that's<00:01:52.470> how<00:01:52.649> I'm<00:01:52.770> going<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.009> make<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
and that's how I'm going to make the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.090 
and that's how I'm going to make the
tube<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:54.360> we're<00:01:54.509> going<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.689> pierce<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.680> center

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
tube so we're going to pierce the center

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.270 
tube so we're going to pierce the center
of<00:01:56.340> our<00:01:57.530> completely<00:01:58.530> covered<00:01:59.689> -<00:02:00.829> and<00:02:01.829> then

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
of our completely covered - and then

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.639 
of our completely covered - and then
scoot<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.909> up<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> knitting<00:02:03.780> needle<00:02:04.140> then

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
scoot it up on the knitting needle then

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.980 
scoot it up on the knitting needle then
you<00:02:04.770> want<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.040> pinch<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.670> ends<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.329> that

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
you want to pinch the ends and that

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.690 
you want to pinch the ends and that
keeps<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.469> ends<00:02:07.740> neat<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.160> tidy<00:02:08.340> okay

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
keeps the ends neat and tidy okay

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.850 
keeps the ends neat and tidy okay
so<00:02:10.330> I'm<00:02:10.450> going<00:02:10.599> to<00:02:10.630> pinch<00:02:10.990> each<00:02:11.260> one<00:02:11.590> of<00:02:11.709> those

so I'm going to pinch each one of those

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.300 
so I'm going to pinch each one of those
ends<00:02:12.520> and<00:02:13.530> then<00:02:14.530> we're<00:02:14.650> going<00:02:14.739> to<00:02:14.830> start<00:02:15.160> using

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
ends and then we're going to start using

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.190 
ends and then we're going to start using
our<00:02:15.580> hands<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.390> work<00:02:16.540> surface<00:02:16.750> and

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
our hands and the work surface and

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.110 
our hands and the work surface and
spread<00:02:17.739> it<00:02:18.130> out<00:02:18.250> across<00:02:18.459> that<00:02:18.940> knitting

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120

getting it into the shape right and so

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.800 
getting it into the shape right and so
we're<00:02:26.530> just<00:02:26.560> gonna<00:02:26.860> as<00:02:27.340> we<00:02:27.880> work<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.300> clay<00:02:28.540> out

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
we're just gonna as we work the clay out

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.040 
we're just gonna as we work the clay out
ready<00:02:29.440> it'll<00:02:29.770> get<00:02:30.010> smaller<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.970> thinner<00:02:31.420> and

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
then it'll come right out

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.840 
then it'll come right out
now<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.200> bake<00:02:50.739> it<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.130> want<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.400> bake<00:02:51.549> it<00:02:51.730> on

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
now to bake it you want to bake it on

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.059 
now to bake it you want to bake it on
some<00:02:52.090> polyester<00:02:52.390> batting<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:53.410> same<00:02:53.650> kind<00:02:53.920> of

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
some polyester batting the same kind of

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.190 
some polyester batting the same kind of
the<00:02:54.459> quilters<00:02:55.120> use<00:02:55.330> now<00:02:55.630> why<00:02:55.780> would<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.049> do

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
the quilters use now why would you do

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.600 
the quilters use now why would you do
that<00:02:56.230> instead<00:02:56.739> of<00:02:56.799> just<00:02:56.920> on<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.220> flat<00:02:57.430> surface

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
that instead of just on a flat surface

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.789 
that instead of just on a flat surface
because<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.239> flat<00:02:58.510> surface<00:02:58.720> we've<00:02:59.500> worked<00:02:59.709> so

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
because a flat surface we've worked so

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.559 
because a flat surface we've worked so
hard<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.250> make<00:03:00.430> this<00:03:00.549> nice<00:03:00.819> and<00:03:01.030> round<00:03:01.239> and

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
hard to make this nice and round and

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.860 
hard to make this nice and round and
then<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.530> would<00:03:02.769> flatten<00:03:03.220> in<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.670> oven<00:03:04.030> so<00:03:04.690> if

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
then it would flatten in the oven so if

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.440 
then it would flatten in the oven so if
you<00:03:05.080> just<00:03:05.350> loop<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:05.799> just<00:03:06.340> like<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:07.150> memory

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
you just loop it just like the memory

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.390 
you just loop it just like the memory
wire<00:03:07.660> shape<00:03:08.080> so<00:03:08.380> it's<00:03:08.530> gonna<00:03:08.650> place<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.130> on

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
wire shape so it's gonna place it on

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.430 
wire shape so it's gonna place it on
batting<00:03:09.880> and<00:03:10.090> then<00:03:10.600> we're<00:03:10.690> gonna<00:03:10.810> bake<00:03:11.019> it<00:03:11.260> as

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
batting and then we're gonna bake it as

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.099 
batting and then we're gonna bake it as
per<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.950> manufacturers<00:03:12.640> directions<00:03:12.850> like<00:03:13.720> 20

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109

minutes<00:03:14.290> at<00:03:14.620> 275<00:03:15.190> degrees<00:03:15.609> it's<00:03:16.420> such<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.570> low

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780

temperature too yeah yeah it won't
affect<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.790> batting<00:03:19.120> at<00:03:19.239> all<00:03:19.450> then<00:03:20.310> magic<00:03:21.310> of

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
affect the batting at all then magic of

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.210 
affect the batting at all then magic of
TV<00:03:21.609> here's<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.090> big<00:03:22.269> one<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:23.410> want<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.040> show<00:03:24.160> you

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
TV here's the big one I want to show you

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.300 
TV here's the big one I want to show you
how<00:03:24.400> easy<00:03:24.670> it<00:03:24.880> is<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.150> cut<00:03:25.390> now<00:03:26.019> coming<00:03:27.010> out<00:03:27.160> of

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
how easy it is to cut now coming out of

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.650 
how easy it is to cut now coming out of
the<00:03:27.370> oven<00:03:27.549> when<00:03:27.730> it's<00:03:27.880> a<00:03:27.940> little<00:03:28.180> warm<00:03:28.359> it'll

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
the oven when it's a little warm it'll

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.330 
the oven when it's a little warm it'll
be<00:03:28.750> even<00:03:28.930> easier<00:03:29.230> than<00:03:29.470> this<00:03:29.769> but<00:03:29.980> this<00:03:30.160> has

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
be even easier than this but this has

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.699 
be even easier than this but this has
been<00:03:30.519> baked<00:03:30.760> for<00:03:30.970> several<00:03:31.359> days<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:32.260> all<00:03:32.530> you

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
been baked for several days and all you

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.430 
been baked for several days and all you
do<00:03:32.859> is<00:03:32.890> take<00:03:33.280> your<00:03:33.430> blade<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:34.350> we're<00:03:35.350> gonna

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
do is take your blade and we're gonna

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.370 
do is take your blade and we're gonna
cut<00:03:35.739> it<00:03:35.769> into<00:03:36.040> six<00:03:36.370> or<00:03:36.609> seven<00:03:36.940> pieces

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
cut it into six or seven pieces

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.810 
cut it into six or seven pieces
hopefully<00:03:38.380> this<00:03:38.560> won't<00:03:38.680> go<00:03:38.859> flying<00:03:39.400> off<00:03:39.760> the

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
hopefully this won't go flying off the

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.569 
hopefully this won't go flying off the
table<00:03:40.239> yeah<00:03:40.840> but<00:03:41.320> just<00:03:41.680> by<00:03:41.859> using<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.370> same

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
table yeah but just by using the same

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.430 
table yeah but just by using the same
blade<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:43.030> we<00:03:43.150> use<00:03:43.390> to<00:03:43.600> trim<00:03:43.870> up<00:03:43.900> our<00:03:44.170> clay

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
blade that we use to trim up our clay

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.500 
blade that we use to trim up our clay
and<00:03:44.799> you<00:03:44.920> just<00:03:45.130> cut<00:03:45.340> around<00:03:45.430> it<00:03:45.760> so<00:03:46.239> then<00:03:46.390> we've

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
and you just cut around it so then we've

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.440 
and you just cut around it so then we've
got<00:03:46.690> our<00:03:46.810> six<00:03:47.049> or<00:03:47.230> seven<00:03:47.530> pieces<00:03:47.829> what's<00:03:48.760> now

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
got our six or seven pieces what's now

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.090 
got our six or seven pieces what's now
why<00:03:49.690> would<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:49.900> you're<00:03:50.260> cutting<00:03:50.620> it<00:03:50.769> so<00:03:50.950> that

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
why would you you're cutting it so that

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.620 
why would you you're cutting it so that
it<00:03:51.190> goes<00:03:51.280> on<00:03:51.489> to<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.730> memory<00:03:52.030> wire<00:03:52.150> easier

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
it goes on to the memory wire easier

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.780 
it goes on to the memory wire easier
well<00:03:53.170> it<00:03:53.739> would<00:03:53.890> go<00:03:54.010> on<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.340> memory<00:03:54.609> wire

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
well it would go on to the memory wire

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.670 
well it would go on to the memory wire
just<00:03:55.090> like<00:03:55.180> this<00:03:55.480> but<00:03:55.750> I<00:03:55.810> wanted<00:03:56.200> to<00:03:56.319> add<00:03:56.440> some
