standard chisel is that when you're
doing<00:00:42.730> a<00:00:43.120> cut<00:00:43.600> like<00:00:43.809> and<00:00:44.020> a<00:00:44.050> half-blind

doing a cut like and a half-blind
dovetail<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.989> chisel<00:00:47.350> won't<00:00:47.530> get<00:00:47.770> into<00:00:48.040> the

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
dovetail the chisel won't get into the

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.630 
dovetail the chisel won't get into the
corner<00:00:48.579> the<00:00:49.360> straight<00:00:49.630> sided<00:00:49.930> chisel<00:00:50.559> so<00:00:51.340> the

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
corner the straight sided chisel so the

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.590 
corner the straight sided chisel so the
the<00:00:51.969> fishtail<00:00:52.420> chisel<00:00:52.870> allows<00:00:53.770> you<00:00:54.040> to<00:00:54.160> pair

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the fishtail chisel allows you to pair

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.889 
the fishtail chisel allows you to pair
into<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:56.200> corner<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:58.329> right<00:00:58.480> now<00:00:58.600> we're<00:00:58.809> going

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
into the corner so right now we're going

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.750 
into the corner so right now we're going
to<00:00:58.989> do<00:00:59.110> is<00:00:59.200> chop<00:00:59.469> away<00:00:59.770> some<00:01:00.039> of<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.190> waste<00:01:00.399> in

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
to do is chop away some of the waste in

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.010 
to do is chop away some of the waste in
this<00:01:00.969> remaining<00:01:01.680> tail<00:01:02.680> opening<00:01:03.930> using<00:01:04.930> the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.020 
this remaining tail opening using the

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.510 
this remaining tail opening using the
one<00:01:05.140> inch<00:01:05.320> chisel<00:01:07.470> because<00:01:08.470> of<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.680> width<00:01:08.920> it

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
one inch chisel because of the width it

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.090 
one inch chisel because of the width it
gives<00:01:09.820> me<00:01:09.970> a<00:01:10.000> good<00:01:10.240> span<00:01:10.660> across<00:01:10.990> here<00:01:11.410> but

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
gives me a good span across here but

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.960 
gives me a good span across here but
you'll<00:01:12.310> notice<00:01:12.520> as<00:01:12.880> I<00:01:13.420> get<00:01:13.630> down<00:01:13.840> into<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.289> cut

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
you'll notice as I get down into the cut

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:34.300 
you'll notice as I get down into the cut
I'm<00:01:15.970> not<00:01:16.390> getting<00:01:16.750> into<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:17.020> corner

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.560 

as<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.520> get<00:01:35.730> into<00:01:35.940> this<00:01:36.060> corner<00:01:36.510> area<00:01:38.510> this<00:01:39.510> is

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
as I get into this corner area this is

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.990 
as I get into this corner area this is
where<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.380> fishtail<00:01:40.770> chisel<00:01:41.220> starts<00:01:41.850> to

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
where the fishtail chisel starts to

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.830 
where the fishtail chisel starts to
become<00:01:42.150> useful<00:01:44.360> I've<00:01:45.360> switched<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
become useful I've switched the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.570 
become useful I've switched the
orientation<00:01:46.440> of<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> board<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.340> I'm<00:01:47.430> no

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
orientation of the board so that I'm no

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.020 
orientation of the board so that I'm no
longer<00:01:47.640> chopping<00:01:48.450> down<00:01:48.600> now<00:01:48.930> I'm<00:01:49.080> pairing<00:01:49.560> as

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
longer chopping down now I'm pairing as

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.300 
longer chopping down now I'm pairing as
I<00:01:51.030> work<00:01:51.240> into<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.630> corner<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:53.460> advantage<00:01:54.090> of

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
I work into the corner the advantage of

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.950 
I work into the corner the advantage of
the<00:01:56.310> fishtail<00:01:56.940> chisel<00:01:57.330> becomes<00:01:57.690> apparent<00:01:59.960> so

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the fishtail chisel becomes apparent so

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.810 
the fishtail chisel becomes apparent so
you<00:02:01.050> can<00:02:01.200> get<00:02:01.380> right<00:02:01.620> into<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> corner<00:02:02.640> with

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
you can get right into the corner with

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.090 
you can get right into the corner with
the<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.660> the<00:02:03.810> tool<00:02:04.760> my<00:02:05.760> larger<00:02:06.240> chisel

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
the with the tool my larger chisel

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.669 
the with the tool my larger chisel
doesn't<00:02:08.100> kick<00:02:08.700> over<00:02:08.880> to<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.209> corner<00:02:09.570> it<00:02:10.410> pulls

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
doesn't kick over to the corner it pulls

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.199 
doesn't kick over to the corner it pulls
away<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.100> doesn't<00:02:11.430> get<00:02:11.580> right<00:02:11.790> into<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
away it doesn't get right into the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.110 
away it doesn't get right into the
interior<00:02:13.050> point<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:14.400> could<00:02:14.640> try<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.910> use<00:02:15.090> a

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
interior point you could try to use a

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.420 
interior point you could try to use a
smaller<00:02:15.510> chisel<00:02:15.990> but<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:16.860> still<00:02:17.100> isn't<00:02:17.250> going

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
smaller chisel but it still isn't going

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.140 
smaller chisel but it still isn't going
to<00:02:17.490> get<00:02:17.670> right<00:02:17.970> into<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.450> corner<00:02:18.780> area<00:02:20.150> that's

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
to get right into the corner area that's

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.090 
to get right into the corner area that's
what<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.570> fishtail<00:02:22.140> chisel<00:02:22.560> allows<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:22.980> to

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
what the fishtail chisel allows you to

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.500 
what the fishtail chisel allows you to
do<00:02:23.280> now<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.360> may<00:02:24.720> prefer<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.670> size<00:02:29.360> with<00:02:30.360> the
