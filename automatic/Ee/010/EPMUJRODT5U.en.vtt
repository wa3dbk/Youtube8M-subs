00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.979 
so I figured I mean what if I tried in
my<00:00:58.020> hair<00:00:58.230> will<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.649> um<00:00:59.420> will<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.629> good<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.870> my

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
hair so whatever I was screwed in anyway

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.500 
hair so whatever I was screwed in anyway
so<00:01:04.250> after<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.280> got<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.519> honey<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.760> got<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> olive

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
so after I got the honey I got the olive

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.149 
so after I got the honey I got the olive
oil<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.070> just<00:01:08.250> um<00:01:09.290> pump<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.650> extra

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
oil and this is just um pump a in extra

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.080 
oil and this is just um pump a in extra
virgin<00:01:11.340> olive<00:01:11.640> oil<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.820> it<00:01:14.820> doesn't

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
virgin olive oil and you can it doesn't

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.520 
virgin olive oil and you can it doesn't
matter<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.420> brand<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:15.990> honestly<00:01:16.439> it

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
really doesn't um I think that any oil

really doesn't um I think that any oil
at<00:01:20.460> all<00:01:20.549> would<00:01:20.790> work<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.090> your<00:01:21.119> hair<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.930> know

Hellmann's<00:02:09.470> light<00:02:09.979> mayonnaise<00:02:10.670> all<00:02:11.300> right<00:02:11.540> so

Hellmann's light mayonnaise all right so
yeah<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.900> downside<00:02:15.530> about<00:02:15.770> using<00:02:16.640> mayonnaise

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
yeah the downside about using mayonnaise

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.750 
yeah the downside about using mayonnaise
is<00:02:17.300> it's<00:02:17.510> very<00:02:17.780> chunky<00:02:18.080> in<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.980> mixture<00:02:19.400> and

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
is it's very chunky in the mixture and

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.229 
is it's very chunky in the mixture and
it's<00:02:19.910> very<00:02:20.180> hard<00:02:20.570> to<00:02:20.900> make<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.800> cream<00:02:22.640> okay

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
it's very hard to make it a cream okay

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.240 
it's very hard to make it a cream okay
so<00:02:23.930> um<00:02:24.890> be<00:02:25.700> very<00:02:25.910> careful<00:02:26.390> with<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.540> okay

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
so um be very careful with that okay

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.930 
so um be very careful with that okay
yeah<00:02:28.250> keep<00:02:28.700> saying<00:02:28.910> okay<00:02:29.120> whatever<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:30.940> what

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
yeah keep saying okay whatever so what

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
the mayonnaise in there mix it in very

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.040 
the mayonnaise in there mix it in very
well<00:02:33.920> but<00:02:34.070> it<00:02:34.280> is<00:02:34.400> very<00:02:34.700> very<00:02:34.910> chunky<00:02:35.540> all

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050

well but it is very very chunky all
right<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.380> it's<00:02:36.470> very<00:02:36.800> hard<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.970> get<00:02:38.060> those

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180
