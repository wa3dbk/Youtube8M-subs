00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.710
 Hi, I am back. Yes, you just can't seem to get rid of me. 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.330
 I have the taste of making a movie. 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:14.330
 So continue to give me those pretty news, I will continue to let them. Today I go to something different, it's not an Easter treat or Christmas stuff 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.830
 You can have all the year round. Especially for those warm summer days. 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.589
 Now I like to have it on a hot summer day. 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.210
 It is ice, who is not? But I will do different things, not just 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.849
 A normal ice cube. 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.649
 Join me today to make some fudge bear ice cubes for me. It tastes great! 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.280
 So what do you need to do? 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.280
 You are a stupid bear 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.850
 Ice cube/cold pole 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.190
 Gummy bear. You can smell the sweetness from 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.380
 I just opened this package 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.380
 They are very smelling. 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.609
 You need an ice tray 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.420
 I only have four because it is very sweet, not what you want. 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.380
 all the time. But believe me 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.820
 On a very hot day, they are fantastic. With your jelly 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.530
 Put them evenly into 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.450
 Your ice cube tray. Do not fill in as "high". 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.790
 Not all is full. 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.980
 Just, so you 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.780
 Use all the soft candy 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.260
 Therefore, 4 ice cubes 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.880
 It was just a pack of gummy bears. Not the most important, I am going to pour 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.880
 lemonade. You can also use Sprite. The reason why we use lemonade or elf is because it is clear, so their freezing 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.659
 Soft candy 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.170
 Really stand up 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.310
 Slowly pour 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.960
 Because, you don't want it to be buzzing and overcurrent. 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.399
 Pop up now 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.820
 Your eyelids 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.999
 Another reason is not filled 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.999
 Soft candy 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.719
 top 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:20.519
 Because your eyelids are not suitable 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.419
 Now we will place them in the freezer and I will tell you when they are ready. 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.919
 Now they have been frozen for just over an hour 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.979
 When you take them out, they are in some flush 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:41.979
 Cold water, don't use too hot water because you don't want to melt. Then they should just slide out like this. 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.549
 , MMMM looks at this 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.439
 How to do it and see. 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.549
 I'll try 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.930
 Yum 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.700
 So please have these at home. They are just delicious 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.589
