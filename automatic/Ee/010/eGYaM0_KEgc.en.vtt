our 2006 kia sedona a/c was glowing warm
there<00:00:04.620> was<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.770> fuse<00:00:05.220> that<00:00:05.250> kept<00:00:05.670> blowing<00:00:06.000> every

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
there was a fuse that kept blowing every

that<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.990> need<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.320> get<00:01:22.860> off<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.700> coil<00:01:23.909> can

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
that you need to get off that coil can

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.060 
that you need to get off that coil can
kind<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.540> stuck<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.110> I'm<00:01:25.409> gently<00:01:25.830> hit<00:01:25.950> it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
kind of be stuck so I'm gently hit it

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.620 
kind of be stuck so I'm gently hit it
with<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.250> hammer<00:01:26.400> or<00:01:26.580> screwdriver<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.330> pry

that<00:01:27.840> thing<00:01:28.049> off<00:01:28.259> once<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.890> get<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> snap

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
that thing off once you get the snap

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.399 
that thing off once you get the snap
ring<00:01:29.490> off<00:01:29.700> above<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.750> an<00:01:30.900> electrical

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
ring off above is an electrical

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.710 
ring off above is an electrical
connection<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.220> couldn't<00:01:32.549> unscrew<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.659> I

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
connection I couldn't unscrew it so I

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.690 
connection I couldn't unscrew it so I
had<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.049> use<00:01:34.200> vice<00:01:34.650> grips<00:01:34.950> here's<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
had to use vice grips here's the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.880 
had to use vice grips here's the
measurement<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> old<00:01:36.540> coil<00:01:36.810> 1.7<00:01:37.560> ohms

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
measurement on the old coil 1.7 ohms

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.819 
measurement on the old coil 1.7 ohms
there's<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.280> short<00:01:38.579> there's<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.570> new<00:01:39.840> part<00:01:40.110> 3.4

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
there's a short there's a new part 3.4

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.139 
there's a short there's a new part 3.4
ohms<00:01:41.509> which<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.689> correct<00:01:43.579> so<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.640> put<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> new

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149
