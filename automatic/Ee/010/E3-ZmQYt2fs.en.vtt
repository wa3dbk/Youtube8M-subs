what Samsung is doing with the TVs about

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.010 
what Samsung is doing with the TVs about
the<00:00:59.190> how<00:00:59.460> they<00:00:59.670> really<00:01:00.030> built<00:01:00.359> at<00:01:00.480> least<00:01:00.510> these

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the how they really built at least these

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.049 
the how they really built at least these
type<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.260> floating<00:01:01.710> stands<00:01:02.219> kind<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.850> where

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
type of floating stands kind of where

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.880 
type of floating stands kind of where
the<00:01:03.629> TVs<00:01:03.960> would<00:01:04.080> now<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> little<00:01:04.439> bit<00:01:04.739> you

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
the TVs would now be a little bit you

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.710 
the TVs would now be a little bit you
can<00:01:05.040> adjust<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> viewing<00:01:05.970> angle<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.479> them<00:01:06.630> you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
can adjust the viewing angle of them you

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.450 
can adjust the viewing angle of them you
can<00:01:06.840> kind<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.080> move<00:01:07.229> them<00:01:07.380> around<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.220> I

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
can kind of move them around on this I

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.429 
can kind of move them around on this I
think<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.760> verge<00:01:08.939> described<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.510> as<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> easel

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
think the verge described it as a easel

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.990 
think the verge described it as a easel
it<00:01:10.770> looks<00:01:10.950> like<00:01:11.070> these<00:01:11.189> TVs<00:01:11.490> are<00:01:11.670> sitting<00:01:11.939> on

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
it looks like these TVs are sitting on

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.399 
it looks like these TVs are sitting on
an<00:01:12.119> easel<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.540> think<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.869> stand<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.200> pretty

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
an easel so I think that stand is pretty

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.660 
an easel so I think that stand is pretty
cool<00:01:13.560> has<00:01:13.799> some<00:01:13.979> really<00:01:14.159> good<00:01:14.250> functionality

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
cool has some really good functionality

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.210 
cool has some really good functionality
to<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.810> Samsung<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.439> also<00:01:16.860> throwing<00:01:17.070> in

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
to it and Samsung is also throwing in

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.510 
to it and Samsung is also throwing in
121<00:01:18.000> 2.2<00:01:18.780> speakers<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.409> these<00:01:19.560> TVs<00:01:19.920> let's<00:01:20.430> be

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
121 2.2 speakers on these TVs let's be

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.740 
121 2.2 speakers on these TVs let's be
honest<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.850> biggest<00:01:21.150> crutch<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.479> TVs

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
honest the biggest crutch of TVs

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.480 
honest the biggest crutch of TVs
nowadays<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.350> really<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> speakers

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
nowadays is really the speakers

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.740 
nowadays is really the speakers

at this year's CES is this really these
TV<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:58.950> kind<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.250> getting<00:01:59.460> their<00:01:59.579> day<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.060> of

TV is kind of getting their day and of

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.819 
TV is kind of getting their day and of
course<00:02:00.750> just<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.380> when<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.619> first

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
course just like in it when you first

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.010 
course just like in it when you first
got<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.219> first<00:02:02.540> high-definition<00:02:03.540> TVs<00:02:03.840> when

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
got the first high-definition TVs when

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.240 
got the first high-definition TVs when
they<00:02:04.079> first<00:02:04.259> launched<00:02:04.530> they<00:02:04.920> were<00:02:04.979> pretty

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
they first launched they were pretty

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.789 
they first launched they were pretty
expensive<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:05.909> well<00:02:06.090> but<00:02:06.990> now<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.500> what

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
expensive as well but now this is what

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.589 
expensive as well but now this is what
we<00:02:07.920> see<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.069> these<00:02:08.220> 4k<00:02:08.580> TVs<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.179> realistically

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
we see in these 4k TVs and realistically

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.270 
we see in these 4k TVs and realistically
I'm<00:02:09.810> probably<00:02:10.200> thinking<00:02:10.530> between<00:02:10.649> 7<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.099> 10

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
I'm probably thinking between 7 to 10

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.920 
I'm probably thinking between 7 to 10
years<00:02:11.520> we'll<00:02:11.970> probably<00:02:12.150> see<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.480> prices<00:02:12.810> come

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
years we'll probably see the prices come

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.340 
years we'll probably see the prices come
