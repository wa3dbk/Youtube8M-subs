00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.459 
seconds it's closer to 12 11 13 seconds
from<00:00:50.460> whenever<00:00:50.789> they<00:00:50.940> hit<00:00:51.090> bid<00:00:51.390> here<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.320> they

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
from whenever they hit bid here so they

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.400 
from whenever they hit bid here so they
are<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.770> fact<00:00:54.320> raising<00:00:55.320> up<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.370> cost<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
are in fact raising up the cost of the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.729 
are in fact raising up the cost of the
item<00:00:58.410> by<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> significant<00:01:00.109> real<00:01:01.109> significant

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
item by a significant real significant

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.969 
item by a significant real significant
price<00:01:02.180> because<00:01:03.180> what<00:01:03.449> they<00:01:03.660> do<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:04.229> they<00:01:04.650> cut

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
price because what they do is they cut

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.940 
price because what they do is they cut
down<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.250> time<00:01:05.960> from<00:01:06.960> bidding<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.619> instead<00:01:07.890> of

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
down the time from bidding so instead of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.980 
down the time from bidding so instead of
giving<00:01:08.159> us<00:01:08.400> an<00:01:08.549> actual<00:01:08.729> 15<00:01:09.240> seconds<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.840> bid

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
giving us an actual 15 seconds of bid

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.550 
giving us an actual 15 seconds of bid
it's<00:01:10.229> maybe<00:01:10.890> closer<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.430> 10<00:01:11.790> seconds<00:01:12.380> this<00:01:13.380> is

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
it's maybe closer to 10 seconds this is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.940 
it's maybe closer to 10 seconds this is
legal<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.479> what<00:01:16.140> they<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.439> promising

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
legal it is not what they are promising

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.450 
legal it is not what they are promising
on<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> website<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.900> I<00:01:18.900> think<00:01:19.500> that's<00:01:20.220> why

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
on the website and I think that's why

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.630 
on the website and I think that's why
I'm<00:01:20.700> documenting<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.130> show

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
I'm documenting it so that I can show

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.320 
I'm documenting it so that I can show
