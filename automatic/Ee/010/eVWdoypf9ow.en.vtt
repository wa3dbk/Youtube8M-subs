00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
like it but it said Paris so I had to

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.270 
like it but it said Paris so I had to
choose<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.220> okay<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.590> let's<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.830> into<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
choose it okay so let's get into the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.920 
choose it okay so let's get into the
kits<00:01:26.520> there<00:01:26.820> was<00:01:26.970> three<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.300> them<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.660> I<00:01:27.720> think

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
kits there was three of them and I think

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.230 
kits there was three of them and I think
it<00:01:28.020> might<00:01:28.280> still<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.370> going<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.700> although<00:01:30.060> by

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
it might still be going on although by

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.820

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.650 
the first one seemed to be more with
like<00:01:34.100> sort<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> Sun<00:01:35.760> feel<00:01:36.120> as<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.540> like

didn't really go for that one and then
the<00:01:39.180> third<00:01:39.330> one<00:01:39.390> seemed<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.260> be<00:01:40.410> dealing<00:01:40.680> more

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.080 
really don't like it because I feel like
it<00:02:58.469> makes<00:02:58.620> me<00:02:58.769> tug<00:02:59.040> on<00:02:59.069> my<00:02:59.189> eyes<00:02:59.400> too<00:02:59.669> much<00:02:59.819> so<00:03:00.030> I

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
it makes me tug on my eyes too much so I

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.839 
it makes me tug on my eyes too much so I
wanted<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.540> try<00:03:00.930> something<00:03:01.290> like<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.340> where

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
wanted to try something like this where

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.849 
wanted to try something like this where
hopefully<00:03:03.689> it<00:03:03.840> just<00:03:03.870> kind<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.290> slides<00:03:04.500> off<00:03:04.680> and

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
hopefully it just kind of slides off and

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.170 
hopefully it just kind of slides off and
I'm<00:03:04.919> not<00:03:05.069> constantly<00:03:05.579> tugging<00:03:05.879> at<00:03:05.939> my<00:03:06.060> eyes

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
I'm not constantly tugging at my eyes

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.369 
I'm not constantly tugging at my eyes
because<00:03:06.389> I<00:03:06.480> feel<00:03:06.659> like<00:03:06.750> it's<00:03:06.930> really<00:03:07.199> messing

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
because I feel like it's really messing

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.379 
because I feel like it's really messing
on<00:03:07.530> my<00:03:07.650> under<00:03:07.859> eye<00:03:07.889> area<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.579> that's<00:03:09.209> why<00:03:09.329> I

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
on my under eye area so that's why I

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.909 
on my under eye area so that's why I
chose<00:03:09.540> this<00:03:09.599> and<00:03:09.959> I'm<00:03:10.019> excited<00:03:10.379> and<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:10.680> hope<00:03:10.799> it

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:10.919 
chose this and I'm excited and I hope it

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.750 
chose this and I'm excited and I hope it
works<00:03:11.129> really<00:03:11.340> well<00:03:11.659> and<00:03:13.040> then<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.069> also<00:03:14.310> got

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
gosh I pull out two different rushes but

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.280 
gosh I pull out two different rushes but
it's<00:03:39.120> because<00:03:39.299> you<00:03:39.389> turn<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.659> on<00:03:39.720> its<00:03:39.900> side<00:03:39.959> and

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
it's because you turn it on its side and

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.509 
it's because you turn it on its side and
it's<00:03:40.409> flat<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:40.709> then<00:03:40.979> you<00:03:41.099> turn<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.459> way

it's flat and then you turn it this way

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.390 
it's flat and then you turn it this way
and<00:03:41.849> it's<00:03:41.970> like<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.870> end<00:03:43.019> of<00:03:43.229> an<00:03:43.349> arrow<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:44.220> I'm

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400
