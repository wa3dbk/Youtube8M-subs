right<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.960> want<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.350> know<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.739> understand

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
right I want to know if you understand

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.709 
right I want to know if you understand
my<00:00:50.280> problem<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> solution<00:00:51.510> for

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
my problem and you have a solution for

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.139 
my problem and you have a solution for
it<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.110> going<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.260> pay<00:00:52.440> off<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.670> that's<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
it it's going to pay off so that's the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.049 
it it's going to pay off so that's the
first<00:00:54.390> big<00:00:54.809> sin<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.250> second<00:00:56.640> one<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
first big sin the second one is a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.720 
first big sin the second one is a
failure<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.899> differentiate<00:00:58.350> yourself<00:00:58.829> if<00:00:59.489> you

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
failure to differentiate yourself if you

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.099 
failure to differentiate yourself if you
don't<00:01:00.030> show<00:01:00.300> them<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.690> there's<00:01:00.899> something

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
don't show them that there's something

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.200 
don't show them that there's something
about<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.770> that's<00:01:02.190> different<00:01:02.399> from<00:01:02.699> all<00:01:03.000> your

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
about you that's different from all your

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.960 
about you that's different from all your
competitors<00:01:04.189> why<00:01:05.189> should<00:01:05.400> they<00:01:05.519> choose<00:01:05.729> you

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
competitors why should they choose you

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.929 
competitors why should they choose you
price<00:01:06.869> well<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:08.220> works<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.580> you're<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> low

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
price well it works if you're the low

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.420 
price well it works if you're the low
price<00:01:09.210> leader<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:09.900> otherwise<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.130> not<00:01:11.220> so

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
price leader but otherwise it's not so

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.280 
price leader but otherwise it's not so
good<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.119> then<00:01:12.299> wheeze<00:01:12.600> into<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.900> second

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
good and then wheeze into a second

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.080 
good and then wheeze into a second
factor<00:01:13.619> which<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:14.010> or<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> third<00:01:14.580> factor<00:01:14.790> which

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
factor which is or a third factor which

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.830 
factor which is or a third factor which
is<00:01:15.500> value<00:01:16.880> differentiators<00:01:17.880> only<00:01:18.540> really

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
is value differentiators only really

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.260 
is value differentiators only really
matter<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.740> they<00:01:19.979> contribute<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> superior

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
matter if they contribute to a superior

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.359 
matter if they contribute to a superior
value<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.890> include<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.340> our

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
value so we have to include in our

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.510 
value so we have to include in our
proposals<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.680> calculation<00:01:25.680> or<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> projection

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
proposals a calculation or a projection

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.340 
proposals a calculation or a projection
of<00:01:26.850> possible<00:01:27.299> return<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.630> investment<00:01:28.229> and

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
of possible return on investment and

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.289 
of possible return on investment and
then<00:01:28.860> link<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.549> those<00:01:29.670> differentiators

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
then link that to those differentiators

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.450 
then link that to those differentiators
what<00:01:30.930> we're<00:01:31.049> saying<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.470> you're<00:01:31.920> getting<00:01:32.220> more

things about us that are unique so those
three<00:01:39.329> are<00:01:39.420> really<00:01:39.570> big<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.380> fourth<00:01:40.770> one<00:01:40.979> is

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
three are really big the fourth one is

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.370 
three are really big the fourth one is
that<00:01:41.189> proposals<00:01:41.850> are<00:01:41.909> often<00:01:42.210> too<00:01:42.509> long<00:01:42.750> too

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
just too much yeah that's a critical one

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.949 
just too much yeah that's a critical one
related<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.160> problem<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.959> not

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
related to that is the problem of not

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.559

number that Darnell Institute found that

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.550

most<00:02:26.340> executives<00:02:26.849> don't<00:02:27.180> read<00:02:27.450> what<00:02:28.349> they<00:02:28.500> do

most executives don't read what they do

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.370 
most executives don't read what they do
is<00:02:28.769> they<00:02:28.890> skim<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:30.420> if<00:02:30.750> we<00:02:30.930> give<00:02:31.170> them<00:02:31.319> a

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
is they skim so if we give them a

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.720 
is they skim so if we give them a
document<00:02:31.890> that's<00:02:32.069> skimmable

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730

where we've highlighted our key points

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.770 
where we've highlighted our key points
then<00:02:35.519> we're<00:02:35.670> likely<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:35.940> get<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.269> key<00:02:36.420> points

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
then we're likely to get the key points

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.570 
then we're likely to get the key points
directly<00:02:37.110> executive<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.860> what<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.190> want<00:02:38.400> them

proposal legs and talk about some of the
things<00:03:47.489> that<00:03:47.549> we<00:03:47.760> can<00:03:47.940> hopefully<00:03:48.450> avoid<00:03:48.780> to

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
things that we can hopefully avoid to

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.370 
things that we can hopefully avoid to
make<00:03:49.560> our<00:03:49.709> proposals<00:03:50.130> more<00:03:50.250> effective<00:03:50.790> and

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
think about what does the client need to

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.960 
think about what does the client need to
