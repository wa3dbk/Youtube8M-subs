00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.379
 well friends today i will tell you 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.050
 how to record video from your screen 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:20.410
 iphone and ipad 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.939
 ipads no other gadgets in 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.770
 In general, work and should also with 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.860
 android but i will show you by example 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.899
 iphone with all this without 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.599
 wires as you can see but also as much as possible 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:33.700
 cheap while the connection goes through 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.559
 Wi-Fi and such a maximum 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.110
 the synchronization system will be the telephone 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.930
 keep in the same room you can 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.030
 watch the screen even in another but 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.949
 You can also watch the phones 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.579
 other people who are directly 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:52.739
 give you your permission in general 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.739
 I think what is seen as it happens and 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.699
 respectively , I have a computer 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.359
 You can also display the screen correctly. 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.329
 connect 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.339
 ipad i mean i connected two at once 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.909
 iphone ipad then everything fits on one 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:10.360
 screen well i think you all will fail 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.920
 I know how many devices you can 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.020
 connect everything will depend on 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.120
 as far as your wi-fi and in general, all 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.230
 this story draws well and now let 's 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:23.650
 the details how to do it so do 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:26.620
 it's pretty simple just to 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.710
 all we have to include it we need to leave 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.600
 program it is called reflector i 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.960
 I'll write a name like this 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.310
 there is no longer on the screen 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.490
 I will write the name you can download 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.380
 directly from the official site 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.180
 so we will have it paid but two 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.560
 weeks there are beta versions you can two 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.380
 weeks to use it for free therefore 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.540
 if you need times to write something down with 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.360
 the screen is basically enough for you 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.550
 beta versions if you want to buy but in 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.780
 Generally it is not so expensive is in 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:02.560
 First, secondly, I think that everyone can 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.020
 enjoy the torrent to help you 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.450
 I will not explain how to do it 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.099
 evolved goal here which means 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.230
 install the program reflector think 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.830
 that no difficulties with this 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.550
 will arise 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.819
 then we run the reflector here with us 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.349
 started well and go accordingly 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.670
 what we need here we have here 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.310
 settings 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.400
 we choose either ipad or some other 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.400
 device here i choose iphone world up to 5 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.470
 iphone you can password your with it not 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:39.489
 I need a password and there is no you 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:41.920
 You can choose the color of the border me too 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.500
 everything is not necessary in general, these are already more 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.400
 detailed settings that can 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.459
 be useful to you 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.080
 look further we had our settings 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.400
 which are generally called as 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.269
 most settings on the Mac 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.550
 teams, we still have these 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.880
 directly building i.e. iphone 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.730
 Well, that is, it's all the same color that 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.209
 you can activate yourself somehow 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.700
 now in order to connect 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.150
 run the reflector on the computer after 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.040
 what 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.269
 on your phone 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.030
 we pull the quick menu with us 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.200
 a macbook appears under the airdrop for everyone 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.910
 and macbook pro 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.100
 Viktor this in my case you can 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.160
 be there will be determined by the computer we 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.290
 Click it instead of an iPhone 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.810
 choose your computer and turn it on 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.840
 video repeat click done and the screen 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.920
 you are displayed on the computer screen 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.920
 in general, that's the whole trick 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.920

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.480
