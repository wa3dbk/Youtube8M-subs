00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 but the proceedings in the following case 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.870
 perhaps still hundreds of Belarus ahead 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.090
 students who are going to fly in the summer 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.759
 us in the work and travel usa program and 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.500
 seems to fly from work with rest 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.599
 each of the young people trusted 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.220
 travel companies for two thousand dollars on 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.439
 today no one can tell where 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.240
 money and whether their employees will return 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.369
 agencies keep silent director on 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:29.880
 communication does not leave the situation tried 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:32.219
 to sort out our correspondents to them 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.899
 promised to travel work and impressions 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.510
 but instead of their teeth just let under 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.100
 eyes of hundreds of students hoping for summer 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.410
 In America, not only to earn extra money 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.210
 rest remained beggars paid by 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.899
 two thousand dollars but the answer came 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.480
 message 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.379
 sorry you were unlucky as an inscription 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.420
 or in a letter 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.280
 refused spoiling cooperate that more 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.079
 embassy students from 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.760
 Belarus only thanks to him we can 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.270
 by which we can be legally 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.460
 and work in the company's office center 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.460
 youth travel which promised 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.320
 unforgettable summer of 2014 crowded all 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.840
 students and everyone got a message from 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.909
 company manager cash back 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.430
 funds will be produced according to 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.119
 contract clause 319 to your bank 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.950
 score 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.930
 find out the reasons for a break up 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.180
 it turns out the travel agency employee say 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.340
 that they don't know where the director is 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.350
 also do not know the situation could clarify 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.330
 his mother she even told young people 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.280
 that son is now overseas us 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.740
 but seeing the camera the woman chose 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.740
 just go and why 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.069
 students say return at least money 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.439
 but under the contract you can do in 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.240
 the half year deadline is October and 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.060
 it is at best a director 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.450
 will appear here that is what you need 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.259
 seem but for money other than 400 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.679
 dollars but this is not specified what will 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.810
 if they spend with us people brought 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.390
 In other agencies seemed accounts on 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.939
 which we transferred the money said it 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.039
 bills are not sponsored ie we are not 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.470
 translated not by the sponsor but in general it 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.840
 black headquarters ie whom we survived 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.700
 transferred money unknown where the money is 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.890
 a decent total of over half a million 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.079
 dollars nobody knows another nuance 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.640
 according to the studio 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.310
 flashed obtaining visas on properties but 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.849
 Here they are looking for work themselves 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.650
 good faith american 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.239
 employers on behalf of the Belarusian 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.430
 companies had to check 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.590
 one of the curators of the ocean that is 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.329
 figure out all the ins and outs of jobs 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.950
 realities of existence of the system 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.170
 salaries and lack of criminal 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.450
 stories but students have a new 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.280
 information American curator canceled 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.769
 cooperation with the Belarusian travel agency 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.450
 because no money either 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.970
 of the students intend to wait patiently 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.319
 suddenly the story will be resolved safely 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.540
 other tired of uncertainty 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.099
 wrote statements and addressed the police 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.510
 besides the youth it turned out that 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.069
 half of job applications up 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.410
 American shores are simply not 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.590

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.600

 but only a part of the amount was not returned to me 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.290
