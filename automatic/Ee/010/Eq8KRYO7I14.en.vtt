not<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.460> bad<00:00:35.700> thing<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.940> not<00:00:36.210> know<00:00:36.360> very<00:00:36.570> much

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
not a bad thing to not know very much

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.240 
not a bad thing to not know very much
about<00:00:36.750> computers<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.559> fact<00:00:37.800> I'm<00:00:37.980> actually

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
about computers in fact I'm actually

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.130 
about computers in fact I'm actually
counting<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.760> your<00:00:39.300> not<00:00:39.450> knowing<00:00:39.660> everything

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
counting on your not knowing everything

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.260 
counting on your not knowing everything
so<00:00:40.590> there<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.070> actually<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.430> point<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.940> people

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
so there is actually a point of people

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.119 
so there is actually a point of people
like<00:00:42.570> me<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.200> basically<00:00:43.590> today's<00:00:43.829> video

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
like me but basically today's video

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.650 
like me but basically today's video
we're<00:00:44.250> gonna<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.460> going<00:00:44.670> all<00:00:44.820> for<00:00:45.059> everything

we're gonna be going all for everything

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.119 
we're gonna be going all for everything
to<00:00:45.750> do<00:00:45.840> with<00:00:45.870> computers<00:00:46.410> explaining<00:00:46.890> all

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
to do with computers explaining all

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.889 
to do with computers explaining all
types<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.579> computers<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.120> if<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.570> ever<00:00:48.719> need

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
types of computers so if you ever need

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.209 
types of computers so if you ever need
to<00:00:49.020> go<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.260> buy<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.410> or<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.890> just<00:00:49.980> want<00:00:50.160> to

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
to go and buy one or you just want to

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.010 
to go and buy one or you just want to
know<00:00:50.340> stuff<00:00:50.640> about<00:00:50.820> computers<00:00:51.329> you'll<00:00:51.809> know

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
know stuff about computers you'll know

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.600 
know stuff about computers you'll know
what<00:00:52.170> you're<00:00:52.260> talking<00:00:52.620> about<00:00:52.710> okay<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.460> we're

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
what you're talking about okay so we're

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.590 
what you're talking about okay so we're
gonna<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.879> covering<00:00:54.030> three<00:00:54.360> different

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
gonna be covering three different

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.760 
gonna be covering three different
categories<00:00:54.750> today<00:00:55.199> we're<00:00:55.410> gonna<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.649> covering

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
categories today we're gonna be covering

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.610 
categories today we're gonna be covering
oh<00:00:56.070> s<00:00:56.399> or<00:00:56.670> operating<00:00:57.149> system<00:00:57.199> memory<00:00:58.199> and

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
oh s or operating system memory and

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.200 
oh s or operating system memory and
speed<00:00:58.980> all<00:00:59.280> very<00:00:59.609> important<00:01:00.000> things<00:01:00.149> that

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
speed all very important things that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.410 
speed all very important things that
will<00:01:00.420> contribute<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.739> buying<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.160> computer

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
will contribute to you buying a computer

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.670 
will contribute to you buying a computer
okay<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.480> let's<00:01:03.690> start<00:01:03.840> with<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> OS<00:01:04.409> or

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
okay so let's start with the OS or

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.070 
okay so let's start with the OS or
operating<00:01:05.280> systems<00:01:05.670> operating<00:01:06.479> systems<00:01:06.810> are

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
operating systems operating systems are

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.260 
operating systems operating systems are
the<00:01:07.530> software<00:01:08.100> side<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.580> computer<00:01:08.939> now

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the software side of the computer now

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.520 
the software side of the computer now
you<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.540> hear<00:01:09.630> software<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.320> hardware

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
you can you hear software and hardware

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.170 
you can you hear software and hardware
quite<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> bit<00:01:11.220> now<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> difference<00:01:12.060> is

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
quite a bit now the difference is

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.149 
quite a bit now the difference is
software<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.049> programming<00:01:13.619> sense<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.040> it

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
software is the programming sense of it

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.640 
software is the programming sense of it
now<00:01:14.760> hardware<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.450> physical<00:01:15.869> sense<00:01:16.110> so

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
now hardware is the physical sense so

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.440 
now hardware is the physical sense so
example<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.310> hardware<00:01:17.700> would<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> hard

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
example of hardware would be a hard

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.310 
example of hardware would be a hard
drive<00:01:18.689> because<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.170> actually

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
drive because you can actually

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.230 
drive because you can actually
physically<00:01:19.860> hold<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.220> now<00:01:20.610> software<00:01:20.970> would<00:01:21.150> be

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
physically hold it now software would be

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.820 
physically hold it now software would be
something<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.570> notepad<00:01:21.900> which<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.530> actually

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
something like notepad which is actually

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.460 
something like notepad which is actually
a<00:01:22.890> program<00:01:23.070> also<00:01:23.820> staying<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> track<00:01:24.990> here

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
a program also staying on the track here

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.749 
a program also staying on the track here
we<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:25.979> three<00:01:26.220> different<00:01:26.340> operating

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
we have three different operating

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.340 
we have three different operating
systems<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.180> are<00:01:27.390> really<00:01:27.659> popular<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
systems that are really popular in the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.560 
systems that are really popular in the
market<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.159> very<00:01:29.490> different<00:01:29.610> users<00:01:30.090> so

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
market but for very different users so

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.569 
market but for very different users so
you<00:01:30.600> got<00:01:30.780> Mac<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.530> got<00:01:31.680> Windows<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.460> call

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
you got Mac you got Windows and you call

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.120 
you got Mac you got Windows and you call
Linux<00:01:33.000> now<00:01:33.630> Mac<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.110> known<00:01:34.619> for<00:01:34.860> being<00:01:35.040> very

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
Linux now Mac is known for being very

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.719 
Linux now Mac is known for being very
expensive<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.090> very<00:01:36.689> very<00:01:36.960> expensive<00:01:37.320> um<00:01:38.159> but

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
expensive a very very expensive um but

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.999 
expensive a very very expensive um but
they're<00:01:39.150> very<00:01:39.329> simple<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.079> use<00:01:40.110> you're

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
they're very simple to use you're

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.170 
they're very simple to use you're
probably<00:01:41.400> you're<00:01:41.549> not<00:01:41.610> gonna<00:01:41.790> get<00:01:41.939> as<00:01:42.030> many

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
probably you're not gonna get as many

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.240 
probably you're not gonna get as many
viruses<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.409> long<00:01:43.619> run<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:44.159> gonna

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
viruses so in the long run it's gonna

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.569 
viruses so in the long run it's gonna
last<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.909> lot<00:01:45.090> longer<00:01:45.680> and<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:47.100> tends<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.430> be

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
last you a lot longer and it tends to be

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.190 
last you a lot longer and it tends to be
a<00:01:47.610> little<00:01:47.820> bit<00:01:47.970> faster<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:48.960> very

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
a little bit faster but that's very

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.990 
a little bit faster but that's very
arguable<00:01:49.590> because<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.340> get<00:01:50.549> very<00:01:50.610> fast

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
arguable because you can get very fast

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.940 
arguable because you can get very fast
Windows<00:01:51.420> 2<00:01:51.630> now<00:01:52.110> Windows<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> lot<00:01:52.680> cheaper

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
Windows 2 now Windows is a lot cheaper

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.710 
Windows 2 now Windows is a lot cheaper
it's<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.490> one<00:01:54.090> tenth<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.570> price

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
it's like one tenth of the price

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.170 
it's like one tenth of the price
sometimes<00:01:55.310> but<00:01:56.310> you're<00:01:56.490> gonna<00:01:56.610> be<00:01:56.880> worrying

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
sometimes but you're gonna be worrying

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.690 
sometimes but you're gonna be worrying
about<00:01:57.210> viruses<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.280> but<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.399> also<00:01:59.549> very

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
about viruses and but it's also very

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.819 
about viruses and but it's also very
customizable<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:00.899> your<00:02:01.049> person<00:02:01.710> that

windows<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.469> way<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.710> go<00:02:04.950> now<00:02:05.430> if<00:02:05.520> you're<00:02:05.640> a

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
windows is the way to go now if you're a

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.700 
windows is the way to go now if you're a
hacker<00:02:05.909> or<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.270> developer<00:02:06.810> then<00:02:07.049> Linux<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
hacker or a developer then Linux is the

hacker or a developer then Linux is the
way<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> go<00:02:08.069> because<00:02:08.160> Linux<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.759> completely

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
way to go because Linux is completely

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.780 
way to go because Linux is completely
free<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:10.319> it's<00:02:10.470> for<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.830> advanced<00:02:11.250> users<00:02:11.580> out

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
free but it's for the advanced users out

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.400 
free but it's for the advanced users out
there<00:02:11.819> ok<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:12.750> next<00:02:12.989> we're<00:02:13.200> going<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.349> be

is sign called a hard drive now most of

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
is sign called a hard drive now most of
you<00:02:19.120> already<00:02:19.209> know<00:02:19.480> this<00:02:19.599> but<00:02:19.810> this<00:02:19.930> is

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
you already know this but this is

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.390 
you already know this but this is
basically<00:02:20.349> where<00:02:20.560> all<00:02:20.739> your<00:02:20.920> files<00:02:21.099> will<00:02:21.370> be

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
basically where all your files will be

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.640 
basically where all your files will be
stored<00:02:21.550> this<00:02:22.540> is<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.720> very<00:02:22.930> old<00:02:23.110> hard<00:02:23.410> drive

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
stored this is a very old hard drive

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.500 
stored this is a very old hard drive
very<00:02:23.890> standard<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.730> I'll<00:02:24.819> be<00:02:24.970> going<00:02:25.150> over<00:02:25.390> the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
very standard and I'll be going over the

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.449 
very standard and I'll be going over the
different<00:02:25.630> types<00:02:25.810> of<00:02:26.110> hard<00:02:26.260> drives<00:02:26.319> in<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.280> few

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
different types of hard drives in a few

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.370 
different types of hard drives in a few
moments<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.209> basically<00:02:28.540> if<00:02:28.900> you're<00:02:29.080> gonna<00:02:29.170> be

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
moments so basically if you're gonna be

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.530 
moments so basically if you're gonna be
a<00:02:29.410> very<00:02:29.650> beginner<00:02:29.950> user<00:02:30.220> 100<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.120> 300

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540

a very beginner user 100 to 300
gigabytes<00:02:31.810> is<00:02:32.110> perfectly<00:02:32.620> fine<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:33.099> won't<00:02:33.280> go

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
gigabytes is perfectly fine you won't go

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.009 
gigabytes is perfectly fine you won't go
over<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.670> if<00:02:34.120> you're<00:02:34.269> thinking<00:02:34.390> maybe<00:02:34.780> I'm

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
over that if you're thinking maybe I'm

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.270 
over that if you're thinking maybe I'm
in<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.200> family<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.680> four<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.040> they're<00:02:36.160> all

in a family of four and they're all

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.009 
in a family of four and they're all
gonna<00:02:36.400> have<00:02:36.489> their<00:02:36.700> own<00:02:36.790> user<00:02:37.000> accounts<00:02:37.510> maybe

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
gonna have their own user accounts maybe

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.380 
gonna have their own user accounts maybe
500<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.800> one<00:02:39.040> terabyte<00:02:39.430> maybe<00:02:39.730> two<00:02:39.910> terabytes

500 to one terabyte maybe two terabytes

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.650 
500 to one terabyte maybe two terabytes
is<00:02:40.569> perfect<00:02:40.989> for<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.470> one<00:02:42.280> terabyte<00:02:42.670> is<00:02:42.849> 1000

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
is perfect for you one terabyte is 1000

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.660 
is perfect for you one terabyte is 1000
gigabytes<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.319> I'll<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.920> probably<00:02:45.340> won't<00:02:45.519> go

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
gigabytes and I'll you probably won't go

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.850 
gigabytes and I'll you probably won't go
over<00:02:45.819> that<00:02:45.910> I<00:02:46.180> have<00:02:46.390> in<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.870> family<00:02:47.230> of<00:02:47.410> four<00:02:47.650> and

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
about 600 gigabytes and we do extreme so

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.039 
about 600 gigabytes and we do extreme so
if<00:02:54.220> you're<00:02:54.340> gonna<00:02:54.489> be<00:02:54.640> like<00:02:54.760> if<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.810> want<00:02:55.959> to

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
if you're gonna be like if you want to

if you're gonna be like if you want to
be<00:02:56.110> safe<00:02:56.380> go<00:02:56.799> with<00:02:56.950> 500<00:02:57.400> gigabytes<00:02:57.700> but<00:02:57.850> if<00:02:57.910> you

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
be safe go with 500 gigabytes but if you

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.490 
be safe go with 500 gigabytes but if you
want<00:02:58.120> to<00:02:58.180> be<00:02:58.239> extra<00:02:58.540> safe<00:02:58.690> go<00:02:58.930> with<00:02:59.080> 1<00:02:59.230> terabyte

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
want to be extra safe go with 1 terabyte

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.320 
want to be extra safe go with 1 terabyte
now<00:03:00.069> there's<00:03:00.220> also<00:03:00.459> do<00:03:00.580> different<00:03:00.760> types<00:03:01.090> of

now there's also do different types of
hard<00:03:01.510> drives<00:03:01.540> this<00:03:02.110> is<00:03:02.319> a<00:03:02.380> standard<00:03:02.769> one<00:03:02.910> not

hard drives this is a standard one not

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.940 
hard drives this is a standard one not
very<00:03:04.120> expensive<00:03:04.630> but<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.349> little<00:03:05.590> bit<00:03:05.680> slower

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
very expensive but a little bit slower

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.130 
very expensive but a little bit slower
they're<00:03:06.640> starting<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.030> use<00:03:07.150> SSDs<00:03:07.690> now<00:03:07.930> or

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
they're starting to use SSDs now or

they're starting to use SSDs now or
solid-state<00:03:08.680> drives<00:03:08.980> which<00:03:09.190> is<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:09.640> much

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.460 
solid-state drives which is so much
faster<00:03:10.060> there<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.840> have<00:03:10.959> no<00:03:11.110> moving<00:03:11.410> parts

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
faster there you have no moving parts

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.589 
faster there you have no moving parts
they're<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.160> lot<00:03:12.370> smaller<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:12.970> they're<00:03:13.360> really

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
they're a lot smaller and they're really

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.300 
they're a lot smaller and they're really
fast<00:03:13.810> but<00:03:14.200> they're<00:03:14.349> more<00:03:14.590> expensive<00:03:14.920> so

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
fast but they're more expensive so

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.410 
fast but they're more expensive so
you're<00:03:15.400> gonna<00:03:15.489> have<00:03:15.610> to<00:03:15.700> decide<00:03:15.970> do<00:03:16.299> I<00:03:16.390> want

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
you're gonna have to decide do I want

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.900 
you're gonna have to decide do I want
lots<00:03:16.959> of<00:03:17.110> space<00:03:17.319> for<00:03:17.349> really<00:03:17.799> cheap<00:03:18.010> or<00:03:18.250> less

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
lots of space for really cheap or less

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.660 
lots of space for really cheap or less
space<00:03:19.180> for<00:03:19.450> more<00:03:19.600> for<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.230> faster<00:03:20.709> hard<00:03:21.430> drive

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
space for more for a faster hard drive

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.699 
space for more for a faster hard drive
or<00:03:21.940> more<00:03:22.540> money<00:03:22.750> so<00:03:23.140> you<00:03:23.230> have<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.440> kind<00:03:23.620> of

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
or more money so you have to kind of

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.280 
or more money so you have to kind of
decide<00:03:24.130> what<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.549> want<00:03:24.940> now<00:03:25.750> another<00:03:26.019> type<00:03:26.230> of

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
decide what you want now another type of

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.289 
decide what you want now another type of
memory<00:03:26.470> is<00:03:26.859> line<00:03:27.040> called<00:03:27.310> Ram<00:03:27.609> now<00:03:27.910> this<00:03:28.120> is

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
memory is line called Ram now this is

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.940 
memory is line called Ram now this is
the<00:03:28.630> cheapest<00:03:29.019> way<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.200> make<00:03:29.500> your<00:03:29.650> computer

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
the cheapest way to make your computer

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.830 
the cheapest way to make your computer
the<00:03:30.160> fastest<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.819> basically<00:03:31.329> stands<00:03:31.660> for

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
the fastest it basically stands for

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.809 
the fastest it basically stands for
random<00:03:32.019> access<00:03:32.530> memory<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.100> it's<00:03:33.310> basically

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
random access memory and it's basically

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.039 
random access memory and it's basically
the<00:03:34.000> memory<00:03:34.239> that<00:03:34.390> your<00:03:34.510> computer<00:03:34.900> will

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
the memory that your computer will

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.440 
the memory that your computer will
access<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.980> run<00:03:36.160> programs<00:03:36.670> so<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.120> more<00:03:37.269> RAM

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
access to run programs so the more RAM

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.059 
access to run programs so the more RAM
you<00:03:37.600> have<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.989> bigger<00:03:38.170> programs<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:38.799> can<00:03:38.890> run

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
you have the bigger programs you can run

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.440 
you have the bigger programs you can run
the<00:03:39.220> faster<00:03:39.609> you<00:03:39.700> can<00:03:39.819> run<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.180> stuff<00:03:40.359> like

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
the faster you can run it and stuff like

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.890 
the faster you can run it and stuff like
that

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
that

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.559 
that
generally<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.560> normal<00:03:41.980> amount<00:03:42.190> for<00:03:42.940> computers

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
generally a normal amount for computers

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.199 
generally a normal amount for computers
is<00:03:43.720> 2<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.049> 4<00:03:44.260> gigabytes<00:03:44.470> of<00:03:44.980> RAM<00:03:45.220> but<00:03:45.970> if<00:03:46.150> you

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
is 2 to 4 gigabytes of RAM but if you

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.150 
is 2 to 4 gigabytes of RAM but if you
want<00:03:46.359> to<00:03:46.420> go<00:03:46.510> higher<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:46.959> you<00:03:47.079> can<00:03:47.200> go<00:03:47.350> 8<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.859> 16

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
want to go higher and you can go 8 to 16

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.520 
want to go higher and you can go 8 to 16
but<00:03:49.030> usually<00:03:49.540> people<00:03:49.569> won't<00:03:50.049> use<00:03:50.139> that<00:03:50.380> much

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
but usually people won't use that much

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.960 
but usually people won't use that much
unless<00:03:50.709> they're<00:03:50.980> doing<00:03:51.190> really<00:03:51.489> really<00:03:51.609> big

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
unless they're doing really really big

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.569 
unless they're doing really really big
programs<00:03:52.480> such<00:03:52.780> as<00:03:52.989> making<00:03:53.739> videos<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.430> stuff

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
programs such as making videos and stuff

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.580 
programs such as making videos and stuff
like<00:03:54.730> that<00:03:54.940> ok<00:03:55.750> so<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.989> very<00:03:56.139> last<00:03:56.170> thing<00:03:56.470> I'm

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
like that ok so the very last thing I'm

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.170 
like that ok so the very last thing I'm
gonna<00:03:56.680> be<00:03:56.859> talking<00:03:57.130> about<00:03:57.190> today<00:03:57.310> is<00:03:57.549> speed

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
gonna be talking about today is speed

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.180 
gonna be talking about today is speed
now<00:03:58.720> it's<00:03:58.989> one<00:03:59.500> of<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.650> most<00:03:59.799> important

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
now it's one of the most important

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.470 
now it's one of the most important
things<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.430> take<00:04:00.639> note<00:04:00.850> of<00:04:00.880> while<00:04:01.180> buying<00:04:01.389> a

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
things to take note of while buying a

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.300 
things to take note of while buying a
new<00:04:01.600> computer<00:04:01.750> or<00:04:02.170> upgrading<00:04:02.799> a<00:04:02.829> new<00:04:02.920> computer

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
new computer or upgrading a new computer

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.090 
new computer or upgrading a new computer
as<00:04:03.459> I<00:04:03.850> just<00:04:04.150> said<00:04:04.359> RAM<00:04:05.200> is<00:04:05.380> the<00:04:05.500> easiest<00:04:05.859> the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
as I just said RAM is the easiest the

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.830 
as I just said RAM is the easiest the
cheapest<00:04:06.519> the<00:04:06.670> fastest<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.269> everything<00:04:07.690> is

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
cheapest the fastest the everything is

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.930 
cheapest the fastest the everything is
Tway<00:04:08.109> to<00:04:08.620> change<00:04:09.130> that<00:04:09.370> so<00:04:09.579> if<00:04:09.670> you<00:04:09.760> have<00:04:09.790> an

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
Tway to change that so if you have an

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.190 
Tway to change that so if you have an
old<00:04:10.060> computer<00:04:10.359> laying<00:04:10.660> around<00:04:10.780> you<00:04:10.989> want<00:04:11.139> to

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
old computer laying around you want to

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.110 
old computer laying around you want to
speed<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.500> up<00:04:11.590> 30<00:04:12.190> or<00:04:12.370> 40<00:04:12.639> bucks<00:04:12.670> you<00:04:12.970> can

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
speed it up 30 or 40 bucks you can

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.340 
speed it up 30 or 40 bucks you can
double<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.510> speed<00:04:13.690> of<00:04:13.840> your<00:04:13.900> computer<00:04:14.079> just

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
double the speed of your computer just

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.440 
double the speed of your computer just
like<00:04:14.650> that<00:04:14.829> with<00:04:15.040> RAM<00:04:15.280> so<00:04:16.030> definitely<00:04:16.329> take

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
like that with RAM so definitely take

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.000 
like that with RAM so definitely take
note<00:04:16.690> of<00:04:16.720> that<00:04:16.840> while<00:04:17.410> buying<00:04:17.620> a<00:04:17.739> new<00:04:17.889> computer

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
note of that while buying a new computer

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.009 
note of that while buying a new computer
now<00:04:18.459> another<00:04:19.329> thing<00:04:19.479> you<00:04:19.570> want<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.720> take<00:04:19.840> note

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
now another thing you want to take note

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.569 
now another thing you want to take note
of<00:04:20.049> is<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.500> processor<00:04:21.100> it's<00:04:21.340> not<00:04:21.459> as

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
of is the processor it's not as

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.399 
of is the processor it's not as
important<00:04:22.090> as<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.300> RAM<00:04:22.450> but<00:04:23.169> every<00:04:23.380> year

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.409 
important as the RAM but every year

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:25.589 
important as the RAM but every year
Intel<00:04:24.099> comes<00:04:24.340> out<00:04:24.490> with<00:04:24.580> a<00:04:24.610> new<00:04:24.789> processor<00:04:25.419> and

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
Intel comes out with a new processor and

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.720 
Intel comes out with a new processor and
they<00:04:25.720> called<00:04:26.020> like<00:04:26.229> the<00:04:26.380> eye<00:04:26.409> 3<00:04:26.950> the<00:04:27.159> eye

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
they called like the eye 3 the eye

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.510 
they called like the eye 3 the eye
five<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.360> i7<00:04:28.960> or<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:29.650> it'll<00:04:29.890> keep<00:04:30.010> on<00:04:30.160> going

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
five the i7 or and it'll keep on going

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.800 
five the i7 or and it'll keep on going
so<00:04:30.700> basically<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.090> higher<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.390> number<00:04:31.420> the

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
so basically the higher the number the

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.290 
so basically the higher the number the
better<00:04:31.930> processor<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:32.740> is<00:04:32.830> i7<00:04:33.730> is<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:33.940> newest

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
better processor it is i7 is the newest

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.970 
better processor it is i7 is the newest
as<00:04:34.480> of<00:04:34.750> now<00:04:34.900> they<00:04:35.380> also<00:04:35.530> measure<00:04:35.860> the

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
as of now they also measure the

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.400 
as of now they also measure the
processor<00:04:36.550> speed<00:04:36.820> with<00:04:37.570> gigahertz<00:04:37.900> which<00:04:38.260> is

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
processor speed with gigahertz which is

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.100 
processor speed with gigahertz which is
basically<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.830> clock<00:04:39.070> speed<00:04:39.340> of<00:04:39.460> the

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
basically the clock speed of the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.420 
basically the clock speed of the
processor<00:04:41.110> so<00:04:41.320> generally<00:04:41.980> two<00:04:42.130> to<00:04:42.250> three

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
processor so generally two to three

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.520 
processor so generally two to three
gigahertz<00:04:42.730> is<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.210> very<00:04:43.450> very<00:04:43.630> best<00:04:43.960> but<00:04:44.470> you

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
gigahertz is the very very best but you

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.560 
gigahertz is the very very best but you
can<00:04:44.650> also<00:04:44.770> get<00:04:44.980> one<00:04:45.040> for<00:04:45.550> smaller<00:04:45.850> laptops<00:04:46.330> or

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
can also get one for smaller laptops or

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.060 
can also get one for smaller laptops or
something<00:04:46.810> like<00:04:46.900> that<00:04:46.960> now<00:04:47.710> another<00:04:47.980> thing

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
something like that now another thing

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.010 
something like that now another thing
that<00:04:48.220> will<00:04:48.460> make<00:04:48.850> a<00:04:48.880> big<00:04:49.240> big<00:04:49.450> difference<00:04:49.660> in

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
that will make a big big difference in

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.560 
that will make a big big difference in
speed<00:04:50.350> is<00:04:50.560> SSD<00:04:51.100> as<00:04:51.220> I<00:04:51.340> said<00:04:51.520> before<00:04:51.850> or<00:04:52.210> flash

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
speed is SSD as I said before or flash

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.930 
speed is SSD as I said before or flash
or<00:04:52.780> whatever<00:04:53.020> you<00:04:53.170> want<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.410> call<00:04:53.560> it

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
or whatever you want to call it

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.160 
or whatever you want to call it
basically<00:04:54.940> it<00:04:55.390> will<00:04:55.600> speed<00:04:55.900> up<00:04:56.020> your<00:04:56.050> computer

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
basically it will speed up your computer

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.190 
basically it will speed up your computer
a<00:04:56.740> lot<00:04:57.070> running<00:04:57.730> your<00:04:58.030> computer<00:04:58.420> on<00:04:58.570> flash<00:04:58.870> is

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
a lot running your computer on flash is

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.680 
a lot running your computer on flash is
like<00:04:59.440> ten<00:04:59.680> times<00:04:59.860> as<00:05:00.130> fast<00:05:00.160> is<00:05:00.580> using<00:05:00.910> a<00:05:01.060> normal

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
like ten times as fast is using a normal

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.000 
like ten times as fast is using a normal
hard<00:05:01.870> drive<00:05:02.050> so<00:05:02.260> if<00:05:02.350> you<00:05:02.440> have<00:05:02.560> in<00:05:02.680> money<00:05:02.860> and

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
hard drive so if you have in money and

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.280 
hard drive so if you have in money and
you<00:05:03.370> don't<00:05:03.550> need<00:05:03.670> the<00:05:03.820> extra<00:05:03.880> space<00:05:04.210> flash<00:05:05.020> is

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
you don't need the extra space flash is

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.870 
you don't need the extra space flash is
the<00:05:05.320> way<00:05:05.530> to<00:05:05.590> go<00:05:05.800> so<00:05:06.400> I<00:05:06.430> guess<00:05:06.610> that<00:05:06.790> concludes

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
the way to go so I guess that concludes

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.470 
the way to go so I guess that concludes
this<00:05:07.180> video

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
this video

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.790

program and I guess that's all from

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.400 
program and I guess that's all from
technology<00:05:11.170> crazy<00:05:11.490> goodbye
