00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
actually tricked itself and if you try

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.920 
actually tricked itself and if you try
to<00:03:21.640> search<00:03:22.510> something<00:03:22.840> on<00:03:23.200> Google<00:03:24.930> sometimes

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
to search something on Google sometimes

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.960 
to search something on Google sometimes
it<00:03:26.290> might<00:03:26.440> not<00:03:26.650> work

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.560 

as<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.060> can<00:03:33.210> see<00:03:34.400> or<00:03:35.400> if<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.150> want<00:03:36.330> to<00:03:36.390> gain

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
as you can see or if you want to gain

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:43.540 
as you can see or if you want to gain
access<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:38.450> you<00:03:39.450> can<00:03:39.690> simply<00:03:40.200> just<00:03:41.540> do

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
access to that you can simply just do

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:56.750 
access to that you can simply just do
this<00:03:47.510> turn<00:03:48.510> type<00:03:48.750> timing<00:03:49.170> right<00:03:49.320> I<00:03:49.380> guess<00:03:55.760> and

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
this turn type timing right I guess and

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.750 
this turn type timing right I guess and
then<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.210> have<00:03:57.420> access<00:03:58.110> to<00:03:58.380> it<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:59.580> only

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
then you have access to it the only

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.730 
then you have access to it the only
reason<00:04:00.120> they<00:04:00.240> do<00:04:00.300> that<00:04:00.450> is<00:04:00.660> cuz<00:04:01.170> they<00:04:01.380> really

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
reason they do that is cuz they really

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.490 
reason they do that is cuz they really
think<00:04:01.950> it's<00:04:02.160> strange<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:03.090> you're<00:04:03.930> trying<00:04:04.410> to

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.560 
think it's strange that you're trying to
confuse<00:04:04.650> Google<00:04:05.310> since<00:04:05.610> google<00:04:06.000> has<00:04:06.150> nothing

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
confuse Google since google has nothing
