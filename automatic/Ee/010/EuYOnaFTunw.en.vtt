 list of 10 animals in danger of 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.940
 extinction of the year 2012 well this what 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.470
 I was watching from a page of

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.500
 of the 10 species of animals that most 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.449
 are in danger of disappearing are the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.470
 endangered species of 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.439
 2012 asian elephant the elephant 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.510
 Asian reaches to measure 310 meters of 

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:02.790
 height and weigh a little less than 6 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.949
 tons the ears of this elephant

 just have a finger or separate with in the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.400
 horn this animal is in danger of 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.259
 extinction due to lack of habitat 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.330
 by deforestation, excessive hunting 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.400
 to get the ivory tusks 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.710
 has also greatly affected the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.479
 survival of this animal the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.430
 main reason that elephants 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.710
 Asians are in danger of extinction 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.780
 is the lack of habitat or deforestation and 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.409
 secondly the excessive hunting since 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.179
 the 10 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.149

 currently there are only 60 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.170
 worldwide copies of the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.289
 which are extinct in vietnam point 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.289
 what
