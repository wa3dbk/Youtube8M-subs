 hello dear friends this 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.090
 extra money around review 0 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.300
 58 0 about 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.310
 firmware 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.319
 40 000 5 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:11.959
 we left a comment about 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.539
 the fact that I did not fully disclose 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:15.739
 all possibilities 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:17.409
 this new firmware 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:20.029
 but on the other hand how can I reveal everything 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.809
 firmware options if i'm not completely 

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:24.119
 tested 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.640
 so maybe I'm wrong he called it 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.640
 with his 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.630
 its quick review of the firmware of us rather 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.400
 some kind of express 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.450
 in the firmware review 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.390
 so once I already put a comment 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.210
 about three points 1 point is 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.350
 concerning 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.600
 no call 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.160
 i.e. reception 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.950
 locked keyboard like 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.060
 carried me a call on the phone 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.050
 Now mother with the help of our beloved 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.400
 Samsung phone with 52 thousand try to do 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.100
 call 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.440
 that's how we will have it all displayed 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 so mid we do completely 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.920
 disabled on the screen you see even does not want 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.310
 to block 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.670
 turn off the screen and 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.670
 dial the number 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.230
 make a call 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.820
 you can answer now we just 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.750
 unlock the keyboard turn off 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.720
 sound can now be answered maktavisha 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.720
 or by tapping the screen 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.640
 this 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.640
 now the second 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.310
 touches the bottom of this part of the screen where 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.159
 we are showing 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:11.119
 most 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:12.290
 unlockable 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.220
 hour program openable 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.950
 programs 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.259
 here you can ask them on construction sites 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:20.349
 percentage if you click on them for a long time then 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.499
 you can see their names that is here in 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.569
 In this case, the message percentage 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.369
 radio boots 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:29.769
 then you can show how displayed 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:30.920
 us player 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.319
 as passed 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.459
 we open 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.459
 any composition 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:43.519
 we started playing we 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:44.829
 we leave 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.109
 and on the main screen we have displayed 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:47.889
 budget 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:49.129
 player 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.219
 unity that is not very convenient because it is impossible 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:53.849
 run using this budget 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.129
 directly 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.509
 forgetting to fully replace 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:59.989
 further there is a full screen this player 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.449
 so everyone will have to press 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:04.280
 by duty 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.170
 by clicking on our menu and call 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.980
 already directly the player itself 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.660
 I would like of course some or 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.879
 double-tap it 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.129
 and so on here now we go donbot disappeared 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.599
 don't scare visit 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.060
 as I said earlier we are present 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.299
 the percentage is fast 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.299
 top contacts 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.069
 these can now 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.069
 see how the call is rejected 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:34.519
 alarm clock 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:35.840
 our alarm clock is in 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.829
 applications clock new signal now 21 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.829
 47 let's set the 48 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.699
 then we are changing here 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.459
 at a very 21 48 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.159
 soon rather soon 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.379
 finished 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.369
 here we go now 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:00.099
 we wait 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.689
 forty-eighth 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:04.979
 minute 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.729
 can bye 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.869
 and climb into the menu to see 

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:11.799
 as I said, we have a kinetic 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.959
 scrolling is not me that is for example when 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.169
 I can not click on the screen 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.459
 move 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.759
 here we have an alarm clock 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.159
 and as many said my background that is necessary 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.189
 turn over 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:25.309
 cell phone percentage to 

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:26.840
 disable alarm 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.539
 that's why we 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.539
 that's their business 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:38.949
 so we turned 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.779
 its us it seems that the repeat signal after 15 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:44.319
 minutes will be 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.319
 we leave 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.309
 Well, actually I think that the alley 

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:53.649
 main features of this firmware if 

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:54.629
 what else 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:56.110
 much will be an opportunity 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.639
 be sure to comment on me 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:58.849
 I will try to remove 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:00.679
 to do this we all thank you
