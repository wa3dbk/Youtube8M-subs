00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
sure I'm you know obviously we haven't

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.799 
sure I'm you know obviously we haven't
decided<00:00:50.280> exactly<00:00:50.549> how<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.179> going<00:00:51.359> to<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.600> but

decided exactly how it's going to be but
the<00:00:51.929> the<00:00:52.199> current<00:00:52.530> thinking<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.479> it<00:00:54.479> was

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690

to accomplish with this series and one

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.580 
to accomplish with this series and one
of<00:04:01.769> them<00:04:01.919> is<00:04:02.129> to<00:04:02.819> create<00:04:03.239> you<00:04:03.900> know<00:04:03.930> we<00:04:04.349> have

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
of them is to create you know we have

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.129 
of them is to create you know we have
drisana<00:04:05.040> station<00:04:05.609> as<00:04:05.819> this<00:04:06.239> sort<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:06.959> cross

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
drisana station as this sort of cross

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.849 
drisana station as this sort of cross
faction<00:04:07.440> bar<00:04:07.919> we<00:04:08.579> really<00:04:08.879> wanted<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.359> make<00:04:09.510> a

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
faction bar we really wanted to make a

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.759 
faction bar we really wanted to make a
fun<00:04:10.859> new<00:04:11.549> zone<00:04:12.239> that<00:04:12.720> Klingons<00:04:13.319> and<00:04:13.560> feds

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
fun new zone that Klingons and feds

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.460 
fun new zone that Klingons and feds
could<00:04:14.069> both<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.639> hangout<00:04:15.419> on<00:04:15.629> and<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.289> run

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
could both a hangout on and and run

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.469 
could both a hangout on and and run
missions<00:04:16.859> from<00:04:17.070> similar<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.209> what<00:04:18.329> we<00:04:18.449> did

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
missions from similar to what we did

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.360 
missions from similar to what we did
with<00:04:18.659> the<00:04:18.840> fair<00:04:19.079> but<00:04:19.199> just<00:04:19.440> on<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.590> grander

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
with the fair but just on a grander

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.939 
with the fair but just on a grander
scale<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:21.329> so<00:04:21.659> we<00:04:22.139> were<00:04:22.409> trying<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.740> figure

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
scale and so we were trying to figure

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.490 
scale and so we were trying to figure
out<00:04:23.010> if<00:04:23.280> that's<00:04:23.520> deep<00:04:23.909> space<00:04:24.210> nine<00:04:24.510> or<00:04:25.020> if<00:04:25.320> it's

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
out if that's deep space nine or if it's

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.740 
out if that's deep space nine or if it's
something<00:04:25.560> related<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.400> deep<00:04:26.610> space<00:04:26.789> 9<00:04:26.969> so

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
something related to deep space 9 so

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.180 
something related to deep space 9 so
that<00:04:28.020> is<00:04:28.169> one<00:04:28.380> of<00:04:28.469> the<00:04:28.529> questions<00:04:28.919> that<00:04:29.010> we're

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
that is one of the questions that we're

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.190 
that is one of the questions that we're
going<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.370> answer<00:04:29.520> where<00:04:29.760> news<00:04:30.330> we're<00:04:31.110> going

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
going to answer where news we're going

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.500 
going to answer where news we're going
to<00:04:31.260> introduce<00:04:31.469> a<00:04:31.740> new<00:04:31.950> zone

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
to introduce a new zone

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.750 
to introduce a new zone
that<00:04:32.990> has<00:04:33.260> mission<00:04:33.800> givers<00:04:34.160> that<00:04:34.520> both

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
that has mission givers that both

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.070 
that has mission givers that both
Klingons<00:04:35.240> and<00:04:35.360> feds<00:04:35.600> are<00:04:35.720> going<00:04:35.840> to<00:04:35.900> be<00:04:36.020> able

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
Klingons and feds are going to be able

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.870 
Klingons and feds are going to be able
to<00:04:36.290> take<00:04:36.500> much<00:04:36.710> probably<00:04:37.010> to<00:04:37.130> space<00:04:37.370> 11<00:04:37.760> that

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
to take much probably to space 11 that

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.170 
to take much probably to space 11 that
