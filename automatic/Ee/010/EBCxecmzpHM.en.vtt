00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.020
 well this video I'm doing for 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.970
 help miami a hummer and anybody 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.970
 that you need it and can not configure 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.879
 I have a copy that is a visit from 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.879
 is 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:28.530
 good first to talk about Pablo Blanco 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.530
 from the American act scene 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.780
 the cadenero 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.780
 it looks below where the antenna that 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.489
 is pointing to the past 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.040
 Now I 'm going to put on the menu so that 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.820
 Ivan with a tango set me 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.820
 and we will notice 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.460
 we press 999 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.630
 and there he is four times nine and I do not 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.730
 I have an insurance yes 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.490
 Thus 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.580
 and down friend goal is to impose 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.840
 Applications 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.840
 back with minutes 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.080
 we press installation 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.630
 the satellite distro done to the side and 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:28.409
 then I have the Amazon's keyboard 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:31.110
 and the one from the past we will see here 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.420
 then back 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.960
 with manu 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.960
 search for 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.619
 look for this 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.190
 do not 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.860
 well here I see the two satellites 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.650
 one of the scarlet and eight for the 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.250
 side by catching him 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.680
 the impasse to the certain 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.470
 but they are going to notice that the signal goes down to 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.120
 Although the signal mark me down 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.710
 channel have told me that it is because 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.460
 only my keys is made 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.460
 past 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.510
 of the Amazon I shit on the signal 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.670
 in case they think I want to give you a signal 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.670
 the snow frequency of the universe 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.990
 50 and good to take several 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.350
 there are several that I have 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.909
 after the good tp you can only 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.489
 you can enter what you look for on the Internet 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.510
 thousands and every time they change the channel 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.379
 they will be changing 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.379
 I have several 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.270
 disabled 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.129
 the polarity put machine type of 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.129
 motor deactivates 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.190
 history with a configurator 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.450
 search 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.450
 in the list of fp 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.760
 I was doing a boy 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.520
 saith the 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.590
 satellite list sorry and wrong grade but 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.030
 that hired to aim well the left 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.030
 of satellites reaches 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.100
 put in f2 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.600
 in the control would be here below 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.250
 efe 2 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.730
 and so I have it 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:38.510
 type of connection and salt 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:42.370
 lv 1 before the fixed and lnb feed 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:45.060
 the genre goes out and I move here 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.060
 dual 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.230
 different dual 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.770
 or change to it different and more 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.440
 activate the g20 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.950
 and if you did not see me that's why I have it 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.950
 simple 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:09.080
 and antenna with that they should be 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.080
 have everything without problem 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.980
 there I'm throwing myself back I'm 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.980
 leaving nothing 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.290
 then system I do not know what else they turn 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.290
 brother is put 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.450
 cast 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.150
 I will see it 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.330
 in a very good environment system only to 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.330
 times 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.150
 and it would be the channels that you see 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.660
 there are times that do not appear in green but 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.520
 same look after wait a moment and 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.650
 I'll know 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.620
 It has already happened to me with several channels like 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.979
 the 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:05:00.250
 it looks good free faces are not 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.250
 dug green but it will be equal to the same 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.640
 hd 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.080
 with around 20 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.680
 louis 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.680
 Tuesdays only for the others 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:52.430
 and more I can tell you at least that way you know 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.430
 to help you more 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:06:00.060
 that configuration is chasing 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.060
 and I hope to get there 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:06.069
 to systems
