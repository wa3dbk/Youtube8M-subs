00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.100
 so that it everyone is fatal and 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.500
 we find ourselves for a water level 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.200
 niven hair of course so they are 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.210
 who will be on a blaz farm that 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.650
 will give the loot so the blaze bar 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:59.379
 and the xp so that's really good I 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.940
 broke all the red stone circuit for 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.940
 because I did not want to redo 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.369
 the structure was pretty big so 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.920
 that's it, we'll start from 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.710
 so the button here you can the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.100
 do on their side we know no 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.390
 problem but I did so here a 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.250
 will have stone with a rap and late 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.350
 why repeat was successful because if 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.690
 we put it in the loop 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.610
 by then as we have to do a new 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.160
 plan the firecrackers as we would have life 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.380
 in the life of your presentation 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:34.450
 so to repeat like that until 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:38.140
 there and if they remain friends if that to do 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.850
 one end until it has so that 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.210
 we stop him apart we do not come his 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.330
 Notes 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.770
 that's why it takes a lot 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.420
 a lot of repeaters it can take 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.509
 a lot of cyan delay doing some 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.849
 canoubiers but good at least here we want 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.610
 just pressed a small button and that 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:02:01.030
 do all the work 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:10.539
 we just pressed to tap on his point 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:10.979
 what and sometimes it's in two shots this 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.280
 than 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:22.230
 can you know why where more vic 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:24.799
 here they are all the masters on the 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.799
 last step 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.960
 sorry there is a little long but good 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.430
 have to go through 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:55.410
 so here is for lens needs to give you 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.410
 so that's the crow circuit that's it 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.670
 we 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.860
 risk 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.450
 ok I got faith and 25 repeaters 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.270
 trouble at first notch so here is when 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:22.690
 you will have done that you do like those 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:26.950
 ci have placed two slices of roast 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.950
 then you take a little quick and 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:42.200
 I would like to think that you place out 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:44.420
 lafarge de ralston a little cube ah yes 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.720
 sorry also for the absence of my 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.450
 videos since with the return all that 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.280
 I do not really have much time for 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.170
 videos 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:00.670
 but hey, I do not make a pass that I have 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.670
 the time here at the monitor 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.680
 we were shooting firecrackers here sir circuit 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.970
 on the other hand really very much 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.190
 late we see there the shark is over 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.900
 so I show you how the blast 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.440
 do they have because that's where they can 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.530
 not fall 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.270
 he supports there and that drives them a class 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.660
 because the circuit in young fashion I 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.660
 will reach it 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.280
 is pressed once on the button 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:47.520
 it's not, but it's all right 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:55.169
 that's when we look at that or sell it to 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:05:01.699
 ok actually it was off thin ah I 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:09.830
 see why I'm waiting for cassation 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:14.220
 boss for the cube to be like that 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.820
 it's good circuit era normal step to 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.360
 his offers 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:24.120
 yes then I show myself how the 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:35.610
 modes when he so so repression a 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:40.480
 drummer and a tube before he will fall into 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:42.610
 look like that he'll change his soul 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.110
 it's because there's no such thing 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:49.420
 principle how they fall I'm going 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:53.740
 you will go back up the intimates this 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:57.540
 problem because that in time and if we 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:06:00.880
 do not put this piston the mode escapes 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:07.320
 so it's over it's gone pretty fast 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.320
 we're going to put the mob it's gone on m 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.960
 op 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.130
 I like to calculate 

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:43.689
 so the tutorial is over I hope he 

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:45.999
 you will have pleased I hope you approach 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:48.279
 that you will put comments and that 

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:51.969
 you'll put a little green thumb 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:54.369
 Here it was fatal that I tell you 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:57.789
 a next this adventure rate followed or 

00:06:54.369 --> 00:07:00.089
 a next video what are you going hi 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:00.089
 everybody
