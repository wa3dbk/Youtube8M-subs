00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:09.440
 and this serving fold to see with the 12-pack is used 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.049
 in that door that has something of 30 degrees in the design of your kitchen cabinet or 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.730
 even from 4 to take a look at the first material I will start here looks 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.550

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.050

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:25.539
 and it looks nice 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.939
 I'll show you that opening in the closed door April 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:29.909

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:30.770

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.929
 death without pain and only hinge 

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:38.279
 a hinge as a fan it will generate a soft pan in the opening and 

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:41.300
 in the closing of the door another detail that is interesting year 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.440
 see here we're going to suppose you're just the door for some reason you have 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.800
 want to go 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.039
 take the door 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.729
 or later put like that makes pegassione made do not deny 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:51.699
 look just to see 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.120
 put your finger here 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.070
 took out 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.250
 took the door 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.630
 did the maintenance 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.540
 I'll put 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.430
 were 15 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.409
 I heard the noise 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.249
 and despite all these qualities I've already told you is a super hinge 

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:07.329
 easy to climb 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:09.410
 35mm standard 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.230
 standard you drill in the box 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.960
 here is a criminal justice or know that prison agent that we do 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.980
 the height at which the fuji of dengue is supposed to make another 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.820
 detail that is very interesting 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.180
 you do this installation and often opts for the convenience that it can 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.630
 provide you can win this project 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.380
 and not even pay much more expensive taste too much have the sum of the date 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.270
 seeing here 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.270
 you put the screws that is from here finishes 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.270
 You see these apis teams are very low 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.999
 both the bolts 

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:49.179
 there you see that detail of the fit here looks cool 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.960
 I put the cache 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.620
 super simple practical as it should be the deco looks certainly mt going on 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.819
 my view of this agent 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.019
 there is a certain in the store I spoke with the councilman to do good business you 

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:06.810

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.729
