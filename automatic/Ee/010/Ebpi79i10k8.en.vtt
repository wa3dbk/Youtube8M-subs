most constructed collection yes on a
silhouette<00:00:22.769> level<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.670> wanted<00:00:23.939> things<00:00:24.119> to

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
silhouette level we wanted things to

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.670 
silhouette level we wanted things to
feel<00:00:24.390> long<00:00:24.630> but<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.019> wanted<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.320> feel<00:00:25.529> them

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
feel long but we wanted to feel them

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.950 
feel long but we wanted to feel them
light<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.460> have<00:00:26.970> like<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.180> movement<00:00:27.480> and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
light and have like a movement and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.509 
light and have like a movement and
airiness<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.800> as<00:00:29.010> well

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
airiness to it as well

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.099 
airiness to it as well
then<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.060> started<00:00:30.359> playing<00:00:30.420> with<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.810> idea

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
then we started playing with this idea

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.200 
then we started playing with this idea
of<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.289> path<00:00:31.619> feels<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> bit<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.880> skirt

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
of this path feels like a bit of a skirt

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.970 
of this path feels like a bit of a skirt
but<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:33.630> got<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.930> movement<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.530> pen<00:00:34.770> it's

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
but it's got the movement of a pen it's

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.549 
but it's got the movement of a pen it's
got<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> boyishness<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.030> pen<00:00:36.320> this<00:00:37.320> was

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
got the boyishness of a pen this was

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.310
