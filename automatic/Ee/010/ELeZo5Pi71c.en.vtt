cream developer or any developer I

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.680 
cream developer or any developer I
prefer<00:02:29.260> cream<00:02:29.560> just<00:02:30.010> because<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:31.030> stays<00:02:31.450> in

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.650 
prefer cream just because it stays in
your<00:02:31.720> hair<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.440> it's<00:02:32.710> um<00:02:33.480> similar<00:02:34.480> to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
your hair and it's um similar to

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.260 
your hair and it's um similar to
conditioner<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.500> thickness<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.910> like<00:02:37.120> it

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
conditioner the thickness and I like it

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.710 
conditioner the thickness and I like it
just<00:02:37.300> because<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.870> doesn't<00:02:38.020> drip<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:39.720> that's

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
just because it doesn't drip so that's

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.010 
just because it doesn't drip so that's
what<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:40.960> use<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.710> you<00:02:41.820> will<00:02:42.820> need<00:02:43.210> some<00:02:44.050> gloves

use this product but this product just
makes<00:06:29.310> it<00:06:29.520> feel<00:06:29.970> so<00:06:30.030> much<00:06:30.840> softer<00:06:31.560> and<00:06:32.570> it

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
doesn't give that wire feeling that
