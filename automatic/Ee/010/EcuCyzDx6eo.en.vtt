00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.090
 and with that we welcome you to one 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.820
 another video is about emotion 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.440
 this time for the driver toga from the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.400
 black fans foundry we see the 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.560
 good here already 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.860
 and yes there is a lot to note you 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.930
 should first of all the four tracks 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.620
 split so track 1 blue track 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.420
 2 yellow track 3 purple track 4 why that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.000
 so important is driving on the four 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.620
 Railroads different types of trains 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.090
 So there is a fast train 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.480
 Only allowed to travel then there are 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.610
 a cannon withdrawal and general 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.300
 withdrawal and not to overview 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.930
 to lose 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.030
 I recommend you the addon you see it 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.730
 here also under the basis of the picture 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.440
 You are currently on track 2 where I am 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.899
 in this example 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.940
 there is no train there is safe spot on the 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.070
 s1 arrives on track 3 in the canton of Zug 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.160
 express train and four one 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.450
 withdrawal and yes in any case me 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.610
 Just recommend the addon 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.590
 I should then make it like it 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.690
 So you need the symbols there 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.479
 also completely free to place 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.940
 yes, just go the option in the video 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.159
 we just do not see that parents 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.690
 I only found out afterwards 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.880
 that it will change then we are beautiful 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.320
 have to announce the bigfix on it 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.690
 but leave this too 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.940
 reliable come again very briefly 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.250
 to speak on the abilities of boss 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.900
 So from the driver thurgauer yes the 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.510
 First important skill is the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.299
 so-called impulse grenades we prototype 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.970
 see here on the basis of the picture with the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.490
 two blue areas on the floor and yes 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.080
 nearby games become easy 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.110
 pulled in or 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.580
 players who are in it suffer 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.080
 just hurt and yes you have to 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.700
 go out or you best 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.759
 Of course not to be hit 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.090
 otherwise the delayed siege 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.479
 Bomb which always comes when one can 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.850
 without net train at the start is fixed one 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.310
 players and celebrated on these then 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.070
 so-called delayed siege bombs 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.480
 From you can see it on the skull 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.000
 above a raid frame of this 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.640
 skull and yes the player has then 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.890
 in the best case simply the task from the 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.430
 Raid run out and the bomb 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.769
 nowhere to put them down 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.420
 no interest so yes the thing can 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.469
 also millies meet you should because 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.540
 be a little bit on the ball 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:37.299
 not that at once the whole area 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.670
 the militia with delayed siege 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.140
 bombing is otherwise paved 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.299
 Of course, the fighters have the 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.269
 task in this phase as soon as the 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.909
 Iron Staff Sergeant appears 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.189
 So the cannon net train is at the start 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.599
 to kill this so that the phase 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.189
 as soon as possible is over 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.980
 otherwise we will look now 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.719
 video material from the norman mode 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.549
 Here we already have the bus 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.739
 But it takes time 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.139
 just under three or four minutes 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.939
 longer and nothing new happens 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.519
 That's why I decided to 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:12.069
 just the boss here in normal mode too 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.840
 present are just under five minutes 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.150
 The fight took and you see 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.569
 now here is four, a train arrives 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.939
 so violet were too through and yes 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.829
 You see, I 've got this is not here yet 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.780
 used as I have already mentioned 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.579
 that only then found out that 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.109
 there is such a nice aion but me 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.750
 my bitrix is there too 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:35.709
 pretty much what else 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.199
 important is you have to be in before 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.639
 be clear or have your advice in 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:42.220
 split up two groups 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:45.639
 because after about one and a half two 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.729
 minutes in the fight a train comes on track 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:50.530
 3 and track 4 simultaneously with ads and 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:52.959
 now jump left and right 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.329
 that means you have to have yours there 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.340
 split group 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.900
 and yes, I'll show you then, of course 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.669
 when the time comes right here we see 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.340
 now the delayed siege bomb 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:06.540
 exactly on Jurassic and you see how the 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.540
 Farewell beautiful on the cannon withdrawal 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.150
 focus more or less and 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.209
 yes , two is now going through in train 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.389
 So we are at blue track one 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.090
 just offered it ourselves and yes same 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:25.690
 three at yellow now comes with a train 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.550
 ads and you see that I do my tricks 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.350
 So it's all about you 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.840
 yes just be a bit on the ball 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.660
 or to hear your rider 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.280
 otherwise this is a nice fight you 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.090
 should the weapon carriers of the grambker 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.330
 prioritize even if I am here now 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.860
 just the driver toga toga in view 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.920
 or in the target you have 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.930
 really should the WaffentrÃ¤ger 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.480
 Focus because they have the evil 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.730
 property irony bellow and yes 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.260
 This great damage can sometimes 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.660
 deadly someday 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.060
 you see your goal track 2 and 3 is coming 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.680
 each trains with it now drive 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.720
 and you see we also like each other 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.730
 already mentioned divided nicely 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.190
 that means we have now here on the 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.920
 right side group 1 and 3 and on the 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.270
 left side at track 4 is located 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.370
 Group 2 and 4 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.620
 Of course, there has to be a tank here 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.000
 and one or two should be one 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.160
 Of course, be very clear 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.720
 yes otherwise as I said toga rest is 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.140
 useful addon which just shows you 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.640
 when which where which train enters 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.130
 and yes we have the phase here now 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.170
 can survive us now 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.210
 again in the middle orientate on 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.400
 track 1 and 4 now drives a respective 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.150
 fast train through that means we are here 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.770
 on track 2 and 3 absolutely safe on the train 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.050
 one comes in four seconds now 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.250
 next canton train that is the 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.350
 FernkÃ¤mpfer can already look forward to it 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.430
 prepare the canton train 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.540
 or the iron 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.140
 Staff Sergeant to take us days 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.360
 and who has the delayed siege 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.400
 bomb the donzdorf is milli should 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.500
 Of course, go out now and not like that 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.910
 like here with us in the run 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.610
 heroic difficulty level is that 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:13.000
 a bit crass and yes 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:16.190
 just please with the delayed 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.340
 Siege Bomb Get Away From The Minis 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.290
 Drop somewhere and then everything is fine 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.940
 Here comes our death knight again 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.430
 has done her here in lastrup now 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.980
 See that has more or less 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.050
 a part works well 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.910
 respectively one of these apps is 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.180
 still of interest and indeed so that the 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.639
 Fire Healer of the sick who work 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.689
 a so-called 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:44.409
 make lightning and that should be 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:46.810
 just interrupt as dede that still 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:48.909
 I'm just uncertain about that now 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.789
 Track 1 is now going through the same train 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:54.669
 I have to leave now quickly 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:57.699
 and yes otherwise as said biggs shows 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:00.150
 exactly where and when which train 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:03.550
 passes through or stops 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.840
 otherwise toga it is my tip here 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.819
 it shows you that a bit 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.590
 Visually to the tanks is natural 

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:10.389
 put on fire very important 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:14.169
 There must then be regular simple 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:16.389
 change so that you say 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:19.509
 I do not hurt the fire of 

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:22.120
 the brand continued increasingly easy it 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:24.189
 by the way our last patch but we 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:28.389
 We decided to kill the boss 

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:30.610
 has only 800,000 life points and 

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:34.240
 You see her elementary again here 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:36.009
 start bonus booty and the good driver 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.589
 toga is there and as I said in the 

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:40.330
 heroic difficulty level is that 

00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:42.099
 exactly the same, it's only three 

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.500
 or four minutes longer 

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:46.419
 and yes, thank you at this point 

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.680
 with you for your attention i 

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:50.740
 thank you for my money 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:54.479
 beauty from july to terror and say to 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.479
 soon it makes good pure
