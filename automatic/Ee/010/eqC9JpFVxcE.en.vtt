hand get right in here
there's<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.480> turbo

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.450 

if<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.189> waterlines<00:01:36.700> hooked<00:01:37.060> up<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:39.340> all

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
if the waterlines hooked up it's all

if the waterlines hooked up it's all
pretty<00:01:39.670> crowded<00:01:39.970> in<00:01:40.299> there<00:01:40.509> it's<00:01:40.689> kind<00:01:40.869> of

perforated pipe here or this corrugated
thing<00:01:46.360> here<00:01:46.659> that's<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.490> blow-off<00:01:48.820> valve

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
thing here that's the blow-off valve

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.100 
thing here that's the blow-off valve
recirculation<00:01:50.770> tube<00:01:51.509> kind<00:01:52.509> of<00:01:52.659> ghetto<00:01:52.810> but

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
recirculation tube kind of ghetto but

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.710 
recirculation tube kind of ghetto but
seems<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:53.920> work<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:54.399> holds<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.729> holds<00:01:55.630> the

pressure when it's spenting got the

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.950 
pressure when it's spenting got the
cover<00:02:00.009> off<00:02:00.250> right<00:02:00.490> now<00:02:00.700> just<00:02:01.060> had<00:02:01.539> some<00:02:01.750> fuel

cover off right now just had some fuel

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.889 
cover off right now just had some fuel
leaks<00:02:02.229> earlier<00:02:02.619> I<00:02:02.710> had<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:03.479> bring<00:02:04.479> out<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.659> few

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
leaks earlier I had to bring out a few

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.930 
leaks earlier I had to bring out a few
kings<00:02:05.200> here

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.910 

oil<00:02:09.540> feed<00:02:09.810> lines<00:02:10.190> right<00:02:11.190> there

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.220 

comes<00:02:14.520> from<00:02:14.670> in<00:02:14.940> behind<00:02:15.300> on<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.810> back<00:02:15.990> of<00:02:16.170> the

comes from in behind on the back of the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.410 
comes from in behind on the back of the
block<00:02:16.410> same<00:02:17.130> place<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.459> get<00:02:17.610> my<00:02:17.760> oil<00:02:17.790> pressure

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
block same place I get my oil pressure

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:27.170 
block same place I get my oil pressure
from<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:21.590> it's<00:02:22.590> uh<00:02:24.050> it's<00:02:25.050> pretty<00:02:25.200> much<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:26.180> is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
from and it's uh it's pretty much it is

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.860 
from and it's uh it's pretty much it is
the<00:02:27.390> AEM<00:02:27.750> intake<00:02:28.230> flipped<00:02:28.830> around

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
the AEM intake flipped around

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.380 
the AEM intake flipped around
my<00:02:33.470> original<00:02:34.470> plan<00:02:34.739> was<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.640> course<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:36.180> use

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
my original plan was of course to use

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.800 
my original plan was of course to use
the<00:02:37.069> road<00:02:38.069> race<00:02:38.250> Motorsports<00:02:38.879> short<00:02:39.660> Ram

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
the road race Motorsports short Ram

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.190 
the road race Motorsports short Ram
intake<00:02:40.170> pipe<00:02:40.610> but<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:42.360> will<00:02:42.510> fell<00:02:42.840> through

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
intake pipe but that will fell through

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.550 
intake pipe but that will fell through
as<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.920> AEM<00:02:44.610> pipe<00:02:47.030> would<00:02:48.030> work<00:02:48.299> better<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.959> my

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
as the AEM pipe would work better in my

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.789 
as the AEM pipe would work better in my
case<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:51.200> thought<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.290> would<00:02:52.349> be<00:02:52.470> funny<00:02:52.709> to

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
case so I thought it would be funny to

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.770 
case so I thought it would be funny to
use<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.160> RM<00:02:53.519> pipe<00:02:53.760> didn't<00:02:54.090> work<00:02:54.209> out<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:54.599> way

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
use the RM pipe didn't work out that way

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.000 
use the RM pipe didn't work out that way
so<00:02:55.970> whatever<00:02:56.970> if<00:02:57.239> anybody<00:02:57.510> wants<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.750> buy<00:02:57.930> it

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
so whatever if anybody wants to buy it

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.839 
so whatever if anybody wants to buy it
let<00:02:59.459> me<00:02:59.610> know<00:03:00.080> so<00:03:01.080> that's<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.709> next<00:03:02.610> video
