that's<00:00:18.600> not<00:00:18.810> reasonable<00:00:19.200> like<00:00:19.590> if<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:20.270> have

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
that's not reasonable like if you have

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.269 
that's not reasonable like if you have
too<00:00:21.540> high<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.720> demand<00:00:22.170> for<00:00:22.740> speed<00:00:22.950> of<00:00:23.070> service

or if say you have a staff that you

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.600 
or if say you have a staff that you
think<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.500> would<00:00:28.590> be<00:00:28.680> difficult<00:00:28.860> to<00:00:29.220> train<00:00:29.460> on

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610
