double for gaps however you have to be

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.810 
double for gaps however you have to be

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
slightly careful walls doing this

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.060

because if you're walking too fast Diddy
will<00:01:32.250> disappear<00:01:32.700> off<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.880> screen<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.600> he'll

will disappear off the screen and he'll

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.690 
will disappear off the screen and he'll
jump<00:01:34.110> back<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.740> which<00:01:34.979> means<00:01:35.250> he<00:01:35.430> would<00:01:35.579> be

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
jump back to you which means he would be

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.640 
jump back to you which means he would be
able<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.000> get<00:01:36.689> into<00:01:36.840> goodies<00:01:37.259> out<00:01:37.380> there<00:01:37.560> like

bananas or DK coins but here that's

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.740 
bananas or DK coins but here that's
another<00:01:43.500> interesting<00:01:43.740> trick<00:01:44.540> and<00:01:47.750> another

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
lot of levels and plus he's the other

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.710 
lot of levels and plus he's the other
one<00:02:09.720> who<00:02:09.780> can<00:02:09.929> use<00:02:10.050> items<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.739> hammer

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
one who can use items like this hammer

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.690 
one who can use items like this hammer
now

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
now

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.050 
now
how<00:02:14.569> is<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.930> thinking<00:02:15.620> about<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:16.099> there<00:02:16.910> was<00:02:17.000> a

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
guy on the DK vine forums I think his

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.940 
guy on the DK vine forums I think his
name<00:02:19.640> was<00:02:19.670> Sean<00:02:20.090> but<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:21.560> was<00:02:21.650> one<00:02:21.800> being

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
is a boulder as you're already aware to

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.539 
is a boulder as you're already aware to
get<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.840> boulder<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.319> move<00:03:15.500> forward<00:03:15.829> you<00:03:16.400> have

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
get the boulder to move forward you have

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.330 
get the boulder to move forward you have
that<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.760> DK<00:03:17.390> hanging<00:03:18.079> on<00:03:18.319> one<00:03:18.829> side<00:03:19.160> of<00:03:19.190> the

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
that a DK hanging on one side of the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.949 
that a DK hanging on one side of the
border<00:03:19.670> so<00:03:19.790> that<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:20.060> rolls<00:03:20.239> towards<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:20.720> adds

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
border so that it rolls towards it adds

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.620 
border so that it rolls towards it adds
weight<00:03:21.200> but<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:22.310> have<00:03:22.519> to<00:03:22.700> keep<00:03:22.940> constantly

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
weight but you have to keep constantly

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.900 
weight but you have to keep constantly
moving<00:03:24.019> up<00:03:24.319> the<00:03:24.739> right<00:03:25.069> side<00:03:25.280> of<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.400> boulder

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
moving up the right side of the boulder

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.370 
moving up the right side of the boulder
to<00:03:26.090> shift<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.630> weight<00:03:26.780> over<00:03:26.840> because

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
to shift the weight over because

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.000 
to shift the weight over because
otherwise<00:03:27.650> if<00:03:28.100> you<00:03:29.000> just<00:03:29.380> stay<00:03:30.380> in<00:03:30.590> one<00:03:30.799> place

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
otherwise if you just stay in one place

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.430 
otherwise if you just stay in one place
they're<00:03:31.579> bold<00:03:31.850> then<00:03:32.389> you'll<00:03:32.750> eventually<00:03:33.019> roll

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
they're bold then you'll eventually roll

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.940 
they're bold then you'll eventually roll
underneath<00:03:33.829> it<00:03:34.190> as<00:03:34.430> part<00:03:35.269> of<00:03:35.420> physics<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:36.019> the

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
underneath it as part of physics and the

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.190 
underneath it as part of physics and the
boulder<00:03:37.459> will<00:03:37.609> just<00:03:38.139> come<00:03:39.139> to<00:03:39.319> dead<00:03:39.799> stop<00:03:41.200> so

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
boulder will just come to dead stop so
