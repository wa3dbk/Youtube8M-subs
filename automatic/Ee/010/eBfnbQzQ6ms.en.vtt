start lapse to scroll through until we

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:55.959 
start lapse to scroll through until we
find<00:00:45.220> barometer<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:51.270> there<00:00:52.270> it<00:00:52.390> is

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.900 

we'll<00:00:56.570> hit<00:00:56.719> okay<00:00:57.230> and<00:00:57.440> now<00:00:57.530> we<00:00:58.519> have<00:00:58.760> the

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
we'll hit okay and now we have the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.880 
we'll hit okay and now we have the
weather<00:00:59.090> saying<00:00:59.840> that<00:01:00.050> sunny<00:01:00.440> well<00:01:00.769> we're

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
weather saying that sunny well we're

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.369 
weather saying that sunny well we're
indoors<00:01:01.250> so<00:01:01.550> that's<00:01:01.730> perfect<00:01:02.210> now<00:01:02.449> we're

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
indoors so that's perfect now we're

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.730 
indoors so that's perfect now we're
going<00:01:03.589> to<00:01:03.680> hit<00:01:03.980> OK<00:01:04.850> again<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.479> now<00:01:06.409> we<00:01:06.470> have

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
going to hit OK again and now we have

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.820 
going to hit OK again and now we have
the<00:01:06.860> numbers<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:07.790> what<00:01:08.000> we<00:01:08.119> need<00:01:08.330> to<00:01:08.360> do<00:01:08.630> is<00:01:08.869> set

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
the numbers so what we need to do is set

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.880 
the numbers so what we need to do is set
the<00:01:10.009> numbers<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.420> correct<00:01:11.960> barometric

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
the numbers to the correct barometric

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.270 
the numbers to the correct barometric
pressure<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:13.700> you<00:01:14.570> can<00:01:14.810> change<00:01:15.020> this<00:01:15.409> to

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
pressure and you can change this to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.560 
pressure and you can change this to
metric<00:01:17.210> or<00:01:17.360> imperial<00:01:18.340> so<00:01:19.340> let's<00:01:20.149> say<00:01:20.360> that<00:01:20.390> our

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
metric or imperial so let's say that our

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.990 
metric or imperial so let's say that our
barometric<00:01:21.170> pressure<00:01:21.619> should<00:01:21.950> be<00:01:22.070> set<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.369> 29

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
barometric pressure should be set to 29

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.389 
barometric pressure should be set to 29
and<00:01:23.299> you<00:01:23.570> want<00:01:23.780> to<00:01:23.930> do<00:01:24.110> this<00:01:24.409> let's<00:01:25.009> say<00:01:25.100> twenty

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
and you want to do this let's say twenty

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:26.740 
and you want to do this let's say twenty
nine<00:01:25.549> point<00:01:25.759> seven<00:01:25.970> you<00:01:26.210> want<00:01:26.390> to<00:01:26.509> do<00:01:26.630> this

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
nine point seven you want to do this

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.630 
nine point seven you want to do this
every<00:01:26.960> time<00:01:27.080> you're<00:01:27.920> going<00:01:28.100> to<00:01:28.159> go<00:01:28.310> on<00:01:28.399> a<00:01:28.429> run

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
every time you're going to go on a run

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.310 
every time you're going to go on a run
and<00:01:28.850> try<00:01:28.970> to<00:01:29.060> forecast<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.869> weather<00:01:29.899> while

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
and try to forecast the weather while

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.520 
and try to forecast the weather while
you're<00:01:30.500> out<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:31.399> using<00:01:32.179> a<00:01:32.330> either<00:01:33.020> another

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
you're out so using a either another

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.940 
you're out so using a either another
barometer<00:01:34.220> or<00:01:34.399> using<00:01:35.210> computer<00:01:36.020> is<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.830> way

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
barometer or using computer is the way

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.210 
barometer or using computer is the way
to<00:01:37.009> go<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:37.810> we're<00:01:38.810> going<00:01:38.929> to<00:01:39.020> go<00:01:39.140> up<00:01:39.380> or<00:01:39.619> down<00:01:39.649> to

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
to go so we're going to go up or down to

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.350 
to go so we're going to go up or down to
adjust<00:01:40.479> and<00:01:41.479> we<00:01:41.659> want<00:01:41.869> to<00:01:42.050> go<00:01:42.200> down<00:01:42.850> so<00:01:43.850> you<00:01:43.909> use

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
adjust and we want to go down so you use

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.730 
adjust and we want to go down so you use
stop<00:01:45.380> save<00:01:46.039> to<00:01:46.490> go<00:01:46.640> down<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.300> you<00:01:47.780> start<00:01:48.259> lap

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
stop save to go down and you start lap

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.789 
stop save to go down and you start lap
to<00:01:49.130> go<00:01:49.280> up<00:01:49.550> going<00:01:50.509> to<00:01:50.569> go<00:01:50.720> down<00:01:50.899> to<00:01:53.619> twenty<00:01:54.619> nine

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
to go up going to go down to twenty nine

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.150 
to go up going to go down to twenty nine
you<00:01:54.950> can<00:01:55.130> see<00:01:55.399> how<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.640> works<00:01:59.890> there<00:02:00.890> we<00:02:01.039> are

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
you can see how that works there we are

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.520 
you can see how that works there we are
we'll<00:02:01.459> say<00:02:01.729> we're<00:02:02.090> going<00:02:02.209> to<00:02:02.270> start<00:02:02.479> stop<00:02:03.349> at

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
we'll say we're going to start stop at

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:12.020 
we'll say we're going to start stop at
twenty<00:02:03.830> nine<00:02:03.860> point<00:02:04.250> seven

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.180 

and<00:02:12.270> there<00:02:12.780> we<00:02:12.960> are<00:02:13.550> now<00:02:14.550> we'll<00:02:14.760> hit<00:02:14.970> okay<00:02:15.480> and

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
and there we are now we'll hit okay and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.950 
and there we are now we'll hit okay and
then<00:02:17.190> we<00:02:17.490> can<00:02:17.520> adjust<00:02:17.790> Fahrenheit<00:02:18.570> or<00:02:18.600> Celsius

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
then we can adjust Fahrenheit or Celsius

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.810 
then we can adjust Fahrenheit or Celsius
here<00:02:19.500> also<00:02:19.740> so<00:02:21.650> I'm<00:02:22.650> okay<00:02:23.220> with<00:02:23.250> Fahrenheit

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
here also so I'm okay with Fahrenheit

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.200 
here also so I'm okay with Fahrenheit
and<00:02:24.000> now<00:02:24.330> we<00:02:24.390> are<00:02:24.660> out<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.620> barometer

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
and now we are out of the barometer

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.930 
and now we are out of the barometer
setting<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:28.560> it's<00:02:29.010> been<00:02:29.520> confirmed

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
setting and it is it's been confirmed

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.980 
setting and it is it's been confirmed
and<00:02:30.300> we<00:02:30.720> can<00:02:31.500> click<00:02:32.130> mode<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:33.000> go<00:02:33.150> back<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.630> our

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
and we can click mode to go back to our

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.460 
and we can click mode to go back to our
other<00:02:34.470> options<00:02:35.040> here<00:02:35.310> we<00:02:35.490> have<00:02:35.610> time<00:02:36.440> we<00:02:37.440> can

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
other options here we have time we can

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.820 
other options here we have time we can
also<00:02:37.890> change<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:40.080> put<00:02:40.290> into<00:02:40.590> run<00:02:40.800> mode

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
also change that to put into run mode
