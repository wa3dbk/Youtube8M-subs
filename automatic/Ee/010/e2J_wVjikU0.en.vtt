00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.970
 Yes, now it's my turn 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.820
 christa from gamesload him hello me 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.689
 Greetings and I'll show you here today 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.320
 the bridge builder 2 from helicon media 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.859
 who takes part in the classic bridge peter 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.190
 maybe you know oriented 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.309
 maybe not most of mine 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.860
 about 30 of them know him 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.840
 It has been distinguished by 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.489
 Puzzles and really fun 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.440
 you just could not do anything 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.100
 The same had to be done at the end 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.449
 hold like here you just see mine 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.000
 have bridge construction on the sides 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.820
 so i used one of course 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.550
 focus on car use 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.710
 yes and here you see just has 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.989
 pretty good 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.720
 So let's get the buses 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.140
 Oh no, it comes to cars buses come 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.280
 then sweet that grabs my bridge 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.330
 easy that is not serious 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.350
 load so the first test successfully 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.590
 passed 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.330
 Let's go over the second round 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.280
 now comes 20 tons two buses each 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.119
 ten tons of bus probably and two 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.119
 total employees 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.539
 looks good 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.240
 are there still different camera mode 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:49.560
 For example, to track the bus 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:51.890
 spectators now are compenser critical 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.890
 location 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.350
 The bridge is a few that keeps wonder 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.030
 wonderful 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.430
 I think we can do two more smoothly 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.619
 panzer drive more over it though the 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.489
 pure left part because it looks a bit 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.310
 critical but lisa she stands behind 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.540
 like before, I'm a bit proud 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:19.400
 in my arts 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:27.400
 here is also congratulated me 110 euro 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:36.709
 that's the nasty bargains and 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:39.980
 would like to landscape her in the landscape 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.139
 background a bridge is already so good 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:48.079
 how finished was not very nice 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:49.430
 hard is also the first level down there 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.319
 By the way, you can still for 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.280
 to set the reaction speed ob 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.139
 it's the highest grade ever 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.189
 set so that we do not eternity 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.510
 have to watch 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:00.260
 it would not be a tick faster 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:04.040
 bad but you can not 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:09.379
 all seeds in the picture 2 so achieve 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:12.440
 urban environment over a canal 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:17.420
 we build our bridge 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:20.540
 so the wooden beams I have until first 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.620
 over occupied standard can by the way 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.840
 also look around 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.840
 but only by four to 90 degrees 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.650
 that was nothing I have to go back 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.780
 Such a miracle that does not last there 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.459
 times the support is missing that sees 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:49.049
 bombproof from what do you mean 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:53.260
 I think on so the cars drive over it 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:55.329
 Let the full bars be perfect 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.620
 not the red color irritate that 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:01.150
 Ultimately only brothers most 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.680
 burdened with it 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.870
 that does not mean the thing is the same 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.870
 explodes or summarizes 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.630
 that looks good 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:18.270
 that looks good so we give you 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:22.080
 again the next level above her 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:24.720
 mixed second scenario mixed 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.790
 probably he was also foliage me 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.790
 no idea is mixed 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:37.110
 that can work me sooner 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.110
 but remember 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.960
 that does not seem to work sooner 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.790
 So you could like the stuff on the 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.010
 floor provide still additional stop 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.530
 was not quite there 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.060
 Compliant but you still have some 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:55.180
 one or the other weakness 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:05:00.730
 exploited so we need a classic 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.730
 if that does not hold then vinegar 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.520
 actually it would have been held but 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:11.600
 I 'm sure to make it that way first 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.600
 comes two buses again 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.850
 that looks good to the load is too 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.630
 relatively evenly on both sides like that 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.630
 as I have that 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:34.640
 Passed on this test then you come 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.640
 here 40 tons 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:42.920
 a problem on most of the 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:46.010
 bridge sensations anyway a 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:50.780
 more advanced level in the scenario 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:52.490
 canyons and of course not 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.080
 always smooth in the grutt later two 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.110
 I really have a bit here 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.180
 killed and she withstood a lot though 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:03.590
 you see the little one in the back 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:07.220
 weak point there I am finally 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.200
 made a small mistake at 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.280
 that will come there by train which now 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.280
 do not go well look yourself 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.580
 yes that was s so it can act as bridge builder 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.770
 end up 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:30.840
 all materials go down the drain 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:33.480
 look at picture 2 and try 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.370
 to do better than I wish 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.510
 Greetings from christoph 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.510
 surrounded to team
