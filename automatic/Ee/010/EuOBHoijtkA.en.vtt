00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.050
 This common section Ahlen factory buildings on the gentle already 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.260
 transfer and have our II be happy with a simulated body weight per 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.150
 150 kilo thousand kilometers damaged 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.620
 to really see what the bike can handle 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.090
 until now there are just driving impressions we just wanted more 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.110
 we wanted valid test results 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.610
 we are the first to have tested something like that and now we have them 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.610
 Results will soon complete our other wheels 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.840
 the test result should advise 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.590
 after we have gone through the normal tests at value one thousand 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.260
 Kilometers on hardest cobblestones again this 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.240
 Bike tested 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.850
 and then another time the Team Tears successfully completed 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.080
 Gallen Kost areas have always been very successful now 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.170
 Case the possibility 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.020
 Emma to ride the streets or even Song Costard I have 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.169
 a little bit more here 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:12.240
 flexibility 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.270
 at the fork 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.760
 I have more space not he has her side, the track comes through better 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.139
 but on the seat tube 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:19.519
 the same stability 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.629
 But then goes up narrower and thus have more flexibility 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.629
 because the place also has more freedom that both are against weather wheels 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.980
 can run better and thus have no big advantage the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.980
 competitor 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:36.419
