00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
so most of you might know that usually I

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.400 
so most of you might know that usually I
don't<00:00:57.000> do<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.329> way<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.079> turn<00:00:58.289> it

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
don't do it that way so I just turn it

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.680 
don't do it that way so I just turn it
on<00:00:58.500> but<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.280> much<00:00:59.520> easier<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.000> just<00:01:00.359> do<00:01:00.510> that

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
on but it is much easier to just do that

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.049 
on but it is much easier to just do that
now<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.440> you're<00:01:01.559> also<00:01:01.770> very<00:01:01.980> very<00:01:02.430> lazy<00:01:02.760> in
