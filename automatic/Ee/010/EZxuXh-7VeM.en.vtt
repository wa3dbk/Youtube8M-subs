out which is apparently some type of not
really<00:01:22.530> wireless<00:01:22.920> charging<00:01:23.220> but<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.390> just

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
really wireless charging but you just

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.120 
really wireless charging but you just
place<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.590> just<00:01:25.830> kind<00:01:26.040> of

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
place it on and it's just kind of

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.050 
place it on and it's just kind of
magnetic<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:27.180> there<00:01:28.049> which<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.070> quite

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
magnetic on there which is quite

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.890 
magnetic on there which is quite
interesting<00:01:31.610> let's<00:01:32.610> pull<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.060> cable<00:01:33.360> out<00:01:33.689> so

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
interesting let's pull this cable out so

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.859 
interesting let's pull this cable out so
just<00:01:34.079> kind<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.290> show<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.590> how<00:01:35.750> you<00:01:36.750> would

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
just kind of show you how you would

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.620 
just kind of show you how you would
connect<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.880> ideally<00:01:38.880> when<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.299> finish

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
connect this so ideally when you finish

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.960 
connect this so ideally when you finish
the<00:01:39.750> day<00:01:39.900> off<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.710> already<00:01:41.310> connected<00:01:42.000> to

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
the day off this is already connected to

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.260 
the day off this is already connected to
the<00:01:44.970> wall<00:01:45.180> or<00:01:45.479> your<00:01:45.720> computer<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.119> is

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the wall or your computer and this is

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.330 
the wall or your computer and this is
basically<00:01:48.540> let<00:01:49.500> me<00:01:49.590> take<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.920> off<00:01:50.100> right

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
basically let me take this off right

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.940 
basically let me take this off right
here<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.509> we<00:01:51.600> see<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> suction<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.680> and

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
here so we see the suction on this and

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.950 
here so we see the suction on this and
there's<00:01:53.280> nothing<00:01:53.640> else<00:01:53.790> let's<00:01:54.329> see<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.780> there

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
there's nothing else let's see is there

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.680 
there's nothing else let's see is there
something<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.350> there

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
something on there

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.960 
something on there
No<00:01:57.560> Oh<00:01:57.590> yep<00:01:57.950> there<00:01:58.250> is<00:01:58.370> something<00:01:58.670> on<00:01:58.790> here

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
No Oh yep there is something on here

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.390 
No Oh yep there is something on here
let's<00:01:59.480> take<00:01:59.660> that<00:01:59.840> off<00:01:59.980> so<00:02:00.980> you<00:02:01.070> can<00:02:01.160> see<00:02:01.310> how

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
let's take that off so you can see how

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.490 
let's take that off so you can see how
this<00:02:01.520> works<00:02:01.790> so<00:02:02.000> ideally<00:02:02.690> you<00:02:02.810> put<00:02:03.110> this<00:02:03.260> on

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
this works so ideally you put this on

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.910 
this works so ideally you put this on
your<00:02:03.710> nightstand<00:02:04.310> or<00:02:04.580> wherever<00:02:05.360> you<00:02:05.750> want<00:02:05.990> and

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
your nightstand or wherever you want and

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
very close and there's a thickness so

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.620 
very close and there's a thickness so
it's<00:04:16.890> not<00:04:17.010> all<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:17.280> different<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:18.150> your

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
it's not all that different to your

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.540 
it's not all that different to your
average<00:04:18.930> watch<00:04:19.410> it's<00:04:19.830> of<00:04:19.980> course<00:04:20.160> not<00:04:20.400> gonna

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:20.550 
average watch it's of course not gonna

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.180 
average watch it's of course not gonna
be<00:04:20.670> as<00:04:20.760> thin<00:04:21.030> as<00:04:21.270> some<00:04:22.050> of<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:22.590> watches<00:04:23.010> out

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
be as thin as some of the watches out

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.600 
be as thin as some of the watches out
there<00:04:24.320> but<00:04:25.320> it<00:04:25.440> Sun<00:04:25.590> incredibly<00:04:26.040> heavy<00:04:26.220> and

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
there but it Sun incredibly heavy and

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.100 
there but it Sun incredibly heavy and
it's<00:04:26.820> also<00:04:27.510> not<00:04:27.840> incredibly<00:04:29.420> thick<00:04:30.420> so<00:04:30.990> yeah

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
it's also not incredibly thick so yeah

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.440 
it's also not incredibly thick so yeah
as<00:04:31.230> far<00:04:31.410> as<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.710> some<00:04:32.280> where<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.580> specs<00:04:32.910> go<00:04:33.180> in

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
as far as the some where the specs go in

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.410 
as far as the some where the specs go in
this<00:04:33.690> watch<00:04:34.260> we<00:04:34.830> have<00:04:35.100> a<00:04:35.310> one<00:04:35.700> point<00:04:35.880> six<00:04:36.240> five

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
this watch we have a one point six five

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.080 
this watch we have a one point six five
inch<00:04:36.810> display<00:04:36.990> which<00:04:37.710> is<00:04:37.740> 280<00:04:38.190> by<00:04:38.400> 280<00:04:38.820> and

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
inch display which is 280 by 280 and

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.190 
inch display which is 280 by 280 and
it's<00:04:39.660> actually<00:04:40.200> an<00:04:40.290> IPS<00:04:40.800> LCD<00:04:41.250> display<00:04:42.200> which

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
it's actually an IPS LCD display which

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.320 
it's actually an IPS LCD display which
isn't<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.920> best<00:04:44.160> display<00:04:44.610> out<00:04:44.820> there<00:04:45.120> and

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
isn't the best display out there and

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.480 
isn't the best display out there and
we'll<00:04:45.840> see<00:04:46.050> how<00:04:46.200> that<00:04:46.380> looks<00:04:46.680> later<00:04:47.070> on<00:04:47.280> in

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
we'll see how that looks later on in

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.260 
we'll see how that looks later on in
another<00:04:47.850> video<00:04:48.440> but<00:04:49.640> it's<00:04:50.640> not<00:04:50.820> it's<00:04:51.180> not

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
another video but it's not it's not

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.350 
another video but it's not it's not
gonna<00:04:51.450> be<00:04:51.770> super<00:04:52.770> dense<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:53.520> super<00:04:54.210> high

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
gonna be super dense and super high

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.210 
gonna be super dense and super high
quality<00:04:54.410> like<00:04:55.410> some<00:04:55.590> of<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.770> other<00:04:55.890> smart

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
quality like some of the other smart

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.670 
quality like some of the other smart
watches<00:04:56.400> that<00:04:56.640> will<00:04:56.760> be<00:04:56.850> coming<00:04:57.120> out<00:04:57.180> soon<00:04:57.680> but

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
watches that will be coming out soon but

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.870 
watches that will be coming out soon but
we<00:04:58.770> do<00:04:58.920> have<00:04:59.010> a<00:04:59.130> four<00:04:59.280> hundred<00:04:59.340> million<00:04:59.730> power

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
we do have a four hundred million power

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.370 
we do have a four hundred million power
battery<00:04:59.970> which<00:05:00.450> is<00:05:00.480> better<00:05:00.750> than<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.170> Year

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
battery which is better than the Year
