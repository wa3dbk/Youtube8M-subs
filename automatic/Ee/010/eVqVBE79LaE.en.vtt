00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.079
 it's always bitter for us to lose it against paris 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.629
 the evidence after the 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:15.589
 most 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.550
 stunner that stops 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.259
 of matches without defeat against for example the case of tomorrow night 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.439
 without defeat in the league too 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.800
 worse still in the champions league 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.669
 will have to choose 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.650
 it recovers from 1% in May 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.780
 but very quickly because we have a big game on Wednesday against against 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.059
 monaco we are disappointed because 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:39.560
 but stayed on seven 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.190
 nice series of wins that's fine 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.030
 this complex housing markets 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.830
 paris and marseille in the heart 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.240
 So here is 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.240
 it is a crowned evening where we are disappointed but we did not 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.110
 showing his eyes 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.420
 many things to the aces 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.260
 we know very well that we can do 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.040
 much better than it will not be there it scares the discussions 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.930
 rather not bad 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.930
 our match preparation 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.530
 we arrived an hour before the match and we have people who are supposed to be there 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.550
 to make our work easier and it complicates us 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.610
 so already been brought to the program five minutes of the bourget 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.820
 it fits squaresoft so-called high risk match so 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.210
 but there today 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.060
 as I already told you in college that 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.450
 high risk prisoners 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.550
 trucks left right then on arrival it touches us the the 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.450
 traffic make a detour arriving at 8 o'clock in the present case 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.420
 we have rabies because there are obligations you know well 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.270
 it's by assas that makes us love edge 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.240
 it necessarily puts a little more 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.110
 of febrile tension even if it does not make bad happens on 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.510
 the banks field plan 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.470
 it is true that 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.680
 I would have preferred to have a preparation 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.550
 normal for a month 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.720
 I think we should not focus on fixed dates so on them 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.130
 rather on our course in general of the team the beginning of season I 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.560
 think we can do better 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.470
 there are some games we won a little 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.390
 larache and our content cpe it's not enough we did a good match the 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.119
 President it's encouraging 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.549
 now we have to continue the cars in three races 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.829
 the ranking is always third so 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.609
 with a late match 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.459
 so here are the pages 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.060
 it's the same for the fight 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.509
 in terms of time 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.889
 however a position in the standings but a draw would be dangerous 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.539
 much better deal for me to come in the second half despite 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.939
 we were trying to 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.729
 and the dust dude has not created a lot of opportunities 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.539
 however, access difficulties worrying
