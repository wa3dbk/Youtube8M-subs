00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.520 

this<00:01:31.730> particular<00:01:32.000> aircraft<00:01:32.300> is<00:01:32.780> although

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
this particular aircraft is although

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.370 
this particular aircraft is although
registered<00:01:34.190> in<00:01:34.280> Poland<00:01:34.910> it<00:01:35.120> was<00:01:35.270> built<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.870> by

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
registered in Poland it was built a by

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.260 
registered in Poland it was built a by
Pease<00:01:36.650> a<00:01:36.680> tell<00:01:37.010> as<00:01:37.160> so<00:01:37.340> many<00:01:37.490> were<00:01:37.730> in<00:01:38.000> Poland

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
Pease a tell as so many were in Poland

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.260 
Pease a tell as so many were in Poland
in<00:01:39.170> 1985<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:40.310> it's<00:01:40.460> actually<00:01:40.610> Rosalina

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
in 1985 so it's actually Rosalina

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.200 
in 1985 so it's actually Rosalina
aircraft<00:01:42.190> now<00:01:43.190> don't<00:01:43.400> expect<00:01:43.490> high<00:01:43.880> speed

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
aircraft now don't expect high speed

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.550 
aircraft now don't expect high speed
aerobatic<00:01:44.690> or<00:01:44.780> anything<00:01:44.930> like<00:01:45.080> that<00:01:45.140> but<00:01:45.410> what

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
aerobatic or anything like that but what

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.010 
aerobatic or anything like that but what
will<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:45.980> will<00:01:46.220> see<00:01:46.490> is<00:01:46.700> an<00:01:47.150> extraordinary

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
will you will see is an extraordinary

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.670 
will you will see is an extraordinary
and<00:01:48.470> maneuverable<00:01:50.050> old-fashioned<00:01:51.050> biplane

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
and maneuverable old-fashioned biplane

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.180 
and maneuverable old-fashioned biplane
and<00:01:51.710> even<00:01:52.310> when<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:52.580> was<00:01:52.730> built<00:01:53.030> back<00:01:53.270> in<00:01:53.330> 1946

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
and even when it was built back in 1946

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.680 
and even when it was built back in 1946
the<00:01:55.190> Russians<00:01:55.820> were<00:01:55.940> saying<00:01:56.120> God<00:01:56.330> do<00:01:56.540> we

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
the Russians were saying God do we

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.570 
the Russians were saying God do we
really<00:01:56.900> need<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:57.320> be<00:01:57.410> building<00:01:57.620> old<00:01:57.980> biplanes

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
really need to be building old biplanes

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.330 
really need to be building old biplanes
and<00:01:58.760> I<00:01:58.880> think<00:01:59.120> it<00:01:59.270> was<00:01:59.390> a<00:01:59.420> an<00:02:00.110> intervention<00:02:00.920> by

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
and I think it was a an intervention by

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.240 
and I think it was a an intervention by
none<00:02:02.090> other<00:02:02.120> than<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.540> key<00:02:02.660> to<00:02:02.720> Khrushchev

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
none other than the key to Khrushchev

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.550 
none other than the key to Khrushchev
who<00:02:04.250> actually<00:02:04.490> got<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.240> deal<00:02:05.420> together<00:02:05.870> for

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
who actually got the deal together for

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.010 
who actually got the deal together for
Antonov<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:08.000> finally<00:02:08.390> be<00:02:08.510> able<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.780> get<00:02:08.899> the

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
Antonov to finally be able to get the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.000 
Antonov to finally be able to get the
fabric<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.720> there<00:02:11.990> he<00:02:12.200> is<00:02:12.380> flying<00:02:12.800> a

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
fabric so there he is flying a

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.600 
fabric so there he is flying a
tremendously<00:02:13.940> slow<00:02:14.270> speed
