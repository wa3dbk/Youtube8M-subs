more than that you have to have the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.420 
more than that you have to have the

chemistry you have to we have to be able

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.429 
chemistry you have to we have to be able
to<00:01:35.640> understand<00:01:36.360> each<00:01:36.450> other<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.869> kind<00:01:37.350> of

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
to understand each other and kind of

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.140 
to understand each other and kind of
flow<00:01:37.710> together<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.610> what<00:01:38.759> are<00:01:38.790> some<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.060> the
