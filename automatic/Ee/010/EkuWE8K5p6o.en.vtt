00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello to all and welcome to the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.680
 techno chain you may have it 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.050
 noticed thanks to the arrival of windows 8 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.450
 a new breed of devices arrives on 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.019
 the market with new uses and 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.019
 innovative forms 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.189
 and we are interested in the Chinese manufacturer 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.630
 lenovo that launches these days on the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.000
 market an interesting device a 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.610
 hybrid product a tablet a real 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.629
 keyboard and all this is equipped with the real 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.460
 windows 8 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.730
 it's called the links it's a 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.320
 new product so the tablet links 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.170
 which has the particularity of 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.489
 receive a keyboard so in the form of 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.769
 docking that actually allows 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.690
 to expand the capabilities of the product very 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.829
 easily then particularity of this 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.570
 tablet is that it is a 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.360
 tablet years we push 6 so a 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.189
 tablet rather large format what is 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.570
 interesting to note is that when you 

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:59.670
 take it in hand you'll notice 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.470
 really his weight which is very very 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.809
 light compared to what exists on the 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.390
 market today in terms of weight on 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.250
 is on a little less than 600 grams this 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.720
 which is just about to find the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.340
 weight of a 10 inch tablet then 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.780
 we are with a sausage tablet 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.820
 the interest of this product is 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.110
 that today we have no compromise to 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.820
 to do in terms of use 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.950
 you have a product that can be very 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.650
 well used as a tablet but 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.360
 also like a pc to know with the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.890
 back that but also thanks to its ports 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.540
 usb you can add capacity 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.940
 storage very easily on the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.100
 product it works under windows 8 pro 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.790
 quite windows 8 classic windows 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.650
 8 the sic 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.920
 absolutely yes so that means that 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.840
 you managed to make a master of 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.300
 work and windows in a tablet 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.040
 yes it's really a big 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.110
 advantage is that we are on a system 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.990
 so very versatile blow very 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.610
 powerful without limit where we will be able to 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.440
 install all the applications well 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.610
 sure windows but also install 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.799
 its own applications 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.020
 typically a photoshop or that kind 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.350
 application can turn on this 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.060
 machine 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.440
 after we will not have exactly the same 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.060
 performance that a notebook 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.619
 we are a bit limited in memory when 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.690
 even then in terms of memory the 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.299
 product ships 64 giga but as I 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.489
 just quoted through these usb ports 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.110
 and thanks to its slot sd we can very 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.379
 easily being capabilities of the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.400
 machine 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.379
 we must remember that windows is very 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.810
 greedy on 64 gigabytes remains how much 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.819
 so in terms of storage capacity 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.069
 actually on the 60 gigas he goes 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.360
 stay between 40 and 50 gigas pretty much 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.349
 available to the user 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.390
 it's not going to be a product that goes 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.030
 replace the main computer one is 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.430
 rather on a complementary computer 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.220
 so the price for this device is going 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.560
 start at 599 euros the tablet alone 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.700
 plus 149 euros for jogging and the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.590
 docking actually is not just 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.300
 of a keyboard it is also a 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.770
 second battery that will allow to 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.900
 double the autonomy of the product 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.790
 will go from 8 hours in tablet alone to 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.840
 16 hours with both teams here for 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.730
 this tablet who wants to 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.750
 to turn into pc is fun to note 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.700
 that lenovo is not the only one 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.770
 constructor to rush into this 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.270
 kind of hybrid device a hp asus and 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.150
 other major PC manufacturers 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.680
 have their model almost equivalent then to 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.390
 side of the tablets that want to be done 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.980
 as big as the pc well you have 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.170
 pc that tries to be too 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.090
 pretty that tablets all the way 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.600
 the originality of the product lies in its 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.030
 hinge 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.250
 a hinge that actually allows 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.530
 to tilt the product to 360 degrees that's 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.050
 really the computer that will adapt to 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.390
 your needs to your uses today a 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.110
 classic product that is used in form 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.280
 notebook 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.800
 let's say it's used as 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.810
 notebook is quite limited in term 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.740
 the advantages of this product 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.120
 it's that you and be able to use it 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.890
 as well in your room in your 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.570
 living room only in the kitchen that in a 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.220
 plane so he's really going to get you 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.380
 accompany day by day 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.330
 and that's really interesting and via 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.220
 the hinge you will be able to do it 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.980
 switch to 10 4 different modes to 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.570
 know notebook in horse mode is so 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.070
 very practical for example in an airplane 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.450
 when you want to watch a video in 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.760
 fashion tries for example when you are 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.920
 in the kitchen to be able to concoct 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.480
 a good cooking recipe your 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.310
 family you call that the word of tents 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.959
 this meaning yes quite aside recipes 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.040
 have they have the positionne as a 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.140
 simply tries 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.690
 and suddenly you can easily 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.459
 look at the keyboard do not see the 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.450
 look at the screen and not have 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.190
 precisely the keyboard that can 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.080
 which can receive splashes of water 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.030
 or flour when you prepared by 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.250
 example in kitchens and suddenly that 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.810
 protected and in addition we added a 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.280
 little innovation on the product which 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.290
 is called motion control that allows 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.720
 to be able to pass for example 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.910
 photos or hand slides a little 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.680
 like the concept that links to on 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.020
 game consoles like kinect by 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.760
 example what is its price then the price 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.040
 we will have two configurations available 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.160
 so in the 13 inch version from 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:41.530
 of 1199 euros which you have a version to 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.530
 1199 and another at 1499 euros 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.660
 the Rose is the important part 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.630
 the important usability stops where 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.180
 begins where how serious is this 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.070
 start finally short there you gave all 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.270
 best players we can not I 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.600
 could not do better we could not 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.600
 do better
