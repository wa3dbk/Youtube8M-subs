my<00:00:47.589> test<00:00:47.860> i<00:00:47.949> move<00:00:48.129> that<00:00:48.159> the<00:00:48.369> usually<00:00:48.640> visit

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
my test i move that the usually visit

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.759 
my test i move that the usually visit
this<00:00:49.180> is<00:00:49.239> done<00:00:49.629> within<00:00:49.869> within<00:00:50.290> a<00:00:50.409> minute<00:00:50.619> or

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
this is done within within a minute or

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:52.859 
this is done within within a minute or
two<00:00:50.830> so<00:00:51.159> it<00:00:51.280> does<00:00:51.430> work<00:00:51.460> very<00:00:51.640> quickly<00:00:52.059> so

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:52.869 
two so it does work very quickly so

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:53.939 
two so it does work very quickly so
let's<00:00:53.049> going<00:00:53.229> to<00:00:53.290> take<00:00:53.409> a<00:00:53.440> look<00:00:53.589> at<00:00:53.710> an<00:00:53.799> old

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
let's going to take a look at an old

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.590 
let's going to take a look at an old
note<00:00:54.220> i<00:00:54.339> have<00:00:54.580> here<00:00:54.820> where<00:00:55.000> it<00:00:55.059> says<00:00:55.089> go<00:00:55.390> to<00:00:55.449> the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
note i have here where it says go to the

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.780 
note i have here where it says go to the
library<00:00:56.170> so<00:00:56.830> once<00:00:57.010> i<00:00:57.070> click<00:00:57.159> the<00:00:57.339> old<00:00:57.549> note<00:00:57.760> i

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
library so once i click the old note i

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.310 
library so once i click the old note i
can<00:00:58.030> actually<00:00:58.269> listen<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.690> message<00:00:59.110> that

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
can actually listen to the message that

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.700 
can actually listen to the message that
i<00:00:59.350> actually<00:00:59.619> loved<00:01:00.040> actual<00:01:00.400> recording<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
i actually loved actual recording the

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.979 
i actually loved actual recording the
library<00:01:03.309> so<00:01:04.180> i'll<00:01:04.269> see<00:01:04.420> you<00:01:04.510> that<00:01:04.659> i<00:01:04.689> wrote<00:01:04.809> go

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
library so i'll see you that i wrote go

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.390 
library so i'll see you that i wrote go
to<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:05.170> library<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:05.680> we'll<00:01:05.860> see<00:01:06.010> that<00:01:06.159> jaw

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
to the library and we'll see that jaw

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.760 
to the library and we'll see that jaw
did<00:01:06.670> transcribe<00:01:07.330> it<00:01:07.479> for<00:01:07.510> me<00:01:07.810> as<00:01:07.930> well<00:01:07.960> from

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
here i can move that i can put it into

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.480 
here i can move that i can put it into
my<00:01:10.570> to-do<00:01:10.900> list<00:01:10.930> if<00:01:11.290> I'd<00:01:11.440> like<00:01:11.680> so<00:01:12.220> you<00:01:12.280> see

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
here now and move to my to-do list let's

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.840 
here now and move to my to-do list let's
go<00:01:14.800> ahead<00:01:14.890> and<00:01:14.980> take<00:01:15.100> a<00:01:15.190> look<00:01:15.280> at<00:01:15.550> my<00:01:15.640> actual
