00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.340
 conditionally 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.540
 Hello, I am a forest this techno kitchen 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.700
 today I will introduce you to the case 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.680
 xpredator x3 from aerocool 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.570
 all the beauty of the hull model is revealed 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.400
 when you open the side cover 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.380
 insanely interesting combination of orange 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.550
 and black as they say without 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.770
 comments line there is also 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.900
 red-black and white options to anyone what 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.510
 I like the orange model 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.820
 xpredator x3 belongs to the premium class 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.320
 This is a small full tower hull from 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.240
 xpredator black edition 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.130
 but still very roomy hull 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.750
 which are very comfortable to collect 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.970
 iron he hold any 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.010
 existing graphics cards on the market including 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.780
 dual processor monsters as well as any 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.090
 the height of the cooler and you can easily 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.580
 put together a powerful configuration plus this 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.860
 a gift of eight places under the hard drive 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.049
 monstrously in xpredator black edishen 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.659
 there were only six places to collect an array on 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.830
 thirty two terabytes yes no problem 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.140
 drives fasten on plastic 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:18.350
 anti-vibration skid 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:20.450
 anti-vibration washers still 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.820
 there are legs with a rubberized base 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.990
 the system is equipped with three five inch 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.090
 external compartments 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.909
 one transforms into three and a half 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.470
 inch between the motherboard and the top 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.250
 the base is a space of three 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.990
 centimeter 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.720
 it will be useful for placement 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.790
 extra large coolers either for 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.040
 accommodating some radiator systems 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.320
 liquid cooling we like how 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.060
 thought out ventilation in this case according to 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.370
 default front big 20 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.920
 centimeter fan in the back is also not 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.600
 small 14 centimeters of this already 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.260
 enough to blow hot 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.409
 components can be added at will 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.190
 top 214 centimeter fan or 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.190
 one 20 centimeter 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.220
 on the side 214 centimeter fan and 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.080
 below is another one in general nothing 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.900
 make it difficult to pay a great purge 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.970
 of air 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.980
 and that was not so noisy you can 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.170
 connect 6 fans for reobas and 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.540
 drive revving lowering 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.739
 the supplied voltage is only 2 channels 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.810
 three fans respectively filters 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.269
 anti-dust mounted on front 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.220
 covers and bedtime body so we see 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.620
 the block is also protected from contamination 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.930
 supply side filter fans are not 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.930
 have and better if they will work on 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.760
 blowing out 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.680
 what do you like in the case of durable steel 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.170
 brand secc thickness 0 7 millimeters 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.159
 this does not bend of course we note 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.260
 well developed system 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.940
 cable management for the assembly we 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.129
 used power supply shot 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.230
 Xia tightening cables but despite 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.239
 this we managed to put together a system so 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.780
 inside a lot of space and no extra 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.670
 wires 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.189
 what else is like having a seat on 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.079
 additional 8 expansion card slot 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.150
 imagine you make the most of 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.549
 all seven expansion slots trampoline 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.650
 there are still 8 for some slats with 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.180
 remote controllers distance between 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.920
 motherboard and power supply 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.049
 useful when placing 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.150
 multiple video cards from a large system 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:22.120
 cooling beyond two 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.230
 slots are those who organize dreams and crossfire 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.840
 take note 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.739
 xpredator black deshin was 10 slots 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.599
 extensions 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.159
 but he is full of goods in the same way 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.989
 you can say it used to be 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.889
 possibility of installation 4 side 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.720
 fans 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.579
 and now only 2 if you continue 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.750
 comparison then this time no without 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:42.370
 screwdriver assemblies for expansion cards 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.449
 instead of four remote ports 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.879
 now only two 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:47.889
 but both versions are by 30 small 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.169
 the surprise behind us ports is 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:52.060
 mobil rack made really not big 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:54.549
 hard drives and under drives 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.109
 Notebook format and the like was not 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.000
 xpredator black edition 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.799
 Well, for a snack niche with rubber 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.930
 coated keyhole 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:05.019
 mobile phones and other modern 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.060
 small things aerocool xpredator x3 beautiful 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.159
 the spacious blown case weighing in 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.989
 pleasant surprises our platinum reward 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.989
 I was with you olesya see you
