00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
of piece by piece and what type of base

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.689 
of piece by piece and what type of base
you<00:00:20.220> need<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.609> have<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.810> big<00:00:22.230> big<00:00:23.039> dreadlock

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
you need to have for a big big dreadlock

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.060 
you need to have for a big big dreadlock
and<00:00:23.939> how<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.359> go<00:00:24.600> about<00:00:24.630> getting<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.769> in

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
and how you go about getting that so in

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.970 
and how you go about getting that so in
my<00:00:26.849> book<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.269> talk<00:00:27.539> about<00:00:27.570> leaving<00:00:28.560> your<00:00:28.740> hair

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
my book I talk about leaving your hair

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.440 
my book I talk about leaving your hair
alone<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.810> true<00:00:31.430> this<00:00:32.430> happens<00:00:33.180> on

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
alone and that is true this happens on

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.709 
alone and that is true this happens on
its<00:00:33.540> own<00:00:33.930> based<00:00:34.649> on<00:00:34.980> how<00:00:35.579> much<00:00:35.730> friction<00:00:36.420> you

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
its own based on how much friction you

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.160 
its own based on how much friction you
have<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.110> your<00:00:37.230> life<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.010> when<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.309> sleep<00:00:39.170> this

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
have in your life so when you sleep this

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.160 
have in your life so when you sleep this
part<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.250> back<00:00:41.430> gets<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.329> lot<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.660> friction

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
part and the back gets a lot of friction

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.010 
part and the back gets a lot of friction
so<00:00:43.770> these<00:00:44.040> dreadlocks<00:00:44.730> are<00:00:45.000> likely<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.780> be

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
so these dreadlocks are likely to be

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.650 
so these dreadlocks are likely to be
smaller<00:00:47.930> thinner<00:00:50.420> okay<00:00:52.879> even<00:00:53.879> though<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.510> do

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
smaller thinner okay even though I do

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.619 
smaller thinner okay even though I do
have<00:00:55.039> some<00:00:56.039> pretty<00:00:56.370> good<00:00:56.489> size<00:00:56.910> let's<00:00:57.300> look<00:00:57.480> at

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
have some pretty good size let's look at

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:06.670 
have some pretty good size let's look at
that<00:00:58.609> whew<00:00:59.840> okay<00:01:01.550> so<00:01:02.989> check<00:01:03.989> out<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:05.280> puppy

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
that whew okay so check out this puppy

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.260 
that whew okay so check out this puppy
look<00:01:07.680> at<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:10.100> so<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:12.659> have

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
look at that so you have to just have

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.450 
look at that so you have to just have
that<00:01:15.270> Zen<00:01:15.720> quality<00:01:16.049> where<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.770> let<00:01:17.040> your<00:01:17.250> hair

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
that Zen quality where you let your hair

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.249 
that Zen quality where you let your hair
do<00:01:17.820> what<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.119> wants<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:20.070> at<00:01:20.369> some<00:01:20.670> point

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
do what it wants to do so at some point

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.090 
do what it wants to do so at some point
you<00:01:22.259> know<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:23.159> get<00:01:24.000> out<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.360> control<00:01:24.780> I

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
you know this can get out of control I

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.039 
you know this can get out of control I
every<00:01:26.100> time<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.460> wash<00:01:26.640> your<00:01:26.909> hair<00:01:27.210> your<00:01:28.020> hair

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
every time you wash your hair your hair

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.690 
every time you wash your hair your hair
is<00:01:28.500> going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.280> want<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> fuse<00:01:30.299> together<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:32.040> you

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
is going to want to fuse together so you

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.969 
is going to want to fuse together so you
will<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.299> come<00:01:33.509> along<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.140> separate

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
will have to come along and separate

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.179 
will have to come along and separate
your<00:01:35.250> hair<00:01:35.570> but<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.780> must<00:01:37.170> not<00:01:37.380> overdo<00:01:38.159> it

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
your hair but you must not overdo it

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.679 
your hair but you must not overdo it
okay<00:01:39.259> so<00:01:40.259> once<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.220> job<00:01:41.430> locks<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:42.030> formed

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
okay so once the job locks have formed

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.469 
okay so once the job locks have formed
all<00:01:42.930> you're<00:01:43.409> doing<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.159> just<00:01:44.329> keeping<00:01:45.329> them

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
all you're doing is just keeping them

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.270 
all you're doing is just keeping them
that<00:01:46.140> same<00:01:46.590> size<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:49.100> see<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.610> jug<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.119> here

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
that same size so see this jug like here

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.100 
that same size so see this jug like here
it<00:01:53.280> used<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:54.680> another<00:01:55.939> part<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.299> this

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
it used to have another part of it this

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.260 
it used to have another part of it this
could<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.159> very<00:01:59.520> well<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.790> don't<00:02:00.149> remember

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
could have very well I don't remember

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.810 
could have very well I don't remember
have<00:02:01.079> been<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.680> dreadlocks<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.549> merged

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
have been to dreadlocks that merged

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.740 
have been to dreadlocks that merged
together<00:02:03.740> so<00:02:04.740> at<00:02:05.130> some<00:02:05.490> point<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:06.060> these

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
together so at some point if these

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.529 
together so at some point if these
merged<00:02:07.200> together<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.069> then<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.119> hair<00:02:09.330> just

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
merged together and then the hair just

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.210 
merged together and then the hair just
continued<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.200> grow

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
continued to grow

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.520 
continued to grow
I<00:02:11.330> would<00:02:12.330> form<00:02:12.720> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
I would form the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.240 
I would form the
branched<00:02:14.070> look<00:02:14.580> like<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.120> have<00:02:15.950> but<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.070> just

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
branched look like I have but we just

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.310 
branched look like I have but we just
saw<00:02:17.490> back<00:02:17.820> here<00:02:18.150> somewhere<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.140> why

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
saw back here somewhere so that is why

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.390 
saw back here somewhere so that is why
you<00:02:22.350> separate<00:02:23.190> because<00:02:24.590> when<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.770> don't<00:02:26.070> they

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
you separate because when you don't they

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.960 
you separate because when you don't they
fuse<00:02:26.850> together<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.690> they<00:02:28.410> get<00:02:28.650> thicker<00:02:29.070> see

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
fuse together and they get thicker see

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:38.480 
fuse together and they get thicker see
that<00:02:30.740> can<00:02:31.740> you<00:02:31.770> see<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.430> right<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:37.620> that's

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
that can you see that right so that's

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.360 
that can you see that right so that's
that's<00:02:39.120> basically<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:40.020> way<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.260> happens<00:02:40.680> so

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
that's basically the way it happens so

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.820 
that's basically the way it happens so
if<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.790> just<00:02:42.090> fell<00:02:42.480> asleep<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.110> woke<00:02:43.290> up<00:02:43.530> and

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
if I just fell asleep and woke up and

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.940 
if I just fell asleep and woke up and
you<00:02:44.280> know<00:02:44.400> 10<00:02:44.760> years<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:45.780> would<00:02:46.020> probably<00:02:46.290> be

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
you know 10 years this would probably be

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.180 
you know 10 years this would probably be
all<00:02:47.310> meshed<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.180> form<00:02:48.540> together<00:02:48.950> longer<00:02:49.950> and

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
little tour see I've got some really

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:22.190 
little tour see I've got some really
tiny<00:03:14.970> ones<00:03:15.330> back<00:03:15.600> here<00:03:16.250> see<00:03:17.330> tiny<00:03:20.480> tiny<00:03:21.480> and

tiny ones back here see tiny tiny and
this<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.680> actually<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:24.110> drug<00:03:25.110> like<00:03:25.290> that's

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
this is actually a drug like that's

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.060 
this is actually a drug like that's
merged<00:03:25.890> together<00:03:27.260> which<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.470> good<00:03:28.769> because

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
merged together which is good because

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.210 
merged together which is good because
this<00:03:29.519> might<00:03:29.820> break<00:03:30.299> off<00:03:30.600> if<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.650> didn't<00:03:32.010> get

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
this might break off if it didn't get

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.509 
this might break off if it didn't get
strength<00:03:32.730> from<00:03:32.820> its<00:03:33.299> neighbor<00:03:34.220> let's<00:03:35.220> see

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
strength from its neighbor let's see

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.330 
strength from its neighbor let's see
what<00:03:35.670> else<00:03:35.850> we've<00:03:36.030> got<00:03:36.060> here<00:03:36.330> some<00:03:37.340> other
