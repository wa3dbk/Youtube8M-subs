00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.390
 of 2006 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:11.110
 to say a very cerebral infarction 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:14.730
 so then at the beginning it was a 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.269
 very timely attention 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.269
 He had 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:25.920
 pretty good and fast recovery 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.140
 but unfortunately afterwards already another 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.079
 the click time began 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.200
 and now I have practically a year ago 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.050
 which is only he administered the 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.980
 food and the wind and I do not give it a 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.680
 other medication 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.790
 because I do not see the object if I do not 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:50.629
 I see with the medicine have him a 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.460
 improvement that I see it not then elliot 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:57.340
 and it has served to have a 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.340
 maintenance there is no blood pressure 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:05.239

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.159
 disappeared and does not have any 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.509
 medicine was taken in lava pri 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.509
 I stopped him administering 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.479
 he was even administering 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.750
 insulin because of possibly 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.520
 sooner or later I do not know as a result of that 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.220
 all the studies were done 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.800
 with diseases appeared with a little bit of 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.400
 little sugar because it has never been uploaded 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.890
 to have 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.460
 many more fats 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.360
 right now he handles you daily 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.560
 110-90 of the super does not have its 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.390
 between 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.390
 80 heart rate 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.219
 it's been a bit hypothermic because 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.219
 he has lost a lot of body mass 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.270
 but with to shine crazy I'm sorry that 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.980
 is a little low in temperature with 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:04.280
 add everything normal and left over and 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.310
 totally is not only the medicine cabinet 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.280
 then and take say in a 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.030
 administration from three times dose 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.820
 to day but I put myself a little in a 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.060
 comisa dor and I put him on my back in 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.490
 Any little thing that I see rare and 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.580
 has a year and a half or a year seven months 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.270
 in bed and does not have a single scale and 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.890
 it's very normal in people 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.890
 with the whole back 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.600
 and any this reason cites any 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.100
 I see him 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.230
 If I had a pain in my ears 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.310
 attitude boots disappeared the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.450
 information 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.450
 and the tone of cheeses 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.390

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.640
 Of course you will not be taking it if you do not 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:06.170
 Do you have any diagnosis from a doctor? 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.269

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.019
 you are a hypertensive person for example 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.930
 or you are a diabetic person if you take it 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.410
 as an alternative medicine that 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.690
 I have you 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.310

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.400

 James cause and that's the only thing that 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.540

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.620
