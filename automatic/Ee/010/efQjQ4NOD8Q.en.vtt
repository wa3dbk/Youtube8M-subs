guys<00:02:47.880> in<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.690> NFL<00:02:48.900> was<00:02:49.260> part<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.070> Kansas

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
guys in the NFL was part of the Kansas

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.800 
guys in the NFL was part of the Kansas
City<00:02:50.490> team<00:02:50.790> when<00:02:51.000> he<00:02:51.060> got<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.360> job<00:02:51.600> with

Minnesota<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.590> sort<00:02:53.460> of<00:02:53.520> thought<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:54.030> as<00:02:54.150> a

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
Minnesota I sort of thought of it as a

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.360 
Minnesota I sort of thought of it as a
second<00:02:54.600> beginning<00:02:55.070> maybe<00:02:56.070> they<00:02:56.220> would<00:02:56.310> be

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
second beginning maybe they would be

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.470 
second beginning maybe they would be
able<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.550> put<00:02:56.700> something<00:02:56.880> together<00:02:57.030> him<00:02:57.450> and

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
able to put something together him and

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.960 
able to put something together him and
Greg<00:02:57.750> Jennings<00:02:58.080> but<00:02:58.440> definitely<00:02:59.190> weak<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.730> ice

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
Greg Jennings but definitely weak to ice

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.270 
Greg Jennings but definitely weak to ice
a<00:03:00.540> bet<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.990> house<00:03:01.140> on<00:03:01.380> New<00:03:01.560> England<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.070> think

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
a bet the house on New England I think

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.530

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
that I had already picked New England to

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.570 
that I had already picked New England to
win<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:03.780> game<00:03:03.990> as<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.290> is<00:03:04.410> but<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:04.710> think<00:03:05.010> no

Adrian<00:03:05.820> Peterson<00:03:06.540> one<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:06.990> best<00:03:07.140> players

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
Adrian Peterson one of the best players

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.530 
Adrian Peterson one of the best players
in<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.650> NFL<00:03:07.740> no<00:03:08.550> way<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.940> world<00:03:09.060> Vikings

can win this game I think this is one

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.770 
can win this game I think this is one
hundred<00:03:11.010> percent<00:03:11.190> different<00:03:11.850> than<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.630> Ray
