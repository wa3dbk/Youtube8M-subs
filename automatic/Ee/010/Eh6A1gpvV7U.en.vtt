you<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.500> see<00:01:43.800> when<00:01:44.010> I'm<00:01:44.160> shaping<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.850> I'm<00:01:45.030> just

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
you can see when I'm shaping it I'm just

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.360 
you can see when I'm shaping it I'm just
shaking<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.870> a<00:01:45.990> little<00:01:46.170> bit<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.470> both<00:01:46.650> both

shaking it a little bit to both both
sides<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.180> makes<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.480> little<00:01:48.720> space

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
sides and it makes a little space

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.230 
sides and it makes a little space
between<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:52.110> dough<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.620> the<00:01:52.830> dough<00:01:53.160> that<00:01:54.090> was

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
between the dough and the dough that was

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.060 
between the dough and the dough that was
shaped<00:01:54.630> which<00:01:55.200> makes<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.650> a<00:01:55.740> little<00:01:55.890> bit

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
shaped which makes it a little bit

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:10.420 
shaped which makes it a little bit
easier<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.730> take<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.600> out<00:02:08.180> of<00:02:09.180> course<00:02:09.450> with<00:02:09.540> the

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
easier to take it out of course with the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.310 
easier to take it out of course with the
whatever's<00:02:11.430> left<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.540> dough<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.810> just

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
whatever's left of the dough you just

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.610 
whatever's left of the dough you just
gather<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.400> together<00:02:14.820> again<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.540> make<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.290> bowl

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
gather it together again you make a bowl

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.610 
gather it together again you make a bowl
out<00:02:16.860> of<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:18.740> let's<00:02:20.690> make<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.750> bowl<00:02:22.050> out<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.410> it
