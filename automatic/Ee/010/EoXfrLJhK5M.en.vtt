mango is you have the mango this way and

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.189 
mango is you have the mango this way and
the<00:00:35.250> wrong<00:00:35.430> part<00:00:35.820> here<00:00:36.150> at<00:00:36.330> the<00:00:36.570> top<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.050> just

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
the wrong part here at the top you just

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.799 
the wrong part here at the top you just
cut<00:00:37.949> it<00:00:38.070> straight<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.090> get<00:00:39.330> a<00:00:39.360> little<00:00:39.480> base

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
cut it straight so you get a little base

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.729 
cut it straight so you get a little base
and<00:00:40.460> then<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.699> see<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.970> little<00:00:42.420> wider<00:00:42.989> side<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
and then you see a little wider side and

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.310 
and then you see a little wider side and
narrow<00:00:43.949> side<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.580> you<00:00:44.610> take<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.690> right<00:00:45.930> side

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
narrow side so you take the right side

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.310 
narrow side so you take the right side
and<00:00:46.710> then<00:00:47.339> cut<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.790> there's<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.600> seed<00:00:48.900> right

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
and then cut it there's the seed right

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.709 
and then cut it there's the seed right
in<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> center<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.309> set<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.789> if<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.210> hit

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
in the center so you set up if you hit

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.410 
in the center so you set up if you hit
the<00:00:51.960> seed<00:00:52.200> you<00:00:52.379> sort<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.829> turn<00:00:53.309> their<00:00:53.640> knife<00:00:54.239> a
