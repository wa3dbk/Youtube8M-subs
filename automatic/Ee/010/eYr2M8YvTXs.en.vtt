working on you'll see right away the red

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.690 
working on you'll see right away the red
switch<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.440> different<00:00:13.769> than<00:00:13.860> normal<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.340> put

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
switch is different than normal I put

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.090 
switch is different than normal I put
that<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:14.969> because<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.420> normal<00:00:15.719> one<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.890> really

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
that in because the normal one is really

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.830 
that in because the normal one is really
loud<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.550> terms<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.850> popping<00:00:18.180> like<00:00:18.600> one<00:00:18.750> of

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
turning it on every couple notes to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.620 
turning it on every couple notes to
sustain<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:23.550> don't<00:00:23.699> want<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.939> loud<00:00:24.090> pop<00:00:24.390> in

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
the quiet performance so the red switch

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.650 
the quiet performance so the red switch
isn't<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> greatest<00:00:27.300> I'm<00:00:27.359> going<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.539> switch

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
isn't the greatest I'm going to switch

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.460 
isn't the greatest I'm going to switch
it<00:00:27.750> out<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:27.990> something<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.260> little<00:00:28.439> more

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
it out for something a little more

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.380 
it out for something a little more
robust<00:00:28.920> later<00:00:29.220> but<00:00:29.730> for<00:00:29.880> now<00:00:30.000> it'll<00:00:30.150> do<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
robust later but for now it'll do the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.069 
robust later but for now it'll do the
job<00:00:30.420> very<00:00:31.380> nicely<00:00:31.500> let's<00:00:32.460> show<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.540> stock

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
job very nicely let's show you the stock

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.610 
job very nicely let's show you the stock
freeze

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.850 

they're<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:39.490> fries<00:00:39.730> is<00:00:40.480> on<00:00:40.750> but<00:00:41.440> I<00:00:41.500> can<00:00:41.650> still

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
they're the fries is on but I can still

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.610 
they're the fries is on but I can still
play<00:00:42.070> over<00:00:42.310> top

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.150 

you

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.550 

now<00:00:49.160> that<00:00:49.340> was<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.489> first<00:00:49.850> thing<00:00:50.030> I<00:00:50.120> did<00:00:50.300> was

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
now that was the first thing I did was

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.900 
now that was the first thing I did was
there's<00:00:51.560> an<00:00:51.680> expression<00:00:52.130> pedal<00:00:52.160> track<00:00:52.670> right

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
there's an expression pedal track right

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:01.510 
there's an expression pedal track right
there<00:00:53.260> so<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:54.620> can<00:00:55.100> control<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.030> level<00:01:00.520> which

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
there so you can control the level which

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.700 
there so you can control the level which
is<00:01:01.640> useful<00:01:02.059> if<00:01:02.360> you<00:01:02.390> want<00:01:02.930> to<00:01:03.020> take<00:01:03.200> the<00:01:03.410> same

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
is useful if you want to take the same

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.190 
is useful if you want to take the same
note<00:01:04.070> in<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.150> out<00:01:05.269> if<00:01:05.510> you<00:01:05.570> like<00:01:05.720> me<00:01:05.900> frozen

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
note in and out if you like me frozen

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.780 
note in and out if you like me frozen
you<00:01:06.440> don't<00:01:06.560> want<00:01:06.710> to<00:01:06.770> redo<00:01:06.979> it<00:01:07.100> later<00:01:07.310> you<00:01:07.759> can

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
you don't want to redo it later you can

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:19.100 
you don't want to redo it later you can
keep<00:01:08.090> it<00:01:08.210> in<00:01:08.330> and<00:01:08.479> out<00:01:08.600> even<00:01:08.930> though<00:01:09.050> the<00:01:09.170> song

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.710 

now<00:01:20.110> that<00:01:20.260> would<00:01:20.350> work<00:01:20.500> too<00:01:20.710> with<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.510> on<00:01:22.510> off

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
now that would work too with the on off

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.690 
now that would work too with the on off
stomp<00:01:23.050> just<00:01:23.740> to<00:01:23.830> turn<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.010> thing<00:01:24.250> completely

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
stomp just to turn the thing completely

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.850 
stomp just to turn the thing completely
on<00:01:24.880> or<00:01:25.000> off<00:01:25.090> but<00:01:25.690> expression<00:01:26.560> gives<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:26.770> little

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
on or off but expression gives a little

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.340 
on or off but expression gives a little
more<00:01:26.950> control<00:01:27.280> over<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.580> volume<00:01:27.940> and<00:01:28.180> so<00:01:28.990> the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
more control over the volume and so the

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.540 
more control over the volume and so the
other<00:01:29.410> thing<00:01:29.530> added<00:01:29.920> was<00:01:30.100> an<00:01:30.220> effects<00:01:30.460> loop

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
other thing added was an effects loop

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.670 
other thing added was an effects loop
you<00:01:31.120> can<00:01:31.210> see<00:01:31.390> this<00:01:31.960> guy<00:01:32.170> over<00:01:32.350> here<00:01:32.530> is<00:01:32.560> a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
you can see this guy over here is a

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.100 
you can see this guy over here is a
stereo<00:01:33.100> insert<00:01:33.610> cable<00:01:34.060> that<00:01:34.600> goes<00:01:34.630> out<00:01:34.930> to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
stereo insert cable that goes out to

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.690 
stereo insert cable that goes out to
that<00:01:35.140> phaser<00:01:35.530> in<00:01:35.800> that<00:01:35.920> tremolo<00:01:36.400> and<00:01:36.580> then

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
that phaser in that tremolo and then

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.930 
that phaser in that tremolo and then
back<00:01:36.970> in<00:01:37.210> again<00:01:37.300> so<00:01:38.200> let's<00:01:38.980> turn<00:01:39.130> those<00:01:39.340> on

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
back in again so let's turn those on

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.260 
back in again so let's turn those on
you

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.080 

now<00:01:44.900> you<00:01:44.960> got<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.170> nice<00:01:45.380> chorus<00:01:46.220> of<00:01:46.430> robot<00:01:46.820> cats

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
now you got a nice chorus of robot cats

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.920 
now you got a nice chorus of robot cats
behind<00:01:47.690> you<00:01:50.860> but<00:01:51.940> your<00:01:52.940> clean<00:01:53.180> signal<00:01:53.420> isn't

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
behind you but your clean signal isn't

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.140 
behind you but your clean signal isn't
affected<00:01:54.290> by<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.470> chorus<00:01:55.190> and<00:01:55.310> treble<00:01:55.490> or<00:01:55.790> the

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
affected by the chorus and treble or the

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:06.780 
affected by the chorus and treble or the
phaser<00:01:56.750> in<00:01:56.930> trouble

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.270 

which<00:02:07.330> is<00:02:07.420> pretty<00:02:07.630> awesome<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:08.530> now<00:02:08.710> I've<00:02:09.070> got

which is pretty awesome so now I've got

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.790 
which is pretty awesome so now I've got

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
that 80s Rowland cube amp over there

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.140 
that 80s Rowland cube amp over there
that's<00:02:11.980> our<00:02:12.160> go-to<00:02:12.400> man<00:02:12.730> but<00:02:12.940> we<00:02:13.000> need

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
that's our go-to man but we need

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
the effect return

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.570 
the effect return
send<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.470> out<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.830> amp<00:02:20.040> instead<00:02:20.490> of

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
send it out to that amp instead of

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.310 
send it out to that amp instead of
putting<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.850> back<00:02:21.000> through<00:02:21.360> you'll<00:02:22.080> see

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
putting it back through you'll see

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:31.760 
putting it back through you'll see
you'll<00:02:22.500> catch<00:02:22.650> my<00:02:22.830> drift<00:02:23.010> no<00:02:23.160> sign<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:31.590> now<00:02:31.710> you

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
you'll catch my drift no sign so now you

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.580 
you'll catch my drift no sign so now you
can<00:02:32.010> hear<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.990> affected<00:02:33.990> fruit<00:02:34.290> frozen

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
can hear the affected fruit frozen

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.040 
can hear the affected fruit frozen
signal<00:02:35.180> going<00:02:36.180> through<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.540> phaser<00:02:36.780> and

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
signal going through the phaser and

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.340 
signal going through the phaser and
tremolo<00:02:37.380> out<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.310> rollin<00:02:38.700> my<00:02:39.600> guitar<00:02:39.930> still

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
tremolo out the rollin my guitar still

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.070 
tremolo out the rollin my guitar still
going<00:02:40.590> through<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.830> green<00:02:44.840> turn<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> reverb

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
going through the green turn the reverb

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.510 
going through the green turn the reverb
on<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.500> green<00:02:46.709> amp<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.190> can<00:02:47.310> hear<00:02:47.490> a

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
on the green amp so you can hear a

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:59.090 
on the green amp so you can hear a
little<00:02:47.730> different<00:02:48.090> now<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:58.440> expression

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
little different now the expression

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.699 
little different now the expression
pedal<00:02:59.610> controls<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.570> unaffected<00:03:01.260> free

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
pedal controls the unaffected free

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.070 
pedal controls the unaffected free
frozen<00:03:02.040> signal<00:03:02.489> so<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.180> freeze<00:03:03.420> without<00:03:03.720> the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
frozen signal so the freeze without the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.440 
frozen signal so the freeze without the
tremolo<00:03:04.320> or<00:03:04.709> phaser<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.760> can<00:03:05.880> bring<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.209> in

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
tremolo or phaser you can bring that in

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.690 
tremolo or phaser you can bring that in
a<00:03:06.540> route<00:03:06.720> as<00:03:06.989> well<00:03:07.170> now

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.420 

so<00:03:14.700> now<00:03:14.849> tremolo<00:03:15.810> in<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.290> signal<00:03:16.560> regular

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
so now tremolo in that signal regular

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:29.820 
so now tremolo in that signal regular
fries<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:17.970> guitar<00:03:18.360> in<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.349> one

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:37.680 

it

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.660 

and<00:03:38.860> if<00:03:39.860> you<00:03:39.980> turn

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
and if you turn

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.800 
and if you turn
the<00:03:42.150> affected<00:03:42.780> signal<00:03:43.740> effects<00:03:44.610> off<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:45.630> just

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
the affected signal effects off you just

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
the affected signal effects off you just
get<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:45.990> standard<00:03:46.260> signal<00:03:46.560> out<00:03:46.710> of<00:03:46.800> a

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
get the standard signal out of a

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.600 
get the standard signal out of a
separate<00:03:47.130> amp<00:03:47.250> completely<00:03:51.800> so<00:03:52.800> it<00:03:53.070> becomes<00:03:53.400> a

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
separate amp completely so it becomes a

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.700 
separate amp completely so it becomes a
lot<00:03:53.820> more<00:03:53.880> versatile<00:03:54.630> in<00:03:54.780> terms<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:55.230> an<00:03:55.410> effect

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
lot more versatile in terms of an effect

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.730 
lot more versatile in terms of an effect
yeah<00:03:56.490> of<00:03:56.730> course<00:03:57.320> they<00:03:58.320> released<00:03:58.650> the

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
yeah of course they released the

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.330 
yeah of course they released the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.370 
super-ego
pretty<00:03:59.880> recently<00:04:00.300> as<00:04:00.390> well<00:04:00.570> which<00:04:00.900> basically

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
pretty recently as well which basically

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.410 
pretty recently as well which basically
takes<00:04:01.710> everything<00:04:02.010> I've<00:04:02.220> done<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.730> just<00:04:03.210> puts

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
takes everything I've done and just puts

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.540 
takes everything I've done and just puts
it<00:04:03.510> in<00:04:03.630> a<00:04:03.750> fancier<00:04:04.410> package<00:04:04.920> with<00:04:05.100> some<00:04:05.250> extra

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
it in a fancier package with some extra

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.190 
it in a fancier package with some extra
modes<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:06.030> things<00:04:06.240> but<00:04:06.780> it's<00:04:06.900> more<00:04:07.050> expensive

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
modes and things but it's more expensive

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.320 
modes and things but it's more expensive
so<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:07.890> already<00:04:08.190> have<00:04:08.340> this<00:04:08.550> drilled<00:04:09.209> some

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
so I already have this drilled some

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.630 
so I already have this drilled some
holes<00:04:09.390> in<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.870> I'm<00:04:10.350> pretty<00:04:10.530> happy<00:04:10.640> so

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
holes in it and I'm pretty happy so

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.590 
holes in it and I'm pretty happy so
there<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.270> go

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
there you go

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.350 
there you go
