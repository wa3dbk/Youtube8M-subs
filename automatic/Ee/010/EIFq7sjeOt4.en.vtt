00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 um hello staff okay well this carol 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.830
 coming to my channel 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.290
 Today I bring you a way. 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.799
 fun to make a cake for a 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.880
 Special event in this case was a tea of 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.740
 that I made for my sister in the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.900
 It's true, my sister- in- law of my 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.490
 exchange husband that we have a 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.380
 good relationship she called me to 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.599
 to be her godmother so doing this 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.349
 cake in honor of her 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.920
 but basically you need 28 cacs 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.899
 I made it in lemon a delight I 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.540
 I prefer to do it all in tones 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.090
 Clear because it's easier to 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.910
 to decorate needs to be correcting a lot 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.489
 this is the fossil of course the mass of the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.879
 cake or dark then the basic 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.879
 Good thing I just put her in the cupcakes. 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:57.360
 souza 28 copycats and helped me 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.070
 It helped make the layout for that formed 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.070
 a wedding dress 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.410
 with a small pitanga nipple actually beak 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.900
 great bicanga 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.980
 I'll make the decoration beeping 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.680
 rosettes at each touch for the recipe of the 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.560
 next you can find it here in this video 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.090
 which is below and explained 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.380
 in detail how are you going to do 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.260
 the recipe 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.780
 I do this next you need to do 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.530
 a double income because it covers 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.050
 back of 12 chapters 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.800
 You can see here that I make rosetta 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.730
 until the day when all the 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:49.240
 persimmons abut the other one 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.030
 at least 8 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.890
 among others 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.330
 so basically I'm going to cover the biggest 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.880
 part of it 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:03.790
 the white and then the waist I do in 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.730
 pink that you had a little pink 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.119
 I make the two touches and then the 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:13.720
 The rest I 'm going to paint little pitangas 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:18.940
 as if it were the frill of the dress and the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:22.150
 bust here also fills you all 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.520
 intervals between taps with a tape 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.260
 Dengue map is tiny 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.430
 to see which one 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.640
 make the cake an all i do not 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.000
 I know you, but this to me, this reminds me. 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.930
 that birthday cake that lives 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 little stick on foil 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.319
 It seems like you do not really need it. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.290
 count good 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.659
 the cake is already in cap that is cool because 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.640
 You already know me so much about Portuguese. 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:55.239
 who will need 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.909
 so there's not much left over and it's more 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.299
 clean do not need to use a deal or anything 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.299
 of this 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:09.129

 three days out of the refrigerator 15 days ago 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.239
