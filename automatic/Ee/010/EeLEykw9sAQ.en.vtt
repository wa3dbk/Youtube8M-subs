upon<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:37.049> put<00:01:37.320> our<00:01:37.409> own<00:01:37.439> touches<00:01:37.920> on

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
upon it and just put our own touches on

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.499 
upon it and just put our own touches on
it<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.430> still<00:01:38.700> keep<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.119> heart<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.390> his

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
it but still keep the heart of his

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.899 
it but still keep the heart of his
design<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:39.990> place<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.470> lot<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.369> guys<00:01:41.490> may

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
design in place a lot of you guys may

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.940 
design in place a lot of you guys may
actually<00:01:42.659> wonder<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.500> differences

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
actually wonder what are the differences

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.590 
actually wonder what are the differences
so<00:01:44.189> let<00:01:44.520> me<00:01:44.579> just<00:01:44.759> quickly<00:01:44.880> go<00:01:45.210> through<00:01:45.240> those

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
so let me just quickly go through those

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.300 
so let me just quickly go through those
with<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.869> there's<00:01:46.350> four<00:01:46.560> main<00:01:46.799> differences

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
with you there's four main differences

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.120 
with you there's four main differences
one<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.299> we<00:01:48.990> use<00:01:49.020> spent<00:01:49.470> switching<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.040> you

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
one is we use spent switching so you

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.859 
one is we use spent switching so you
actually<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:50.579> trails<00:01:51.000> when<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.450> click<00:01:51.720> it

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
actually get trails when you click it

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.319 
actually get trails when you click it
off<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.170> reverb<00:01:52.439> keeps<00:01:52.710> going<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.970> second

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
off the reverb keeps going the second

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.910 
off the reverb keeps going the second
thing<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.810> added<00:01:54.990> an<00:01:55.170> effects<00:01:55.530> loop<00:01:55.590> you

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
thing is we added an effects loop you

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.249 
thing is we added an effects loop you
can<00:01:56.070> insert<00:01:56.430> any<00:01:56.700> cuddle<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.600> want<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.049> adds

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
can insert any cuddle you want it adds

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.870 
can insert any cuddle you want it adds
that<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.740> reverb<00:01:59.040> signal<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.610> put<00:01:59.759> an

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
that to the reverb signal so put an

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.910 
that to the reverb signal so put an
octave<00:02:00.180> pedal<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.570> there<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.869> simmer<00:02:01.350> cetera

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
octave pedal in there you simmer cetera

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.100 
octave pedal in there you simmer cetera
the<00:02:02.670> third<00:02:02.880> thing<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.509> adjust<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.990> low

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the third thing is we adjust the low

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.690 
the third thing is we adjust the low
pass<00:02:04.290> frequency<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.070> highest<00:02:05.369> control

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
pass frequency of the highest control

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.429 
pass frequency of the highest control
that's<00:02:06.000> original<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.600> his<00:02:06.750> design<00:02:07.079> we<00:02:07.259> just

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
that's original to his design we just

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.249 
that's original to his design we just
barely<00:02:07.740> moved<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.280> little<00:02:08.429> bit<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.259> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
barely moved it a little bit and the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.839 
barely moved it a little bit and the
fourth<00:02:10.500> thing<00:02:10.739> which<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.220> probably<00:02:11.370> one<00:02:11.819> of

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
fourth thing which is probably one of

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.869 
fourth thing which is probably one of
the<00:02:11.970> biggest<00:02:12.590> additions<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:14.280> use<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
the biggest additions is the use of the

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.150 
the biggest additions is the use of the
new<00:02:15.000> version<00:02:15.330> 3<00:02:15.540> brick<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:16.560> gives<00:02:16.800> us<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
new version 3 brick that gives us the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.309 
new version 3 brick that gives us the
depth<00:02:17.370> control<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.629> it<00:02:18.750> just<00:02:18.900> makes<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.200> more

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
depth control and it just makes it more

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.920 
depth control and it just makes it more
treatable<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:20.280> can<00:02:20.489> adjust<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.209> length<00:02:21.599> and

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
treatable you can adjust that length and

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.800 
treatable you can adjust that length and
the<00:02:22.140> depth<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:22.590> can<00:02:22.800> go<00:02:22.950> from<00:02:23.160> spring<00:02:23.550> to

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
the depth you can go from spring to

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.750 
the depth you can go from spring to
bigger<00:02:24.810> rooms<00:02:25.110> tile<00:02:25.560> rooms<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.580> like

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
bigger rooms tile rooms and to like

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.000 
bigger rooms tile rooms and to like
reverb<00:02:27.330> delay<00:02:27.599> sounds<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.349> we're<00:02:28.890> really

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
reverb delay sounds so we're really

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.530 
reverb delay sounds so we're really
excited<00:02:29.430> about<00:02:29.670> how<00:02:29.879> we<00:02:29.940> were<00:02:30.120> able<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.390> take

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
excited about how we were able to take

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.720 
excited about how we were able to take
Jim's<00:02:30.810> design<00:02:31.200> run<00:02:31.650> with<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:31.980> do<00:02:32.459> our<00:02:32.580> own

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
Jim's design run with it do our own

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.460 
Jim's design run with it do our own
thing<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.209> honor<00:02:33.599> him<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.110> if<00:02:34.290> you're

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
thing and honor him so if you're

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.650 
thing and honor him so if you're
interested<00:02:34.890> in<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.099> go<00:02:35.700> check<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.330> out<00:02:36.450> at<00:02:36.599> a

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
interested in this go check it out at a

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.660 
interested in this go check it out at a
dealer<00:02:37.050> listen<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.680> play<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.129> pick<00:02:38.340> one<00:02:38.519> up

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
dealer listen to it play it pick one up
