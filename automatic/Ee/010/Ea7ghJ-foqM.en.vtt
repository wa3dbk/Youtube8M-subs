00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 because we need the fat types of 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.599
 fat labeling risks moderating the 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.809
 consumption in this section we invite you to 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.650
 that you know a little more the fats that 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.070
 are its functions and objectives within 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.769
 our organism nature of the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.460
 fats are also known with the 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.939
 lipid name the fats that are 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.820
 Ingest mainly come from 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.000
 various foods of animal origin and 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.270
 vegetable are found in different 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.329
 proportions in such foods and not 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.809
 all fats are just as necessary 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.930
 to maintain health even the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.649
 I consume the excess of some type of fat 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.309
 It can lead to health risks 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.270
 fats are formed 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.440
 mainly triglycerides 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:05.870
 which in turn have more structures 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.920
 simple known as fatty acids 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.310
 according to the type of fatty acid of each 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.860
 triglycerides 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.340
 there will be different types of fat with 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.540
 different effects on the body acids 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.610
 saturated unsaturated fatty acids 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.330
 monounsaturated and polyunsaturated and 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.200
 trans fatty acids fats can 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:33.710
 be solid or liquid there are some 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.460
 types of unsaturated fatty acids 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:41.000
 called omega 3 and omega 6 that are 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.900
 they call essential fatty acids because 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.510
 are necessary for various functions 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.270
 physiological and that the body does not 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.900
 synthesizes and can only be obtained to 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.530
 through food the energy of 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:02.210
 fats dietary fats like 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:05.410
 other nutrients provide energy 19 carl 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.869
 gram bar this is what is called 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:11.569
 caloric intake or calories 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.319
 to get a feed 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.989
 balanced the consumption of fat should be 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.099
 less than 30 percent of the 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.920
 Total calories from the diet 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:28.010
 for a 2000 lime diet that is the 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.400
 reference intake of an average adult 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.390
 the caloric content from the 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.159
 fats would be approximately 600 cal 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.640
 what would a daily intake of 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:46.609
 approximately 70 grams of fat 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.989
 you also have to always keep in mind the 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:52.420
 type of fat that is being consumed 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.540
 prioritizing unsaturated fats 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.709
 versus the saturated consumption of 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.260
 fat is therefore essential for 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.769
 the human being since to guarantee 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.140
 health should be carried out a 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.560
 Adequate intake of nutrients 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.890
 basic or essential that are in a 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.460
 varied and balanced diet 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.490
 however this fat intake should 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.640
 be done in adequate proportions to 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:29.270
 get there to be a balance between 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.630
 the energy or calories ingested through 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:36.110
 of food and beverages and spending 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:39.020
 that lori co for it in a 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.900
 healthy and balanced diet is 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.510
 must consume all kinds of food 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.750
 to get a varied contribution and 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:52.070
 full of the main nutrients 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:55.570
 carbohydrates proteins and fats and 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:58.160
 always in the right proportions 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:02.000
 controlling the rations and with a 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.239
 moderate consumption of fatty foods 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.239
 they are high-calorie and low-calorie foods 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:11.450
 satiating power that they make palatable and 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:14.900
 tasty dishes but the excess of 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.049
 non-healthy fat consumption due 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.370
 to which leads to a weight gain not 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.400
 wanted 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.960
 functions of fats the main 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.080
 functions of the fat that is ingested are 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.270
 main source of energy because 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.110
 provide 9 cal for each gram of 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:40.040
 fat ingested energy reserve in the 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:44.090
 organism protects and gives consistency to 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:47.380
 some organs of the body are part 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:51.889
 of the structure of cell membranes 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:54.350
 hormone regulator absorbs and mobilizes 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.889
 the vitamins ad 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:01.669
 aica that being soluble only in fats 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:04.460
 and not in water they need to be transported 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:07.940
 by fat molecules through the 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:11.510
 bloodstream endowed with palatability 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:15.320
 to food making them tastier 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.470
 and desirable this property is one of 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.720
 which is sought technologically when 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.689
 fat is added to food 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.249
 processed or manufactured 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:30.679
 its consumption should be moderate and occasional 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:33.649
 within fatty foods is 

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:36.259
 find the olive oil that is a 

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:38.929
 food included in the diet 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:42.019
 Mediterranean and that according to the pyramid 

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:46.339
 Nutritional consumption is recommended 

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:49.489
 daily in small doses on the other hand 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:52.639
 the expense that a logical goes in function of 

00:05:49.489 --> 00:05:55.519
 the personal needs of each and 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:58.550
 therefore it is essential to carry 

00:05:55.519 --> 00:06:01.429
 out the practice of physical activity 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:05.809
 moderate daily to guarantee the 

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:08.269
 health in this way you can prevent 

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:12.229
 occurrence of related diseases 

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:14.479
 with eating habits and styles of 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:18.379
 life as are diseases 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:24.069
 cardiovascular metabolic diabetes 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:24.069
 obesity and hypertension among others
