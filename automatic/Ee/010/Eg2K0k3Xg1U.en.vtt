box<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:39.019> just<00:02:39.049> used<00:02:39.439> to<00:02:39.590> put<00:02:39.739> up<00:02:39.859> there<00:02:40.040> I<00:02:40.219> had

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
box I just used to put up there I had

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.479 
box I just used to put up there I had
some<00:02:41.540> goats<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:42.200> like<00:02:42.409> to<00:02:42.680> jump<00:02:43.010> on<00:02:43.189> it<00:02:43.340> and

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
some goats that like to jump on it and

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.179 
some goats that like to jump on it and
then<00:02:43.609> jump<00:02:43.909> up<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.239> top<00:02:44.409> and<00:02:45.409> so<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.159> course

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189 
then jump up to the top and so of course

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.030 
then jump up to the top and so of course
that<00:02:46.579> weakened<00:02:47.000> it<00:02:47.120> considerably<00:02:47.829> we<00:02:48.829> made<00:02:49.010> a

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
that weakened it considerably we made a

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.970 
that weakened it considerably we made a
few<00:02:49.340> repairs<00:02:49.699> to<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:50.810> can<00:02:50.930> see<00:02:51.169> we<00:02:51.889> had

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
few repairs to it you can see we had

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.009 
few repairs to it you can see we had
already<00:02:52.159> had<00:02:52.609> to<00:02:52.730> make<00:02:52.939> some<00:02:53.180> shingle<00:02:53.599> repairs

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
already had to make some shingle repairs

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.500 
already had to make some shingle repairs
by<00:02:54.319> putting<00:02:54.650> in<00:02:54.769> screws<00:02:55.010> those<00:02:55.969> staples

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
by putting in screws those staples

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.259 
by putting in screws those staples
didn't<00:02:57.079> stay<00:02:57.709> very<00:02:58.010> well<00:02:58.519> long<00:02:58.730> at<00:02:58.879> all<00:02:59.030> and

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
didn't stay very well long at all and

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.399 
didn't stay very well long at all and
it's<00:03:00.019> a<00:03:00.139> slatted

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
it's a slatted

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:07.030 
it's a slatted
situation<00:03:03.409> and<00:03:04.810> we<00:03:05.810> just<00:03:06.169> put<00:03:06.620> this<00:03:06.709> up<00:03:06.889> there

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
situation and we just put this up there

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.280 
situation and we just put this up there
to<00:03:07.159> just<00:03:07.340> keep<00:03:07.489> them<00:03:07.609> in<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:08.419> the<00:03:08.840> box<00:03:09.019> wasn't

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
to just keep them in the the box wasn't

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.020 
to just keep them in the the box wasn't
a<00:03:09.500> very<00:03:09.620> good<00:03:09.739> design<00:03:10.159> anyway<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.639> bottom<00:03:10.760> was

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
a very good design anyway the bottom was

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.189 
a very good design anyway the bottom was
very<00:03:11.389> very<00:03:11.659> flimsy<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.469> so<00:03:12.709> if<00:03:13.189> it<00:03:13.310> got<00:03:13.489> wet

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:14.199 
very very flimsy and so if it got wet

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.409 
very very flimsy and so if it got wet
from<00:03:15.199> water<00:03:15.590> dripping<00:03:15.919> in<00:03:16.099> or<00:03:16.489> if<00:03:16.939> I<00:03:17.090> put<00:03:17.269> water

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:17.419 
from water dripping in or if I put water

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.030 
from water dripping in or if I put water
in<00:03:17.720> there<00:03:17.930> for<00:03:18.169> them<00:03:18.349> during<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.650> winter<00:03:18.889> and

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
in there for them during the winter and

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.640 
in there for them during the winter and
it<00:03:19.129> got<00:03:19.250> wet<00:03:19.430> it<00:03:20.389> was<00:03:20.509> just<00:03:20.720> soaking<00:03:21.229> and<00:03:21.409> dirty

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
it got wet it was just soaking and dirty

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.009 
it got wet it was just soaking and dirty
you<00:03:21.979> had<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.489> hand<00:03:22.699> clean<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.840> other

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
you had to hand clean that the other

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.409 
you had to hand clean that the other
nice<00:03:24.680> thing<00:03:25.009> about<00:03:25.040> this<00:03:25.430> is<00:03:25.699> that<00:03:25.849> you<00:03:26.030> can

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
nice thing about this is that you can

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.300 
nice thing about this is that you can
these<00:03:27.049> little<00:03:27.139> door<00:03:27.560> poles<00:03:27.769> won't<00:03:27.979> work<00:03:28.129> this

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
these little door poles won't work this

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.640 
these little door poles won't work this
will<00:03:28.459> pop<00:03:28.579> right<00:03:28.699> off<00:03:28.909> but<00:03:29.659> you<00:03:29.810> can<00:03:30.079> reach<00:03:30.409> in

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
will pop right off but you can reach in

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.009

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
tray so you can pull it out not with a

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.050 
tray so you can pull it out not with a
whole<00:03:36.949> lot<00:03:37.069> of<00:03:37.159> hang<00:03:37.310> on<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.519> I<00:03:37.609> kind<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:37.819> remove

it out turn it over wash it off and that
is<00:03:42.530> one<00:03:42.709> nice<00:03:42.889> feature<00:03:43.069> it's<00:03:43.400> metal<00:03:43.879> so<00:03:44.090> it's

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
is one nice feature it's metal so it's

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:45.909 
is one nice feature it's metal so it's
not<00:03:44.419> going<00:03:44.689> to<00:03:44.810> deteriorate<00:03:45.079> like<00:03:45.349> the<00:03:45.739> wood

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:45.919 
not going to deteriorate like the wood

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:51.399 
not going to deteriorate like the wood
did<00:03:47.109> so<00:03:48.109> you<00:03:48.979> know<00:03:49.099> it's<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.569> pros<00:03:50.810> definitely

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
did so you know it's the pros definitely

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.069 
did so you know it's the pros definitely
are<00:03:51.590> it<00:03:52.069> was<00:03:52.220> convenient<00:03:52.639> to<00:03:52.909> get<00:03:53.120> it<00:03:53.419> wasn't

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
are it was convenient to get it wasn't

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.189 
are it was convenient to get it wasn't
that<00:03:54.829> long<00:03:55.099> of<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.310> project<00:03:55.819> to<00:03:55.879> put<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.359> it

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:57.199 
that long of a project to put the it

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:59.709 
that long of a project to put the it
together<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:58.479> instructions<00:03:59.479> weren't

00:03:59.709 --> 00:03:59.719 
together the instructions weren't

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:03.640 
together the instructions weren't
absolutely<00:04:01.299> dead-on<00:04:02.329> so<00:04:02.689> they<00:04:03.259> did<00:04:03.409> have<00:04:03.560> to

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
absolutely dead-on so they did have to

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.369 
absolutely dead-on so they did have to
think<00:04:03.919> but<00:04:04.340> it<00:04:04.430> wasn't<00:04:04.989> extremely<00:04:05.989> difficult

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
think but it wasn't extremely difficult

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.719 
think but it wasn't extremely difficult
and<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:08.269> cons<00:04:08.509> are<00:04:08.780> that<00:04:09.049> it's<00:04:09.199> just<00:04:09.439> not<00:04:09.729> it's

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:10.729 
and the cons are that it's just not it's

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:13.210 
and the cons are that it's just not it's
not<00:04:10.849> going<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.090> stay<00:04:11.329> and

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
not going to stay and

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.580 
not going to stay and
together<00:04:14.000> for<00:04:14.330> very<00:04:14.360> much<00:04:14.720> longer<00:04:14.780> especially

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
together for very much longer especially

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.319 
together for very much longer especially
if<00:04:15.680> we<00:04:15.770> continue<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.220> try<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.489> move<00:04:16.700> it<00:04:16.910> and

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
if we continue to try to move it and

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.289 
if we continue to try to move it and
here's<00:04:17.600> some<00:04:17.900> of<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.910> seven-week-old
