00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
in production yet but I thought that

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.630 
in production yet but I thought that
these<00:01:21.430> were<00:01:21.540> freaking<00:01:22.540> sweet<00:01:23.250> wear<00:01:24.250> tester

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.740 
socks coming soon alright guys here's
the<00:01:26.740> traction<00:01:27.190> real<00:01:27.340> quick<00:01:27.550> and<00:01:27.850> it's<00:01:28.480> it's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
the traction real quick and it's it's

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.510 
the traction real quick and it's it's
herringbone<00:01:29.200> but<00:01:29.380> it<00:01:29.500> is<00:01:29.710> not<00:01:30.070> just

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
herringbone but it is not just

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.030 
herringbone but it is not just
herringbone<00:01:31.000> this<00:01:31.270> is<00:01:31.450> like<00:01:31.780> not<00:01:32.710> dual

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
herringbone this is like not dual

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.560 
herringbone this is like not dual
density<00:01:33.400> but<00:01:33.790> it's<00:01:33.970> just<00:01:34.150> different

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
density but it's just different

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.010 
density but it's just different
like<00:01:34.810> depths<00:01:35.640> or<00:01:36.640> widths<00:01:37.330> I<00:01:37.480> guess<00:01:37.810> would<00:01:37.960> be

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
like depths or widths I guess would be

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.280 
like depths or widths I guess would be
the<00:01:38.320> best<00:01:38.560> way<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.370> put<00:01:39.670> it<00:01:39.730> so<00:01:40.120> you<00:01:40.960> can<00:01:41.110> see

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
the best way to put it so you can see

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.380 
the best way to put it so you can see
you<00:01:41.440> got<00:01:41.560> that<00:01:41.620> thin<00:01:42.130> peaked<00:01:42.700> groove<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.240> got

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
you got that thin peaked groove you got

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.120 
you got that thin peaked groove you got
some<00:01:43.570> flat<00:01:43.870> surfaces<00:01:44.440> you<00:01:44.650> got<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.800> bunch<00:01:45.040> more

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
some flat surfaces you got a bunch more

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.200 
some flat surfaces you got a bunch more
flat<00:01:45.550> surfaces<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:47.680> it's<00:01:48.040> really<00:01:48.340> cool<00:01:48.550> it<00:01:48.850> I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
flat surfaces it's it's really cool it I

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.880 
flat surfaces it's it's really cool it I
think<00:01:49.780> it's<00:01:49.870> going<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.020> play<00:01:50.260> differently

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
think it's going to play differently

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.310 
think it's going to play differently
depending<00:01:51.130> on<00:01:51.430> core<00:01:51.700> conditions<00:01:52.120> so<00:01:52.420> this<00:01:53.140> is

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
depending on core conditions so this is

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.850 
depending on core conditions so this is
for<00:01:54.010> outdoors<00:01:54.550> and<00:01:54.850> indoors<00:01:55.000> or<00:01:55.900> in<00:01:55.930> indoor

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
for outdoors and indoors or in indoor

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.700 
for outdoors and indoors or in indoor
outdoor<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.810> this<00:01:58.960> stuff<00:01:59.200> right<00:01:59.380> here<00:01:59.440> will

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
outdoor so this stuff right here will

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.530 
outdoor so this stuff right here will
grind<00:01:59.980> down<00:02:00.220> quicker<00:02:00.580> on<00:02:00.880> an<00:02:01.030> outdoor<00:02:01.300> setting

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
grind down quicker on an outdoor setting

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.270 
grind down quicker on an outdoor setting
but<00:02:01.840> this<00:02:01.990> stuff<00:02:02.200> here<00:02:02.230> will<00:02:02.530> last<00:02:02.710> longer<00:02:02.980> on

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
but this stuff here will last longer on

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.100 
but this stuff here will last longer on
an<00:02:04.000> outdoor<00:02:04.240> setting<00:02:04.480> and<00:02:04.780> then<00:02:04.870> on<00:02:05.020> the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
an outdoor setting and then on the

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.110 
an outdoor setting and then on the
indoor<00:02:05.410> setting<00:02:05.770> this<00:02:06.340> stuff<00:02:06.580> should<00:02:06.850> perform

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
indoor setting this stuff should perform

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.880 
indoor setting this stuff should perform
really<00:02:07.660> really<00:02:07.900> well<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:08.289> then<00:02:08.440> this<00:02:08.619> part

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
really really well and then this part

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.290 
really really well and then this part
right<00:02:08.979> here<00:02:09.039> will<00:02:09.310> probably<00:02:09.459> clog<00:02:09.940> up<00:02:10.179> a

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
right here will probably clog up a

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.449 
right here will probably clog up a
little<00:02:10.450> bit<00:02:10.629> with<00:02:10.840> some<00:02:10.869> dust<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.769> debris

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
little bit with some dust and and debris

think you got this little dip right here
for<00:02:33.540> some<00:02:33.720> flex<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:35.430> then<00:02:35.550> it's<00:02:35.700> it's<00:02:35.970> Nike

Zoom which you can see right back here

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.520 
Zoom which you can see right back here
and<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.150> heel<00:02:39.390> feels<00:02:39.840> awesome<00:02:40.110> in<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
and the heel feels awesome in the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.440 
and the heel feels awesome in the
forefoot<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.220> doesn't<00:02:41.610> like<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.209> still

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
forefoot it doesn't like you still

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.780 
forefoot it doesn't like you still
doesn't<00:02:42.750> have<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.410> feeling<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:44.490> I'm

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
doesn't have that that feeling that I'm

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.180 
doesn't have that that feeling that I'm
used<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.240> at<00:02:45.450> least<00:02:45.660> from<00:02:45.870> like<00:02:46.080> older<00:02:46.410> zoom<00:02:46.650> so

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
used to at least from like older zoom so

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.350 
used to at least from like older zoom so
I'm<00:02:47.280> pretty<00:02:47.520> sure<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.850> just<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.239> little

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
I'm pretty sure is just that little

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.059 
I'm pretty sure is just that little
rectangle<00:02:48.630> unit<00:02:49.260> right<00:02:49.350> there<00:02:49.410> especially

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
rectangle unit right there especially

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.130 
rectangle unit right there especially
since<00:02:50.880> these<00:02:51.330> are<00:02:51.510> supposed<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.810> be<00:02:51.900> fairly

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
since these are supposed to be fairly

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.229 
since these are supposed to be fairly
flexible<00:02:52.440> up<00:02:52.860> front<00:02:53.130> right<00:02:53.310> there<00:02:53.520> so<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.970> don't

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
flexible up front right there so I don't

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.150 
flexible up front right there so I don't
think<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.540> they<00:02:54.720> would<00:02:54.870> really<00:02:54.900> mess<00:02:55.800> up<00:02:55.860> the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
think that they would really mess up the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.370 
think that they would really mess up the
Flex<00:02:56.489> with<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.700> giant<00:02:57.030> unit<00:02:57.480> there<00:02:57.690> however<00:02:57.930> I

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
Flex with a giant unit there however I

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.690 
Flex with a giant unit there however I
do<00:02:58.739> think<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.190> these<00:02:59.250> are<00:02:59.310> going<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.580> be

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
do think that these are going to be

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.640 
do think that these are going to be
fairly<00:03:00.000> smooth<00:03:00.420> upon<00:03:00.720> transition<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.410> shape

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
fairly smooth upon transition this shape

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.110 
fairly smooth upon transition this shape
right<00:03:01.680> here<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.069> just<00:03:02.100> like<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.670> hyper<00:03:02.850> roof

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
right here is just like the hyper roof

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.970 
right here is just like the hyper roof
so<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.420> think<00:03:03.600> upon<00:03:04.110> landing<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.709> things<00:03:04.860> like

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
so I think upon landing and things like

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.770 
so I think upon landing and things like
that<00:03:05.040> it's<00:03:05.280> gonna<00:03:05.370> have<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:05.610> smooth<00:03:06.060> kind<00:03:06.630> of

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
that it's gonna have that smooth kind of

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.479 
that it's gonna have that smooth kind of
transition<00:03:07.320> from<00:03:07.560> heel<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:07.800> toe<00:03:07.950> which<00:03:08.310> should

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
transition from heel to toe which should

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.490 
transition from heel to toe which should
be<00:03:08.580> cool<00:03:08.790> also<00:03:09.330> this<00:03:09.480> area<00:03:09.690> right<00:03:09.959> here<00:03:10.019> like

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
be cool also this area right here like

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.440 
be cool also this area right here like
wraps<00:03:10.800> up<00:03:11.070> around<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.730> mid<00:03:11.880> foot<00:03:12.060> right<00:03:12.269> there

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
wraps up around the mid foot right there

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.720 
wraps up around the mid foot right there
so<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.660> get<00:03:12.900> nice<00:03:13.140> support<00:03:13.650> that's<00:03:14.430> built

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
so you get nice support that's built

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.460 
so you get nice support that's built
into<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.090> shoes<00:03:15.360> an<00:03:15.660> extra<00:03:16.050> piece<00:03:16.260> or

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
into the shoes an extra piece or

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.750 
into the shoes an extra piece or
anything<00:03:16.650> like<00:03:16.860> that<00:03:16.920> foam<00:03:17.370> is<00:03:17.550> real

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
anything like that foam is real

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.940 
anything like that foam is real
lightweight<00:03:18.180> especially<00:03:18.810> Phylon<00:03:19.560> like<00:03:19.739> this

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
lightweight especially Phylon like this

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.620 
lightweight especially Phylon like this
so<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.430> think<00:03:20.730> that's<00:03:21.060> nice<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.450> they<00:03:21.540> just

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
so I think that's nice that they just

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.420 
so I think that's nice that they just
kind<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.900> incorporated<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:22.950> runs<00:03:23.130> me<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.340> a

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
kind of incorporated it runs me of a

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.309 
kind of incorporated it runs me of a
penny<00:03:23.670> shoe<00:03:23.910> almost<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.660> old<00:03:24.810> school<00:03:25.019> pennies

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
penny shoe almost the old school pennies

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.930 
penny shoe almost the old school pennies
were<00:03:25.920> they<00:03:26.010> had<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.250> wing<00:03:26.430> up<00:03:26.610> there<00:03:26.790> and

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
were they had the wing up there and

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.610 
were they had the wing up there and
everything<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.720> thought<00:03:28.350> that<00:03:28.470> was<00:03:28.530> a

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
everything so I thought that was a

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.320 
everything so I thought that was a
pretty<00:03:28.800> cool<00:03:28.950> touch<00:03:29.190> there's<00:03:29.580> a<00:03:29.640> close<00:03:30.060> shot

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
pretty cool touch there's a close shot

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.570 
pretty cool touch there's a close shot
of<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.750> materials<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.590> reminds<00:03:31.950> me<00:03:32.069> of<00:03:32.190> the

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
of the materials this reminds me of the

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.680 
of the materials this reminds me of the
very<00:03:32.790> first<00:03:33.120> hyper<00:03:33.540> fuse<00:03:35.120> it's<00:03:36.120> just<00:03:36.390> kind<00:03:36.630> of

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
very first hyper fuse it's just kind of

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.780 
very first hyper fuse it's just kind of
got<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:37.049> first<00:03:37.380> gen<00:03:37.650> look<00:03:37.920> but<00:03:38.190> it's<00:03:38.340> nice

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
got that first gen look but it's nice

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.150 
got that first gen look but it's nice
and<00:03:39.000> thick<00:03:39.269> which<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.500> can<00:03:40.680> see<00:03:40.860> right<00:03:41.100> there

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
and thick which you can see right there

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.220 
and thick which you can see right there
so<00:03:41.610> you<00:03:41.700> could<00:03:41.820> see<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.239> base<00:03:42.420> layer<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:43.019> mesh

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
so you could see the base layer the mesh

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.259 
so you could see the base layer the mesh
layer<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.739> then<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.920> top<00:03:44.130> layer<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.640> all

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
layer and then the top layer and all

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.750 
layer and then the top layer and all
together<00:03:45.420> it's<00:03:45.870> like<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:46.079> nice<00:03:46.320> softer<00:03:46.920> kind<00:03:47.640> of

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
together it's like a nice softer kind of

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.819 
together it's like a nice softer kind of
fuse<00:03:48.000> it's<00:03:48.180> flexible<00:03:48.690> but<00:03:48.900> strong<00:03:49.260> so<00:03:49.560> it's

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
fuse it's flexible but strong so it's

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.680 
fuse it's flexible but strong so it's
very<00:03:50.130> similar<00:03:50.610> to<00:03:50.850> what<00:03:51.000> they<00:03:51.150> used<00:03:51.360> on<00:03:51.570> the

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
very similar to what they used on the

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.509 
very similar to what they used on the
LeBron<00:03:52.019> 10<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:52.650> then<00:03:52.920> they've<00:03:53.100> actually

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
LeBron 10 and then they've actually

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.330 
LeBron 10 and then they've actually
incorporated<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.090> lot<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.239> ventilation<00:03:54.630> here

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
incorporated a lot of ventilation here

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.430 
incorporated a lot of ventilation here
which<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.519> something<00:03:56.730> that<00:03:56.850> they<00:03:57.200> it's<00:03:58.200> like<00:03:58.410> a

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
which is something that they it's like a

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.020 
which is something that they it's like a
hit<00:03:58.680> or<00:03:58.799> miss<00:03:58.829> I<00:03:59.160> feel<00:03:59.400> like<00:03:59.579> with<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.790> lot<00:03:59.970> of

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
hit or miss I feel like with a lot of

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.360 
hit or miss I feel like with a lot of
their<00:04:00.269> hyper<00:04:00.720> fused<00:04:01.079> products<00:04:01.590> hyper<00:04:01.890> fuse

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
their hyper fused products hyper fuse

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.310 
their hyper fused products hyper fuse
originally<00:04:02.880> was<00:04:03.000> created<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.630> be<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:04.079> way

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
originally was created to be this way

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.720 
originally was created to be this way
where<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.680> have<00:04:04.829> a<00:04:04.859> base<00:04:05.100> layer<00:04:05.340> for

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
where you have a base layer for

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.550 
where you have a base layer for
structure<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:06.660> have<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.810> mesh<00:04:07.049> layer<00:04:07.260> for

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
structure you have a mesh layer for

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.870 
structure you have a mesh layer for
ventilation<00:04:07.920> then<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.280> have<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.430> top<00:04:08.640> layer

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
ventilation then you have a top layer

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.770 
ventilation then you have a top layer
for<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.510> little<00:04:09.780> bit<00:04:09.870> of<00:04:09.959> extra<00:04:10.200> support<00:04:10.440> and

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
for a little bit of extra support and

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.720 
for a little bit of extra support and
sometimes<00:04:12.780> they'll<00:04:13.019> like<00:04:13.260> do<00:04:13.920> this<00:04:14.160> but<00:04:14.579> then

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
sometimes they'll like do this but then

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.430 
sometimes they'll like do this but then
there<00:04:14.970> would<00:04:15.060> be<00:04:15.090> no<00:04:15.299> ventilation<00:04:15.870> is<00:04:16.169> kind<00:04:16.380> of

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
there would be no ventilation is kind of

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.719 
there would be no ventilation is kind of
like<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.739> just<00:04:16.829> have<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.130> giant<00:04:17.370> plastic

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
like that you just have a giant plastic

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.400 
like that you just have a giant plastic
shoe<00:04:18.180> so<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:18.450> just<00:04:18.660> don't<00:04:18.840> understand<00:04:19.320> the

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
shoe so I just don't understand the

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.469 
shoe so I just don't understand the
point<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:19.680> that<00:04:19.829> so<00:04:20.310> I'm<00:04:20.820> glad<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.060> they<00:04:21.269> went

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
point of that so I'm glad that they went

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.930 
point of that so I'm glad that they went
with<00:04:21.660> this<00:04:21.919> traditional<00:04:22.919> kind<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.430> hyper<00:04:23.610> fuse

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
with this traditional kind of hyper fuse

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.190 
with this traditional kind of hyper fuse
construction<00:04:24.539> where<00:04:24.720> it's<00:04:24.840> actually

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
construction where it's actually

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.620 
construction where it's actually
utilized<00:04:25.620> properly<00:04:26.060> instead<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.210> just<00:04:27.390> being

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
utilized properly instead of just being

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.350 
utilized properly instead of just being
a<00:04:27.870> big<00:04:28.169> one<00:04:28.590> piece<00:04:29.100> of<00:04:29.280> plastic<00:04:29.760> upper<00:04:30.090> then

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
a big one piece of plastic upper then

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.659 
a big one piece of plastic upper then
the<00:04:30.510> back<00:04:30.660> area<00:04:31.020> is<00:04:31.110> just<00:04:31.260> some<00:04:31.470> synthetic<00:04:31.919> you

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
the back area is just some synthetic you

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.279 
the back area is just some synthetic you
got<00:04:32.820> a<00:04:32.850> vent<00:04:33.120> here<00:04:33.360> for<00:04:33.630> ventilation<00:04:33.990> and

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
got a vent here for ventilation and

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.620 
got a vent here for ventilation and
that's<00:04:34.500> also<00:04:34.680> for<00:04:34.979> mobility<00:04:35.280> so<00:04:35.789> if<00:04:36.450> you're

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
that's also for mobility so if you're

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.110 
that's also for mobility so if you're
moving<00:04:36.990> it'll<00:04:37.800> it'll<00:04:38.010> flex<00:04:38.520> with<00:04:38.729> your<00:04:38.760> foot

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
moving it'll it'll flex with your foot

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.610 
moving it'll it'll flex with your foot
and<00:04:39.270> everything<00:04:39.330> in<00:04:39.690> these<00:04:39.810> old<00:04:39.990> pockets<00:04:40.440> here

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
and everything in these old pockets here

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.870 
and everything in these old pockets here
I<00:04:40.650> think<00:04:40.860> are<00:04:40.919> kind<00:04:41.130> of<00:04:41.220> cool<00:04:41.460> because<00:04:41.610> it'll

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
I think are kind of cool because it'll

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.700 
I think are kind of cool because it'll
these<00:04:42.539> that<00:04:42.780> these<00:04:42.990> little<00:04:43.289> right<00:04:43.409> here<00:04:43.530> these

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
these that these little right here these

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.730 
these that these little right here these
ribs<00:04:44.010> because<00:04:44.430> it

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
ribs because it

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.990 
ribs because it
just<00:04:44.860> kind<00:04:45.009> of<00:04:45.069> allow<00:04:45.280> you<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.460> wear<00:04:45.610> an<00:04:45.759> ankle

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
just kind of allow you to wear an ankle

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.540 
just kind of allow you to wear an ankle
brace<00:04:46.180> if<00:04:46.360> you<00:04:46.690> haven't<00:04:46.930> already<00:04:46.990> wear<00:04:47.289> one<00:04:47.550> so

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
brace if you haven't already wear one so

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.620 
brace if you haven't already wear one so
I<00:04:48.819> think<00:04:48.970> that's<00:04:49.210> neat

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
I think that's neat

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.029 
I think that's neat
I<00:04:49.660> think<00:04:50.050> these<00:04:50.110> actually<00:04:50.470> look<00:04:50.680> good<00:04:50.830> too

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
I think these actually look good too

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.650 
I think these actually look good too
from<00:04:51.250> a<00:04:51.340> visual<00:04:51.550> perspective<00:04:51.940> which<00:04:52.449> some

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
from a visual perspective which some

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.270 
from a visual perspective which some
people<00:04:52.930> actually<00:04:53.050> disagree<00:04:53.620> like<00:04:53.800> they<00:04:54.039> think

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
people actually disagree like they think

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.650 
people actually disagree like they think
that<00:04:54.370> these<00:04:54.490> are<00:04:54.550> hideous<00:04:54.789> I<00:04:55.060> don't<00:04:55.509> think

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
that these are hideous I don't think

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.870 
that these are hideous I don't think
honestly<00:04:56.169> I<00:04:56.440> don't<00:04:56.650> see<00:04:57.039> too<00:04:57.520> much<00:04:57.669> of<00:04:57.819> a

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
honestly I don't see too much of a

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
honestly I don't see too much of a
difference<00:04:57.970> between<00:04:58.389> this<00:04:58.569> and<00:04:58.630> like<00:04:58.870> a

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
difference between this and like a

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.469 
difference between this and like a
little<00:04:58.990> Brown<00:04:59.289> 12<00:04:59.590> so<00:05:00.160> to<00:05:00.789> me<00:05:00.940> that's<00:05:01.180> kind<00:05:01.360> of

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
little Brown 12 so to me that's kind of

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:02.939 
little Brown 12 so to me that's kind of
like<00:05:01.630> well<00:05:01.900> they<00:05:02.050> look<00:05:02.259> similar<00:05:02.500> and<00:05:02.830> all<00:05:02.919> I

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
like well they look similar and all I

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.640 
like well they look similar and all I
said<00:05:03.039> the<00:05:03.340> shape<00:05:03.520> is<00:05:03.699> similar<00:05:03.849> and<00:05:04.410> all<00:05:05.410> that

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
said the shape is similar and all that

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.610 
said the shape is similar and all that
stuff<00:05:05.889> so<00:05:05.919> I<00:05:06.160> think<00:05:06.580> for<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.720> amount<00:05:07.990> of<00:05:08.080> money

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
stuff so I think for the amount of money

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.930 
stuff so I think for the amount of money
that<00:05:08.770> these<00:05:08.919> costs<00:05:09.340> I<00:05:09.400> think<00:05:09.430> this<00:05:09.669> is<00:05:09.789> going

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
that these costs I think this is going

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
here's this one more quick look I think

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.890 
here's this one more quick look I think
these<00:05:38.560> are<00:05:38.620> cool<00:05:39.210> this<00:05:40.210> colorway<00:05:40.569> and<00:05:40.690> then

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
these are cool this colorway and then

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.839 
these are cool this colorway and then
there's<00:05:41.050> one<00:05:41.229> with<00:05:41.409> like<00:05:41.560> a<00:05:41.590> red<00:05:41.919> and<00:05:42.130> then<00:05:42.430> a

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849 
there's one with like a red and then a

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.460 
there's one with like a red and then a
black<00:05:43.360> right<00:05:43.599> here<00:05:43.780> and<00:05:43.870> then<00:05:43.960> I<00:05:44.050> think<00:05:44.199> a<00:05:44.289> red

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
black right here and then I think a red

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.890 
black right here and then I think a red
bottom<00:05:44.849> these<00:05:45.849> are<00:05:46.000> the<00:05:46.120> two<00:05:46.270> colorways<00:05:46.569> like

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
bottom these are the two colorways like

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.260 
bottom these are the two colorways like
this<00:05:47.080> one<00:05:47.229> and<00:05:47.380> that<00:05:47.470> one<00:05:47.530> I<00:05:47.860> think<00:05:48.340> are<00:05:48.490> best

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
this one and that one I think are best

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.570 
this one and that one I think are best
and<00:05:49.599> just<00:05:50.050> my<00:05:50.320> opinion<00:05:50.680> and<00:05:51.310> they<00:05:51.430> have<00:05:51.520> a

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
and just my opinion and they have a

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.370 
and just my opinion and they have a
basic<00:05:51.880> all-black<00:05:52.240> one<00:05:52.509> like<00:05:52.719> I<00:05:52.900> know<00:05:53.050> people

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349 
can kind of beat them up a little bit
