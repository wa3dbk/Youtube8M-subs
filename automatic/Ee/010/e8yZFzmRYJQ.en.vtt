00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
kind of ecology of what we think of as

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.259 
kind of ecology of what we think of as
the<00:00:17.769> art<00:00:17.920> world<00:00:18.189> and<00:00:18.369> I<00:00:18.400> say<00:00:18.670> that<00:00:18.849> because<00:00:19.000> I

the art world and I say that because I

the art world and I say that because I
feel<00:00:19.630> like<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.980> role<00:00:21.189> of<00:00:21.369> the<00:00:21.519> curator<00:00:21.670> has

feel like the role of the curator has

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.640 
feel like the role of the curator has

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
shifted an enormous sea if we think even

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.189 
shifted an enormous sea if we think even
of<00:00:23.920> the<00:00:24.039> last<00:00:24.250> decade<00:00:24.699> and<00:00:24.730> you<00:00:25.029> your<00:00:25.240> self

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.300 
seen and I really think the role of the
curator<00:00:58.570> has<00:00:58.780> changed<00:00:59.260> in<00:00:59.440> this<00:00:59.590> time<00:00:59.860> and<00:01:00.070> so

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
curator has changed in this time and so

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.910 
curator has changed in this time and so
I'd<00:01:00.400> love<00:01:00.550> to<00:01:00.610> hear<00:01:00.880> your<00:01:01.060> well<00:01:01.570> I<00:01:02.080> don't<00:01:02.800> quite

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.499 
I'd love to hear your well I don't quite
know<00:01:03.250> if<00:01:03.370> the<00:01:03.490> role<00:01:03.640> of<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.880> curator<00:01:04.030> has

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
know if the role of the curator has

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:11.969 
know if the role of the curator has
changed<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:10.659> was<00:01:10.990> Heisley<00:01:11.500> I<00:01:11.530> think<00:01:11.770> of<00:01:11.890> the

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
changed it was Heisley I think of the

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:18.300 
changed it was Heisley I think of the
world<00:01:12.250> around<00:01:12.579> the<00:01:12.789> curator<00:01:16.619> has<00:01:17.619> changed<00:01:18.219> and

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
world around the curator has changed and

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.929 
world around the curator has changed and
is<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:18.670> is<00:01:19.359> changing<00:01:20.049> and<00:01:20.890> I<00:01:21.009> think<00:01:21.219> it<00:01:21.369> might

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
is and is changing and I think it might

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:23.880 
is and is changing and I think it might
be<00:01:21.969> interesting<00:01:22.390> you<00:01:22.869> know<00:01:23.020> in<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.649> sense

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
be interesting you know in the sense

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.639 
be interesting you know in the sense
that<00:01:23.979> for<00:01:24.280> me<00:01:24.460> I<00:01:24.640> never<00:01:25.179> considered<00:01:26.079> myself<00:01:26.259> an

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
that for me I never considered myself an

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.410 
that for me I never considered myself an
independent<00:01:27.219> curator<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:30.210> considered<00:01:31.210> myself

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
independent curator I considered myself

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.120 
independent curator I considered myself
an<00:01:32.429> unaffiliated<00:01:33.429> curator<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:35.259> I<00:01:35.679> say<00:01:35.950> this

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
an unaffiliated curator and I say this

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.889 
an unaffiliated curator and I say this
is<00:01:36.369> simply<00:01:36.729> to<00:01:36.850> illuminate<00:01:37.630> the

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
is simply to illuminate the

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.980 
is simply to illuminate the
contradictions<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:39.069> exists<00:01:39.850> between<00:01:40.090> the

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
contradictions that exists between the

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.169 
contradictions that exists between the
claim<00:01:41.289> for<00:01:41.530> independence<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:42.549> the<00:01:42.729> fact<00:01:42.999> that

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
claim for independence and the fact that

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.249 
claim for independence and the fact that
you<00:01:44.139> know<00:01:45.240> being<00:01:46.240> an<00:01:46.389> independent<00:01:46.600> curator

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
you know being an independent curator

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.940 
you know being an independent curator
sort<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.189> sometimes<00:01:49.229> smacks<00:01:50.229> too<00:01:50.439> much<00:01:50.710> like

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
sort of sometimes smacks too much like

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.779 
sort of sometimes smacks too much like
hustling<00:01:51.609> for<00:01:52.060> work<00:01:52.329> you<00:01:53.200> know<00:01:53.409> and<00:01:53.649> and<00:01:54.579> I

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
hustling for work you know and and I

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.550 
hustling for work you know and and I
think<00:01:54.850> that<00:01:55.389> it<00:01:55.539> kind<00:01:55.719> of<00:01:55.840> brings<00:01:56.109> up<00:01:56.380> the

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
think that it kind of brings up the

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.699 
think that it kind of brings up the
question<00:01:56.740> of<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:58.329> power<00:01:58.539> of<00:01:58.810> institutions

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
question of the power of institutions

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.510 
question of the power of institutions
the<00:02:00.280> power<00:02:00.520> of<00:02:00.729> nomination<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:02.079> say<00:02:02.350> you<00:02:03.310> know

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
the power of nomination to say you know

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.389 
the power of nomination to say you know
here<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:04.780> like<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:05.409> mentioned<00:02:05.859> the<00:02:05.950> platform

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
here is like you mentioned the platform

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.969 
here is like you mentioned the platform
is<00:02:06.549> space<00:02:06.880> in<00:02:07.149> which<00:02:07.359> to<00:02:07.420> act<00:02:07.869> so<00:02:08.800> I'm

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
is space in which to act so I'm

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.370 
is space in which to act so I'm
interested<00:02:09.430> in<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.570> kind<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:10.930> spaces<00:02:11.350> in

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
interested in the kind of spaces in

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.780 
interested in the kind of spaces in
which<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.770> curator<00:02:12.100> can

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
which a curator can

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.880 
which a curator can
rather<00:02:13.750> than<00:02:13.989> simply<00:02:14.560> did<00:02:14.800> they<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:17.680> way

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
rather than simply did they the the way

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.160 
rather than simply did they the the way
in<00:02:18.099> which<00:02:18.310> we<00:02:18.489> finna<00:02:18.819> ties<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.090> condition<00:02:19.989> or

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
in which we finna ties a condition or

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.979 
in which we finna ties a condition or
they<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:21.310> know<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.730> employment<00:02:22.540> condition

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
they you know the employment condition

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.979 
they you know the employment condition
of<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.230> curator<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.459> where<00:02:25.360> what<00:02:25.720> is<00:02:25.750> the

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
of the curator so where what is the

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.710 
of the curator so where what is the
space<00:02:26.349> in<00:02:26.650> which<00:02:26.890> one<00:02:27.129> can<00:02:27.340> act<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:28.690> think

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
space in which one can act and I think

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.580 
space in which one can act and I think
that<00:02:29.349> for<00:02:29.620> me<00:02:29.769> is<00:02:29.980> really<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.870> know<00:02:31.900> essential

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
that for me is really you know essential

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
least from my perspective when I started

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.990 
least from my perspective when I started
I<00:03:34.980> always<00:03:36.419> had<00:03:37.500> what<00:03:38.500> I<00:03:38.530> thought<00:03:38.739> was<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.549> change

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
I always had what I thought was a change

I always had what I thought was a change
agenda<00:03:40.599> and<00:03:40.930> that<00:03:41.919> needed<00:03:42.639> certain<00:03:43.209> type<00:03:43.419> of

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
agenda and that needed certain type of

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.520

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
hospitable to that and I think we are we

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.349 
hospitable to that and I think we are we
have<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.530> give<00:03:51.250> thought<00:03:51.579> to<00:03:51.609> the<00:03:51.730> fact<00:03:52.060> that<00:03:52.150> we

have to give thought to the fact that we

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.020 
have to give thought to the fact that we
need<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.750> open<00:03:53.109> up<00:03:53.230> those<00:03:53.440> spaces<00:03:53.560> again<00:03:54.190> in

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
need to open up those spaces again in

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.680 
need to open up those spaces again in
order<00:03:55.419> to<00:03:55.660> allow<00:03:56.109> you<00:03:57.069> know<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:58.000> know<00:03:58.180> spaces

in which curators can act not just

I<00:04:02.950> think<00:04:03.609> the<00:04:03.819> institution<00:04:04.599> is<00:04:04.780> very

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
I think the institution is very

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.259 
I think the institution is very
important<00:04:05.739> but<00:04:06.310> I'm<00:04:06.430> also<00:04:06.609> interested<00:04:06.910> in<00:04:07.150> the

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
important but I'm also interested in the

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.689 
important but I'm also interested in the

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
politics of the institution itself so

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.360 
politics of the institution itself so
when<00:04:10.060> when<00:04:10.480> you<00:04:11.379> know<00:04:11.530> when<00:04:11.889> you<00:04:12.069> take<00:04:12.310> over

much<00:04:50.150> interested<00:04:50.930> in<00:04:51.139> this<00:04:52.039> notion<00:04:52.520> of<00:04:53.409> you

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 
much interested in this notion of you

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:59.619 
much interested in this notion of you
know<00:04:54.999> reclaim<00:04:55.999> in<00:04:56.180> this<00:04:56.360> space<00:04:56.949> again<00:04:57.949> I<00:04:58.729> think

00:04:59.619 --> 00:04:59.629 
know reclaim in this space again I think

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:01.990 
know reclaim in this space again I think
that<00:04:59.779> the<00:04:59.900> you<00:05:00.169> the<00:05:00.800> ecology<00:05:01.610> of<00:05:01.639> the<00:05:01.789> art

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
that the you the ecology of the art

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.059 
that the you the ecology of the art
world<00:05:02.240> is<00:05:02.389> very<00:05:02.599> complex<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:03.500> I<00:05:03.560> think<00:05:03.590> it's

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:04.069 
world is very complex and I think it's

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.540 
world is very complex and I think it's
all<00:05:04.340> of<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.789> above<00:05:04.819> it<00:05:05.629> doesn't<00:05:06.050> exclude

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
all of the above it doesn't exclude

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.890 
all of the above it doesn't exclude
private<00:05:07.550> collectors<00:05:08.090> it<00:05:08.300> doesn't<00:05:08.569> exclude

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
private collectors it doesn't exclude

you<00:05:14.389> know<00:05:14.539> the<00:05:14.750> market<00:05:15.229> and<00:05:15.409> so<00:05:15.590> on<00:05:15.620> but<00:05:15.919> I

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
you know the market and so on but I

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.040 
you know the market and so on but I
think<00:05:16.099> we<00:05:16.400> need<00:05:16.639> to<00:05:16.819> you<00:05:17.120> know<00:05:17.240> you<00:05:17.539> know<00:05:17.689> you

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
think we need to you know you know you

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.480 
think we need to you know you know you
know<00:05:18.110> give<00:05:18.409> thought<00:05:18.770> to<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:19.069> fact<00:05:19.310> that

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
know give thought to the fact that

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.209 
know give thought to the fact that
there's<00:05:19.789> been<00:05:19.849> a<00:05:20.120> a<00:05:20.439> diminution<00:05:21.439> of<00:05:21.560> spaces

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:22.219 
there's been a a diminution of spaces

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:24.519 
there's been a a diminution of spaces
where<00:05:22.430> one<00:05:22.699> can<00:05:22.909> act<00:05:23.180> where<00:05:23.509> this<00:05:23.749> agenda<00:05:24.199> can

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:24.529 
where one can act where this agenda can

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:28.570 
where one can act where this agenda can
be<00:05:24.710> can<00:05:25.219> be<00:05:25.339> put<00:05:25.550> forward<00:05:26.589> maybe<00:05:27.589> when<00:05:28.339> you

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
be can be put forward maybe when you

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.659 
be can be put forward maybe when you

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
to think that you can act and and I

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.249 
to think that you can act and and I
suppose<00:05:44.210> this<00:05:44.419> was<00:05:44.599> the<00:05:44.750> same<00:05:44.960> thing<00:05:45.139> that

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
suppose this was the same thing that

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:47.469 
suppose this was the same thing that
happened<00:05:45.589> with<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:45.830> generation<00:05:46.759> of<00:05:46.879> curators

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
happened with the generation of curators

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.689 
happened with the generation of curators
that<00:05:47.509> I<00:05:47.779> grew<00:05:48.080> up<00:05:48.169> with<00:05:48.229> that<00:05:48.949> you<00:05:49.370> know<00:05:49.490> there

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
that I grew up with that you know there

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.879 
that I grew up with that you know there
was<00:05:49.849> you<00:05:50.629> know<00:05:50.689> there<00:05:51.259> was<00:05:51.589> a<00:05:51.649> kind<00:05:51.830> of

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889 
was you know there was a kind of

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.579 
was you know there was a kind of
compelling<00:05:52.279> reason<00:05:52.849> to<00:05:52.879> act<00:05:53.180> but<00:05:53.419> now<00:05:53.719> a<00:05:54.080> lot

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:54.589 
compelling reason to act but now a lot

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:57.969 
compelling reason to act but now a lot
of<00:05:54.620> this<00:05:54.889> seems<00:05:55.189> so<00:05:55.639> studied<00:05:56.539> you<00:05:57.439> know<00:05:57.500> that

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
of this seems so studied you know that

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.300 
of this seems so studied you know that
every<00:05:58.879> project<00:05:59.240> seems<00:05:59.719> like<00:05:59.960> you<00:06:00.919> know<00:06:01.069> like

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
every project seems like you know like

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.300 
every project seems like you know like
an<00:06:02.000> interview<00:06:02.659> for<00:06:02.930> a<00:06:03.020> job<00:06:03.159> you<00:06:04.159> know

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
an interview for a job you know

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.540 
an interview for a job you know
somewhere<00:06:05.120> I<00:06:05.180> can<00:06:05.569> show<00:06:05.839> that<00:06:06.080> you<00:06:06.229> have<00:06:06.550> your

you have the right kind of you know
obviously<00:06:13.789> critique<00:06:14.270> but<00:06:14.449> it's<00:06:14.569> just<00:06:14.719> simply

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
obviously critique but it's just simply

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.740 
obviously critique but it's just simply
an<00:06:15.199> observation<00:06:15.889> you<00:06:16.129> know<00:06:16.610> so<00:06:16.819> how<00:06:17.180> to<00:06:17.449> think

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
an observation you know so how to think

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.899 
an observation you know so how to think
about<00:06:17.990> this<00:06:18.139> thing<00:06:18.199> so<00:06:18.620> that's<00:06:18.860> the<00:06:19.580> one<00:06:19.759> thing

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:19.909 
about this thing so that's the one thing

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:22.179 
about this thing so that's the one thing
down<00:06:20.120> I<00:06:20.419> will<00:06:21.020> talk<00:06:21.199> about<00:06:21.229> what<00:06:21.620> is<00:06:21.710> the<00:06:21.830> space

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:22.189 
down I will talk about what is the space

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:25.899 
down I will talk about what is the space
in<00:06:22.849> which<00:06:22.879> one<00:06:23.360> can<00:06:23.569> act
