00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.850
We will go  to Spain, in trains

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.300
we'll go shopping in Bahrain, Insane? Bahrain- 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.280
You'll see if we don't!		

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:42.970
We are young, we'll find, our way!  	 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.220
No one else can lead our life for us.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.760
We'll explore  Ukraine, Ukraine! 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.040
We'll gallop troikas on the plain-   

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.000
We will, you'll see my love!	

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.210
We will share the pain of love our gain

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:17.420
will be our love to share with children-	

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.800
flowers of amaranth- (unfading)		   

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.240
This is my promise love-	 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:44.270
I promise to be	true to you for	ever, 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.710
come what may- Lord. 										 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.410
I know that we can go somewhere-	 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:32.770
without running the gauntlet of hatred's dance,	 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.890
Our only chance-		

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.930
Sarajevo never will be safe, 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.650
and we will be happy  in the West,  

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.940
only a bullet could	separate us.	 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:14.000
You are my only	happiness!		

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.560
When will this wretched war end? 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.640
I can't believe the suffering and dying	

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.100
Why do our neighbours betray us?   

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.620
What crimes do they lay	at the feet	of children?	

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.980
Oh! No, 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:49.240
not in my beautiful Sarajevo

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.880
No, not in my beautiful

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.480
Sarajevo
