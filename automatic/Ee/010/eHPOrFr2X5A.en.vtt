not<00:00:49.200> even<00:00:49.350> kidding<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.640> hard<00:00:50.850> for

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
not even kidding and that is hard for

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.389 
not even kidding and that is hard for
the<00:00:51.090> server<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.329> keep<00:00:51.539> up<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.710> yeah<00:00:52.920> 50<00:00:53.309> to

the server to keep up with so yeah 50 to

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.770 
the server to keep up with so yeah 50 to
100<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:53.969> what<00:00:54.149> i<00:00:54.180> would<00:00:54.300> recommend<00:00:54.329> because

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
100 is what i would recommend because

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.330 
100 is what i would recommend because
otherwise<00:00:55.140> people<00:00:55.289> are<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.070> teleport

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
otherwise people are going to teleport

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.029 
otherwise people are going to teleport
and<00:00:56.730> that's<00:00:57.090> not<00:00:57.180> cool<00:00:57.480> um<00:00:57.780> i<00:00:58.410> would<00:00:58.680> recommend

and that's not cool um i would recommend

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.650 
and that's not cool um i would recommend
putting<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.300> obvious

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660
