of see where it was dyed and videos not
so<00:01:06.150> much<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.570> natural<00:01:07.080> lighting<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:08.040> um<00:01:08.310> it'll

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
so much in natural lighting but um it'll

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.640 
so much in natural lighting but um it'll

makes<00:02:03.659> about<00:02:03.869> six<00:02:04.140> inches<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.890> year<00:02:04.920> which<00:02:05.430> is

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
makes about six inches a year which is

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.410 
makes about six inches a year which is
not<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:07.350> much<00:02:07.380> as<00:02:07.649> we<00:02:07.799> would<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
not as much as we would like so the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.449 
not as much as we would like so the
first<00:02:09.450> month<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.170> got<00:02:10.289> about<00:02:10.500> an<00:02:10.649> inch<00:02:10.739> which<00:02:11.250> is

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
first month I got about an inch which is

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.320 
first month I got about an inch which is
good

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
good

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.540 
good
I<00:02:12.360> would<00:02:13.290> have<00:02:13.380> preferred<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.770> little<00:02:14.010> more<00:02:14.250> but

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
I would have preferred a little more but

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.150 
I would have preferred a little more but
I<00:02:14.580> guess<00:02:14.820> I<00:02:14.970> can't<00:02:15.240> do<00:02:15.480> much<00:02:16.320> about<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.620> beggars

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
I guess I can't do much about it beggars

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.520 
I guess I can't do much about it beggars
can't<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:17.460> choosers<00:02:17.850> aam<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.360> then<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.930> the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
can't be choosers aam and then in the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.290 
can't be choosers aam and then in the
past<00:02:19.710> two<00:02:20.040> weeks<00:02:20.310> I've<00:02:20.550> got<00:02:21.110> um<00:02:22.760> I'd<00:02:23.760> say<00:02:23.820> about

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
past two weeks I've got um I'd say about

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.910 
past two weeks I've got um I'd say about
a<00:02:24.600> quarter<00:02:25.530> inch<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:27.720> have<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.530> admit<00:02:28.770> that

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
a quarter inch and I have to admit that

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.620 
a quarter inch and I have to admit that
I<00:02:28.980> have<00:02:29.160> been<00:02:29.340> slacking<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.850> little<00:02:29.880> bit<00:02:30.120> after

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
I have been slacking a little bit after

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.540 
I have been slacking a little bit after
the<00:02:31.080> first<00:02:31.320> month<00:02:31.650> I've<00:02:31.860> probably<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.460> the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
the first month I've probably in the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.040 
the first month I've probably in the
last<00:02:32.640> two<00:02:32.910> weeks<00:02:32.940> applied<00:02:33.480> Monistat<00:02:34.050> maybe

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
last two weeks applied Monistat maybe

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.260 
last two weeks applied Monistat maybe
four<00:02:37.050> or<00:02:37.080> five<00:02:37.350> times<00:02:37.710> just<00:02:38.280> because<00:02:38.610> lately

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
four or five times just because lately

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.030 
four or five times just because lately
if<00:02:39.510> you've<00:02:39.630> noticed<00:02:39.810> I've<00:02:40.110> had<00:02:40.290> my<00:02:40.440> extensions

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
if you've noticed I've had my extensions

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.980 
if you've noticed I've had my extensions
in<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.520> it's<00:02:41.670> kind<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.090> difficult<00:02:42.570> for<00:02:42.630> me<00:02:42.870> to

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
in so it's kind of difficult for me to

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.790 
in so it's kind of difficult for me to
get<00:02:43.170> really<00:02:43.700> back<00:02:44.700> in<00:02:44.910> there<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.470> whatever<00:02:46.470> so

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
get really back in there and whatever so

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.410 
get really back in there and whatever so
I've<00:02:46.890> been<00:02:47.460> kind<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.700> avoiding<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.240> guess

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
I've been kind of avoiding it I guess

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.990 
I've been kind of avoiding it I guess
but<00:02:48.690> anyway<00:02:49.310> I'll<00:02:50.310> shut<00:02:50.610> up<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.910> I'll<00:02:50.970> show

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
but anyway I'll shut up and I'll show

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.900 
but anyway I'll shut up and I'll show
you<00:02:51.210> guys<00:02:52.430> how<00:02:53.430> it's<00:02:53.610> looking<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.960> there<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:56.100> is

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910

where<00:03:19.020> it<00:03:19.650> was<00:03:20.130> I<00:03:20.430> had<00:03:20.670> about<00:03:20.910> a<00:03:21.110> maybe<00:03:22.110> half

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
where it was I had about a maybe half

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.500 
where it was I had about a maybe half
inch<00:03:22.740> to<00:03:22.860> an<00:03:23.070> inch<00:03:23.280> of<00:03:23.490> outgrowth<00:03:24.210> when<00:03:24.480> I

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
inch to an inch of outgrowth when I

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.110 
inch to an inch of outgrowth when I
began<00:03:24.990> so<00:03:25.850> you<00:03:26.850> can<00:03:27.000> kind<00:03:27.240> of<00:03:27.360> see<00:03:28.020> from<00:03:28.050> where

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
began so you can kind of see from where

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.500 
began so you can kind of see from where
there's<00:03:30.120> where<00:03:30.510> I<00:03:30.540> actually<00:03:30.960> had<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.350> good

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
there's where I actually had a good

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.660 
there's where I actually had a good
dyeing<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.810> then<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:34.950> about<00:03:35.130> right<00:03:35.190> here

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
dyeing and then so about right here

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.720 
dyeing and then so about right here
where<00:03:35.850> my<00:03:35.880> finger<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.330> is<00:03:36.660> where<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.560> began<00:03:37.980> so

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
where my finger is is where I began so

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.820 
where my finger is is where I began so
all<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.780> new<00:03:41.150> I'd<00:03:42.150> say<00:03:42.420> from<00:03:42.480> there<00:03:43.140> this

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
all this is new I'd say from there this

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.800 
all this is new I'd say from there this
is<00:03:44.010> all<00:03:44.190> new<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:44.760> I'd<00:03:45.120> say<00:03:45.300> it's<00:03:45.450> about<00:03:45.600> an<00:03:45.750> inch

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
is all new so I'd say it's about an inch

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.400 
is all new so I'd say it's about an inch
and<00:03:46.050> a<00:03:46.080> half<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.880> then<00:03:47.930> you<00:03:48.930> can<00:03:49.050> see<00:03:49.230> where<00:03:49.380> I

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
and a half and then you can see where I

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.520 
and a half and then you can see where I
died<00:03:49.680> over<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.550> then<00:03:50.790> this<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:52.020> really<00:03:52.320> dark

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
died over and then this the really dark

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.470 
died over and then this the really dark
obviously<00:03:53.130> you<00:03:53.190> can<00:03:53.340> see<00:03:53.550> where<00:03:54.330> that<00:03:54.420> is

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
obviously you can see where that is

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.950 
obviously you can see where that is
that's<00:03:55.140> two<00:03:55.500> weeks<00:03:55.740> of<00:03:55.980> growth<00:03:56.660> so<00:03:57.660> that's

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
that's two weeks of growth so that's

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.060 
that's two weeks of growth so that's
almost<00:03:59.810> about<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:00.870> quarter<00:04:01.230> inch<00:04:01.350> like<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:01.800> said

in two weeks and like I said I've been
slacking<00:04:05.190> so<00:04:06.180> um<00:04:06.690> I<00:04:07.250> mean<00:04:08.250> still<00:04:08.550> for<00:04:08.790> two

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
slacking so um I mean still for two

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.940 
slacking so um I mean still for two
weeks<00:04:09.150> that's<00:04:09.330> pretty<00:04:09.600> good<00:04:10.080> I'd<00:04:10.380> say<00:04:10.650> so

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
weeks that's pretty good I'd say so

is right now and I was I assume it was
about<00:05:12.490> here<00:05:13.170> when<00:05:14.170> I<00:05:14.200> started<00:05:15.030> but<00:05:16.030> like<00:05:16.180> I

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
about here when I started but like I

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.720

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
tricky and um depending on just your

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.510 
tricky and um depending on just your
body<00:05:57.430> um<00:05:57.850> how<00:05:58.120> I<00:05:58.480> mean<00:05:58.750> you<00:05:58.840> know<00:05:58.960> your<00:05:59.140> body

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
like pretty fast then you're probably

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.650

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
going to get a lot better results just

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.060 
going to get a lot better results just

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
between this range for about four or

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.490 
between this range for about four or
five<00:06:31.960> years<00:06:32.130> I've<00:06:33.130> tried<00:06:33.460> to<00:06:33.520> grow<00:06:33.850> my<00:06:34.030> hair<00:06:34.500> so

five years I've tried to grow my hair so

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.719 
five years I've tried to grow my hair so
many<00:06:35.770> times

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
many times

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.510 
many times
it<00:06:37.539> used<00:06:37.749> to<00:06:37.930> be<00:06:38.050> down<00:06:38.229> to<00:06:38.469> about<00:06:38.680> my<00:06:38.830> ribs<00:06:39.159> but

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
it used to be down to about my ribs but

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.459 
it used to be down to about my ribs but
of<00:06:39.729> course<00:06:40.030> that<00:06:40.330> was<00:06:40.479> before<00:06:40.629> I<00:06:41.139> started

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:41.469 
of course that was before I started

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:42.839 
of course that was before I started
dyeing<00:06:41.710> my<00:06:41.889> hair<00:06:41.919> and<00:06:42.340> straightening<00:06:42.699> my<00:06:42.819> hair

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:42.849 
dyeing my hair and straightening my hair

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:44.730 
dyeing my hair and straightening my hair
and<00:06:43.270> like<00:06:43.509> it<00:06:43.749> was<00:06:43.930> like<00:06:44.080> in<00:06:44.199> fifth<00:06:44.439> grade<00:06:44.650> when

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
and like it was like in fifth grade when

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.219 
and like it was like in fifth grade when
I<00:06:44.849> wore<00:06:45.849> it<00:06:45.909> in<00:06:45.999> a<00:06:46.029> ponytail<00:06:46.360> every<00:06:46.810> single<00:06:47.139> day

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:47.229 
I wore it in a ponytail every single day

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:48.689 
I wore it in a ponytail every single day
like<00:06:47.529> of<00:06:47.740> course<00:06:47.949> it's<00:06:48.099> going<00:06:48.219> to<00:06:48.279> be<00:06:48.490> super

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:48.699 
like of course it's going to be super

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:51.390 
like of course it's going to be super
long<00:06:48.939> and<00:06:48.999> healthy<00:06:49.419> but<00:06:50.069> we<00:06:51.069> don't<00:06:51.249> always

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
long and healthy but we don't always

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.610 
long and healthy but we don't always
treat<00:06:51.789> our<00:06:51.939> hair<00:06:52.120> the<00:06:52.270> best<00:06:52.449> so<00:06:52.840> hopefully<00:06:53.469> um

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
treat our hair the best so hopefully um

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.409 
treat our hair the best so hopefully um
smort<00:06:56.620> sooner<00:06:57.039> more<00:06:57.249> than<00:06:57.430> later<00:06:57.699> my<00:06:58.120> hair

00:06:58.409 --> 00:06:58.419 
smort sooner more than later my hair

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.969 
smort sooner more than later my hair

I<00:07:16.599> do<00:07:16.719> recommend<00:07:17.469> using<00:07:17.889> the<00:07:18.340> Monistat<00:07:18.849> if

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 
I do recommend using the Monistat if

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.490 
I do recommend using the Monistat if
you're<00:07:19.360> comfortable<00:07:19.569> with<00:07:19.930> it<00:07:20.080> I<00:07:20.169> know<00:07:20.199> some

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:20.500 
you're comfortable with it I know some

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.869 
you're comfortable with it I know some
people<00:07:20.650> are<00:07:20.860> like<00:07:21.009> that's<00:07:21.219> freaking<00:07:21.639> weird

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:21.879 
people are like that's freaking weird

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:23.939 
people are like that's freaking weird
but<00:07:22.210> it<00:07:22.629> works<00:07:22.870> so<00:07:23.229> if<00:07:23.349> you<00:07:23.469> want<00:07:23.620> to<00:07:23.650> try<00:07:23.889> it

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:23.949 
but it works so if you want to try it

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:26.730 
but it works so if you want to try it
then<00:07:24.310> go<00:07:25.090> for<00:07:25.389> it<00:07:25.509> because<00:07:25.659> this<00:07:26.289> is<00:07:26.439> probably

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:26.740 
then go for it because this is probably

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.689 
then go for it because this is probably
the<00:07:26.889> fastest<00:07:27.279> my<00:07:27.460> hair's<00:07:27.729> grown<00:07:27.969> in<00:07:28.120> years<00:07:28.599> and
