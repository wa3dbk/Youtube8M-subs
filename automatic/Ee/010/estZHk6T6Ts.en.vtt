I'll be looking at that in a couple of

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.410

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
these for a bit and I thought I would

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.530 
these for a bit and I thought I would
share<00:00:38.460> my<00:00:38.670> thoughts<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:39.210> them

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
share my thoughts on them

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.049 
share my thoughts on them
first<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.559> all<00:00:40.710> they<00:00:41.460> look<00:00:41.640> pretty<00:00:41.910> cool

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
first of all they look pretty cool

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.910 
first of all they look pretty cool
together<00:00:42.600> there's<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.989> little<00:00:43.290> group<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
together there's a little group the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.510 
together there's a little group the
three<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.280> them<00:00:44.430> they<00:00:45.149> look<00:00:45.360> pretty<00:00:45.600> ace<00:00:46.520> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
three of them they look pretty ace the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.430 
three of them they look pretty ace the
two<00:00:47.700> foot<00:00:47.940> soldiers<00:00:48.360> are<00:00:48.570> fundamentally<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
two foot soldiers are fundamentally the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.470 
two foot soldiers are fundamentally the
same<00:00:49.590> they're<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.730> painted<00:00:51.149> differently

same they're just painted differently

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.650 
same they're just painted differently
that's<00:00:51.949> literally<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.010> only<00:00:53.309> difference<00:00:53.670> but

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
that's literally the only difference but

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.310 
that's literally the only difference but

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.220 
and just know yes maybe possibly there
we<00:04:33.040> go<00:04:33.160> now<00:04:34.000> just<00:04:34.419> as<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.600> quick<00:04:34.690> size

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
we go now just as a quick size

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.450 
we go now just as a quick size
comparison<00:04:35.550> there<00:04:36.550> they<00:04:36.700> are<00:04:36.730> together<00:04:37.060> here

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
comparison there they are together here

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.210 
comparison there they are together here
is<00:04:39.460> Leonardo<00:04:40.270> now<00:04:41.080> Leonardo<00:04:41.410> is<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:41.919> bit<00:04:42.100> of<00:04:42.190> a

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
is Leonardo now Leonardo is a bit of a

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.840 
is Leonardo now Leonardo is a bit of a
funny<00:04:42.490> camera<00:04:42.820> angle<00:04:43.150> but<00:04:43.240> Leonardo<00:04:43.860> is<00:04:44.860> about

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
funny camera angle but Leonardo is about

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:46.980 
funny camera angle but Leonardo is about
the<00:04:46.030> same<00:04:46.360> height

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
the same height

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.480 
the same height
in<00:04:47.139> fact<00:04:47.350> he's<00:04:47.560> shorter<00:04:48.070> than<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.310> foot

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
in fact he's shorter than the foot

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.430 
in fact he's shorter than the foot
soldiers<00:04:48.940> and<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.630> foot<00:04:49.840> soldiers<00:04:50.230> are

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
soldiers and the foot soldiers are

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.570 
soldiers and the foot soldiers are
shorter<00:04:50.860> than<00:04:51.010> shredder<00:04:51.660> so<00:04:53.010> so<00:04:54.010> they're

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
shorter than shredder so so they're

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.250 
shorter than shredder so so they're
bigger<00:04:54.790> but<00:04:55.690> I<00:04:56.080> think<00:04:56.410> overall<00:04:58.080> they're<00:04:59.080> not

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
bigger but I think overall they're not

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.840 
bigger but I think overall they're not
as<00:04:59.410> good<00:04:59.440> they<00:04:59.770> can't<00:05:00.010> pose<00:05:00.280> as<00:05:00.490> well

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
as good they can't pose as well

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.210 
as good they can't pose as well
and<00:05:01.240> we<00:05:01.330> shred<00:05:01.600> as<00:05:01.750> a<00:05:01.780> very<00:05:02.050> imposing<00:05:02.530> looking

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
and we shred as a very imposing looking

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.950 
and we shred as a very imposing looking
figure<00:05:04.860> he's<00:05:05.860> off<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.130> table<00:05:06.460> and<00:05:07.000> that

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
figure he's off the table and that

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.360 
figure he's off the table and that
that's<00:05:08.139> good

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
that's good

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.960 
that's good
I<00:05:09.430> like<00:05:10.060> how<00:05:10.270> shredding<00:05:10.660> looks<00:05:11.160> he<00:05:12.160> he<00:05:12.760> looks

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
I like how shredding looks he he looks

modern I mean the he's got a fair amount

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.700 
modern I mean the he's got a fair amount
of<00:05:15.550> his<00:05:16.270> arm<00:05:16.510> is<00:05:16.690> not<00:05:16.900> great<00:05:17.169> and<00:05:17.380> as<00:05:17.470> you<00:05:17.590> can

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.370 

the<00:05:26.590> cable<00:05:26.979> as<00:05:27.190> I<00:05:27.220> say<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.850> the<00:05:28.720> armour<00:05:29.080> on<00:05:29.110> him

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
can get him into some decent stances but

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.020 
can get him into some decent stances but
he<00:05:37.810> is<00:05:37.960> hindered<00:05:38.350> by<00:05:38.380> that<00:05:38.680> lack<00:05:38.919> of<00:05:39.130> leg

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
he is hindered by that lack of leg

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.170 
he is hindered by that lack of leg
articulation<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:41.530> foot<00:05:41.770> soldiers<00:05:42.340> I'd<00:05:42.910> get

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
articulation the foot soldiers I'd get

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.760 
articulation the foot soldiers I'd get
the<00:05:43.270> dragon<00:05:43.630> chop<00:05:43.810> but<00:05:43.990> the<00:05:44.050> dragon<00:05:44.380> chop<00:05:44.560> was

good fun which means you get this guy
otherwise<00:05:49.510> I<00:05:50.050> think<00:05:50.680> if<00:05:51.210> we<00:05:52.210> need<00:05:52.300> to<00:05:52.450> be<00:05:52.630> ideal

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
otherwise I think if we need to be ideal

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.779 
otherwise I think if we need to be ideal
for<00:05:53.020> army<00:05:53.620> building<00:05:54.039> really<00:05:54.280> you<00:05:54.460> can<00:05:54.640> have

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
for army building really you can have

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:56.340 
for army building really you can have
half<00:05:55.060> a<00:05:55.090> dozen<00:05:55.300> of<00:05:55.510> these<00:05:55.600> but<00:05:55.870> they're<00:05:56.050> just

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
half a dozen of these but they're just

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.770 
half a dozen of these but they're just
at<00:05:56.740> 10<00:05:57.010> pounds<00:05:57.520> which<00:05:57.669> is<00:05:57.700> what<00:05:58.030> they<00:05:58.180> are<00:05:58.210> in

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
at 10 pounds which is what they are in

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.320 
at 10 pounds which is what they are in
the<00:05:58.990> UK<00:05:59.200> here<00:05:59.729> they're<00:06:00.729> just<00:06:00.760> too<00:06:01.210> expensive

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
the UK here they're just too expensive

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.830 
the UK here they're just too expensive
to<00:06:01.990> warrant<00:06:02.350> it<00:06:02.560> and<00:06:03.400> the<00:06:03.550> food<00:06:03.760> if<00:06:04.419> they<00:06:04.570> carry

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
to warrant it and the food if they carry

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.730 
to warrant it and the food if they carry
more<00:06:05.139> accessories<00:06:05.740> maybe<00:06:07.020> but<00:06:08.020> I<00:06:08.050> just<00:06:08.560> don't

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
more accessories maybe but I just don't

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.190 
more accessories maybe but I just don't
think<00:06:08.979> they're<00:06:09.539> they're<00:06:10.539> worth<00:06:10.810> the<00:06:11.020> price

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
think they're they're worth the price

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.350 
think they're they're worth the price
when<00:06:11.380> they<00:06:11.470> come<00:06:11.680> down<00:06:11.710> by<00:06:12.550> half<00:06:12.880> a<00:06:12.970> dozen<00:06:13.090> they

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
when they come down by half a dozen they

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.560 
when they come down by half a dozen they
look<00:06:13.510> really<00:06:13.840> cool<00:06:14.610> if<00:06:15.610> the<00:06:15.850> dragon<00:06:16.210> choppers

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
look really cool if the dragon choppers

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.600 
look really cool if the dragon choppers
come<00:06:16.750> down<00:06:16.960> by<00:06:17.680> a<00:06:17.710> couple<00:06:17.919> of<00:06:18.070> those<00:06:18.190> they<00:06:18.490> look

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
come down by a couple of those they look

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.600 
come down by a couple of those they look
really<00:06:18.880> cool<00:06:19.620> otherwise<00:06:20.620> I<00:06:20.950> think<00:06:21.130> I'd<00:06:21.430> be

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
really cool otherwise I think I'd be

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.240 
really cool otherwise I think I'd be
