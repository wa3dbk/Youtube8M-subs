00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.130 
elf era the era has kind of
revolutionized<00:00:49.329> the<00:00:50.850> minimally-invasive

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
revolutionized the minimally-invasive

revolutionized the minimally-invasive
skin-tightening<00:00:53.140> procedures<00:00:53.320> that<00:00:54.280> we<00:00:54.460> have

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
skin-tightening procedures that we have

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.400 
skin-tightening procedures that we have
obviously<00:00:56.079> this<00:00:56.229> was<00:00:56.409> all<00:00:56.589> pioneered<00:00:57.250> by

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.460 

Thermage<00:01:00.220> where<00:01:01.000> we<00:01:01.180> had<00:01:01.360> mono<00:01:01.630> polar<00:01:01.989> radio

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
Thermage where we had mono polar radio

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.430 
Thermage where we had mono polar radio
frequency<00:01:03.100> devices<00:01:03.430> initially<00:01:04.269> doing<00:01:05.050> a<00:01:05.229> lot

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
frequency devices initially doing a lot

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.200 
frequency devices initially doing a lot
of<00:01:05.790> skin<00:01:06.790> tightening<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:07.690> many

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
of skin tightening and many

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.340 
of skin tightening and many

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.900 
penetrate deeper than most radio
frequency<00:01:16.990> devices<00:01:17.610> we're<00:01:18.610> going<00:01:18.730> to<00:01:18.820> go

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
frequency devices we're going to go

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.450 
frequency devices we're going to go
ahead<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.360> mark<00:01:19.570> you<00:01:19.920> I'm<00:01:20.920> going<00:01:21.100> to<00:01:21.190> have<00:01:21.340> you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
ahead and mark you I'm going to have you

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:38.440 
ahead and mark you I'm going to have you
bring<00:01:21.640> your<00:01:21.760> chadway<00:01:22.480> back

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.980 

and<00:01:38.659> so<00:01:39.020> really<00:01:39.710> after<00:01:40.159> that<00:01:40.610> part<00:01:41.450> they<00:01:41.750> can

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
and so really after that part they can

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.109 
and so really after that part they can
go<00:01:42.140> back<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.409> doing<00:01:42.650> whatever<00:01:43.130> she<00:01:43.640> wants<00:01:44.030> to

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
go back to doing whatever she wants to

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.749 
go back to doing whatever she wants to
do<00:01:44.420> people<00:01:45.320> generally<00:01:45.560> note<00:01:46.159> that<00:01:46.400> they<00:01:46.549> have

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
do people generally note that they have

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.690 
do people generally note that they have
a<00:01:46.790> little<00:01:47.210> bit<00:01:47.390> of<00:01:47.540> pinkness<00:01:48.140> or<00:01:48.590> redness<00:01:48.860> but

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
a little bit of pinkness or redness but

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.210 
a little bit of pinkness or redness but
that<00:01:49.909> usually<00:01:50.570> dissipates<00:01:51.170> within<00:01:51.320> 24<00:01:52.189> hours

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
that usually dissipates within 24 hours

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.789 
that usually dissipates within 24 hours
so

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
so

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.709 
so
that's<00:01:55.189> never<00:01:55.399> a<00:01:55.549> problem<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:56.240> it's<00:01:56.359> nothing

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
that's never a problem and it's nothing

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.179 
that's never a problem and it's nothing
that<00:01:56.750> makeup<00:01:57.289> can<00:01:57.560> tie

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.099 

so<00:02:02.880> here<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.299> have<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> nice<00:02:03.840> clear<00:02:04.439> view<00:02:04.859> of<00:02:05.219> her

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
so here we have a nice clear view of her

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:10.430 
so here we have a nice clear view of her
submental<00:02:07.519> German<00:02:08.519> and<00:02:08.970> spats

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
submental German and spats

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.770 
submental German and spats
and<00:02:11.220> that's<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:11.670> beauty<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.360> technology

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
and that's the beauty of this technology

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.260 
and that's the beauty of this technology
is<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.440> actually<00:02:13.830> allows<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.640> see

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
is that it actually allows you to see

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.680 
is that it actually allows you to see
where<00:02:15.600> you're<00:02:15.810> delivering<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.500> call<00:02:17.690> unlike

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
where you're delivering the call unlike

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.840 
where you're delivering the call unlike
a<00:02:18.930> lot<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.410> radio<00:02:19.740> frequency<00:02:19.770> devices<00:02:20.520> out

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
a lot of the radio frequency devices out

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.260 
a lot of the radio frequency devices out
there<00:02:21.180> or<00:02:21.450> others<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:22.170> tightening<00:02:22.620> devices

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
there or others in tightening devices

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.270 
there or others in tightening devices
and<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:25.020> far<00:02:25.260> today<00:02:25.560> I'm<00:02:25.620> going<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.860> go<00:02:26.010> ahead

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
and so far today I'm going to go ahead

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.100 
and so far today I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:26.430> start<00:02:26.790> I'm<00:02:27.360> gonna<00:02:27.480> have<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.720> take<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.900> nice

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
you kind of look at her straight on but

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.649 
you kind of look at her straight on but
you<00:02:52.930> can<00:02:53.110> kind<00:02:53.379> of<00:02:53.500> appreciate<00:02:53.800> is<00:02:54.519> that<00:02:54.879> this

you can kind of appreciate is that this
side<00:02:55.989> is<00:02:56.440> just<00:02:57.340> hanging<00:02:57.760> more<00:02:58.150> this<00:02:58.810> looked

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
side is just hanging more this looked

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.000 
side is just hanging more this looked
tighter<00:02:59.709> and<00:03:00.180> higher<00:03:01.200> then<00:03:02.200> if<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:02.739> look<00:03:02.920> at

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
tighter and higher then if you look at

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.910 
tighter and higher then if you look at
this<00:03:03.159> kind<00:03:03.430> of<00:03:03.640> more<00:03:04.269> redundant<00:03:05.019> saggy<00:03:05.409> skin

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
this kind of more redundant saggy skin
