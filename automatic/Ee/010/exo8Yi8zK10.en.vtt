00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.539
 the cage is another good thing 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.420
 have at home 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:21.840
 not because I am favorable 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.700
 the use of the cage as an environment 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.920
 single of the rabbit 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.040
 I am convinced that we live in ours 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.140
 free families in our home e 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.219
 then share with us every moment 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.950
 of our life 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.480
 however the cage can be important in 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.489
 nature the cones divide into canvases 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.409
 therefore have a space that 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.460
 they identify like them 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:46.249
 exclusively they can be useful for 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.309
 give them more security 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:51.659
 the cage I like to think of as a little one 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.729
 because it is true that it will not be there 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.079
 but they would want us and they should 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:58.289
 be the times we are 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.489
 forced to put it in, let's suppose one 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.249
 period in which I have to do therapy 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.350
 or if there are so many people inside the house 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:07.110
 so there is the risk that he can 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.130
 be crushed by someone of the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.660
 invited 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.360
 or if the guests are not so much 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.560
 noticed and are there ready to give 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.270
 morsels of our lunch at a 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.850
 rabbit so maybe in that context 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.040
 if we don't have an environment to dedicate 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.980
 exclusively some videos then 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.250
 it would be good and small but really 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.120
 very small time intervals 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.360
 just leave him a comfortable rabbit hutch 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:37.700
 for him a cage as I said must 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:45.950
 have a couple of things a bottle 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:50.780
 which will be used to make it drinkable 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:54.380
 use or bottles of this type assif 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.619
 one or normally like this with the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.189
 ball that will be filled with water and yes 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:04.210
 want some outside the cage 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.880
 they also use bowls 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.680
 if it is true that some advise against it 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.630
 they think the rabbit can get wet 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.740
 too much under the chin and then make come 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.780
 their dermatitis 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.600
 but it is also true that it is a rabbit eats 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.180
 the right amount of vegetables per day 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.850
 we have 200 g of vegetables per kg of 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.620
 Rabbit a day won't come that way 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.360
 so much and therefore in my opinion the risk of 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.950
 dermatitis in the inter under the chin but 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.220
 It is not so 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.670
 we say averted and then there must be 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.340
 a chain sign or a door 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.959
 hay where the rabbit will have fun 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.459
 we put the hay back here 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.330
 rabbit will have fun carrying 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.280
 inside the cage the hay in 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.580
 this case this cage also a thing 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.470
 in particular a small house a small house 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.410
 in which the con instead goes to dent 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.750
 when you hear some noise or 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.000
 it will have an engine that will give it true 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.530
 annoyance and that is his home 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.239
 leave him alone at that time 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.690
 he is saying this is my home let me 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.820
 in peace it doesn't bother me this is you 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.310
 another thing that I think in homes 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.500
 of those who decide to have a rabbit must 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.480
 be there in case we don't want to 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.720
 just having a cage could be 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.640
 useful to put a small king ninth 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.769
 inside a room 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.470
 if we have the chance to do that 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.570
 may however delimit a space of the 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.090
 rabbit where you can possibly do it 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.400
 stay when we said before there 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.730
 there may be gods 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.519
 problems the cage will also be the place 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.620
 where our friend will do his needs 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.840
 so we will need to put some 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.790
 things inside that absorb just 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.820
 all both pee and balls that 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:51.070
 rabbits will do absolutely not 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.070
 must use cat litter 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.730
 of bentonite or whatever else you must 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.400
 use products that are natural 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.959
 that if ingested occasionally by the 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.239
 rabbit do not create constructions 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.780
 intestinal the most common thing that 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:12.030
 lately it is being used and this 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:15.840
 is the wooden pallet or are gods 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:19.019
 big wooden cylinders are big ones 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.880
 wooden cylinders that practically 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.419
 can be used for rabbits for 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.490
 birds also for cats in this case is 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.970
 that absorb and once to the point that 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.949
 absorb urine from the rabbit 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.460
 they take on the shape of the quasi 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.460
 of sawdust
