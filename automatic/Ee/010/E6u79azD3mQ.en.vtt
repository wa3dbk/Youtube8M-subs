you've often heard me discuss the
importance<00:00:04.840> of<00:00:04.990> mixing<00:00:05.440> up<00:00:05.560> your<00:00:05.590> play<00:00:05.890> in

order to remain unpredictable one of the

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:09.299 
order to remain unpredictable one of the
ways<00:00:08.200> which<00:00:08.410> you<00:00:08.440> can<00:00:08.680> do<00:00:08.769> that<00:00:08.980> is<00:00:09.160> by

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:09.309 
ways which you can do that is by

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:10.980 
ways which you can do that is by
sometimes<00:00:09.730> betting<00:00:10.059> the<00:00:10.150> flop<00:00:10.360> and<00:00:10.660> sometimes

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
sometimes betting the flop and sometimes

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.720

your<00:00:28.630> hand<00:00:28.900> is<00:00:29.050> to<00:00:29.199> get<00:00:29.320> out<00:00:29.500> drawn<00:00:29.800> the<00:00:30.310> more

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
your hand is to get out drawn the more

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.159 
your hand is to get out drawn the more
you<00:00:30.670> should<00:00:30.849> lean<00:00:31.029> towards<00:00:31.420> betting<00:00:31.810> rather

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
you should lean towards betting rather

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:33.569 
you should lean towards betting rather
than<00:00:32.320> risking<00:00:32.590> a<00:00:32.679> check<00:00:32.889> raised<00:00:33.100> it<00:00:33.339> doesn't

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
than risking a check raised it doesn't

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.129 
than risking a check raised it doesn't
work<00:00:33.699> out<00:00:33.879> because<00:00:34.479> your<00:00:34.600> opponent<00:00:34.780> didn't

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:35.139 
work out because your opponent didn't

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:37.680 
work out because your opponent didn't
bet<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:35.289> flop<00:00:35.469> so<00:00:36.399> for<00:00:36.760> example<00:00:37.239> if<00:00:37.389> you<00:00:37.479> held

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
bet the flop so for example if you held

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.840 
bet the flop so for example if you held
pocket<00:00:38.170> kings<00:00:38.409> and<00:00:38.649> the<00:00:38.710> flop<00:00:38.949> was<00:00:39.159> King<00:00:39.699> eight

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
pocket kings and the flop was King eight

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.759 
pocket kings and the flop was King eight
three<00:00:40.089> rainbow<00:00:40.510> well<00:00:41.170> there'd<00:00:41.319> be<00:00:41.409> little

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
three rainbow well there'd be little

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:43.259 
three rainbow well there'd be little
risk<00:00:41.949> of<00:00:42.100> being<00:00:42.280> out<00:00:42.399> drawn<00:00:42.639> on<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:42.850> next<00:00:43.059> card

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
risk of being out drawn on the next card

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:44.819 
risk of being out drawn on the next card
so<00:00:43.479> checking<00:00:43.929> would<00:00:44.139> be<00:00:44.229> the<00:00:44.350> perfect<00:00:44.530> play

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
so checking would be the perfect play

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.099 
so checking would be the perfect play
however<00:00:45.549> if<00:00:45.819> you<00:00:45.940> had<00:00:46.030> those<00:00:46.209> same<00:00:46.449> kings<00:00:46.809> but

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
however if you had those same kings but

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.079 
however if you had those same kings but
this<00:00:47.229> time<00:00:47.469> the<00:00:47.649> flop<00:00:47.859> was<00:00:48.100> nine<00:00:48.789> of<00:00:48.940> diamonds

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
this time the flop was nine of diamonds

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.180 
this time the flop was nine of diamonds
ten<00:00:49.539> of<00:00:49.629> diamonds<00:00:49.780> and<00:00:50.049> a<00:00:50.139> three<00:00:50.440> you<00:00:51.039> know<00:00:51.100> you

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
ten of diamonds and a three you know you

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.289 
ten of diamonds and a three you know you
should<00:00:51.370> consider<00:00:51.609> betting<00:00:51.969> the<00:00:52.059> flop<00:00:52.269> is

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:52.299 
should consider betting the flop is

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:53.910 
should consider betting the flop is
that's<00:00:52.629> a<00:00:52.719> dangerous<00:00:53.199> board<00:00:53.469> for<00:00:53.619> your<00:00:53.679> hand

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
that's a dangerous board for your hand

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.199 
that's a dangerous board for your hand
your<00:00:54.399> opponent<00:00:54.729> could<00:00:54.819> have<00:00:54.909> a<00:00:54.940> flush<00:00:55.179> draw

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:55.209 
your opponent could have a flush draw

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:57.000 
your opponent could have a flush draw
straight<00:00:55.809> draw<00:00:56.049> or<00:00:56.260> even<00:00:56.469> a<00:00:56.499> hand<00:00:56.619> like<00:00:56.799> ace

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
straight draw or even a hand like ace

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.500 
straight draw or even a hand like ace
ten<00:00:57.339> would<00:00:57.609> have<00:00:57.699> five<00:00:57.879> outs<00:00:58.089> to<00:00:58.239> beat<00:00:58.359> your

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
ten would have five outs to beat your

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.559 
ten would have five outs to beat your

extremely important consideration when

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.220 
extremely important consideration when

obviously the more players to act behind

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.560 
obviously the more players to act behind
the<00:02:44.310> more<00:02:44.490> likely<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.270> one<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.420> those

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
the more likely it is that one of those

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.570
