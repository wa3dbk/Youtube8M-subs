00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.519
 come on 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.330
 in these moments 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.970
 they have little matter what the rival 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.340
 if at the end of the day he has to beat 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.910
 all to come out champion and we 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:35.590
 we are thinking about going out champion 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:38.320
 at the end of the date when newly 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.970
 we started winning we realized that 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.300
 little by little we started to reach what 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.970
 that the equipment that was higher up and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.160
 we realized that it was possible 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.199
 to be able to be first but that is 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.510
 was giving in each one without conversing what 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:56.640
 one little by little he was noticing and it was 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.079
 having the illusion of being able to get to 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.839
 First of all we want to continue 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.210
 first this weekend ratify and 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.060
 be able to finish the regular phase first 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.189
 to leave us with more options for 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.380
 the lawsuits between or good when some 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.229
 goal is an event but 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.390
 happy and happy that it was like that 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.610
 that goal has been so important goes to 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.320
 the team but there is still a long way to go 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.970
 still so 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.620
 we have our feet well placed on the 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.000
 earth at that time we are first 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.850
 but a lot is missing 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.770
 Yes, I think there was a part of us 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.600
 overconfidence in the party of san 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.770
 felipe 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.290
 I think unconsciously 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.430
 disparaging the team and we had a 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.520
 very low performance but 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.070
 fortunately we had time to 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.470
 reverse this situation 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.720
 and everything goes as we wanted to 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.170
 clearly that the results do not 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.880
 accompany, that is until we lose and use 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.940
 all wrong or win we are all good 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.640
 independent sometimes I play a good 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.250
 game do not play it the victories go 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.260
 covering up how bad you played and the defeat 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.100
 They are bringing to light the bad that you played 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.750
 one 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.990
 depends on the moment of the team in 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.520
 actually in this moment I think everyone 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.330
 they are very important and they are all very 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.120
 well for the reason that the team does not 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.370
 I still believe that we are the best team 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.519
 still missing this team is missing a lot 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.269
 to say that the best team of chile 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:33.209
 and in playoff I think it's really that 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:36.349
 conviction is better and I think it is 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.819
 very important in feeling capable of 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.220
 to be able to reverse the bad situation that 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.599
 we were living and the measure with the 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.049
 triumph little by little one goes taking 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.049
 trust
