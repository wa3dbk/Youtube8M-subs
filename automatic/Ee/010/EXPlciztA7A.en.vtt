reinforced to the performance potential
of<00:02:12.080> this<00:02:12.170> car

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
of this car

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.860 
of this car
what<00:02:12.920> did<00:02:13.100> Mercedes<00:02:13.580> do<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:13.970> really<00:02:14.240> take<00:02:14.660> this

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
car to the next step the next level what

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.640 
car to the next step the next level what
keeps<00:02:17.360> our<00:02:17.480> engineers<00:02:17.900> up<00:02:18.080> at<00:02:18.230> night<00:02:18.440> is

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
keeps our engineers up at night is

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.340 
keeps our engineers up at night is
always<00:02:19.030> just<00:02:20.030> improving<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.630> from<00:02:20.930> every

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
always just improving it from every

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.840 
always just improving it from every
single<00:02:21.680> element<00:02:21.800> what<00:02:22.280> we've<00:02:22.430> done<00:02:22.640> is

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
single element what we've done is

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.730 
single element what we've done is
actually<00:02:23.090> taking<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.570> standard<00:02:23.930> C<00:02:24.500> coupe

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
actually taking the standard C coupe

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.890 
actually taking the standard C coupe
completely<00:02:25.550> re-engineered<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:26.420> for<00:02:26.810> the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
completely re-engineered it for the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.720 
completely re-engineered it for the
ultimate<00:02:27.320> in<00:02:27.410> performance<00:02:27.730> reliability

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
ultimate in performance reliability

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.690 
ultimate in performance reliability
safety<00:02:29.410> there's<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.500> lot<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.830> development<00:02:31.370> for

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
safety there's a lot of development for

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.430 
safety there's a lot of development for
the<00:02:31.790> exhaust<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.390> give<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.630> that<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:33.320> know

the exhaust to give you that you know

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.690 
the exhaust to give you that you know

kick in the pants feel when you're
driving<00:02:34.850> around<00:02:35.180> really<00:02:35.720> every<00:02:36.110> single<00:02:36.410> part

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
driving around really every single part

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.840 
driving around really every single part
of<00:02:36.650> this<00:02:36.739> car<00:02:36.920> is<00:02:37.010> engineered<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.550> do<00:02:37.670> one
