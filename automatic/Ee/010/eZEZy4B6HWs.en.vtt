that<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.180> water<00:02:33.390> will<00:02:33.630> try<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:35.540> leak

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
that the water will try to leak

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:45.820 
that the water will try to leak
everywhere<00:02:38.130> that<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.640> can't<00:02:38.910> go<00:02:39.630> downhill

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.090 

and<00:02:46.760> right<00:02:47.000> here<00:02:47.180> is<00:02:47.300> this<00:02:47.420> Ridgeline<00:02:47.950> you<00:02:48.950> can

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
and right here is this Ridgeline you can

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.740 
and right here is this Ridgeline you can
see<00:02:49.250> I'm<00:02:49.400> putting<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.790> on<00:02:49.850> nice<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.120> thick<00:02:50.360> and

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.120 

then<00:02:53.750> kind<00:02:54.050> of<00:02:54.110> give<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.230> out<00:02:56.860> once<00:02:57.860> you<00:02:57.950> got

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
then kind of give it out once you got

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.240 
then kind of give it out once you got
that<00:02:58.280> done<00:02:59.470> and<00:03:00.470> then<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.710> can<00:03:00.740> move<00:03:01.040> down<00:03:01.190> here

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
that done and then I can move down here

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:12.160 
that done and then I can move down here
a<00:03:06.460> little<00:03:07.460> bit<00:03:07.580> right<00:03:07.700> here<00:03:10.810> now<00:03:11.810> we're<00:03:11.990> ready

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
a little bit right here now we're ready

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.260 
a little bit right here now we're ready
to<00:03:12.230> open<00:03:12.530> here<00:03:15.640> basically<00:03:16.640> I'm<00:03:16.910> going<00:03:17.150> up

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
to open here basically I'm going up

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.570 
to open here basically I'm going up
inside<00:03:17.540> in<00:03:17.690> here<00:03:17.840> because<00:03:18.830> a<00:03:18.860> lot<00:03:19.280> of<00:03:19.310> times

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
inside in here because a lot of times

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.000 
inside in here because a lot of times
during<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.910> storm<00:03:20.270> you'll<00:03:20.630> get<00:03:20.780> water<00:03:21.010> coming

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
during a storm you'll get water coming

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.770 
during a storm you'll get water coming
in<00:03:22.130> here<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.820> rain<00:03:23.000> will<00:03:23.150> come<00:03:23.180> in<00:03:23.390> here<00:03:23.600> at<00:03:23.690> an

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
in here the rain will come in here at an

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.810 
in here the rain will come in here at an
angle<00:03:24.140> it<00:03:24.560> can<00:03:24.740> also<00:03:24.890> hit<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.250> shingles<00:03:25.700> and

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
angle it can also hit the shingles and

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.670 
angle it can also hit the shingles and
bounce<00:03:26.000> up<00:03:26.270> and<00:03:26.480> once<00:03:27.080> it<00:03:27.230> gets<00:03:27.380> underneath

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
bounce up and once it gets underneath

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.260 
bounce up and once it gets underneath
the<00:03:27.890> shingles<00:03:28.280> that's<00:03:28.820> where<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.090> get<00:03:29.240> your

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
the shingles that's where you get your

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.440 
the shingles that's where you get your
leak<00:03:29.560> so<00:03:30.560> by<00:03:30.710> sealing<00:03:30.950> this<00:03:31.190> up<00:03:31.450> doesn't

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
leak so by sealing this up doesn't

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.810 
leak so by sealing this up doesn't
matter<00:03:32.570> where<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.810> water<00:03:33.020> hits<00:03:33.550> it's<00:03:34.550> not

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
matter where the water hits it's not

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.760 
matter where the water hits it's not
going<00:03:34.970> to<00:03:35.030> leak<00:03:35.150> out<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:39.170> I<00:03:39.350> was<00:03:39.470> remember

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
going to leak out and I was remember

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.320 
going to leak out and I was remember
safety<00:03:40.730> first

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.690 

so

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.119 

this<00:03:51.330> is<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.629> finished<00:03:51.989> product<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.620> our

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
this is the finished product of our

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.839 
this is the finished product of our
project<00:03:54.060> as<00:03:54.410> you<00:03:55.410> can<00:03:55.590> see<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.220> Henry's<00:03:56.610> is

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
project as you can see the Henry's is

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.449 
project as you can see the Henry's is
very<00:03:57.480> well<00:03:57.750> evenly<00:03:58.260> coated<00:03:58.590> on<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:58.890> side<00:03:59.280> of

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
very well evenly coated on the side of

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.020 
very well evenly coated on the side of
the<00:03:59.580> house<00:04:01.190> it's<00:04:02.190> not<00:04:02.400> working<00:04:02.849> right<00:04:02.879> now

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
the house it's not working right now

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.259 
the house it's not working right now
because<00:04:03.569> the<00:04:03.690> trees<00:04:03.930> in<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.140> way<00:04:07.940> okay<00:04:08.940> now

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
because the trees in the way okay now

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.320 
because the trees in the way okay now
we're<00:04:09.450> sealing<00:04:09.630> up<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.900> AC<00:04:10.110> unit<00:04:10.560> here<00:04:11.330> and

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
we're sealing up the AC unit here and

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.750 
we're sealing up the AC unit here and
what<00:04:12.510> we're<00:04:12.660> doing<00:04:12.980> it's<00:04:13.980> basically<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.550> same

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
what we're doing it's basically the same

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.140 
what we're doing it's basically the same
thing<00:04:14.819> you<00:04:15.540> apply<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.870> oil<00:04:16.049> Henry

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
thing you apply the oil Henry

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.349 
thing you apply the oil Henry
so<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.329> anywhere<00:04:19.139> water<00:04:19.410> can<00:04:19.650> get<00:04:19.769> in<00:04:20.209> yep<00:04:21.209> he

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
so that anywhere water can get in yep he

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.530 
so that anywhere water can get in yep he
needs<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:21.690> be<00:04:21.810> sealed<00:04:22.079> up<00:04:23.120> okay<00:04:24.120> now<00:04:24.389> that

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
needs to be sealed up okay now that

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.379 
needs to be sealed up okay now that
you've<00:04:24.660> gotten<00:04:25.440> finished<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:26.000> did<00:04:27.000> end<00:04:27.150> up<00:04:27.240> with

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
you've gotten finished I did end up with

you've gotten finished I did end up with
a<00:04:27.419> little<00:04:28.139> bit<00:04:28.290> of<00:04:28.440> time<00:04:28.650> I<00:04:28.860> fangers<00:04:29.340> but

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
a little bit of time I fangers but

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.730 
a little bit of time I fangers but
that's<00:04:30.300> what<00:04:30.450> goof-off<00:04:30.840> this<00:04:31.020> water<00:04:31.290> it'll

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
that's what goof-off this water it'll

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.560 
that's what goof-off this water it'll
take<00:04:31.950> it<00:04:32.070> right<00:04:32.160> off<00:04:32.220> be<00:04:32.910> like<00:04:33.060> it<00:04:33.180> never<00:04:33.210> was

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.860 
take it right off be like it never was
and<00:04:33.810> then<00:04:34.229> these<00:04:34.550> let<00:04:35.550> them<00:04:35.639> dry<00:04:35.880> for<00:04:36.240> like<00:04:36.840> a

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
and then these let them dry for like a

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.310 
and then these let them dry for like a
week

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
week

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.360 
week
sticking<00:04:37.680> somewhere<00:04:37.979> everything<00:04:38.250> won't

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
sticking somewhere everything won't

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.219 
sticking somewhere everything won't
bother<00:04:38.520> anybody<00:04:38.820> then<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:39.810> just<00:04:39.990> throw<00:04:40.110> them

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
bother anybody then you just throw them

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:40.629 
bother anybody then you just throw them
away

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
away

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.150 
away
the<00:04:41.639> can<00:04:41.910> is<00:04:42.180> almost<00:04:42.450> done<00:04:42.750> but<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.889> can<00:04:44.040> use

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
the can is almost done but you can use

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.750 
the can is almost done but you can use
this<00:04:44.310> for<00:04:44.520> other<00:04:44.610> things<00:04:46.310> back<00:04:47.310> up<00:04:47.490> here<00:04:47.639> in<00:04:47.700> a

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
this for other things back up here in a

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.110 
this for other things back up here in a
few<00:04:47.910> years<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.860> refresh<00:04:49.860> these<00:04:50.100> areas<00:04:50.490> as<00:04:50.760> you

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
few years and refresh these areas as you

00:04:51.120 --> 00:05:00.320 
few years and refresh these areas as you
can<00:04:51.240> see<00:04:51.419> re<00:04:51.690> sealed<00:04:51.960> around<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.440> AC<00:04:52.590> unit

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.490 

we<00:05:01.330> can<00:05:01.450> think<00:05:01.600> to<00:05:01.720> keep<00:05:01.900> in<00:05:02.020> mind<00:05:02.230> when<00:05:02.410> you're

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
we can think to keep in mind when you're

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.980 
we can think to keep in mind when you're
working<00:05:02.620> on<00:05:02.860> your<00:05:03.010> roof<00:05:03.220> is<00:05:03.430> that<00:05:04.120> water<00:05:04.690> only

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
working on your roof is that water only

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.710 
working on your roof is that water only
goes<00:05:05.110> downhill<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:06.430> then<00:05:07.030> if<00:05:07.270> you<00:05:07.390> let<00:05:07.540> it<00:05:07.570> go

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
goes downhill and then if you let it go

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.950 
goes downhill and then if you let it go
downhill<00:05:07.900> you'll<00:05:08.530> never<00:05:08.770> have<00:05:08.920> a<00:05:08.980> problem<00:05:09.960> all

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
downhill you'll never have a problem all

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.680 
downhill you'll never have a problem all
right<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:11.350> that's<00:05:11.560> it
