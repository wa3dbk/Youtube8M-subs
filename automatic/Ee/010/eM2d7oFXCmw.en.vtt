00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.440 
little bit better as time went on I did
only<00:01:46.860> play<00:01:47.159> for<00:01:47.220> around<00:01:47.610> 40<00:01:48.060> minutes<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
only play for around 40 minutes and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.569 
only play for around 40 minutes and
stuff<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.110> gotta<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.770> know<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.100> victory

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
stuff and I gotta you know this victory

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.999 
stuff and I gotta you know this victory
for<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.880> guys<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.380> think<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> most

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
for you guys but I think the most

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.060 
for you guys but I think the most
annoying<00:01:53.460> gun<00:01:53.939> out<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.509> all<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.810> these<00:01:55.290> guns<00:01:55.740> is

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
annoying gun out of all of these guns is

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.520 
annoying gun out of all of these guns is
definitely<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.939> 24th<00:01:57.540> gun<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.259> one<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
definitely the 24th gun it's like one of

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.230 
definitely the 24th gun it's like one of
it<00:01:58.860> i<00:01:59.040> think<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> main<00:01:59.880> rocket

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
it i think is like the main rocket

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.550 
it i think is like the main rocket
launcher<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.649> weak<00:02:02.219> as<00:02:02.430> hell<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.560> yeah

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
launcher it is weak as hell and yeah

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.980 
launcher it is weak as hell and yeah
that<00:02:04.770> was<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.920> most<00:02:05.729> challenging<00:02:05.969> one<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.869> my

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
that was the most challenging one in my

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.839 
that was the most challenging one in my
opinion<00:02:07.290> i<00:02:07.500> could<00:02:07.860> probably<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.729> know<00:02:08.759> i

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
opinion i could probably you know i

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.449 
opinion i could probably you know i
could<00:02:09.119> easily<00:02:09.330> get<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.500> crossbow<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:11.340> know

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
could easily get the crossbow you know

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:11.700 
could easily get the crossbow you know
that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
that

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.470 
that
isn't<00:02:12.250> too<00:02:12.370> difficult<00:02:12.640> all<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.090> have<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.360> do

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
isn't too difficult all you have to do

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.940 
isn't too difficult all you have to do
is<00:02:13.600> just<00:02:13.630> like<00:02:13.990> sneak<00:02:14.260> up<00:02:14.440> on<00:02:14.560> someone<00:02:14.800> to

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
is just like sneak up on someone to

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.770 
is just like sneak up on someone to
stuff<00:02:15.160> like<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.370> but<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.390> rocket<00:02:16.750> launcher

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
stuff like that but the rocket launcher

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.630 
stuff like that but the rocket launcher
man<00:02:17.170> it's<00:02:17.350> really<00:02:17.620> really<00:02:18.010> annoying<00:02:18.280> it's<00:02:18.580> so

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
man it's really really annoying it's so

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.540 
man it's really really annoying it's so
slow<00:02:19.150> it's<00:02:19.480> not<00:02:19.690> strong<00:02:19.990> at<00:02:20.200> all<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.770> that

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
slow it's not strong at all so that that

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.640 
slow it's not strong at all so that that
when<00:02:21.790> I<00:02:21.820> tell<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:22.510> guys<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.660> watch<00:02:22.930> out<00:02:23.170> for<00:02:23.200> so

the 24th gun and you know it's pretty

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.800 
the 24th gun and you know it's pretty
cool<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:27.730> don't<00:02:28.030> have<00:02:28.240> to<00:02:28.300> like<00:02:28.630> use

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
cool that you don't have to like use

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.380 
cool that you don't have to like use
every<00:02:29.110> single<00:02:29.260> gun<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:30.030> for<00:02:31.030> one<00:02:31.270> of<00:02:31.360> my

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
every single gun so for one of my

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.000 
every single gun so for one of my
victories<00:02:31.900> actually<00:02:32.230> got<00:02:32.380> like<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.590> double

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
victories actually got like a double

kill<00:02:33.700> with<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.030> rocket<00:02:34.870> launcher<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.320> they

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
kill with that rocket launcher and they

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.230 
kill with that rocket launcher and they
finished<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.860> game<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.640> didn't<00:02:36.970> know<00:02:37.060> that

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
finished the game and I didn't know that

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.820 
finished the game and I didn't know that
I<00:02:37.270> was<00:02:37.390> like<00:02:37.540> surprised<00:02:37.960> I<00:02:38.140> like<00:02:38.320> did<00:02:38.470> I<00:02:38.530> lose

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
I was like surprised I like did I lose

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.080 
I was like surprised I like did I lose
or<00:02:39.070> something<00:02:39.370> because<00:02:39.490> like<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:39.850> said<00:02:39.910> I

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
or something because like I said I

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.390 
or something because like I said I
hadn't<00:02:40.450> played<00:02:40.630> gun<00:02:41.500> game<00:02:41.710> since<00:02:42.010> black<00:02:42.190> ops

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
hadn't played gun game since black ops

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.680 
hadn't played gun game since black ops
on<00:02:42.520> so<00:02:42.670> I<00:02:42.700> don't<00:02:42.910> really<00:02:42.940> remember<00:02:43.120> with<00:02:43.570> the

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
on so I don't really remember with the

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.690 
on so I don't really remember with the
rules<00:02:43.930> like<00:02:44.170> it's<00:02:44.350> just<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.590> first<00:02:44.830> 25<00:02:45.370> and

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
rules like it's just the first 25 and

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.490 
rules like it's just the first 25 and
then<00:02:46.330> you<00:02:46.540> know<00:02:46.630> you<00:02:46.690> have<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.050> guns<00:02:47.260> and

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
then you know you have the guns and

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.200 
then you know you have the guns and
stuff<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.980> just<00:02:48.010> keep<00:02:48.370> on<00:02:48.490> rotating<00:02:48.670> after

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
stuff that just keep on rotating after

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.060 
stuff that just keep on rotating after
we<00:02:49.330> kill<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:49.750> it's<00:02:50.200> really<00:02:50.380> fun<00:02:50.620> one<00:02:50.830> thing

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
we kill so it's really fun one thing

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.580 
we kill so it's really fun one thing
that<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.280> will<00:02:51.370> say<00:02:51.580> that<00:02:51.940> for<00:02:52.660> like<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.410> light

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
that I will say that for like the light

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.350 
that I will say that for like the light
machine<00:02:53.980> guns<00:02:54.220> like<00:02:54.700> once<00:02:54.880> you<00:02:54.970> get<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.120> kill

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
machine guns like once you get a kill

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.480 
machine guns like once you get a kill
with<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.780> first<00:02:56.080> gun<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:57.100> second<00:02:57.400> was

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
with the first gun you the second was

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.820 
with the first gun you the second was
like<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.730> light<00:02:57.970> machine<00:02:58.300> gun<00:02:58.480> in<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:59.470> comes

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
like a light machine gun in it it comes

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.910 
like a light machine gun in it it comes
out<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.430> slowly<00:03:00.910> that<00:03:01.380> unless<00:03:02.380> like<00:03:02.680> there's

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
out so slowly that unless like there's

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.040 
out so slowly that unless like there's
no<00:03:03.160> one<00:03:03.280> around<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:03.670> you're<00:03:03.880> always<00:03:04.540> going<00:03:04.900> to

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
no one around you you're always going to

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.470 
no one around you you're always going to
die<00:03:05.290> because<00:03:05.320> it<00:03:06.010> is<00:03:06.160> so<00:03:06.430> slow<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.090> takes<00:03:07.210> like

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
die because it is so slow it takes like

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.250 
die because it is so slow it takes like
three<00:03:07.900> full<00:03:08.350> seconds<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:10.000> know<00:03:10.120> for<00:03:10.540> you
