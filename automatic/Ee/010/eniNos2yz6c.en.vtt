00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.280
 and good to everyone here in breaks 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.560
 commenting 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:11.230
 now I come with a video tutorial of 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.660
 how to go to hell in minecraft 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.910
 the first thing we need for our 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.650
 draft 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.700
 obsidian what 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:27.510
 you get the mixture of 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.510
 the lava and the water we have now 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.090
 but do not take the trouble to go to 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.090
 look for it 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.500
 good 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.500
 we will make our obsidian generator 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.630
 so of 3 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.030
 here 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.030
 in extremes we put the water 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.130
 and the other 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.090
 nail and it is generated 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.090
 jobs and diana 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.280
 or not to get this following the block 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.820
 obsidian with the only thing that can be 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.820
 take out is with the diamond peak 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.460
 nor with any other vigor anything the only 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.460
 rich diamond after 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.720
 this step we have to repeat 14 times 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.440
 it's a bit annoying they are 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.690
 but what I do not get bored I can 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.530
 use the video a moment and when 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.869
 ends we come back 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.060
 well I'm already finishing just missing 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.170
 the latter 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.170
 and happy 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.430
 and already 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.130
 we already have 14 oxidized 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.520
 and now what the next thing we have 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.520
 tasks 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.360
 I met diana we have to perform 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:08.850
 the following so in this way 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.850
 4 then 12 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.640
 4 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.660
 1 2 3 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.000
 4 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.800
 now we complete it 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.860
 in such a way that this stays like this 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.070
 and now the next 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.070
 cool 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.250
 flint and iron ingot 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.100
 which is for 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.250
 turn on the portal 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.980
 what has to be done in this way 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.510
 diagonal up and ingot iron and down 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.640
 the flint and in that exit 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.640
 well we need that we have 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.750
 once done that 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.050
 this video right click prendo me later 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.050
 the fire 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.319
 but when you give him here 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.880
 you learn the portal 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.000
 but 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.210
 here we already have in our portal for 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.900
 the hell 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:25.379
 that we're not ready yet so 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.200
 first we prepare but before I have 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:31.549
 to pay for this fire I burn burns me 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.549
 I love you 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.400
 the night 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.410
 Now we have to prepare for the 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.010
 hell because many things await us 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.010
 cool there 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.840
 our module you can have 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.440
 anything but it does not work I already have 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.440
 my diamond soul 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.170
 and now if we are ready to go to 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.170
 hell 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.170
 this is animated yes yes these called and 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:16.440
 so, let's go 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.440
 let's go to hell I got shit 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:29.319
 what fear 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.319
 well let's say let's say let's say 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.950
 here 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.280
 but because we seem here 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:47.080
 because we appear in the air 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.080
 is my question 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.120
 I do not want to be here like hard bass 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.540
 well now back I'll solve 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.230
 this 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.860
 good boil you 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.510
 and I had to restart everything so that 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.170
 another place will appear 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.620
 good is hell there is another kind of 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.360
 zombies 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.380
 is the combination of a pig and a zombie 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.740
 they practically do not attack you but seven 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.700
 they attack them 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.320
 and the whole herd of people and 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.200
 shattered 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.420
 well there are a variety of monsters here 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.960
 that I was really afraid to experiment 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.960
 but 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.740
 but I'll still be here for a moment 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.529
 another type of zombie zombie or monster is 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.439
 the cast 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:02.420
 what is a white thing that smells like 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:05.600
 A jellyfish 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:08.410
 and that you who the truth 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.410
 It is very good 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:18.090
 they are means of the ugly ones in some 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.090
 cases give you a gold nugget 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.240
 look for attacking one they're going to 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:27.900
 follow two I approach others go to 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.900
 want to kill 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.570
 or it seems that he did not see it 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:37.300
 you did not see me did not touch me 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.290
 die die die die die die die 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.290
 good good good good 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.250
 even though 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:51.960
 sure it was an expense 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:03.540
 not me, I better, I'm going 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.540
 and well I hope you liked it 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:10.070
