00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 Hi, nice people, taking care of requests. 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.760
 I brought a video here on the channel 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.309
 tutorial on how to draw cats and 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.380
 in this video is to teach drawing cats 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.599
 in two different positions 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.430
 a man standing and one without addition pado 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.490
 It will also show you how to do 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.380
 some details like the eyes the nose 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.029
 so this is it I hope you like it 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.070
 and let's go 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.920
 Good folks following what I already said 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.539
 in the video tutorial of horses who want 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.390
 I'll leave the link on the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.090
 description of this video is the best way to 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.800
 To start making a sketch, it's you. 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.010
 try to see geometric shapes 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.559
 simple in the drawing you want to do by 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.180
 example the drawing of a standing cat I 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.430
 do two centuries 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.129
 the greater or lesser that they will represent 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.340
 respectively the head and the socket 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.649
 and in this case the cat's body can be 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.109
 represented as a rectangle in 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.859
 followed to sketch the legs of the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.320
 animal 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.510
 you can make use of lines and small 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:12.360
 circles without news circles will 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:14.880
 represent the joints well 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.280
 finalized the sketch, it's time to give 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.220
 volume to the animal I'm going to start here 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.890
 and it is important to remember that 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.170
 in a small one and the neck does not 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.299
 very long then you can half 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.299
 that follow the basic outlines of the outline 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.350
 to do the drawing of the legs 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.229
 We'll use that last one. 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.180
 circulation in the sketch we did for 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.970
 this we will draw a circle one 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.060
 a little more about it and starting from 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.030
 each side of this century to the belly but 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.430
 two straight lines and 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.759
 they are going to give volume to the legs an 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.430
 cat in the case of hind legs 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.229
 they have a slightly different shape 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.580
 so we'll mark two circles 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.580
 more 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.400
 now one in each articulation of them brings 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.100
 two parallel lines between them and 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.210
 We'll call them, then, and the belly. 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.730
 back to finish the paw design 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.800
 coming out of the last larger circle 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.530
 we did we'll mark a square 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:27.950
 small like that on the front 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:30.320
 as you can see in the image to the 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.690
 faults that are raised also leave 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.090
 from where you how can you do 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.209
 one format a rounded stub on the tip 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.010
 and make one or two divisions in them 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.200
 this will vary according to the position 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.390
 of the cat 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.180
 with this our design is already almost 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.060
 ready to just win the tail and 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.340
 erase the lines from the initial sketch 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.180
 left over and after adding some 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.180
 extra details 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.080
 Good guys, from here, I'm going. 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.140
 show you how to draw a cat 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.330
 the initial sketch of the head and the 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.980
 neck will remain practically 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.260
 like the other 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.060
 what will change even the format of the 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.239
 body because it is in a position 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.880
 completely different from the previous 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.459
 in this case the larger circle I made 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.250
 it will represent the cat's chest and it is 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.010
 of him that does not leave the front paws 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.280
 already the shape of the rest of the body it can 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.570
 vary according to the position of the cat 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.459
 to mark the faults 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.430
 you can use the same principle of 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:41.019
 either before or line and small circles 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.019
 representing the joints 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.240
 in our heads we're going to score another 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.120
 smaller circle that will represent the snout 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.760
 of the cat and the two ears triangle 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.660
 areas to give volume to the legs 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.820
 front 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.850
 We'll follow the same idea as before. 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.650
 ie make a circle and draw it 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.650
 two almost parallel lines 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:17.049
 again to draw the paws you 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.220
 can draw almost a century and not even 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.220
 make some divisions 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.379
 here I am going to draw the face of the 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.509
 cat 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:41.099
 but do not worry because I'll go 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.419
 show all the step-by-step how to 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.419
 to draw only the face 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.190
 to give your drawing more realism 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.470
 You can about it or even 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.950
 simply mark some details of the 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.950
 coat 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.909
 good guys now I'm going to show 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.719
 how to draw the face of 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:10.969
 a cat 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:13.789
 beginning with the shape of the head and 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:16.219
 muzzle we will again use two 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.889
 circles these two straight lines 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:22.189
 crushes are used to indicate 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:25.430
 what is the center of the face and the height of 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:27.620
 eyes to make the cat's nose more 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.500
 let's draw a tip triangle 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.699
 head and on both sides of it 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.729
 Let's do two semicircles leaving. 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:40.270
 hence we will do the format of the mouth 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.270
 characteristic of a cat 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.910
 leaving the far side we go 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:49.000
 mark two small lines that will give 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:52.000
 a volume to the muzzle and is part of it 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.880
 We'll win the eyes one more way. 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.040
 I found it easy to make eyes 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.260
 consists of making a curved line and logo 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.490
 below it make a circle 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.490
 as you can see in the image 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:15.460
 the pupils of cats usually have the 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:17.139
 shape the evil to make the ears 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.300
 just mark almost two 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:22.270
 triangles causing the beads to 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.580
 them on the turn and will not have 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.969
 a head a little above the height 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.969
 From the eyes 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:41.580
 done all this just pay the lines of the 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.889
 sketch and add some details to the 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.880
 cat eyes for example they are well 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:46.800
 featured 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.400
 so you can darken the edges 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.400
 their 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.939
 detailing the worst of the 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.249
 muzzle and some features of the 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:05.080
 coat are also good that make 

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:05.080
 the much more realistic design 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.980
 and this is it I hope you have 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.840
 and you will also find that this 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.650
 tutorial can help you from any 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.050
 way 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.350
 Thank you so much for watching and even 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.350
 next
