00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.579
 I saw that the one who told me was the luch 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.649

 grab a character that does not 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.899
 It shows that you do not have controls 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.719
 basics of the game such as grabbing a 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.860
 character and claw also the monkeys 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.460

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.859
 very good because grabbing the monkeys is 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.320
 much easier because that's what you have 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.719
