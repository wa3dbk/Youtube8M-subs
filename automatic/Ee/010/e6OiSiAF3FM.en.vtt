00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.600
 The game would come back, I told you until I recorded 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.529
 here and look how chic and solve your 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.580
 conflict I'm not the best 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.139
 I will not try not to 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.490
 blame I know that a lot of people end up 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:21.240
 falling on the blog looking for new and tie 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:24.449
 what became evident the new super easy 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.070
 I know it seems it's hard to have 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.260
 many people who are not doing 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.320
 It's also hard to buy anyone. 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.820
 sells on tie but I do not think it will 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.820
 help looking back time does not 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:47.760
 I managed to find the internet from china 2 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:53.270
 dose of good humor that is in the city 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.270
 It's been a good week not to die, I 'm 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.719
 I'll see if I can explain the best. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:11.159
 Teacher, I 'm not going to try to use you. 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:13.520
 has two equal sides does not have a little 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.520
 smaller 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.400
 the knot 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:36.390
 will do the normal normal route will pick up 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:44.850
 the side the lowest will hold in the format 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:47.130
 I with this part that gives bigger goes 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.630
 bring confirm 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:55.630
 maybe a little bit now so that 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.550
 trust that you will listen to the 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:04.420
 thing here is going to bring this rate to 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:14.200
 back now focused on it one side 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:17.230
 here you will catch it here and fold 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:27.210
 You're going to stick it back here in the hole of the knot. 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:29.160
 initial is what will make you will accept 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.190
 pulls both goals from the boy's parents 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:42.660
 despite this low thing I'm purple band 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:53.670
 in the arm the white face until straightening my 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:55.590
 understand 2006 just called carol 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.330
 and it is not perfect like these 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.500
 that people buy soon that was in 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.480
 box and such 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.720
 Dabo end but I think they are a 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.670
 charm also in the bow tie 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.450
 tied up I'm going to make a 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.830
 purchase procedure at the end of the year 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.020
 showing something you can buy without 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.360
 tie that I think is good 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:20.940
 Cooler than the hands 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.890
 Another thing I got straightened out is nothing else. 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:30.410
 chic I think at least raise 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.410
 end of open party 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.960
 I've been liking 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:51.530
 I hope you have not undertaken in 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:51.530
 adopt the hair
