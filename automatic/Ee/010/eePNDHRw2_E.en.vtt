to<00:01:39.360> look<00:01:39.509> like<00:01:39.750> really<00:01:40.619> thick<00:01:40.979> clay<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.280> it's

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
to look like really thick clay so it's

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.179 
to look like really thick clay so it's
getting<00:01:41.880> better<00:01:42.119> every<00:01:42.240> year<00:01:44.450> even<00:01:45.450> out<00:01:46.189> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
getting better every year even out the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:02:00.210 
getting better every year even out the
planting<00:01:47.670> area<00:01:47.990> break<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.170> any<00:01:49.320> clumps

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
and you want a nice flat surface that is

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.390 
and you want a nice flat surface that is
really<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:05.930> mean<00:02:06.110> look<00:02:06.290> how<00:02:06.380> loose<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:06.770> is<00:02:06.920> if

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
really I mean look how loose it is if

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.840 
really I mean look how loose it is if
you<00:02:07.550> reach<00:02:07.760> in<00:02:07.970> here<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:10.280> onions<00:02:10.580> are<00:02:10.700> could

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
you reach in here the onions are could

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.630 
you reach in here the onions are could
have<00:02:10.970> any<00:02:11.120> trouble<00:02:11.990> forming<00:02:12.350> bulbs<00:02:12.770> in<00:02:12.920> the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
soil and that's one of the key to the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.840 
soil and that's one of the key to the
onions<00:02:16.520> is<00:02:16.700> just<00:02:16.940> really<00:02:17.420> loose<00:02:17.600> soil<00:02:18.850> when

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
onions is just really loose soil when

onions is just really loose soil when
you<00:02:20.030> buy<00:02:20.240> your<00:02:20.450> onions<00:02:20.840> they're<00:02:21.320> going<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.560> say

you buy your onions they're going to say

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.090 
you buy your onions they're going to say
they're<00:02:22.160> either<00:02:22.730> short<00:02:23.120> day<00:02:23.300> onions<00:02:23.330> or<00:02:24.110> um

your country and figure out what type of
onions<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:47.510> would<00:02:47.660> grow<00:02:49.690> so<00:02:50.690> let<00:02:50.870> them<00:02:51.050> soak

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
onions you would grow so let them soak

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.490 
onions you would grow so let them soak
let<00:02:53.660> me<00:02:53.780> show<00:02:53.989> you<00:02:54.050> just<00:02:54.620> how<00:02:54.769> to<00:02:54.830> separate<00:02:56.500> the

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
let me show you just how to separate the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.560 
let me show you just how to separate the
other<00:02:57.650> onion<00:02:57.980> bunches<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:59.000> can<00:02:59.180> see<00:02:59.360> how<00:02:59.540> I

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
other onion bunches you can see how I

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.840 
other onion bunches you can see how I
told<00:02:59.660> you<00:02:59.930> in<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.200> other<00:03:00.320> videos<00:03:00.650> these<00:03:01.459> root

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
told you in the other videos these root

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.850 
told you in the other videos these root
systems<00:03:02.239> are<00:03:02.360> almost<00:03:02.630> indestructible<00:03:03.200> you

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
systems are almost indestructible you

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.330 
systems are almost indestructible you
can<00:03:04.040> see<00:03:04.220> they're<00:03:04.400> breaking<00:03:05.620> be<00:03:06.620> gentle<00:03:07.100> but

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
can see they're breaking be gentle but

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.729 
can see they're breaking be gentle but
I'm<00:03:07.459> being<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:07.700> little<00:03:07.730> rougher<00:03:08.320> just<00:03:09.320> to<00:03:09.440> prove

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
I'm being a little rougher just to prove

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.699 
I'm being a little rougher just to prove
a<00:03:09.890> point<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:11.360> you<00:03:11.510> don't<00:03:11.780> have<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.380> worry<00:03:14.709> about

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
a point is you don't have to worry about

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.590 
a point is you don't have to worry about
these<00:03:16.010> breaking<00:03:16.459> onions<00:03:16.880> are<00:03:17.060> going<00:03:17.360> to<00:03:17.450> grow

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
these breaking onions are going to grow

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.750 
these breaking onions are going to grow
they're<00:03:17.780> almost<00:03:17.900> indestructible<00:03:18.549> so<00:03:19.549> look

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
they're almost indestructible so look

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.819 
they're almost indestructible so look
how<00:03:19.880> nice<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.299> root<00:03:20.450> systems<00:03:20.870> are<00:03:21.049> they're

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
how nice the root systems are they're

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.509 
how nice the root systems are they're
going<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.070> go<00:03:22.190> right<00:03:22.850> into<00:03:23.140> this<00:03:24.140> bed<00:03:24.519> so

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
going to go right into this bed so

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.319 
going to go right into this bed so
packed<00:03:25.820> in<00:03:26.000> there<00:03:26.209> are<00:03:27.049> five<00:03:27.910> great<00:03:28.910> onions

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
packed in there are five great onions

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.650 
packed in there are five great onions
these<00:03:29.420> are<00:03:29.570> Spanish<00:03:29.989> onions<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.790> I'm<00:03:32.510> going

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
these are Spanish onions and I'm going

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.250 
these are Spanish onions and I'm going
to<00:03:32.720> plant<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.049> whole<00:03:33.170> bed<00:03:33.410> but<00:03:33.590> basically

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
to plant the whole bed but basically

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.039 
to plant the whole bed but basically
make<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.290> circle<00:03:37.120> I<00:03:38.120> think<00:03:38.510> he's<00:03:38.660> call<00:03:38.900> for

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
make a circle I think he's call for

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.240 
make a circle I think he's call for
every<00:03:39.230> four<00:03:39.500> inches<00:03:39.650> so<00:03:39.860> you<00:03:39.950> want<00:03:40.100> to<00:03:40.160> do

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
every four inches so you want to do

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.250 
every four inches so you want to do
about<00:03:40.340> every<00:03:40.640> four<00:03:40.910> inches<00:03:41.150> you<00:03:41.720> can<00:03:41.900> plant

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
about every four inches you can plant

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.530 
about every four inches you can plant
them<00:03:42.380> closer<00:03:42.680> together<00:03:42.980> if<00:03:43.489> you're<00:03:44.209> not<00:03:44.390> going

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
them closer together if you're not going

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.690 
them closer together if you're not going
to<00:03:44.630> let<00:03:44.720> them<00:03:44.870> grow<00:03:45.049> to<00:03:45.079> full<00:03:45.380> onion<00:03:45.590> bulbs<00:03:46.010> but

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
to let them grow to full onion bulbs but

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.940 
to let them grow to full onion bulbs but
you<00:03:46.790> make<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.090> hole<00:03:47.239> deep<00:03:47.510> enough<00:03:47.769> let's<00:03:48.769> see

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
you make the hole deep enough let's see

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.500 
you make the hole deep enough let's see
let's<00:03:49.190> do<00:03:49.370> this<00:03:49.489> one<00:03:49.700> make<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.150> hole<00:03:50.299> deep

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
let's do this one make the hole deep

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.300 
let's do this one make the hole deep
enough<00:03:50.600> so<00:03:51.170> you<00:03:51.230> can<00:03:51.440> drop<00:03:51.650> in<00:03:51.829> the<00:03:51.920> whole<00:03:52.100> root

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
enough so you can drop in the whole root

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.880 
enough so you can drop in the whole root
system<00:03:52.340> but<00:03:52.910> keep<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:55.519> roots

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:06.430 

so<00:03:59.150> that<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.300> bulb<00:04:00.800> your<00:04:01.800> roots<00:04:02.010> are<00:04:04.430> above

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
so that the bulb your roots are above

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.530 
so that the bulb your roots are above
the<00:04:07.440> soil<00:04:07.650> wall<00:04:07.950> just<00:04:08.250> above<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.730> soil<00:04:08.880> you

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
the soil wall just above the soil you

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.150 
the soil wall just above the soil you
want<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.840> onion<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.290> form<00:04:10.560> up<00:04:10.740> here<00:04:10.920> you<00:04:11.070> don't

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
want the onion to form up here you don't

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.710 
want the onion to form up here you don't
want<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.430> drop<00:04:11.910> an<00:04:12.120> onion<00:04:12.800> down<00:04:13.800> like<00:04:14.070> this

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
want to drop an onion down like this

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.360 
want to drop an onion down like this
it's<00:04:15.720> just<00:04:15.870> not<00:04:16.350> going<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.620> bulb<00:04:16.799> up<00:04:17.010> so<00:04:17.310> you

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
it's just not going to bulb up so you

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.160 
it's just not going to bulb up so you
don't<00:04:17.519> want<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.850> do<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:18.120> you<00:04:18.540> want<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:18.959> plant

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
don't want to do that you want to plant

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.400 
don't want to do that you want to plant
it<00:04:19.970> so<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.239> roots<00:04:21.480> dropped<00:04:21.840> all<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.110> way

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
it so that the roots dropped all the way

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.060 
it so that the roots dropped all the way
down<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:22.860> then<00:04:22.980> you<00:04:23.010> backfill<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.810> just<00:04:25.070> drop

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
down and then you backfill and just drop

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.470 
down and then you backfill and just drop
it<00:04:26.250> just<00:04:26.490> like<00:04:26.730> that<00:04:26.910> that's<00:04:27.090> almost<00:04:27.270> perfect

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
it just like that that's almost perfect

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.850 
it just like that that's almost perfect
that's<00:04:28.290> where<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.680> onions<00:04:29.010> get<00:04:29.190> afford<00:04:30.860> so

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
that's where the onions get afford so

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.210 
that's where the onions get afford so
you're<00:04:32.520> going<00:04:32.700> to<00:04:32.730> do<00:04:32.910> every<00:04:33.840> four<00:04:34.110> inches<00:04:34.290> let

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
you're going to do every four inches let

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.960 
you're going to do every four inches let
me<00:04:35.310> change<00:04:35.730> this<00:04:35.940> out<00:04:37.490> I'm<00:04:38.490> going<00:04:38.670> to<00:04:38.730> do<00:04:38.820> these

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
me change this out I'm going to do these

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.930 
me change this out I'm going to do these
a<00:04:39.000> little<00:04:39.270> bit<00:04:39.360> closer<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:44.220> more<00:04:44.430> space<00:04:44.760> you

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
a little bit closer the more space you

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.970 
a little bit closer the more space you
give<00:04:45.120> them<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:46.110> greater<00:04:46.380> chance<00:04:46.680> they<00:04:46.830> have

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
give them the greater chance they have

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.980 
give them the greater chance they have
to<00:04:47.010> getting<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.550> full<00:04:47.790> size<00:04:48.030> I'm<00:04:48.600> going<00:04:48.660> to<00:04:48.900> be

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
to getting to full size I'm going to be

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.500 
to getting to full size I'm going to be
eating<00:04:49.350> these<00:04:49.560> at<00:04:50.370> all<00:04:50.580> different<00:04:50.850> stages<00:04:51.210> of

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
eating these at all different stages of

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:58.020 
eating these at all different stages of
development

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.630 

and<00:04:59.030> you<00:04:59.180> can<00:04:59.360> see<00:04:59.710> that<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.860> root<00:05:01.250> systems

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
and you can see that the root systems

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.460 
and you can see that the root systems
are<00:05:01.760> still<00:05:02.330> like<00:05:02.600> right<00:05:02.840> there<00:05:03.050> that's<00:05:03.230> really

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
are still like right there that's really

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:10.510 
are still like right there that's really
really<00:05:03.800> important<00:05:08.980> and<00:05:09.980> I<00:05:10.100> would<00:05:10.160> just<00:05:10.400> go

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
really important and I would just go

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.110 
really important and I would just go
down<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:10.910> whole<00:05:11.090> row<00:05:11.360> up<00:05:12.200> here<00:05:12.850> I'm<00:05:13.850> going<00:05:14.060> to

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
down the whole row up here I'm going to

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.510 
down the whole row up here I'm going to
grow<00:05:16.240> these<00:05:17.240> Georgia<00:05:17.630> sweet<00:05:18.020> onions<00:05:18.460> and<00:05:19.460> I

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.220 
grow these Georgia sweet onions and I
couldn't<00:05:19.790> find<00:05:20.000> seeds<00:05:20.300> for<00:05:20.540> these<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:22.880> plus

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
couldn't find seeds for these and plus

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
the same thing make a hole they don't

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.170 
the same thing make a hole they don't
have<00:05:35.990> really<00:05:36.260> established<00:05:36.740> root<00:05:37.370> systems<00:05:37.820> or

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
have really established root systems or

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.580 
have really established root systems or
the<00:05:38.360> root<00:05:38.510> systems<00:05:38.900> aren't<00:05:39.050> as<00:05:39.170> nice<00:05:39.320> as<00:05:39.500> the

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
the root systems aren't as nice as the

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.860 
the root systems aren't as nice as the
ones<00:05:39.740> I<00:05:39.830> just<00:05:39.860> did<00:05:40.190> and<00:05:40.670> just<00:05:41.950> drop<00:05:42.950> it<00:05:43.130> in<00:05:43.870> so

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
ones I just did and just drop it in so

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.900 
ones I just did and just drop it in so
that<00:05:44.900> it's<00:05:45.380> above<00:05:46.100> the<00:05:46.130> ground<00:05:46.490> that's<00:05:46.670> the

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
that it's above the ground that's the

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.860 
that it's above the ground that's the
planting<00:05:47.360> instructions<00:05:47.930> every<00:05:48.800> four<00:05:49.040> inches

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
planting instructions every four inches

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.680 
planting instructions every four inches
or<00:05:50.870> so<00:05:51.370> make<00:05:52.370> sure<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.670> roots<00:05:52.820> drop<00:05:53.150> down<00:05:53.420> and

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
or so make sure the roots drop down and

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.260 
or so make sure the roots drop down and
the<00:05:54.470> onions<00:05:54.860> are<00:05:54.980> going<00:05:55.100> to<00:05:55.160> form<00:05:55.400> above<00:05:55.880> the

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
the onions are going to form above the

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.150 
the onions are going to form above the
ground<00:05:56.540> and<00:05:56.810> that's<00:05:57.110> basically<00:05:57.560> how<00:05:57.860> you<00:05:57.890> put

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
ground and that's basically how you put

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.770 
ground and that's basically how you put
the<00:05:58.280> onions<00:05:58.550> in<00:05:58.670> three<00:05:59.210> or<00:05:59.300> four<00:05:59.450> inches

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
the onions in three or four inches

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.320 
the onions in three or four inches
around<00:05:59.990> just<00:06:00.920> drop<00:06:01.190> them<00:06:01.370> in<00:06:01.490> you'd<00:06:02.060> water

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330
