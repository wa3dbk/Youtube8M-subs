00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.600
 hello how about I took the time to 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.110
 make this video again how 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.090
 know if the alternator fails the battery 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.960
 I have received enough criticism in my 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.520
 video then he's going to do it more 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.760
 explanatory more because they understand it 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.280
 better for those people who say no 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.930
 I know nothing about mechanics, not even I have 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.810
 my instructions as you can see here 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.270
 I have this one that has helped me a lot and 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.609
 as I told you we are going to check the 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.260
 battery the alternator let's see which one 

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:36.989
 is the one that fails 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.379
 As you can see, it has updated me now 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.680
 use an innovator multimeter is number 33 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.920
 20 is very helpful since this 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.109
 multimeter simply one puts the ones 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 the battery voltage in this case the 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:55.860
 of the car uses the voltage of 12 I go to 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.760
 12 here tells me if the battery is good 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:05.110
 more or less humala let's check 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:08.550
 let's put the most positive 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.550
 and then we go to the negative 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.860
 to always perform a test with the 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.590
 alternator you have to verify that the 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.230
 battery is always charged here 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.150
 We can see 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:26.400
 the battery is 12.37 if it was below 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.640
 of 12 may not start because it 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.920
 missing charge in this case is up if 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.260
 will start and as you can see here I 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.630
 says the multimeter here you can see the 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.729
 green light 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.470
 and that it is ok the battery is charged 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.869
 if it was orange 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.930
 better I would load it or if it were in red 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.360
 as you can see today it turns on and so 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.690
 you have to load it in this case it's fine 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.450
 we will continue proceeding with the video 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.789
 once charged your battery we will 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.030
 turn on the vehicle when it is 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:04.289
 On, let's check again 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.289
 with the multimeter 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.260
 who are we going to check again 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.190
 Lets put 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.940
 positive then the negative red he 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.940
 black 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:35.020
 here we are seeing a load of 12.25 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.020
 the alternator is fine 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.900
 If the load gave less than 13 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.510
 it means that the regulator that goes 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.150
 inside the alternator is already bad or that 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.630
 the alternator this one is already there 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.870
 change it if it gave us more than 15 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.510
 you can see if there were more than 15 too 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.620
 it was bad the alternator would cause 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.480
 that will swell the battery and this in turn 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.310
 would cause the electrical systems 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.319
 studies will begin to damage 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.480
 then how can you see here the 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.760
 alternator is checking well if its 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.569
 alternator brand a brand multimeter 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.080
 less than 13 or more than 15 also the 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.080
 alternator 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.150
 I also recommend that you also 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:30.010
 the terminals also this plays a lot 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.010
 a paper to allow the load to pass 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.129
 and finally I recommend that you check 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.959
 the band as you can see is the one 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.689
 Baso alternator check on which is not 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.599
 very corrected because sometimes it fails 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.990
 or is very loose and does not allow it to arrive 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:49.569
 load 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:52.269
 I hope and I have answered your questions 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.870
 this any comment please already 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.870
 you know what to do
