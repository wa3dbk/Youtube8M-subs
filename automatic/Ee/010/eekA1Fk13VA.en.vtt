 Hello, how are you friends, I like being here with you? We are in the program 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:32.210
 to know Latin rhythm 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.100
 My name is Maria San Xavier, I am going to give you an Arabic dance class 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.910
 us with some basic steps to go complicating it more and more and 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.170
 let's finish seeing this choreography that you just saw 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.370
 We are in the city of Mexico in an incredible cultural center called 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.550
 cultural house 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.140
 jesus kings heros 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.930
 I am going to present you 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.340
 to those who are going to be with us in the program 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.660
 first of all we are accompanied by the famous batista atkinson 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.430

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.190
 hip simi knees 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.150
 similar chest that inhabits what we will be applying during the class 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.710
 If you measure hip 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.090
 comes with knees 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.820
 chest simi 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.310
 If you measure hip 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.550
 then whenever you go in Arabic music that sound 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.560
 characteristic terr 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.150
 bacon himself 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.400
 you can apply some layers for example if you measure hip 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.690
 from pombrol would be arms of snakes 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.750
 I could poke soda up 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.550
 they can get head 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.550
 turns to the right was in metepec done 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.180
 was to put this frame but everything without stopping is finite 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.550
 simi filmmaker slap we are going to practice a little bit with each one 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.600

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.909
 Sinnigen and without me self 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:22.149

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.469
 more than once 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:42.499
 with two players 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:46.930
 there is still nothing cuter than there is 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.949
 also an honor 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.849
 when 5 6 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.439

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.439
 not all 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:01.479
 4 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.479
 1 4% in amambay 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.039

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:14.249
 the other comes from the breast circles we want to do while

 that in slow motion would be 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:20.709
 chest up down down up down down up 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.290
