00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
ribbon and I've just used the seal part

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.470 
ribbon and I've just used the seal part
there<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.860> hide<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.280> linkage<00:02:27.730> behind<00:02:28.210> there

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
there to hide the linkage behind there

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.480 
there to hide the linkage behind there
so<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:28.840> should<00:02:29.260> once<00:02:29.470> patented<00:02:29.980> look<00:02:30.220> quite

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
so that should once patented look quite
