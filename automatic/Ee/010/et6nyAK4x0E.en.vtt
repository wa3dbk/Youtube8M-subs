 the chef before being a chef 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.649
 that did not talk that did not say things the 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.300
 cook locked in his kitchen 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:10.910
 absorbed into his world a small world 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.870
 to which the kitchen had been confined 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.360
 today is a communication tool 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.219
 is a promotional tool is a 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.740
 economic tool etcetera in 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.920
 consequence the cooks has acquired 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.789
 a voice that forces them to prepare for 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.789
 a different way 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.820
 [Music] 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.880
 at this time three generations come 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.610
 the older generation that lived in 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.660
 those times where everything beautiful 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.489
 had to come from outside 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.980
 so that it has value so that it 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.710
 valuable 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.380
 Of course if you take a pisco sour but in 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.340
 intimacy in a family environment ever 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.930
 imagined that it could be sold in the world 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:58.400
 the generation that has grown 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.200
 on this path between that time and the 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.850
 recovery of our pride of 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.239
 our identity that is where we 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.400
 I belong and that although we try 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.270
 champion a claim process 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:16.760
 about us sometimes still coexist 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:19.620
 those fearful voices that before any 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.180
 threat in quotes 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.680
 they wake up wrongly 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.590
 basically for fear of going back to that 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.079
 past 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.450
 and the most returned part of that story 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.780
 is the young generation those who have 20 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.509
 25 15 years and they do not understand what happens 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.260
 because they have grown free they 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.750
 They are free 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.820
 they do not have that fear then they look 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.850
 because they are already sure of themselves 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.850
 same 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.300
 [Music] 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.640
 we work solid thinking how 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.350
 we will bring young people and as 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.120
 come now I have my team the islands 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.440
 the most fascinating stories that 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.870
 we are writing now in gastric 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.210
 they are for example conceptual full of 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.250
 art 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.200
 and the avant-garde is because we have 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.509
 incorporated boys of 20 and 21 years old 22 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.080
 years are free as they should start 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.700
 incorporate and my big task is to give 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.590
 god muÃ±oz all the responsibility for 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.900
 that assumes the new stage and I 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.020
 just look to applaud because that 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.480
 it is the responsibility we have to give 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.620
 the step not only because I do not 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.210
 corresponds but because they have to 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.770
 take responsibility 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:34.190
 and train and be accountable for good 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.190
 or for bad

 [Music] 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.900
 the most avant-garde universities in 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.030
 world are already collaborating with us 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.320
 for this culinary basque project 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:54.410
 center the university of carlo petrini 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.410
 of the slow food university 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.160
 at the forefront of new tourism 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.480
 there is still a position a little 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.450
 Current University tourism 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.120
 world adapt to the new era still 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.439
 well in a little 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.540
 trapped in the structure of the tourist 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:15.020
 old that traveled the Italian that 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.080
 I was coming but eating pizza 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.020
 Exxon until recently today the trip 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.780
 of today's tourist comes to discover the 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.350
 local culture is much more conscious 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.190
 with the things that are around him 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:33.490
 before building ghettos then you have 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.130
 which now form a leader who is 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.080
 able to get to relate 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.730
 as first with the environment find 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.830
 the stories of the environment for 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.530
 turn them into tourist products and 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.510
 incorporating to the place where it is installed 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.060
 in all the activities because in addition 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.040
 that's what you're going to expect 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.900
 tourist that comes to this hotel to this 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.730
 restaurant from the butter that 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.120
 wants it to be that of the farmer who is 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.550
 on the way back from the hotel until the 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.170
 can even visit the places where 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.170
 certain things are produced and leaving everything 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.710
 the universities are transiting like this 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.940
 that training we are going to start from 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:17.260
 with all that 360 degree look at the 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.260
 training of these leading guys

 he does not care to be clear that when 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.990
 appear a critic 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.110
 who have the opportunity to 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.290
 explain it we have to remind you that 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.720
 we have to cultivate criticism as a 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.790
 magical opportunity to be able to improve and 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.860
 progress because the big challenge like you 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.099
 you say now is 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.110
 do things every day better because the 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.360
 expectation that continues to grow outside 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.939
 from outside Peru in relation to Peru 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.590
 the Peruvian cuisine and then the traffic 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:54.659
 the security has to be fixed 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.310
 also the restaurants have to be 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.900
 increasingly better safety 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.039
 food so that nobody is 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.650
 sick also has to be 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.180
 properly controlled there can not be 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.340
 can not give malnutrition in a country that 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.379
 sells tourism and gastronomy and so on 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.389
 etc 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:11.440
 we have to be clear that the great challenge 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:14.950
 in this is 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.850
 just understand that this is not a 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.850
 consummate story 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.509
 because it sounds sometimes it seems so much that 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.580
 it seems like it's not the other way around, it 's a 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.590
 story that just begins the great 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.440
 challenge is in the professionalization 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.289
 extreme of each of the tools 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.169
 that are necessary to convert a 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.310
 raw cooking in a great experience 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.550
 a great experience in every way 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:45.669
 since you entered until you leave from 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.669
