just different layout as you can see up
and<00:04:13.450> down<00:04:13.980> bit<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.160> they're<00:04:15.250> all<00:04:15.340> basically

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
and down bit and they're all basically

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.280 
and down bit and they're all basically
same<00:04:15.910> moves<00:04:16.150> he<00:04:16.359> has<00:04:16.510> there's<00:04:16.750> no<00:04:16.930> difference

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
same moves he has there's no difference

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.240 
same moves he has there's no difference
between<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.680> truth<00:04:19.169> just<00:04:20.169> different<00:04:21.010> parts

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
between the truth just different parts

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.500 
between the truth just different parts
and<00:04:21.639> different<00:04:21.700> shape

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
and different shape

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.659 
and different shape
anyhow<00:04:22.900> so<00:04:23.169> he<00:04:23.410> has<00:04:23.530> a<00:04:23.560> much<00:04:23.800> longer<00:04:24.280> charge

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
anyhow so he has a much longer charge

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.480 
anyhow so he has a much longer charge
that<00:04:24.880> you<00:04:24.910> could<00:04:25.090> do<00:04:25.180> with<00:04:25.330> much<00:04:26.490> more

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
that you could do with much more

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.610 
that you could do with much more
interesting<00:04:27.850> things<00:04:28.030> it's<00:04:28.330> got<00:04:28.449> the<00:04:28.660> wide

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
interesting things it's got the wide

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.790 
interesting things it's got the wide
range<00:04:29.919> fall<00:04:30.880> of<00:04:31.120> lightning<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:31.780> his<00:04:32.530> tongue

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
range fall of lightning and his tongue

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.969
