00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.990
Tips and opinions, yerba mate

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Tests, brewing tea

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.990
Yerba mate - what is it exactly?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.990
 Well, not everyone knows but it is not tea.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You can frequently read 'yerba mate tea' or even 'yerba mate green tea' on its labels.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's green in colour, that's true but it isn't tea at all. It's a totally different plant, not related to tea.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.990
It's  'ilex paraguariensis'  which is Paraguayan ilex whereas tea is 'camellia sinensis'.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.990
It can have various forms: black, green, etc. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.990
while yerba mate is a herb which is completely unrelated to tea. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.990
Where does this terminology come from?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.990
Of course the word 'tea' has little in common with the original name of this plant which is 'cha'.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.990
originating from China which was then spread throughout Europe in different forms.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.990
Depending on the north or south pronunciation in China: 'cha' or 'tea'

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.990
In Poland it's 'herbata' because it's connected with Latin word 'herba' which is a herb. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
A herb of some plant, and 'tea' which is the plant - herba tea, which gave one word 'herbata',

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
so here you'd actually have to say 'herba mate' which would stand for a herb of mate plant.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It actually looks like that since we say yerba mate but the same source is from Latin.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
There are a few different names: yerba mate, herba matee, herba matchi, 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.990
it's pronounced in various ways.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.990
Originally and traditionally the word 'chai' is used 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
which is closer to the Chinese terminology of tea. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.990
It's a forever-green plant existing in South America 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.990
and yerba mate infusion is made of its leaves.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.990
Actually it is dry mate as we can make infusion in different ways which I will mention later.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.990
This plant virtually doesn't grow anywhere else.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.990
Yerba mate appears wildly only in South America 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.990
and has limited reach which also caused some difficulties with its cultivation

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.990
and it was impossible to grow it effectively anywhere else 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
so yerba mate is a traditional drink found only in South America.
