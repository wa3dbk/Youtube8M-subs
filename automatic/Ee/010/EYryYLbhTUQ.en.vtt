00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 this game is serious 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.120
 today we play jack bauer of a 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.070

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.420

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.000
 comments 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.370
 seemingly roudier it's a game that 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.700
 part of dragon ball z so his 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.950
 volkswagen barzi but that was because 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.140
 than 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.780
 to position we do not know goodbye 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.210
 so the games for continued I think 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.030
 when we start again 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.030

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.210
 5 many do not like hair 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.570
 a chance it's that it lacked 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.979
 power 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.930
