00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.309
 dreamweaver makes working with boost 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.949
 rap files very comfortable 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.890
 in the moment where you get a boost rap 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:19.500
 file in dreamweaver opens recognizes 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.320
 dream furthermore and hey leads the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.119
 elements are split into blue 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.520
 shown and ryan in gray we see 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.740
 So by the dashed lines 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.170
 always if we are in a split 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.440
 or in a row if you are 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.950
 an element selected like for example 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.320
 here 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.140
 then always the overlying 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.450
 element highlighted that can now 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.660
 Here I can see quite well when I see the picture 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.840
 then select that will enclose 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.180
 element here married as well 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.090
 the text or if I stop in here 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.960
 this element clique in the case 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.700
 a h 2 if i have the surrounding element 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.039
 So select this one 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.360
 then the so-called opens here 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:09.030
 Head-Up Display 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.520
 this shows us the corresponding classes 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.420
 to the class for the big variant 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.970
 lounge and the small small depending on 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.860
 whether I am in a column or a column 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.200
 I have the series here 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.830
 possibility to duplicate the element 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.920
 in this case now here is a column 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.960
 or other elements depending on 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.970
 which element we select here 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.150
 to have 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.300
 for example here then we can have one 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.240
 Add a new line I want that 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.920
 here for an element 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.890
 Try this one 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.380
 I click into clique then up here 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.600
 Add a new column and then 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.210
 we see that the column is simple 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.430
 was published or the same column 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.830
 Of course, it was added here again 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.080
 in the case without content about the 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.420
 remove button i can split the column too 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.369
 eliminate it again 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.470
 besides, if I have an outer one here 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.570
 have selected container then I 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.810
 here on the left and on the right 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.590
 side possibility the column too 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.410
 to edit 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.940
 here you can specify the size 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.580
 usually we have twelve here now 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.570
 if I split the whole thing now 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.580
 decrease 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.160
 then we'll see it like eleven o'clock right now 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.280
 ten are I was less the whole 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.870
 Just five 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.459
 so 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.540
 if I do the overlying 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.769
 element also reduced to five 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.930
 flow elements now in the case 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.760
 next to each other and now I can 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.909
 go and here the left area 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.250
 touch and click and drag to 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.860
 through the element select see there 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.890
 we can split it now I can 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.209
 click and drag to this her column 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.730
 to move to the right 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.099
 the gap between the two columns 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.860
 gets us here by these gray ones 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.349
 oblique lines represent heat so 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.170
 the possibility for a right here 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.269
 across the column size but also left 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.450
 on the possibility column offset 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.329
 here the layout later for the 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.420
 different devices resp 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:19.760
 you can adapt media queries here 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.019
 I also hide elements when I go to 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.260
 example here 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.599
 want to hide this textbox in the 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.879
 current view then i can just 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.579
 make a right click and then have 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.829
 we hide element here so this 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.250
 now hidden for these media 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.420
 query 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.780
 Of course, now the question arises 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.610
 how do I show this again ? 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.030
 In that case, we also join 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.650
 Right click no matter where in here somewhere 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.130
 our document and then we can 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.470
 Manage hidden elements here 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.930
 hook and then become elements again 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.880
 but here with this 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.230
 gray checkerboard pattern 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.510
 shows that is actually up 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.239
 is set transparent if I am now 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.709
 Into clique we see an eye here 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.390
 if I clique here now on the eye 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.260
 then the element becomes again 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.750
 displayed 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.780
 let's take a look at the 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.790
 components when we insert on the 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.970
 palette go then we have the 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.609
 Possibility to clean up in the category 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.739
 rap components to switch then if 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.230
 all our boots trap here 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.540
 components displayed when I enter now 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.750
 I would like to have a new element 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.640
 Just touch it and drag it 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.410
 Drop the spot where it likes 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.729
 would have as we will see the 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.570
 appropriate area then here 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.350
 got married 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.540
 When I let go, I am asked where I am 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.030
 want to insert the element before 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.090
 element after the element or embed 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.770
 and then I'll say the number here 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.669
 the columns now closed at 3 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.500
 and in front of the element and click on ok and 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.080
 already we split three here 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.450
 get added and this i can 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.660
 Now also fill with for example 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.640
 a button 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.650
 On the one hand, I can easily go into that 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.900
 click in element 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.580
 and then choose the button here like 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.860
 for example this blue one here 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.509
 then I am asked before or after 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.210
 embed i say embed now and 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:17.979
 then we have the button or I go 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.289
 I'll do that and undo 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.449
 do that too by dragging and dropping here 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:25.680
 So hold down the button and drag 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.360
 to put to the where I would like him to 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.669
 and if I let go then let go here 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.340
 we are the button then where 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.800
 just the pointer was marked 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.650
 So we saw that everything was in 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.830
 very much in dreamweaver here 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:44.220
 who happened so using boost rap here 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.490
 working very comfortably in dreamweaver 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.490
 can
