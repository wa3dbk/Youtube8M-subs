00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.319
 hello everyone welcome to the channel 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.330
 small video on easter eggs that you 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.150
 can meet the very beginning of this game 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.680
 there will be several here and the first one 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:21.810
 where is this map located close to 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:25.199
 from the tower here is the product itself here is such 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.529
 here is the lane that is what we have here 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.470
 some kind of road comes here 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.030
 This is the famous bakery. 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.480
 notice here here 's some more about 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.750
 streets 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:43.559
 I look at her from this side live for 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.250
 bread is called so this 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.250
 bakery 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:53.539
 I think many of you will understand what it is 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:56.550
 reference to the game sex photos so the following 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.510
 next everyone will be already tower 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:09.340
 here 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:11.909
 I'll just go so even save 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.909
 I will not be anyone 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.950
 not to pull say so time 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.210
 so the wall of honor is the so-called 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.260
 It is located directly in front of the goods haven 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.850
 all those who took an active part in 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.790
 creating this game testing 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.100
 optimization settings and so on 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.440
 forum members view all these people 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.330
 presented here are those 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.360
 photos are found in some 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.770
 places in this game but that's such a 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.259
 wall of honor 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.680
 so already accepted that in many games 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.360
 this is exactly what the developers are with their names 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.240
 most active participants 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.759
 puts some torino on tombstones 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.470
 whether on some descriptions means 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.420
 some corpses and so on i mean 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:15.890
 always something like this next after 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.780
 as you pass the mission first 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.950
 siblings 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.200
 you will search there on these on in 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:29.040
 It means the school but in the end find plastids 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.040
 explosives in one of the rooms in the classroom 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.350
 this 13 room in my opinion 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.840
 here under the number here will be a reference as 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.110
 exactly where to find it you could 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.110
 to discover 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:48.440
 a book that teaches you guitar 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.440
 as always ran in a circle 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.360
 picked up this book you can play on 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.360
 guitar 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:15.860
 so in the second game options Unfortunately 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:19.420
 so I can not hear, I will add a little bit like 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.420
 the guitar sounds like that 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.550
 Here is such a small Easter egg 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.850
 now we are not just bryn than giving out 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:37.300
 some two chords and fully issue 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:45.910
 like this tune is pretty nice so 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:49.920
 the next it is on the roof means 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.209
 you just need to go upstairs and 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.840
 come back often as they say here 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:59.580
 need 5-6 times here to go on 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.900
 opposite side 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:07.239
 can see there are checkers on the Vedas log in 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.910
 here and every time do some 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:13.810
 certain move when you win 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:19.299
 a drawing will appear here 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:22.090
 unique drawing on the assembly this weapon 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.440
 until the first part of easter eggs the rest 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.440
 will be my leadership incentive 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.290
 Here is such a story 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.270
 so on this I say goodbye to you all 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.960
 enjoy the game thanks for watching everyone 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.960
 bye Bye
