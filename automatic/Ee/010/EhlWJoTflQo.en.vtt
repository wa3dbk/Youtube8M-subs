you<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:10.049> distinguish<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.740> brown<00:01:10.950> anole<00:01:11.340> from

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
you can distinguish the brown anole from

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.700 
you can distinguish the brown anole from
its<00:01:12.150> native<00:01:12.570> relative<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> green<00:01:13.380> anole

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
its native relative the green anole

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.390 
its native relative the green anole
because<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> green<00:01:14.520> anole<00:01:14.880> has<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> much<00:01:15.330> more

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
because the green anole has a much more

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.690 
because the green anole has a much more
pointed<00:01:17.400> snout<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.060> green<00:01:18.930> anole<00:01:19.229> has<00:01:19.590> a

over<00:01:58.530> we<00:01:58.860> see<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> large<00:01:59.460> decline<00:01:59.700> in<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.180> green

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390

over we see a large decline in the green
anole<00:02:00.689> population<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.790> because

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
anole population and this is so because

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.539 
anole population and this is so because
they're<00:02:04.020> very<00:02:04.500> closely<00:02:04.770> related<00:02:04.890> they

the same habitat and food source and
they're<00:02:09.209> good<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:10.050> know<00:02:10.170> they<00:02:10.289> seem<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.530> be

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
they're good you know they seem to be

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.110 
they're good you know they seem to be
better<00:02:10.679> competitors<00:02:11.400> at<00:02:11.550> pushing<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:11.940> green
