this<00:00:28.949> creates<00:00:29.550> some<00:00:29.880> interest<00:00:30.510> we've<00:00:31.230> taken

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
this creates some interest we've taken

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.560 
this creates some interest we've taken
all<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> desk<00:00:32.070> jackets<00:00:32.550> off<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.180> see<00:00:33.390> that

all the desk jackets off to see that
spine<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.530> grab<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.950> color<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.640> add<00:00:35.760> it

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
spine and to grab that color to add it

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.970 
spine and to grab that color to add it
to<00:00:36.059> our<00:00:36.090> space<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.469> gives<00:00:37.680> us<00:00:37.860> an

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
to our space and it gives us an

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.549 
to our space and it gives us an
interesting<00:00:38.190> feel<00:00:38.790> we've<00:00:39.570> also<00:00:39.960> paired<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.440> up

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
interesting feel we've also paired it up

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.350 
interesting feel we've also paired it up
and<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.370> what<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.550> would<00:00:41.760> call<00:00:41.940> more<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
and this is what I would call more of a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.860 
and this is what I would call more of a
riser<00:00:42.680> situation<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:44.489> raise<00:00:44.910> up<00:00:45.149> items<00:00:45.600> like

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
riser situation to raise up items like

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.830 
riser situation to raise up items like
this<00:00:46.079> shell<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:47.129> create<00:00:47.430> interest<00:00:47.820> again<00:00:48.180> so

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
this shell to create interest again so

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.990 
this shell to create interest again so
we'll<00:00:49.260> look<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.860> other<00:00:49.980> areas<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
we'll look to this in other areas of the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.369 
we'll look to this in other areas of the
home<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.510> how<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.690> can<00:00:51.930> apply<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
home and see how you can apply it to

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.250 
home and see how you can apply it to
your<00:00:52.680> space<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.059> other<00:00:54.239> areas<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.050> home

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
your space so in other areas of the home

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.229 
your space so in other areas of the home
we<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.649> use<00:00:55.860> those<00:00:56.100> same<00:00:56.460> things<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.059> did

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
we can use those same things that we did

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.660 
we can use those same things that we did
in<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.390> bookcase<00:00:58.010> taking<00:00:59.010> even<00:00:59.250> three<00:00:59.430> books

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670

and make sure a paperback and hardback
having<00:01:02.640> those<00:01:02.730> desk<00:01:03.030> jackets<00:01:03.510> off<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.840> them

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
having those desk jackets off of them

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.479 
having those desk jackets off of them
and<00:01:04.170> putting<00:01:04.589> what<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.860> would<00:01:05.010> call<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> bonbon

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and putting what we would call a bonbon

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.990 
and putting what we would call a bonbon
on<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> top<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:07.260> paperweight<00:01:08.000> something

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
on the top so a paperweight something

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.760 
on the top so a paperweight something
that<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.330> meaningful<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:10.110> your<00:01:10.140> home<00:01:10.500> just
