00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello friends with you scrimmer pulled 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.720
 today there will be a review of magnus weapons this 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.940
 pistol 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.880
 something like a revolver which he so 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.710
 it's more the revolver described on it that 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.929
 he is flexible in use can revolver 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.690
 lethal weapon match for any you 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.789
 on but very difficult indeed for 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.119
 about this output, do a little bit of it 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.640
 it's hard why he is universal with him 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.010
 have his punches pierce the cut more 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.640
 hit yes it means accordingly 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.920
 suitable for any faction can kill 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.770
 as infected as side dishes and against 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.399
 shells can be used but here 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.190
 there is a small problem he's only 8 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.590
 he has no big bullets 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.690
 now it is without modules but pumped by 30 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:54.050
 hive let's i show it in arsenal from 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.489
 it has all the characteristics completely 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.020
 his conclave may be high 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.030
 enough I don't know why paired and 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.420
 there is no gun version 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.380
 maybe while maybe never 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.950
 there will be one slot polarized check mark 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.439
 such a gun to be honest to me 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.780
 really like why he is very 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.850
 difficult to shoot in terms of what the first 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.450
 the shot goes well troll and fast 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.729
 everything's great but here's the return 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.790
 on unpredictable absolutely and second 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.850
 3 10 shot is impossible to do 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.250
 I really didn't like the gun 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.840
 I advise you to buy it buy it only 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.610
 in case you are going 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:45.240
 for example swing your rank 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.909
 Well, in general, here and there, I'll show you how he is 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.350
 shoots in action you can see how 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:55.440
 the gun against the world is inserted 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:02.420
 here I was talking about recoil physical damage 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:05.280
 also not always happen here cut open 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.000
 even shoot your head out forever 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.000
 critically 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.299
 this 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.469
 liners are just one of the gun efforts in 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.780
 lol it doesn't apply 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:24.959
 and of course it can't be like this 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:29.939
 magnus behaves against the bodies of the maiden 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:32.239
 body and hide from me four 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.239
 the shot 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.040
 score 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.080
 nothing 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.190
 these 25 levels 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.760
 nothing from 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.760
 here he is 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.810
 guard four shots 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.840
 watch 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:26.940
 I am somewhat rather forced 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.670
 polarization well I don `t know what it is with us 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.900
 can put up a good 100 years but 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.450
 currently not in general if you are 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.140
 want yourself a gun to 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.560
 just fill the level do not pass 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.269
 by 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.450
 if you want to use it like 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:48.629
 primary secondary weapon i'm not 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.650
 I know the flag in your hands and of course the drum and 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.430
 sticks 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.569
 There but I do not advise absolutely 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.390
 such was the review 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.390
