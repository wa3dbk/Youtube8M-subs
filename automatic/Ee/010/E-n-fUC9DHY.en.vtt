00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
I have to say this is not a slippy as it

but<00:05:35.740> what<00:05:35.860> a<00:05:35.890> couple<00:05:37.230> very<00:05:38.230> different<00:05:38.770> though

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
but what a couple very different though

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.190 
but what a couple very different though
it's<00:05:39.640> different<00:05:40.210> than<00:05:40.360> it's<00:05:40.510> similar<00:05:40.750> same

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200

time<00:05:41.440> obviously<00:05:41.950> we<00:05:42.400> know<00:05:45.390> put<00:05:46.390> the<00:05:46.540> glide

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
time obviously we know put the glide

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.360 
time obviously we know put the glide

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
that you get on ice it's not the same
