00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.879

 I see is obese panel was very colorful 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:17.280

 Very good angel today on the radio globe now 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:36.360
 Let's hear the opinion of the people who 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:40.630
 I love this song, it 's the goat's face. 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.449
 the plane yours may well 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:48.810
 she is sensational the songs not so much and 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.810
 He was not much more or less Chinese. 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:05:00.290
 in the year 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.290
 you 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.940
 started this song well out of tune well 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.420
 out of tune 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.710
 it was not a business at all 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.300
 but for those who have a 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.160
 hearing a little more refined and I 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.410
 I'm sure my fellow jury 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.010
 you realize that you left the tone 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:23.100
 several times you have recovered after 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.740
 First chorus and then you half- pint 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.870
 apparently when you went to 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.690
 Incarnate a bit more the choreography 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.990
 You gave an improved February but 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:37.890
 so it was a perfect interpretation 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:41.420
 it was not now and we have to choreograph 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:44.850
 in terms of plasticity is you you become 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:47.010
 harmonized very well with so taking 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.780
 watch out for these songs the fall 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.700
 The mosque found all that it 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.700
 It's all bullshit. 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:06.140
 this song is a very difficult song 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:09.920
 has several modulations has a melody 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.720
 I also like it and I like this song 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.910
 for a long time and when I had the 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.130
 first time ever just came to my mind 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.080
 That would make it very cool for you to sing. 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.640
 this song that's why I told you that 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.160
 would be a good choice if you sing 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:25.430
 this song and today was a present power 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.670
 listen to your interpretation of this song and 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.830
 the beyoncé is an artist out of the ordinary 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.110
 but its interpretation certainly is 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.980
 very private and leaves nothing to 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:41.410
 Wish 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:44.420
 garden even had the wave of the day backyards 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:47.000
 this song is this song is very difficult 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.280
 It's full of pranks it's all module 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.320
 frame photo frame but it was great 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.280
 the module also along with love next to 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.280
 grape line 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:04.040
 Amanda South will fight and you will get a 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.420
 Now I do not have much to say. 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.810
 because so do not 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.390
 also keep at that level there does not think 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:14.390
 I can not fall, it 's too good. 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:21.070
 you complete the medium 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:23.990
 the last brigade brigade angel zé messias 

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:28.670
 big fan of airplane c 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:30.890
 only about what is not nothing has 

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:35.090
 be very careful because you are in a 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:38.180
 vocal transition c and d in your life is 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.680
 a great transformation by which 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.200
 you are passing 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.650
 You have to be careful is this thing of the 

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:49.730
 Easy applause is also very dangerous 

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:52.400
 Do not be fooled by this, you seemed 

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:56.450
 is a 16 year old boy who we 

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:59.810
 tolerate everything there be a good singer you 

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:03.170
 will be an excellent singer 

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:05.540
 but today you've been out of tune some 

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:08.570
 times and this is undeniable what 

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:11.420
 means you were a bad candidate 

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:16.660
 today it was no longer that it was out of the top 

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:16.660
 Have you been okay, Tchan? Go with god.
