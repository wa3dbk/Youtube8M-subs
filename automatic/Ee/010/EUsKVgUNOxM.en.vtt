to foster him first
come<00:00:11.309> on<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.639> just<00:00:12.150> like<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.469> fact<00:00:13.799> that

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
come on I just like the fact that

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.129 
come on I just like the fact that
something<00:00:14.460> will<00:00:15.000> be<00:00:15.120> around<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.690> give<00:00:15.839> us<00:00:15.960> that

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
something will be around to give us that

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.650

unconditional<00:00:16.590> love<00:00:16.949> look<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.449> love

unconditional love look and we to love
as<00:00:18.900> well<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.529> thought<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.859> dog<00:00:20.100> would<00:00:20.369> be<00:00:20.550> that

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
as well I thought a dog would be that

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.960 
as well I thought a dog would be that
extra<00:00:21.680> support<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.890> guess<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.550> when<00:00:23.820> I'm

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
extra support I guess so when I'm

best way to evaluate does you get to see

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.109 
best way to evaluate does you get to see
who<00:01:05.159> they<00:01:05.280> really<00:01:05.549> are

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119
