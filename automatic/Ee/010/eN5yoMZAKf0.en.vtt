00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.959
 Hello everyone, today we will explain 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.669
 how to change how to change gear 

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:09.760
 electronic on our presence 

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:11.920
 the tools we will need are 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.640
 a very simple Allen key from 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.810
 four a flat screwdriver 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:23.130
 a 10- inch wrench, a 5-point allen key 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:25.380
 another bubble of 4 and our auction that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.720
 the change in must be changed 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.119
 question is a reduction of 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.060
 length of 5 centimeters in this case 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.290
 I cut it to this height or 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:39.240
 reduced by 5 centimeters and after which the 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.100
 reassembled this because why 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.700
 mounting the electronic gear that it has 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.649
 a length more or less than 5 cm added 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.320
 to the st 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.930
 must have a rod length to the rod 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.760
 original now I'll show you how 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.519
 leonardo 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.590
 let's start with the assembly first 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:03.000
 what we take the auction and we screw the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:07.070
 sensor in this case is a dynojet that 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.020
 it is activated with traction we screw the rod 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.230
 until it comes to a stop after which with 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:19.500
 the a10 miss has prepared before we serve 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:22.350
 in order to fix the ball change well 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.840
 then we proceed to the assembly on the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.840
 rod motion with sensor attached 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.300
 live 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:44.920
 the complete auction on ours on ours 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.510
 send change as you see very much 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.390
 easy that the thread is twisted then 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.020
 keep it so you can easily 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.130
 to avoid the auction until you bring it like 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.160
 see here 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.580
 the auction knocked down by dott 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.080
 after which we will also screw this data 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.920
 with a key like we did before 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.920
 for the data above 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.770
 we bring st back to the height of 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:19.350
 referral with the key of four that there 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:23.720
 we are prepared before we go to fix it 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.720
 on our referral 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.720
 ok the mechanical part is finished now 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.280
 we'll see how to connect the part 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.740
 power 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.970
 regarding the commission now 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:44.280
 of the sensor the control unit 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.560
 let's take our cable let's say for 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.430
 save time I have already passed 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.040
 the cable from po over the inside then 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.810
 you have to raise the tank and after 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.390
 that the children will succeed with the 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.190
 battery 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.060
 you see they come from here to this point 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:06.590
 the control unit must be raised slightly 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.940
 remove the smaller connector ok 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.940
 with a screwdriver 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.760
 we must press on this catch that 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.010
 thus allows the pins to come out 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.830
 inside this point we must 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.370
 look for pin 21 that ping this when 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:28.470
 see this white ball you need with 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.690
 a screwdriver does not remove it we take 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.030
 our connector of ours 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.740
 central of our sensor and it 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.740
 we insert inside the hole 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.500
 sending it as far as it goes ok this way 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.739
 no longer goes down 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.600
 after which we must close the catch 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.480
 you see this the white teeth press 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.900
 first one then the other you see in this 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.489
 in case the connector does not close this 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.090
 because because the sense the thread does not 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.110
 still went well inside then 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.690
 we take pliers and but we succeed in 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.210
 make more strength and push the better 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.800
 thread inside 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.230
 after which we try again to close again 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.720
 our sensor this time yes 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.780
 will close without problems 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:22.480
 then we insert his again 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:25.060
 we hang up a control unit e 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.700
 we have finished the first part now 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.850
 the other end of our sensor will remain 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.600
 that will go directly connected at least 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.600
 from the battery 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:46.210
 ok you are connected to this point 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.670
 we can close the seat cover 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:54.180
 tighten the screws and try ours 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:54.180
 sensor and now we just have to try it
