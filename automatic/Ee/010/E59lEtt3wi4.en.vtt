 Written delayed expansion of knowledge by its enormous 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.420
 speed and efficiency limitations 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.320
 the restlessness by the slowness of the disclosure to pen and ink was 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.360
 latent in the century of lights 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.760
 and numerous mechanical artisans went to the task of solving the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.020
 problem 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.020

 they presented their alternative proposals 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.900
 all looking for a more useful and practical design 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.480
 from there the typewriter unleashed a cultural revolution not

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.700
 of typewriters to produce up to the goal 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.079
 despite the fact that the contraption had a reign of 130 years in the most

 and it happens that the objective of the activity is quite heavy we d 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.689
 we develop the muscles of the fingers 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.659
 to such an extent that we hit the keyboard very hard the computer agreement 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:02.249
 they came with a keyboard or very weak and like everyone accustomed to the tapping 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:03.539
