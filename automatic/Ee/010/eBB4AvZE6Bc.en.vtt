00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.010
 our motocross classes go to 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.099
 home stretch is waiting for me today 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.169
 main test race on racing 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.970
 track and as always my mentor 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:22.460
 will be a veteran of bender motocross or 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.040
 Amanda but we will try tricks 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.989
 overtaking you drove to this for big 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.079
 radius better ride on a small radius 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:32.989
 and second we will try today by 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.210
 drive across the whole line that is 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.000
 you will drive all the way we mark 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.760
 time at the beginning of the workout and then 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.410
 check the time with the open head and 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.140
 see the difference but given that 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.690
 we have in frame two motorcycle race with us 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.360
 will be dynamic and I'll try with 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.530
 you drive on the highway make you 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.650
 competition so that you have more 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.170
 simulated 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.170
 Riding more interesting 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.680
 all previous classes I spent on 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.300
 first gear and motorcycle did not develop 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.700
 great speed and it was safe 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.260
 for a newbie today when in a race 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.900
 the whole track is involved 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.909
 it's almost 1200 meters I will have 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.400
 speed up and overcome springboards for 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.650
 this we learn to switch to the second and 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.119
 third speed motocross not 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.950
 be sure to use the clutch and 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.229
 universal box it allows 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.140
 include all gears without dropping 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.759
 first show than down countries click gear 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.430
 standing on pads 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.570
 and when you need to switch you can 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.729
 before you move when you need to 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:45.640
 switched a lot removed again on the pillow 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:47.380
 again switched the good removed more 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.720
 part of the track the rider drives to 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.590
 standing motorcycle it's not easy to do 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.380
 newcomer 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.840
 clutch two handles brakes gas and foot 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.000
 gear shift is not enough pair 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.520
 extra limbs to manage everything 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.179
 this but the coach still hear not from me 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.280
 task 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.619
 otherwise pass the so-called cipher 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.630
 impossible not to mention that on 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.630
 springboard and drive in only standing 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.700
 it's time to go all the way 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.120
 to find out what's happening on the track and 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.520
 how to use these all gears and all 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.780
 still on the track and on the very barrels probably 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.430
 knows every bump before entering 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.209
 competitions for some fast riders 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.209
 many pass on the whole route on foot 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.209
 prepayments 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.050
 already at the first meters of the track I regretted 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.569
 that did not study it in advance each 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.459
 obstacle unique one springboard 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.700
 need to take on the speed the other way around 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.459
 easy to jump I can not yet but 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.959
 and without it enough thrill 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.790
 when i give rival a wish 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.500
 compete dulls the sense of fear 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.450
 several times in the course of the circle I stalled 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.730
 somehow accidentally turned on the wrong gear 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.980
 because of the wrong position of the legs and my 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.390
 8 10 cubic monster toothy 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.670
 tires howled 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.760
 but I still kept myself in the saddle and never 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.160
 didn't fall it's time to learn a new chapter 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.310
 motocross overtaking on bends we 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.560
 tried to take two radii one radius 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.110
 I will go, let's say something big about 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:34.299
 external on internal you will manifest mine 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:36.310
 the challenge to overtake a turn can be entered on 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.170
 high speed but you have to 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.970
 go in a big arc in the end 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.579
 distance increases 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.500
 the path is cut off by a small radius but 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.049
 more is required here from the rider 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.060
 skill due to such nuances can 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.139
 improve lap time by a few seconds 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.579
 this and we will soon prove experimentally 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.239
 it was noticeable only suresupply went out 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.670
 small radius 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.010
 I had to keep a large radius 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.459
 that is, I increase the distance and that is 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.830
 how would i close by this 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.530
 I've been to how you would get in 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:15.739
 small radius and overlap me already on 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:17.720
 exit you now we notice how many 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.269
 time i will take the lap first 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.550
 Check in will take place over a large radius of 2 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.550
 small difference will show a stopwatch 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.770
 time of the first lap is the minute 09 best 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.810
 result due to multiplied tricks 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.389
 on the mastery of passing through small 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.720
 radius harder to fit into a narrow 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.639
 track that ate enters the wheel is me 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.190
 still had one on the track during 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.990
 mass check in now and then you are attacked 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.889
 rivals and have to actively 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.889
 maneuver 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.199
 This race was on our small radius and 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.050
 you have got the time 063 minutes 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.759
 I saved a second count on each 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.520
 Circle brought it because you 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.910
 there were everywhere small radii three turns you 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.300
 if the rooms 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.760
 in motocross this is the absolute last 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.920
 the lesson was the most energy-intensive one and a half 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.350
 hours of study exhausted so I barely 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.490
 raised foot to turn kickstarter 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.160
 and start the bike 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.620
 but what I learned to do is already big 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.360
 breakthrough for me man who month 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:35.310
 back first sat on a motocross bike 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.530
 those were the lessons that you don't want 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.890
 skip 0 cross is actually very 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.200
 fascinating and accessible sport is 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.570
 we proved on our experiment people 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.940
 they think it's such a dangerous sport 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:52.310
 professional sport motocross from 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:55.230
 amateur for veterans for different 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.350
 there are no obstacles everyone can for 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.950
 find yourself in this sport something 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.950
 interesting
