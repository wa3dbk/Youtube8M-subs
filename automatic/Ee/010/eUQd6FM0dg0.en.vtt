00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
doing this for my family I need to get

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.640 
doing this for my family I need to get
my<00:02:59.850> son<00:02:59.910> out<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.420> this<00:03:00.690> world<00:03:00.990> I<00:03:01.200> need<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.500> get

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
my son out of this world I need to get

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.740 
my son out of this world I need to get
my<00:03:01.800> son<00:03:01.860> into<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.670> safe<00:03:02.970> place<00:03:03.270> and<00:03:03.300> so<00:03:03.600> he

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
my son into a safe place and so he

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.270 
my son into a safe place and so he
doesn't<00:03:04.020> go<00:03:04.110> down<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.410> same<00:03:04.590> road<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:05.040> I

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
doesn't go down the same road that I

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.220 
doesn't go down the same road that I
went<00:03:05.610> on<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:05.970> think<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.330> that's<00:03:06.450> as<00:03:07.110> long

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
went on and I think that that's as long

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.870 
went on and I think that that's as long
as<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.440> follow<00:03:07.680> that<00:03:07.980> through<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.370> think<00:03:08.730> it's

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
as you follow that through I think it's

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.270 
as you follow that through I think it's
a<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.600> really<00:03:09.870> sort<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.140> strong<00:03:10.500> thing<00:03:11.010> and

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
a it's a really sort of strong thing and

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.729 
a it's a really sort of strong thing and
respectful<00:03:12.030> thing<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.209> play<00:03:12.540> do<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:12.930> look

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
respectful thing to play do you look
