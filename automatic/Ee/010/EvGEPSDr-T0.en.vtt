what<00:01:02.180> I<00:01:02.210> really<00:01:02.780> like<00:01:02.990> about<00:01:03.020> this<00:01:03.380> technique

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
what I really like about this technique

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.590 
what I really like about this technique
is<00:01:04.160> that<00:01:04.430> first<00:01:04.670> of<00:01:04.790> all<00:01:04.880> it<00:01:05.059> puts<00:01:05.300> you<00:01:05.450> in<00:01:05.540> a

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
is that first of all it puts you in a

about<00:01:20.000> this<00:01:20.410> for<00:01:21.410> a<00:01:21.500> sacrifice<00:01:22.130> crew<00:01:22.480> is<00:01:23.480> how

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
about this for a sacrifice crew is how

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.890 
about this for a sacrifice crew is how
you<00:01:23.690> sit<00:01:23.990> down<00:01:24.200> I'm<00:01:24.620> not<00:01:24.830> pulling<00:01:25.640> my<00:01:25.820> back<00:01:26.210> I'm

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
you sit down I'm not pulling my back I'm

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.640 
you sit down I'm not pulling my back I'm
sitting<00:01:27.710> by<00:01:28.490> but<00:01:28.930> I've<00:01:29.930> been<00:01:30.050> sittin<00:01:30.350> screwed

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
sitting by but I've been sittin screwed

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.280 
sitting by but I've been sittin screwed
on<00:01:30.910> Blake<00:01:31.910> books<00:01:32.180> is<00:01:32.660> like<00:01:32.900> very<00:01:33.680> City<00:01:34.070> role

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
on Blake books is like very City role

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:54.609 
on Blake books is like very City role
they<00:01:36.290> look<00:01:36.470> here<00:01:53.200> what<00:01:54.200> I<00:01:54.229> guess<00:01:54.410> I<00:01:54.440> just

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
they look here what I guess I just

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.830 
they look here what I guess I just
ignore<00:01:55.040> a<00:01:55.070> little<00:01:55.369> bit<00:01:55.460> differently<00:01:55.850> but<00:01:56.780> i

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
ignore a little bit differently but i

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.330 
ignore a little bit differently but i
find<00:01:57.110> this<00:01:57.170> way<00:01:57.470> to<00:01:57.830> be<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:57.979> little<00:01:58.130> more

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
find this way to be a little more

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.090 
find this way to be a little more
effective<00:01:59.290> all<00:02:00.290> right<00:02:00.440> now<00:02:00.530> it's<00:02:00.830> good<00:02:01.009> and

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
effective all right now it's good and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.480 
effective all right now it's good and
lie<00:02:01.220> down<00:02:03.820> so<00:02:05.530> when<00:02:06.530> I<00:02:06.560> see<00:02:06.800> a<00:02:06.830> lot<00:02:07.040> of<00:02:07.070> guys<00:02:07.280> do

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
lie down so when I see a lot of guys do

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.930 
lie down so when I see a lot of guys do
they<00:02:07.820> go<00:02:07.970> for<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.209> Kimura<00:02:08.510> and<00:02:09.610> I'm<00:02:10.610> trying<00:02:10.850> to

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
they go for the Kimura and I'm trying to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.360 
they go for the Kimura and I'm trying to
step<00:02:11.180> over<00:02:11.330> here<00:02:11.720> do<00:02:12.650> this<00:02:12.830> sort<00:02:13.070> of<00:02:13.160> number

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
step over here do this sort of number

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.180 
step over here do this sort of number
and<00:02:13.790> then<00:02:13.940> finishing<00:02:14.239> you<00:02:14.390> can<00:02:14.680> but<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:15.890> think

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
and then finishing you can but I think

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.820 
and then finishing you can but I think
it<00:02:16.310> gives<00:02:16.580> up<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.790> lot<00:02:16.970> of<00:02:17.090> space<00:02:17.680> ours<00:02:18.680> you<00:02:18.800> know

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
it gives up a lot of space ours you know

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.180 
it gives up a lot of space ours you know
like<00:02:19.510> I'm<00:02:20.510> just<00:02:20.660> going<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:20.870> knee<00:02:21.080> over<00:02:21.410> based<00:02:22.040> I

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
like I'm just going to knee over based I

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:31.230 
like I'm just going to knee over based I
sit<00:02:22.459> on<00:02:22.550> his<00:02:22.670> face<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:24.080> then<00:02:24.140> posture<00:02:24.709> up<00:02:27.040> so
