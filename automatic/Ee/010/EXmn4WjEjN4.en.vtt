hi<00:00:01.170> I'm<00:00:01.500> Molly<00:00:01.680> in<00:00:02.010> this<00:00:02.100> video<00:00:02.280> going<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.639> be

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
hi I'm Molly in this video going to be

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.640 
hi I'm Molly in this video going to be
take<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:02.879> look<00:00:03.060> at<00:00:03.179> the<00:00:03.270> tech<00:00:03.480> 21<00:00:03.929> folio<00:00:04.380> case

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
take a look at the tech 21 folio case

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.829 
take a look at the tech 21 folio case
for<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:04.980> ipad<00:00:05.279> mini<00:00:05.339> so<00:00:05.850> this<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.150> case

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
for the ipad mini so this is the case

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.990 
for the ipad mini so this is the case
itself<00:00:07.259> you're<00:00:07.859> not<00:00:07.980> familiar<00:00:08.130> with<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.730> tech

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
itself you're not familiar with the tech

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.810 
itself you're not familiar with the tech
21<00:00:09.420> they<00:00:09.690> all<00:00:09.840> feature<00:00:10.080> d3o<00:00:10.740> technology<00:00:11.370> which

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
21 they all feature d3o technology which

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.419 
21 they all feature d3o technology which
is<00:00:11.969> basically<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.480> kind<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.380> gel<00:00:13.860> substance

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
is basically a kind of gel substance

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.310 
is basically a kind of gel substance
that<00:00:14.639> when<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.880> hits<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.360> goes<00:00:15.540> rock<00:00:15.809> hard<00:00:16.109> and

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
that when it hits it goes rock hard and

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.590 
that when it hits it goes rock hard and
stops<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.460> apart<00:00:17.730> from<00:00:17.880> reaching<00:00:18.090> your<00:00:18.270> phone

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
stops you apart from reaching your phone

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.170 
stops you apart from reaching your phone
and<00:00:18.920> so<00:00:19.920> basically<00:00:20.279> you've<00:00:20.369> got<00:00:20.490> d<00:00:20.640> 30<00:00:20.910> line

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
and so basically you've got d 30 line

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.340 
and so basically you've got d 30 line
through<00:00:21.390> there<00:00:21.510> there's<00:00:21.720> two<00:00:21.869> million<00:00:22.170> meters

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
through there there's two million meters

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.109 
through there there's two million meters
are<00:00:22.529> there<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.460> back<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.880> case

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
are there it's in the back of the case

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.480 
are there it's in the back of the case
and<00:00:24.449> also<00:00:24.900> runs<00:00:25.350> up<00:00:25.500> here<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.189> edges<00:00:26.460> are

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
and also runs up here so the edges are

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.830

because<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> way<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.070> edges<00:01:44.729> work<00:01:44.970> around

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
because of the way the edges work around

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.149 
because of the way the edges work around
here<00:01:45.360> they're<00:01:45.540> absolutely<00:01:45.840> rock<00:01:46.110> solid<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.100> if

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
here they're absolutely rock solid so if

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.530 
here they're absolutely rock solid so if
you<00:01:47.220> drop<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:47.729> any<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.090> corners

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
you drop this in on any of the corners

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.030 
you drop this in on any of the corners
it's<00:01:48.720> highly<00:01:48.990> protected<00:01:49.500> you've<00:01:49.680> got<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> T

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
it's highly protected you've got the T

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.590 
it's highly protected you've got the T
30<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.460> runs<00:01:50.640> across<00:01:50.759> there<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.479> it's

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
30 that runs across there so it's

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.810

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
is you've got the stand function there

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.060 
is you've got the stand function there
are<00:02:00.479> several<00:02:00.780> grooves<00:02:01.200> across<00:02:01.590> here<00:02:01.860> that

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
are several grooves across here that

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.249 
are several grooves across here that
enable<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.640> get<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> angle<00:02:03.240> will<00:02:04.110> just

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
enable you to get the angle will just

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.600 
enable you to get the angle will just
show<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.560> from<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.770> side<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.399> get<00:02:05.520> pretty

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
show up from the side you can get pretty

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.910 
show up from the side you can get pretty
much<00:02:05.790> anything<00:02:05.939> from<00:02:06.270> 90<00:02:06.689> degrees<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.770> you

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
much anything from 90 degrees and you

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.589 
much anything from 90 degrees and you
can<00:02:08.069> move<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.399> all<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> way<00:02:08.759> down<00:02:09.030> that's<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
can move it all the way down that's the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.330 
can move it all the way down that's the
bottom<00:02:10.200> ledge<00:02:10.410> but<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.770> will<00:02:10.920> still<00:02:11.160> support

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
bottom ledge but it will still support

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.320 
bottom ledge but it will still support
itself<00:02:11.849> all<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.180> way<00:02:12.420> down<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.660> there

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
itself all the way down to there

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.030 
itself all the way down to there
so<00:02:13.600> you've<00:02:13.720> got<00:02:13.750> complete<00:02:14.200> flexibility<00:02:14.830> on

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
so you've got complete flexibility on

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.100 
so you've got complete flexibility on
the<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.580> angle<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.030> choose<00:02:16.330> which<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.690> which

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
the the angle you choose which is which

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.620 
the the angle you choose which is which
is<00:02:17.140> really<00:02:17.470> good<00:02:17.710> so<00:02:18.700> all<00:02:19.030> in<00:02:19.180> all<00:02:19.270> it<00:02:19.360> does<00:02:19.510> add

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
is really good so all in all it does add

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.630 
is really good so all in all it does add
a<00:02:19.660> little<00:02:19.870> bit<00:02:20.020> of<00:02:20.080> bolt<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.280> ipad

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
a little bit of bolt to the to the ipad

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.400 
a little bit of bolt to the to the ipad
mini<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:22.150> but<00:02:22.930> you're<00:02:23.050> obviously<00:02:23.110> all

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410
