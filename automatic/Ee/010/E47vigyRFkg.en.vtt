primase protein during the replication

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.459 
primase protein during the replication
and<00:00:11.849> we<00:00:12.030> all<00:00:12.150> know<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.570> we<00:00:12.780> have<00:00:12.809> seen<00:00:13.080> in

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
and we all know that we have seen in

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.530 
and we all know that we have seen in
couple<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.950> times<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.639> prime<00:00:15.000> this

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
couple of times that this prime this

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.720 
couple of times that this prime this
clamp<00:00:16.139> loader<00:00:16.379> protein<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> very<00:00:17.250> important

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
clamp loader protein is a very important

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.550 
clamp loader protein is a very important
protein<00:00:17.940> which<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.420> helping<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.840> increase<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
protein which is helping to increase the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.099 
protein which is helping to increase the
processivity<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.550> DNA<00:00:21.390> polymerase<00:00:21.750> see

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
processivity of DNA polymerase see

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.009 
processivity of DNA polymerase see
during<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.710> DNA<00:00:23.279> replication<00:00:23.789> stages<00:00:24.300> now

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
during the DNA replication stages now

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.359 
during the DNA replication stages now
what<00:00:25.199> happens<00:00:25.590> during<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.949> replication

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
what happens during the replication

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.599 
what happens during the replication
stages<00:00:27.000> let<00:00:27.960> me<00:00:28.109> go<00:00:28.260> back<00:00:28.439> okay

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
stages let me go back okay

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.330 
stages let me go back okay
now<00:00:30.000> what<00:00:30.179> happens<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.720> replication<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
now what happens in replication that the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.900 
now what happens in replication that the
DNA<00:00:32.700> polymerase<00:00:33.000> C<00:00:33.600> code<00:00:34.050> enzyme<00:00:34.489> is<00:00:35.489> not

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
DNA polymerase C code enzyme is not

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.670 
DNA polymerase C code enzyme is not
having<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.480> higher<00:00:36.630> processivity<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.500> it

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
having a higher processivity so it

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.560 
having a higher processivity so it
cannot<00:00:38.100> hold<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.820> DNA<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.329> long

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
cannot hold on to the DNA for a long

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.540 
cannot hold on to the DNA for a long
time<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.379> what<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:40.770> having<00:00:40.920> we<00:00:41.219> end<00:00:41.430> up

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
time so what we are having we end up

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.170 
time so what we are having we end up
with<00:00:41.700> making<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:43.430> fork<00:00:44.430> or<00:00:44.670> replication

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
with making this fork or replication

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.720 
with making this fork or replication
fork<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.289> replication<00:00:46.890> fork<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.460> there

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
fork and this replication fork it there

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.060 
fork and this replication fork it there
is<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> polymerase<00:00:48.809> Ercole<00:00:49.140> polymerase<00:00:49.710> enzyme

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
is a polymerase Ercole polymerase enzyme

00:00:50.070 --> 00:01:01.670 
is a polymerase Ercole polymerase enzyme
for<00:00:50.340> example<00:00:52.399> so<00:00:59.239> okay<00:01:00.239> now<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:01.020> polymer<00:01:01.559> is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
for example so okay now this polymer is

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.130 
for example so okay now this polymer is
a<00:01:01.710> cold<00:01:02.039> polymers<00:01:02.460> enzyme<00:01:02.850> will<00:01:03.059> bind<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.539> one

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
a cold polymers enzyme will bind to one

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.960 
a cold polymers enzyme will bind to one
of<00:01:04.290> these<00:01:04.470> strands<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.129> can<00:01:05.309> synthesizes

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
of these strands and it can synthesizes

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.640 
of these strands and it can synthesizes
the<00:01:06.000> nucleotide<00:01:06.540> sequences<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> other

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
the nucleotide sequences on the other

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.060 
the nucleotide sequences on the other
hand<00:01:08.040> now<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.210> cannot<00:01:09.810> synthesize<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.409> longer

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
hand now it cannot synthesize a longer

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.330 
hand now it cannot synthesize a longer
amount<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.580> DNA<00:01:11.970> for<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> long<00:01:12.750> time<00:01:12.990> or

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
amount of DNA for for a long time or

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.770 
amount of DNA for for a long time or
many<00:01:14.340> number<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.640> nucleotide<00:01:15.119> sequences<00:01:15.630> for

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
many number of nucleotide sequences for

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.350 
many number of nucleotide sequences for
a<00:01:15.810> long<00:01:16.020> time<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.770> will<00:01:16.920> dissociate<00:01:17.310> from<00:01:17.820> this

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
a long time it will dissociate from this

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.330 
a long time it will dissociate from this
DNA<00:01:18.960> only<00:01:19.110> after<00:01:19.500> synthesizing<00:01:20.070> fewer

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
DNA only after synthesizing fewer

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.760 
DNA only after synthesizing fewer
nucleotide<00:01:20.880> sequences<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.259> why<00:01:22.470> we

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
nucleotide sequences so that's why we

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.130 
nucleotide sequences so that's why we
need<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.159> ensure<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:24.450> polymer<00:01:25.020> is

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
need to ensure that this polymer is

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.990 
need to ensure that this polymer is
enzyme<00:01:25.530> or<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> activity<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.580> polymers

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
enzyme or the activity of the polymers

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.490 
enzyme or the activity of the polymers
enzyme<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.659> go<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.799> for<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> long<00:01:29.430> time

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
enzyme can go on to for a long time

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.380 
enzyme can go on to for a long time
utilizing<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.159> or<00:01:32.729> utilizing<00:01:33.270> those

nucleotide sequences and that can only

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.090 
nucleotide sequences and that can only
be<00:01:35.640> possible<00:01:35.970> if<00:01:36.360> we<00:01:36.570> give<00:01:36.990> them<00:01:37.259> another

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
be possible if we give them another

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.310 
be possible if we give them another
mechanism<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.150> mechanism<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.810> provided

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320

and<00:02:07.979> right<00:02:08.520> after<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.940> attachment<00:02:09.209> with<00:02:09.899> this

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
and right after the attachment with this

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.350 
and right after the attachment with this
clamp<00:02:10.349> now<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.160> polymer<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.730> enzyme<00:02:12.120> can

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
clamp now this polymer is enzyme can

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.610 
clamp now this polymer is enzyme can
synthesize<00:02:12.599> and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
synthesize and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.280 
synthesize and
add<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.730> nucleotide<00:02:15.239> sequences<00:02:15.810> for<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.020> long

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
add the nucleotide sequences for a long

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.170 
add the nucleotide sequences for a long
time<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.340> process<00:02:17.730> if<00:02:17.849> ax<00:02:17.910> T<00:02:18.030> will

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
time so the process if ax T will

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.479 
time so the process if ax T will
increase<00:02:18.660> now<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.470> importance<00:02:20.099> of<00:02:20.220> clamp

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
increase now the importance of clamp

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.160 
increase now the importance of clamp
loader<00:02:20.760> protein<00:02:21.239> as<00:02:21.420> well<00:02:21.720> as<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.959> clamp

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.220 
loader protein as well as the clamp
proteins<00:02:22.560> we<00:02:22.770> know<00:02:23.069> are<00:02:23.310> very<00:02:23.550> very

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
proteins we know are very very

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.540 
proteins we know are very very

presence of this clamp load not it's not
clamped<00:02:41.310> on<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.459> clamp<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.940> here<00:02:42.239> this<00:02:42.480> is

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
clamped on the clamp and here this is

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.240 
clamped on the clamp and here this is
the<00:02:42.720> clamp<00:02:42.959> proteins<00:02:43.380> now<00:02:43.800> this<00:02:43.980> clamp

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
the clamp proteins now this clamp

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.190 
the clamp proteins now this clamp
proteins<00:02:44.700> are<00:02:44.880> structurally<00:02:45.569> almost<00:02:45.959> similar

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.289 
proteins are structurally almost similar
in<00:02:46.470> all<00:02:46.590> these<00:02:46.799> cases<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:47.910> case<00:02:48.150> this

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
in all these cases so in this case this

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.350 
in all these cases so in this case this
is<00:02:48.360> also<00:02:48.560> telling<00:02:49.560> us<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.850> evolutionary

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
is also telling us the evolutionary

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.460 
is also telling us the evolutionary
origin<00:02:51.810> for<00:02:52.019> this

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
origin for this

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.830 
origin for this
okay<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:52.890> common<00:02:53.489> ancestor<00:02:53.970> from<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.510> we<00:02:54.810> are

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
okay so common ancestor from that we are

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.539 
okay so common ancestor from that we are
having<00:02:55.110> branching<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:55.920> all<00:02:56.010> these<00:02:56.190> things<00:02:56.430> it

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
having branching and all these things it

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.460 
having branching and all these things it
is<00:02:56.610> showing<00:02:57.060> us<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.299> because<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:58.140> can<00:02:58.319> see

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
is showing us that because you can see

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.660 
is showing us that because you can see
the<00:02:58.650> structure<00:02:58.920> is<00:02:59.160> almost<00:02:59.489> similar<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:01.670> in

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
the structure is almost similar and in

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.610 
the structure is almost similar and in
case<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:02.910> e.coli<00:03:03.510> there<00:03:03.870> are<00:03:04.019> two<00:03:04.260> different

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
case of e.coli there are two different

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.589 
case of e.coli there are two different
types<00:03:04.769> of<00:03:05.010> subunits<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.640> three<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:06.360> each

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
types of subunits and three of each

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.839 
types of subunits and three of each
subunit<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.319> making<00:03:07.709> it<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.160> in<00:03:08.640> case<00:03:08.670> of

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
subunit is making it and in case of

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.430 
subunit is making it and in case of
human<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:09.480> is<00:03:09.630> three<00:03:09.870> different<00:03:10.019> type<00:03:10.410> of

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
human this is three different type of

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.530 
human this is three different type of
subunit<00:03:11.069> two<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.519> them<00:03:11.730> are<00:03:11.940> making<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.420> in

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
subunit two of them are making it in

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.170 
subunit two of them are making it in
case<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:13.110> Farge<00:03:13.349> again<00:03:14.099> in<00:03:14.280> case<00:03:14.430> if<00:03:14.640> this<00:03:15.030> is

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
case of Farge again in case if this is

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.940 
case of Farge again in case if this is
three<00:03:15.390> different<00:03:15.540> type<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:15.959> subunit<00:03:16.530> two<00:03:16.769> of

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
three different type of subunit two of

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.949 
three different type of subunit two of
each<00:03:17.190> are<00:03:17.790> making<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:18.660> beta<00:03:19.290> clamp<00:03:19.670> now<00:03:20.959> so

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
each are making this beta clamp now so

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.930 
each are making this beta clamp now so
ultimately<00:03:22.380> six<00:03:22.769> subunits<00:03:23.280> are<00:03:23.400> interacting

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
ultimately six subunits are interacting

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.789 
ultimately six subunits are interacting
together<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.359> make<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.660> clamp<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.140> this<00:03:25.560> lab

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
together to make this clamp and this lab

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.920 
together to make this clamp and this lab
symmetries<00:03:26.579> almost<00:03:27.000> looks<00:03:27.269> similar<00:03:27.510> in<00:03:27.780> all

symmetries almost looks similar in all
these<00:03:28.109> cases<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.890> all<00:03:29.100> these<00:03:29.250> cases<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:29.609> can

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
these cases and all these cases you can

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.670 
these cases and all these cases you can
see<00:03:29.970> there<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.239> loop<00:03:30.630> structure<00:03:31.079> in<00:03:31.170> outside

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
see there is a loop structure in outside

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.770 
see there is a loop structure in outside
region<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.370> also<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.880> central<00:03:33.180> channel

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780

through<00:03:34.290> where<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:35.489> DNA<00:03:36.209> strand<00:03:36.630> will<00:03:36.810> pass

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
through where the DNA strand will pass

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.680 
through where the DNA strand will pass
okay<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:38.489> this<00:03:38.670> is<00:03:38.790> extremely<00:03:39.000> conserved

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
okay so this is extremely conserved

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.720 
okay so this is extremely conserved

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
the scratch there so RNA polymerase

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.640 
the scratch there so RNA polymerase
synthesizes<00:04:38.639> it<00:04:39.120> de<00:04:39.509> novo<00:04:39.539> from<00:04:40.229> the<00:04:40.349> scratch

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
synthesizes it de novo from the scratch

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.649 
synthesizes it de novo from the scratch
synthesis<00:04:41.189> but<00:04:41.639> in<00:04:41.759> case<00:04:41.879> of<00:04:41.909> DNA<00:04:42.360> polymerase

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:42.659 
synthesis but in case of DNA polymerase

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.809 
synthesis but in case of DNA polymerase
it<00:04:43.139> must<00:04:43.590> need<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:43.949> stretch<00:04:44.219> of<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.639> three

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
it must need the stretch of a three

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.510 
it must need the stretch of a three
prime<00:04:45.029> hydroxyl<00:04:45.090> group<00:04:45.990> for<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.800> activity<00:04:47.340> of

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
prime hydroxyl group for the activity of

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.119 
prime hydroxyl group for the activity of
further<00:04:48.419> addition<00:04:48.930> of<00:04:49.050> nucleotide<00:04:49.529> sequences

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:50.129 
further addition of nucleotide sequences

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:52.339 
further addition of nucleotide sequences
and<00:04:50.279> then<00:04:51.029> they<00:04:51.210> can<00:04:51.749> act<00:04:51.930> nikla<00:04:52.139> type

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
and then they can act nikla type

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:53.899 
and then they can act nikla type
sequence<00:04:52.560> so<00:04:52.919> only<00:04:53.159> after<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.550> three<00:04:53.699> prime

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:53.909 
sequence so only after the three prime

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.059 
sequence so only after the three prime
hydroxyl<00:04:53.999> so<00:04:54.810> primer<00:04:55.080> is<00:04:55.259> establishing<00:04:55.919> this

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
hydroxyl so primer is establishing this

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:58.029 
hydroxyl so primer is establishing this
so<00:04:56.279> it's<00:04:56.430> a<00:04:56.520> very<00:04:56.729> important<00:04:57.120> job<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.360> primer

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
so it's a very important job of primer

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.390 
so it's a very important job of primer
but<00:04:59.039> now<00:05:00.080> with<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.169> help<00:05:01.199> of<00:05:01.500> new<00:05:01.800> research<00:05:02.250> we

but now with the help of new research we

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.300 
but now with the help of new research we
can<00:05:02.520> also<00:05:02.729> know<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.330> primer<00:05:03.629> are<00:05:04.110> are<00:05:04.620> as<00:05:05.250> a

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
can also know the primer are are as a

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.429 
can also know the primer are are as a
result<00:05:05.669> of<00:05:05.789> this<00:05:05.879> priming<00:05:06.509> what<00:05:07.020> we<00:05:07.169> end<00:05:07.319> up

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:07.439

that's<00:06:01.050> why<00:06:01.319> it's<00:06:01.500> really<00:06:01.589> really<00:06:02.099> important

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
that's why it's really really important

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.429 
that's why it's really really important
step<00:06:02.639> but<00:06:03.060> you<00:06:03.149> can<00:06:03.330> see<00:06:03.509> in<00:06:03.899> this<00:06:04.020> case<00:06:04.229> there

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:04.439

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
DNA are in a hybrid c prime up this will

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:13.939 
DNA are in a hybrid c prime up this will
interact<00:06:12.180> to<00:06:12.389> the<00:06:12.659> d<00:06:12.810> subunit<00:06:13.289> and<00:06:13.409> phi<00:06:13.770> prime

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949

not<00:06:14.159> of<00:06:14.370> it<00:06:14.669> will<00:06:15.000> be<00:06:15.120> interacted<00:06:15.689> with<00:06:15.719> this

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
not of it will be interacted with this

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.899 
not of it will be interacted with this
beta<00:06:16.259> clamp<00:06:16.560> so<00:06:17.099> that's<00:06:17.279> why<00:06:17.490> the<00:06:17.580> clamp

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:17.909 
beta clamp so that's why the clamp

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:21.469 
beta clamp so that's why the clamp
