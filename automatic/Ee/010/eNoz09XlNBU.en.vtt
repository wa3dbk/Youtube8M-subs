00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
and also they do fail with these a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.770 
and also they do fail with these a
folding<00:01:10.590> canes<00:01:10.830> one<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> problems<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
folding canes one of the problems is the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.980 
folding canes one of the problems is the
bungee<00:01:13.170> cord<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> center<00:01:14.990> sometimes

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
bungee cord in the center sometimes

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.130 
bungee cord in the center sometimes
wears<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.970> phrase<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:18.659> will<00:01:18.810> snap

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
wears and phrase and then will snap

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.440 
wears and phrase and then will snap
which<00:01:19.830> means<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> cocaine<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:21.240> falls

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
which means that the cocaine just falls

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.539 
which means that the cocaine just falls
apart<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.799> haven't<00:01:22.950> got<00:01:23.130> back<00:01:23.310> up

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
apart and if you haven't got back up

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.020 
apart and if you haven't got back up
then<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.750> serious<00:01:25.110> problems<00:01:26.030> there

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
then you can have serious problems there

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.990 
then you can have serious problems there

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
you buy it in a set length so this one

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.470

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
blow the match in my chest when you

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.690 
blow the match in my chest when you
stand<00:04:08.269> vertically<00:04:08.720> now<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:10.340> put<00:04:10.519> them

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
stand vertically now to put them

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.929

together<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:12.069> folding<00:04:13.069> cane<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.700> just

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:13.939 
together the folding cane you just

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:19.029 
together the folding cane you just
simply<00:04:14.329> unclip<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:17.090> it<00:04:17.449> makes<00:04:18.229> one<00:04:18.590> solid

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
simply unclip and it makes one solid

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.560 
simply unclip and it makes one solid
length<00:04:19.910> of<00:04:20.120> cane<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.949> then<00:04:22.060> so<00:04:23.060> if<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.419> can

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
length of cane and then so if you can

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:32.290 
length of cane and then so if you can
see<00:04:23.800> this<00:04:24.800> is<00:04:25.160> how<00:04:25.780> it<00:04:26.780> looks<00:04:27.050> if<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:31.150> come<00:04:32.150> to

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
see this is how it looks if I come to

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.300 
see this is how it looks if I come to
about<00:04:32.539> the<00:04:32.599> right<00:04:32.810> distance<00:04:33.289> away<00:04:33.979> from<00:04:34.099> the

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
about the right distance away from the

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.790 
about the right distance away from the
camera<00:04:34.789> and<00:04:35.449> that's<00:04:35.930> where<00:04:36.169> it<00:04:36.289> comes<00:04:36.470> to<00:04:36.650> me

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
camera and that's where it comes to me

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.430 
camera and that's where it comes to me
and<00:04:37.599> in<00:04:38.599> order<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:38.990> hold<00:04:39.380> the<00:04:39.590> cane<00:04:39.830> I<00:04:41.169> hold<00:04:42.169> it

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
and in order to hold the cane I hold it

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.529 
and in order to hold the cane I hold it
with<00:04:43.310> my<00:04:43.340> hand<00:04:43.840> open<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.820> keep<00:04:46.820> keeping<00:04:47.330> the

I<00:05:32.880> have<00:05:33.880> bought<00:05:34.420> most<00:05:35.140> of<00:05:35.290> my<00:05:35.440> canes<00:05:35.740> online

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
I have bought most of my canes online

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.410 
I have bought most of my canes online
and<00:05:37.090> I<00:05:37.870> found<00:05:38.410> it<00:05:38.620> very<00:05:38.970> difficult<00:05:39.970> at<00:05:40.390> times

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
and I found it very difficult at times

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.290 
and I found it very difficult at times
to<00:05:42.000> get<00:05:43.000> just<00:05:43.480> the<00:05:43.660> right<00:05:43.690> weight<00:05:44.110> of<00:05:44.320> cane

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
to get just the right weight of cane

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.400 
to get just the right weight of cane
with<00:05:46.300> these<00:05:47.100> mushroom<00:05:48.100> tips<00:05:48.370> the<00:05:49.090> cane<00:05:49.810> tends

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
with these mushroom tips the cane tends

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.910 
with these mushroom tips the cane tends
to<00:05:50.590> be<00:05:50.770> tip<00:05:51.310> heavy<00:05:51.700> which<00:05:52.480> pulls<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:53.470> K<00:05:53.650> down

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
to be tip heavy which pulls the K down

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.530 
to be tip heavy which pulls the K down
onto<00:05:54.250> the<00:05:54.340> ground<00:05:54.520> which<00:05:54.820> is<00:05:54.850> a<00:05:55.030> good<00:05:55.270> thing

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
onto the ground which is a good thing

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.330 
onto the ground which is a good thing
because<00:05:56.140> it<00:05:56.380> means<00:05:56.530> that<00:05:56.620> you<00:05:56.800> don't<00:05:56.950> have<00:05:57.070> to

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
because it means that you don't have to

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.340 
because it means that you don't have to
hold<00:05:57.520> the<00:05:57.820> cane<00:05:58.060> hard<00:05:58.419> down<00:05:58.720> onto<00:05:59.050> the<00:05:59.140> ground

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
hold the cane hard down onto the ground

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.990 
hold the cane hard down onto the ground
as<00:06:00.280> you<00:06:00.460> walk<00:06:00.700> but<00:06:01.660> if<00:06:02.470> the<00:06:02.919> cane<00:06:03.160> is<00:06:03.400> too<00:06:03.669> heavy

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
as you walk but if the cane is too heavy

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.800 
as you walk but if the cane is too heavy
in<00:06:04.390> itself<00:06:04.810> the<00:06:05.530> length<00:06:05.740> of<00:06:05.919> the<00:06:06.070> cane<00:06:06.540> acts<00:06:07.540> as

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
in itself the length of the cane acts as

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.780 
in itself the length of the cane acts as
a<00:06:09.060> lever<00:06:10.060> and<00:06:10.810> so<00:06:11.140> it<00:06:11.830> can<00:06:12.130> get<00:06:12.310> very<00:06:12.370> very

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
a lever and so it can get very very

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.270 
a lever and so it can get very very
heavy<00:06:13.270> and<00:06:13.510> very<00:06:13.540> very<00:06:13.930> tiring<00:06:14.290> if<00:06:15.010> you're

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
heavy and very very tiring if you're

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.710 
heavy and very very tiring if you're
just<00:06:15.550> walking<00:06:15.820> with<00:06:16.810> a<00:06:16.840> cane<00:06:16.960> and<00:06:17.470> then<00:06:18.720> you

need to rest more often and it is rather

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.850
