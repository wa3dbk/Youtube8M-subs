00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
are actually two separate things food

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.599 
are actually two separate things food
processing<00:00:27.680> is<00:00:28.680> done<00:00:28.740> for<00:00:29.310> many<00:00:29.400> different

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
reasons as well but one of the things

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.380 
reasons as well but one of the things
that's<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:32.099> wild<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.759> gotta<00:00:32.940> share<00:00:33.210> with

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
that's just wild that I gotta share with

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.260 
that's just wild that I gotta share with
you<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:34.469> when<00:00:34.800> food<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.309> processed<00:00:35.610> it

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
you is that when food is processed it

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.569 
you is that when food is processed it
loses<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> lot<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.230> its<00:00:37.500> flavor<00:00:37.860> if<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.520> ever

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
loses a lot of its flavor if you ever

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.780 
loses a lot of its flavor if you ever
noticed<00:00:39.030> an<00:00:39.570> orange<00:00:40.170> when<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.800> first<00:00:41.129> get<00:00:41.610> it

and it's ripe it tastes good it has a
good<00:00:43.890> flavor<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.760> then<00:00:44.910> as<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.360> orange<00:00:45.750> gets

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
good flavor and then as that orange gets

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.619 
good flavor and then as that orange gets
closer<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.739> closer<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.219> rotting<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:48.000> lot<00:00:48.539> of

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
that flavor is lost and it doesn't taste

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.930 
that flavor is lost and it doesn't taste
as<00:00:50.309> good<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.879> gets<00:00:51.120> kind<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.480> mushy<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.050> gross

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
as good it gets kind of mushy and gross

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.130 
as good it gets kind of mushy and gross
well<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> same<00:00:54.210> thing<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.510> true<00:00:54.539> with<00:00:54.809> with

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
well the same thing is true with with

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.040

any food substance and as it gets

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.260 
any food substance and as it gets
further<00:00:58.350> away<00:00:58.500> from<00:00:59.420> its<00:01:00.420> natural<00:01:00.690> state<00:01:02.270> it

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
further away from its natural state it

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.780 
further away from its natural state it
loses<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.660> lot<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.930> its<00:01:04.140> flavor<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:05.010> there
