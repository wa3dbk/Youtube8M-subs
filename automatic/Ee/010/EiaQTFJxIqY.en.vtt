and planets and last week a tardigrade
so<00:00:16.470> pops<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.859> picked<00:00:17.130> up<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.369> picture<00:00:17.730> and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
so pops I picked up this picture and

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.519 
so pops I picked up this picture and
before<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.240> knew<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.660> was<00:00:18.690> lost<00:00:18.990> in<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.320> sea<00:00:19.500> of

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
I have often placed the animal fuels I

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.580 
I have often placed the animal fuels I
have<00:04:17.459> before<00:04:17.640> described<00:04:18.330> out<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.350> water

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
have before described out of the water

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
sand adjoining to them in order to see

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.200 
sand adjoining to them in order to see
whether<00:04:25.080> when<00:04:25.470> all<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:26.250> water<00:04:26.520> about<00:04:26.940> them

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
whether when all the water about them

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.030 
whether when all the water about them
was<00:04:27.330> evaporated<00:04:27.960> and<00:04:28.110> they<00:04:28.230> were<00:04:28.290> exposed<00:04:28.830> to

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
was evaporated and they were exposed to

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.610 
was evaporated and they were exposed to
air<00:04:29.190> their<00:04:29.820> bodies<00:04:30.180> would<00:04:30.360> burst<00:04:30.690> as<00:04:31.110> I<00:04:31.470> had

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
air their bodies would burst as I had

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.580 
air their bodies would burst as I had
often<00:04:31.830> seen<00:04:32.220> in<00:04:32.250> other<00:04:32.700> animal<00:04:33.240> fuels<00:04:33.480> but<00:04:34.290> now

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
often seen in other animal fuels but now

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.560 
often seen in other animal fuels but now
I<00:04:34.620> found<00:04:35.160> that<00:04:35.460> when<00:04:35.580> almost<00:04:35.850> all<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.420> water

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
I found that when almost all the water

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.450 
I found that when almost all the water
was<00:04:36.840> evaporated<00:04:37.530> so<00:04:37.919> that<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.190> creature

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
was evaporated so that the creature

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.400 
was evaporated so that the creature
could<00:04:38.850> no<00:04:39.120> longer<00:04:39.150> be<00:04:39.720> covered<00:04:39.900> with<00:04:40.169> water

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
could no longer be covered with water

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.680 
could no longer be covered with water
nor<00:04:40.770> move<00:04:40.980> itself<00:04:41.310> as<00:04:41.550> usual<00:04:41.970> it<00:04:42.390> then

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
nor move itself as usual it then

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.320 
nor move itself as usual it then
contracted<00:04:43.320> itself<00:04:44.040> into<00:04:44.400> an<00:04:44.520> oval<00:04:44.940> figure

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
contracted itself into an oval figure

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.140 
contracted itself into an oval figure
and<00:04:45.570> in<00:04:45.990> that<00:04:46.169> state<00:04:46.560> remained<00:04:47.010> nor<00:04:47.760> could<00:04:48.060> I

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
and in that state remained nor could I

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.060 
and in that state remained nor could I
perceive<00:04:48.600> that<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:48.930> moisture<00:04:49.110> evaporated

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
perceive that the moisture evaporated

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.580

the<00:04:58.050> 3rd<00:04:58.290> of<00:04:58.470> September<00:04:58.980> about<00:04:59.280> 7:00<00:04:59.730> in<00:04:59.880> the

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
the 3rd of September about 7:00 in the

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.270 
the 3rd of September about 7:00 in the
morning<00:05:00.180> I<00:05:00.510> took<00:05:00.900> some<00:05:01.260> of<00:05:01.380> this<00:05:01.470> dry<00:05:01.770> sediment

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
morning I took some of this dry sediment

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.130 
morning I took some of this dry sediment
which<00:05:02.669> I<00:05:02.910> had<00:05:03.150> taken<00:05:03.390> out<00:05:03.660> of<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:03.930> leading

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
which I had taken out of the leading

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.350 
which I had taken out of the leading
gutter<00:05:04.440> and<00:05:04.680> had<00:05:04.860> stood<00:05:05.130> almost<00:05:05.400> two<00:05:05.850> days<00:05:06.060> in

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
gutter and had stood almost two days in

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.810 
gutter and had stood almost two days in
my<00:05:06.510> study<00:05:06.810> and<00:05:07.169> put<00:05:07.620> a<00:05:07.680> little<00:05:07.980> of<00:05:08.160> it<00:05:08.250> into<00:05:08.430> two

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
my study and put a little of it into two

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.570 
my study and put a little of it into two
separate<00:05:09.450> glass<00:05:09.600> tubes<00:05:10.050> wherein<00:05:10.980> I<00:05:11.160> poured

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
separate glass tubes wherein I poured

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.370 
separate glass tubes wherein I poured
some<00:05:11.640> rainwater<00:05:12.000> which<00:05:12.510> had<00:05:12.660> been<00:05:12.810> boiled<00:05:12.990> and

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
some rainwater which had been boiled and

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.190 
some rainwater which had been boiled and
afterwards<00:05:13.919> cooled<00:05:14.220> as<00:05:14.550> soon<00:05:15.450> as<00:05:15.630> I<00:05:15.720> poured<00:05:16.020> on

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
afterwards cooled as soon as I poured on

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.409 
afterwards cooled as soon as I poured on
the<00:05:16.350> water<00:05:16.560> I<00:05:16.650> stirred<00:05:17.130> the<00:05:17.160> whole<00:05:17.520> about<00:05:17.940> the

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
the water I stirred the whole about the

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.450 
the water I stirred the whole about the
this<00:05:18.600> sediment<00:05:19.020> which<00:05:19.260> by<00:05:19.800> means<00:05:20.040> of<00:05:20.310> the

this sediment which by means of the
hairs<00:05:20.790> in<00:05:21.000> it<00:05:21.300> seemed<00:05:21.630> to<00:05:21.810> adhere<00:05:22.320> like<00:05:22.560> a

the bottom of the glass I examined it
and<00:05:29.340> perceived<00:05:29.790> some<00:05:30.300> of<00:05:30.480> the<00:05:30.660> animal<00:05:31.020> pools

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290
