recent<00:00:15.120> games<00:00:15.389> here<00:00:16.070> without<00:00:17.070> really<00:00:17.910> knowing

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
recent games here without really knowing

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.769 
recent games here without really knowing
what's<00:00:18.510> going<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:20.960> yeah<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:23.570> fog<00:00:24.570> by

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
what's going on yeah this is the fog by

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.460 
what's going on yeah this is the fog by
account<00:00:25.140> again<00:00:25.470> but<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:26.570> think<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
account again but I think this is the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:38.340 
account again but I think this is the
right<00:00:28.830> right<00:00:29.429> way<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.699> play

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.689 

or<00:00:38.859> what<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:39.219> bishop<00:00:39.430> III<00:00:39.940> I<00:00:40.120> keep<00:00:40.989> forgetting

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
or what the bishop III I keep forgetting

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.360 
or what the bishop III I keep forgetting
okay<00:00:42.699> so<00:00:42.760> i<00:00:42.940> cannot<00:00:43.390> i<00:00:43.809> cannot<00:00:44.050> take<00:00:44.500> on<00:00:44.680> c6<00:00:45.160> of

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
okay so i cannot i cannot take on c6 of

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:54.119 
okay so i cannot i cannot take on c6 of
course<00:00:48.629> hmm<00:00:50.129> yeah<00:00:51.129> probably<00:00:51.550> i<00:00:51.760> should<00:00:53.129> speed

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
course hmm yeah probably i should speed

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:01.680 
course hmm yeah probably i should speed
up<00:00:54.159> my<00:00:54.489> development<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.559> maybe<00:01:00.039> try<00:01:00.430> to<00:01:00.690> get

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
up my development and maybe try to get

Bishop<00:02:27.030> e3<00:02:27.860> something<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.040> like<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.269> I'm

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
Bishop e3 something like like that I'm

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.470 
Bishop e3 something like like that I'm
in<00:02:30.840> excellent<00:02:30.989> shape<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.180> night<00:02:33.330> only

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
in excellent shape and the night only

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.040 
in excellent shape and the night only
five<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.080> very<00:02:34.440> annoying<00:02:34.800> piece<00:02:35.750> yeah<00:02:36.750> this

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
five is a very annoying piece yeah this

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.650 
five is a very annoying piece yeah this
is<00:02:37.200> why<00:02:37.470> he<00:02:37.709> probably<00:02:38.280> tries<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:39.000> get<00:02:39.420> rid<00:02:39.630> of

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
is why he probably tries to get rid of

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.350 
is why he probably tries to get rid of
it<00:02:40.459> ok<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:42.239> just<00:02:42.450> Knight<00:02:42.810> f3<00:02:43.200> yawn<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:44.360> don't

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
it ok so just Knight f3 yawn I don't

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
it ok so just Knight f3 yawn I don't
have<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.569> tactic<00:02:47.360> not<00:02:48.360> really<00:02:48.690> at<00:02:49.019> least<00:02:49.230> I

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
have a tactic not really at least I

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.020 
have a tactic not really at least I
don't<00:02:49.560> see<00:02:49.800> one<00:02:51.170> but<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.350> looks<00:02:52.500> good

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
don't see one but this looks good

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:03.300 
don't see one but this looks good
supporting<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.450> snide<00:02:58.459> so

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.240 

yeah<00:03:04.120> maybe<00:03:04.420> maybe<00:03:04.750> this<00:03:05.200> just<00:03:05.650> get<00:03:05.950> rid<00:03:06.069> of

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
yeah maybe maybe this just get rid of

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.400 
yeah maybe maybe this just get rid of
this<00:03:06.430> strong<00:03:06.760> bishop<00:03:09.989> maybe<00:03:10.989> you<00:03:11.110> could<00:03:11.290> have

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
this strong bishop maybe you could have

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:20.290 
this strong bishop maybe you could have
taken<00:03:11.650> twice<00:03:12.190> iam

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.260 

this<00:03:20.900> still<00:03:21.200> looks<00:03:21.350> some<00:03:21.740> quite<00:03:22.640> favorable

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
this still looks some quite favorable

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.710 
this still looks some quite favorable
for<00:03:23.420> white<00:03:23.600> I<00:03:23.870> think<00:03:26.950> green<00:03:27.950> on<00:03:28.100> c5<00:03:28.550> versa<00:03:29.090> is

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
for white I think green on c5 versa is

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.700 
for white I think green on c5 versa is
nicely<00:03:30.110> placed<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:32.690> also<00:03:32.960> threatening<00:03:33.500> night

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
nicely placed and also threatening night

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.910 
nicely placed and also threatening night
takes<00:03:33.980> f7<00:03:34.400> one<00:03:34.700> night<00:03:35.000> f7<00:03:35.540> moog<00:03:35.690> f77<00:03:36.410> Queen<00:03:36.770> at

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
takes f7 one night f7 moog f77 Queen at

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:49.730 
takes f7 one night f7 moog f77 Queen at
five<00:03:38.020> just<00:03:39.020> quite<00:03:39.560> strong

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.330 

hmm

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.960 

if<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:55.300> just<00:03:55.420> take<00:03:55.660> it

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.130 

hard<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.150> believe<00:04:01.300> that<00:04:01.690> this<00:04:01.840> should<00:04:02.110> work

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
hard to believe that this should work

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:15.270 
hard to believe that this should work
maybe<00:04:02.980> it<00:04:03.190> is<00:04:04.770> hmm<00:04:11.070> if<00:04:12.070> I<00:04:12.190> retreat<00:04:14.100> don't<00:04:15.100> have

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280
