00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:13.400
AACD is a nonprofit organization that provides social support for thousands of disabled people from all over Brazil.

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:20.001
We keep the work going thanks to partnerships and donations from people like you, who believe and support our cause.

00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:23.902
But unfortunately this is not always enough.

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:33.202
We know how often people forget bills and coins in drawers, bedside tables, and especially in clothes pockets.

00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:36.903
Since the amount of money is so small, we end up not counting on it.

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:42.404
But truth is: the sum of this forgotten small amount of money can make a big difference for us.

00:00:43.104 --> 00:00:45.204
Aware of that fact, we had an idea.

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:53.005
Introducing: Forgotten Bill AACD

00:00:54.806 --> 00:01:03.906
In partnership with 5āSec laundries, we put a false bill in clothes left to wash with a simple reminder:

00:01:04.407 --> 00:01:10.507
The forgotten money that you may not miss can help the rehabilitation of thousands of children.

00:01:16.908 --> 00:01:23.608
By doing that, we have achieved something extraordinary: we turned clothes pocket into a new media format.

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.609
When customers returned to pick up their clothes, they found the forgotten bill hidden in the pocket.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.410
An unexpected surprise.

00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:51.311
In order to donate the money, customers just had to scan the QR Code.

00:01:58.012 --> 00:02:06.712
With a small gesture, we've touched people's hearts and encouraged them to give the money they don't miss and change the life of thousands of children.

00:02:07.813 --> 00:02:15.113
So, next time you find some small change in your pocket, don't forget that they can make a big difference for someone else.

00:02:15.714 --> 00:02:17.614
Our children will appreciate it!

00:02:18.214 --> 00:02:20.514
