00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.550 
to do is play with another asus 24 inch
display<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:27.300> would<00:03:27.450> make<00:03:27.600> my<00:03:27.870> life<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:28.320> lot

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
display that would make my life a lot

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.170 
display that would make my life a lot
easier<00:03:28.800> at<00:03:29.489> plus<00:03:29.730> they<00:03:29.880> have<00:03:29.970> different

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
easier at plus they have different

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.600 
easier at plus they have different
resolutions<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.140> it<00:03:31.350> gets<00:03:31.650> sort<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.100> messy<00:03:32.580> i

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
resolutions so it gets sort of messy i

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.790 
resolutions so it gets sort of messy i
guess<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.930> would<00:03:34.110> look<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.320> lot<00:03:34.350> better<00:03:34.620> to

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
guess so it would look a lot better to

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.740 
guess so it would look a lot better to
have<00:03:34.890> two<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.340> same<00:03:35.370> monitors<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.540> next

have those on the solid state so they

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.599

it still have extra
so<00:04:25.530> this<00:04:25.770> is<00:04:25.919> definitely<00:04:26.100> a<00:04:26.280> great<00:04:26.490> drive<00:04:26.790> but

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
so this is definitely a great drive but

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.879 
so this is definitely a great drive but
if<00:04:27.270> I<00:04:27.389> do<00:04:27.449> end<00:04:27.720> up<00:04:27.780> getting<00:04:28.050> 120<00:04:28.470> gig<00:04:28.740> I'll

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
if I do end up getting 120 gig I'll

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.499 
if I do end up getting 120 gig I'll
probably<00:04:29.070> end<00:04:29.280> up<00:04:29.370> sell<00:04:29.639> this<00:04:29.850> drive<00:04:30.240> it's

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
probably end up sell this drive it's

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:32.629 
probably end up sell this drive it's
great<00:04:30.660> drive<00:04:30.990> but<00:04:31.560> there's<00:04:32.280> really<00:04:32.430> no<00:04:32.610> need

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
great drive but there's really no need

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.490 
great drive but there's really no need

to just have those on one hard drive it
just<00:05:01.500> it<00:05:01.620> make<00:05:01.800> my<00:05:01.919> life<00:05:02.100> a<00:05:02.160> lot<00:05:02.280> easier<00:05:02.340> right

500<00:05:04.919> gigabyte<00:05:05.250> hard<00:05:05.370> drive<00:05:05.490> so<00:05:06.270> but<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:06.900> one

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
500 gigabyte hard drive so but a one

500 gigabyte hard drive so but a one
terabyte<00:05:07.260> drive<00:05:07.590> would<00:05:07.770> be<00:05:07.889> nice<00:05:08.010> however<00:05:08.280> I

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
terabyte drive would be nice however I

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.070 
terabyte drive would be nice however I
don't<00:05:08.610> really<00:05:08.729> expect<00:05:09.210> to<00:05:09.330> get<00:05:09.539> it<00:05:09.660> because<00:05:09.810> of

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
don't really expect to get it because of

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.750 
don't really expect to get it because of
how<00:05:10.229> much<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.860> hard<00:05:11.070> drive<00:05:11.250> prices<00:05:11.490> have<00:05:11.729> gone

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
how much the hard drive prices have gone

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.370 
how much the hard drive prices have gone
up<00:05:11.940> due<00:05:12.240> to<00:05:12.270> the<00:05:12.479> flooding<00:05:12.870> over<00:05:12.990> on<00:05:13.229> the<00:05:13.350> other

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
up due to the flooding over on the other

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.460 
up due to the flooding over on the other
side<00:05:13.560> of<00:05:13.740> the<00:05:13.860> world<00:05:14.010> so<00:05:14.699> I<00:05:15.270> don't<00:05:16.050> expect<00:05:16.110> to

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
side of the world so I don't expect to

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.779 
side of the world so I don't expect to
get<00:05:16.620> a<00:05:16.680> terabyte<00:05:17.130> hard<00:05:17.280> drive<00:05:17.460> I'd<00:05:17.610> probably

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
get a terabyte hard drive I'd probably

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.010 
get a terabyte hard drive I'd probably
rather<00:05:18.000> just<00:05:18.270> wait<00:05:18.479> until<00:05:18.750> they're

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
rather just wait until they're

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.930 
rather just wait until they're
reasonably<00:05:19.560> priced<00:05:19.889> again<00:05:20.220> because<00:05:20.789> right

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
reasonably priced again because right

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.279 
reasonably priced again because right
now<00:05:20.970> they're<00:05:21.210> about<00:05:21.330> double<00:05:21.720> the<00:05:21.750> price<00:05:21.990> which

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
now they're about double the price which

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.499 
now they're about double the price which
is<00:05:22.320> absolutely<00:05:22.979> ridiculous<00:05:23.340> UK<00:05:23.940> would<00:05:24.120> find<00:05:24.389> a

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
is absolutely ridiculous UK would find a

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:25.879 
is absolutely ridiculous UK would find a
one<00:05:24.630> terabyte<00:05:24.810> hard<00:05:25.080> drive<00:05:25.320> less<00:05:25.590> like<00:05:25.860> a

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
one terabyte hard drive less like a

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.650 
one terabyte hard drive less like a
hundred<00:05:26.190> and<00:05:26.400> twenty<00:05:26.699> dollars<00:05:27.000> it's<00:05:27.360> getting

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
hundred and twenty dollars it's getting

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.150 
hundred and twenty dollars it's getting
ridiculous<00:05:27.810> so<00:05:28.289> while<00:05:28.440> one<00:05:28.680> terabyte<00:05:28.979> hard

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
ridiculous so while one terabyte hard

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.800 
ridiculous so while one terabyte hard
drive<00:05:29.400> would<00:05:29.580> be<00:05:29.699> very<00:05:29.820> nice<00:05:30.060> I'm<00:05:30.330> not<00:05:30.539> really

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
drive would be very nice I'm not really

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.240 
drive would be very nice I'm not really
expecting<00:05:31.110> it<00:05:31.410> and<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:31.650> could<00:05:31.830> probably<00:05:32.010> just

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
expecting it and I could probably just

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.430 
expecting it and I could probably just
buy<00:05:32.430> one<00:05:32.669> this<00:05:32.820> summer<00:05:33.090> hopefully<00:05:33.389> for<00:05:34.139> a<00:05:34.169> lot

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
buy one this summer hopefully for a lot

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.140 
buy one this summer hopefully for a lot
cheaper<00:05:34.470> with<00:05:35.099> my<00:05:35.250> own<00:05:35.280> body<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.760> last<00:05:35.970> item

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
cheaper with my own body the last item

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.760 
cheaper with my own body the last item
of<00:05:36.330> my<00:05:36.449> wish<00:05:36.630> list<00:05:36.810> is<00:05:37.050> something<00:05:37.440> that<00:05:37.530> no<00:05:37.650> one

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
of my wish list is something that no one

of my wish list is something that no one
could<00:05:37.889> buy<00:05:38.039> for<00:05:38.310> me<00:05:38.430> it's<00:05:38.820> just<00:05:38.940> something

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
could buy for me it's just something
