to set it up for the best results the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.070 
to set it up for the best results the
game<00:00:11.130> offers<00:00:11.610> plenty<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.150> options<00:00:12.480> together

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
game offers plenty of options together

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.560 
game offers plenty of options together
with<00:00:13.380> but<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.980> most<00:00:14.130> important<00:00:14.880> factor<00:00:15.089> is

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
with but the most important factor is

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.840 
with but the most important factor is
the<00:00:15.809> distance<00:00:16.199> from<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> psi<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.490> need<00:00:17.670> to

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
the distance from the psi you need to

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.580 
the distance from the psi you need to

now<00:00:29.369> let's<00:00:29.820> see<00:00:30.060> what<00:00:30.210> else<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.539> can<00:00:30.720> do<00:00:30.840> face

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
now let's see what else you can do face

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.610 
now let's see what else you can do face
angle<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.309> position<00:00:32.610> range<00:00:33.300> options<00:00:33.960> at<00:00:34.230> just

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
angle and position range options at just

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.979 
angle and position range options at just
how<00:00:34.890> much<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.370> cockpit<00:00:35.820> camera<00:00:36.120> will<00:00:36.510> turn<00:00:36.750> or

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
how much the cockpit camera will turn or

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.380 
how much the cockpit camera will turn or
move<00:00:37.260> around<00:00:37.530> respectively<00:00:38.340> for<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.969> purpose

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
move around respectively for the purpose

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.690 
move around respectively for the purpose
of<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.690> video<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.379> set<00:00:40.710> everything<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.460> max

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
of this video I set everything to max

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.330 
of this video I set everything to max
but<00:00:42.149> I'd<00:00:42.450> suggest<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.290> set<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.710> angle<00:00:43.890> value

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
but I'd suggest to set the angle value

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.940 
but I'd suggest to set the angle value
to<00:00:44.520> around<00:00:44.879> 5<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.420> leave<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.020> position<00:00:46.230> 1<00:00:46.739> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
to around 5 and leave the position 1 to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.369 
to around 5 and leave the position 1 to
10<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.700> face<00:00:47.910> recognition<00:00:48.180> option<00:00:49.170> is

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
10 the face recognition option is

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.439 
10 the face recognition option is
basically<00:00:49.829> some<00:00:50.250> sort<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.910> sensitivity

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
basically some sort of a sensitivity

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.360 
basically some sort of a sensitivity
option<00:00:52.079> which<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.649> will<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.039> fiddle

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
option which you will have to fiddle

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.700 
option which you will have to fiddle
with<00:00:53.640> yourself<00:00:54.270> because<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:55.079> affected<00:00:55.680> by

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
with yourself because it's affected by

variation in light condition is

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.570 
variation in light condition is
automatically<00:01:04.290> compensated<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.309> face

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580

oh<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:07.480> of<00:02:07.600> course<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:08.020> works<00:02:08.229> also<00:02:08.590> when

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
looking back now the big question is

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.750 
looking back now the big question is
head<00:02:13.690> tracking<00:02:13.990> actually<00:02:14.620> useful<00:02:14.860> in<00:02:15.160> gt5

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760

finally<00:02:16.660> it's<00:02:16.780> definitely<00:02:17.440> cool<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.890> look

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
finally it's definitely cool to look

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.760 
finally it's definitely cool to look
