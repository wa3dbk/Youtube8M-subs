00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the suspension bike I build them pretty

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.990 
the suspension bike I build them pretty
beefy<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.500> front<00:01:19.740> triangle<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.820> just

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
beefy in the front triangle for just

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.719 
beefy in the front triangle for just
more<00:01:21.240> pinpoint<00:01:21.990> steering<00:01:22.469> and<00:01:22.680> then<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.310> don't

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
more pinpoint steering and then I don't

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.730 
more pinpoint steering and then I don't
overbuild<00:01:24.240> them<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> back<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.530> some

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
overbuild them in the back just for some

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.920 
overbuild them in the back just for some
more<00:01:25.890> compliance<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.729> also<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.539> you<00:01:27.630> get<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
more compliance and also as you get the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.139 
more compliance and also as you get the
chainstays<00:01:28.469> shorter<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.039> ride<00:01:29.250> does<00:01:29.759> become

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
chainstays shorter the ride does become

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.819 
chainstays shorter the ride does become
a<00:01:30.180> bit<00:01:30.420> rougher<00:01:30.810> because<00:01:31.409> you're<00:01:31.560> bringing

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
a bit rougher because you're bringing

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.529 
a bit rougher because you're bringing
that<00:01:31.920> rear<00:01:32.130> wheel<00:01:32.369> underneath<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.329> know

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
that rear wheel underneath you you know

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.740 
that rear wheel underneath you you know
and<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.890> particular<00:01:35.070> bike<00:01:35.610> has<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.539> east

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and so this particular bike has the east

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.010 
and so this particular bike has the east
and<00:01:36.990> carbon<00:01:37.350> havens<00:01:37.710> which<00:01:37.920> are<00:01:38.070> new<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:39.020> but

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
and carbon havens which are new and but

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.899 
and carbon havens which are new and but
I<00:01:40.049> still<00:01:40.289> do<00:01:40.500> things<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.950> 28<00:01:41.490> inch<00:01:41.520> wide

a 24 and a quarter top tube 19-inch

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.830 
a 24 and a quarter top tube 19-inch
see-tube<00:02:11.280> whether<00:02:11.910> they're<00:02:12.000> all<00:02:12.030> customs<00:02:12.630> so

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
see-tube whether they're all customs so

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.860 
see-tube whether they're all customs so
right<00:02:13.260> there's<00:02:13.620> really<00:02:13.800> no<00:02:14.090> no<00:02:15.090> limit<00:02:15.540> on<00:02:15.630> that

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
right there's really no no limit on that

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.580 
right there's really no no limit on that
and

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
and

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.170 
and
game<00:02:17.769> that<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.069> can<00:02:18.190> do<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.280> lot<00:02:18.489> of<00:02:18.519> damage<00:02:18.970> or

game that you can do a lot of damage or

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.020 
game that you can do a lot of damage or
just<00:02:19.360> buy<00:02:19.480> cod<00:02:19.720> yeah<00:02:20.140> what<00:02:21.129> I<00:02:21.160> what<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.640> set<00:02:22.000> out

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
just buy cod yeah what I what I set out

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.910 
just buy cod yeah what I what I set out
to<00:02:22.180> do<00:02:22.480> was<00:02:22.690> I've<00:02:22.840> always<00:02:23.019> been<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.319> fan<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.650> full

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
to do was I've always been a fan of full

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.430 
to do was I've always been a fan of full
suspension<00:02:24.129> and<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:25.150> do<00:02:25.660> build<00:02:26.200> full

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
suspension and I do build full

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.800 
suspension and I do build full
suspension<00:02:26.620> bikes<00:02:27.099> using<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.670> Ventana<00:02:28.510> rear

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
suspension bikes using the Ventana rear

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.640 
suspension bikes using the Ventana rear
end<00:02:28.989> right<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.580> kind<00:02:30.849> of<00:02:31.620> what<00:02:32.620> I

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
end right and this is kind of what I

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.680 
end right and this is kind of what I
think<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.129> actually<00:02:33.280> butt<00:02:33.700> heads<00:02:33.970> with<00:02:34.180> maybe

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
think it actually butt heads with maybe

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.920 
think it actually butt heads with maybe
like<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:35.280> 3<00:02:36.280> inch<00:02:36.430> travel<00:02:36.730> full<00:02:37.269> suspension<00:02:37.480> by

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
like a 3 inch travel full suspension by

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.410 
like a 3 inch travel full suspension by
absolutely<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:38.620> know<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:39.459> absolutely<00:02:39.940> yeah

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
absolutely you know so absolutely yeah

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.210 
absolutely you know so absolutely yeah
there<00:02:40.629> are<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.750> lot<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.260> fun<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.680> ride<00:02:41.860> I'm<00:02:42.069> gonna

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
there are a lot of fun to ride I'm gonna

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.360 
there are a lot of fun to ride I'm gonna
get<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.519> guys<00:02:42.670> on<00:02:42.910> 29er<00:02:43.950> hard<00:02:44.950> data<00:02:45.129> that<00:02:45.340> are

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
get the guys on 29er hard data that are

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.809 
get the guys on 29er hard data that are
aggressive<00:02:45.910> ya<00:02:46.569> can't<00:02:47.470> keep<00:02:47.680> up<00:02:47.890> yeah<00:02:48.610> and

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
aggressive ya can't keep up yeah and

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.460 
aggressive ya can't keep up yeah and
giving<00:02:49.150> this<00:02:49.330> kind<00:02:49.599> of<00:02:49.660> fork<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.170> that<00:02:50.290> kind

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
giving this kind of fork and that kind

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.470 
giving this kind of fork and that kind
of<00:02:50.500> stability<00:02:50.680> on<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.099> headset<00:02:51.519> yeah<00:02:52.360> and

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
of stability on the headset yeah and

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.479 
of stability on the headset yeah and
it's<00:02:52.630> it's<00:02:52.959> pretty<00:02:53.260> slack<00:02:53.560> its<00:02:53.860> sixty<00:02:54.340> eight

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
it's it's pretty slack its sixty eight

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.150 
it's it's pretty slack its sixty eight
and<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.670> half<00:02:55.440> untagged<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:57.190> then<00:02:57.519> with<00:02:57.970> sagged

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
and a half untagged and then with sagged

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.720 
and a half untagged and then with sagged
124<00:03:00.160> kits<00:03:00.400> 70<00:03:00.819> degrees<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:02.560> then<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.430> sea

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
124 kits 70 degrees and then the sea

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.869 
124 kits 70 degrees and then the sea
tube<00:03:04.000> is<00:03:04.709> 73<00:03:05.709> degrees<00:03:06.010> when<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.340> bike<00:03:06.489> sagged

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
tube is 73 degrees when the bike sagged

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.940 
tube is 73 degrees when the bike sagged
so<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.690> is<00:03:07.780> still<00:03:08.110> designed<00:03:08.620> for<00:03:09.430> climbing<00:03:09.940> but

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
so it is still designed for climbing but

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.589 
so it is still designed for climbing but
you<00:03:11.950> can<00:03:12.099> go<00:03:12.220> fast<00:03:12.519> on<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.090> know<00:03:13.150> it's

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
you can go fast on it you know it's

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.089 
you can go fast on it you know it's
that's<00:03:13.780> my<00:03:13.900> advantage<00:03:14.319> is<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.440> custom<00:03:14.829> is<00:03:14.980> you

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
that's my advantage is a custom is you

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.630 
that's my advantage is a custom is you
can<00:03:15.250> use<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.569> material<00:03:16.569> and<00:03:17.200> geometries<00:03:17.739> yeah

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
can use a material and geometries yeah

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.160 
can use a material and geometries yeah
to<00:03:18.910> really<00:03:19.290> tailor<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.769> hardtail<00:03:21.459> yep<00:03:22.170> into

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
to really tailor a hardtail yep into

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.610 
to really tailor a hardtail yep into
something<00:03:23.620> that's<00:03:24.060> sometimes<00:03:25.060> beyond<00:03:25.690> what

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
something that's sometimes beyond what

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.440 
something that's sometimes beyond what
people<00:03:26.859> think<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.160> hardtail<00:03:27.430> can<00:03:27.639> do<00:03:27.790> yeah<00:03:28.209> and

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
people think a hardtail can do yeah and

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.099 
people think a hardtail can do yeah and
and<00:03:28.840> i<00:03:29.019> think<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.410> slackness<00:03:29.829> of<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.400> helps

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
and i think the slackness of it helps

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.089 
and i think the slackness of it helps
counterbalance<00:03:32.109> the<00:03:32.319> shortness<00:03:32.829> of<00:03:32.980> the

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
counterbalance the shortness of the

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.890 
counterbalance the shortness of the
chainstays<00:03:33.700> you<00:03:33.970> know<00:03:34.120> because<00:03:34.660> when<00:03:34.810> you

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
chainstays you know because when you

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.420 
chainstays you know because when you
shorten<00:03:35.109> up<00:03:35.319> the<00:03:35.380> wheelbase<00:03:35.829> now<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:36.190> almost

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
shorten up the wheelbase now you almost

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.390 
shorten up the wheelbase now you almost
need<00:03:36.819> to<00:03:36.910> create<00:03:37.150> more<00:03:37.480> stability<00:03:38.440> right<00:03:39.220> and

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
need to create more stability right and

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.039 
need to create more stability right and
then<00:03:39.549> also<00:03:39.730> it's<00:03:40.209> just<00:03:40.269> designed<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.930> be

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
then also it's just designed to be

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.020 
then also it's just designed to be
written<00:03:41.290> aggressively<00:03:41.859> so<00:03:42.130> it's<00:03:42.730> kind<00:03:42.940> of

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
written aggressively so it's kind of

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.360 
written aggressively so it's kind of
more<00:03:43.180> tailored<00:03:43.660> to<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.530> new<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:45.340> new

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
more tailored to that the new the new

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.360 
more tailored to that the new the new
style<00:03:45.880> of<00:03:46.060> 29<00:03:46.630> or<00:03:46.750> geometry<00:03:47.019> which<00:03:47.470> is<00:03:47.620> short

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
style of 29 or geometry which is short

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.000 
style of 29 or geometry which is short
and<00:03:48.459> slack<00:03:48.730> yes<00:03:49.180> yeah<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:49.840> know<00:03:49.959> that's<00:03:50.889> what

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
and slack yes yeah you know that's what

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.479 
and slack yes yeah you know that's what
I<00:03:51.069> saw<00:03:51.310> yeah<00:03:51.790> last<00:03:52.209> year<00:03:52.329> yes<00:03:52.870> for<00:03:53.489> expanding

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
I saw yeah last year yes for expanding

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.150 
I saw yeah last year yes for expanding
yeah<00:03:54.970> when<00:03:55.900> I<00:03:55.930> started<00:03:56.079> seeing<00:03:56.709> you<00:03:57.040> know

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
yeah when I started seeing you know

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.979 
yeah when I started seeing you know
bikes<00:03:57.459> like<00:03:57.669> the<00:03:57.849> Banshee<00:03:58.389> and<00:03:58.419> the<00:03:58.780> cane

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
bikes like the Banshee and the cane

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.379 
bikes like the Banshee and the cane
field<00:03:59.319> I<00:03:59.530> was<00:03:59.650> I<00:03:59.889> was<00:04:00.579> definitely<00:04:00.849> like<00:04:01.120> I

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
field I was I was definitely like I

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.659 
field I was I was definitely like I
gotta<00:04:01.870> build<00:04:02.079> a<00:04:02.230> few<00:04:02.380> of<00:04:02.470> those<00:04:02.620> so<00:04:03.430> I<00:04:03.459> just

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
gotta build a few of those so I just

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.270 
gotta build a few of those so I just
like<00:04:03.819> yes<00:04:04.329> I<00:04:04.599> did<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.810> couple<00:04:05.139> steel<00:04:05.560> prototypes

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
like yes I did a couple steel prototypes

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.599 
like yes I did a couple steel prototypes
and<00:04:06.639> then<00:04:07.230> rode<00:04:08.230> them<00:04:08.470> and<00:04:08.680> experimented<00:04:09.519> with

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
and then rode them and experimented with

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:14.759 
and then rode them and experimented with
the<00:04:09.730> chain<00:04:09.970> stays<00:04:10.239> down<00:04:11.220> 24<00:04:12.220> 24<00:04:13.769> millimeters

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
the chain stays down 24 24 millimeters

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.460 
the chain stays down 24 24 millimeters
and<00:04:15.010> then<00:04:15.669> I<00:04:15.700> kind<00:04:16.209> of<00:04:16.299> refined<00:04:16.750> it<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.200> found

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
and then I kind of refined it and found

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.680 
and then I kind of refined it and found
the<00:04:17.620> head<00:04:17.769> tube<00:04:17.979> angle<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.370> liked<00:04:18.639> and<00:04:18.970> and<00:04:19.539> I

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
the head tube angle I liked and and I

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.270 
the head tube angle I liked and and I
was<00:04:19.810> like<00:04:19.930> I<00:04:20.079> got<00:04:20.260> to<00:04:20.380> build<00:04:20.500> myself<00:04:20.680> when<00:04:21.099> he's

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
was like I got to build myself when he's

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.339 
was like I got to build myself when he's
out<00:04:21.400> of<00:04:21.430> tie<00:04:21.669> so<00:04:22.300> this<00:04:22.479> one's<00:04:22.690> actually<00:04:22.870> for<00:04:23.200> me

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
out of tie so this one's actually for me

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:24.870 
out of tie so this one's actually for me
looks<00:04:24.010> like<00:04:24.130> a<00:04:24.160> geek<00:04:24.340> knows<00:04:24.490> how<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.669> have<00:04:24.849> fun

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
looks like a geek knows how to have fun

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.210 
looks like a geek knows how to have fun
and<00:04:25.300> he<00:04:25.479> knows<00:04:25.659> how<00:04:25.870> to<00:04:25.900> use<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:27.430> technology

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
and he knows how to use the technology

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.070 
and he knows how to use the technology
materials<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:28.670> geometries<00:04:29.210> yeah<00:04:29.810> to

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
materials and geometries yeah to

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.990 
materials and geometries yeah to
optimize<00:04:30.320> it<00:04:30.770> for<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:31.010> buyer<00:04:31.160> yeah<00:04:31.640> thanks

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000
