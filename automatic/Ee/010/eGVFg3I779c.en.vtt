00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
the survivors of these experiments I

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.510 
the survivors of these experiments I
know<00:00:42.149> you've<00:00:42.480> had<00:00:42.600> access<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.710> thousands<00:00:44.399> of

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.190 
this is absolutely a documented fact so
tell<00:02:07.380> me<00:02:07.560> how<00:02:07.770> commonplace<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.910> was<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.720> this

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
tell me how commonplace this was is this

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.430 
tell me how commonplace this was is this
are<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:10.590> talking<00:02:10.920> about<00:02:11.009> one<00:02:11.489> program<00:02:12.120> that

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
are we talking about one program that

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.800 
are we talking about one program that
took<00:02:12.590> place<00:02:12.830> decades<00:02:13.400> ago<00:02:13.700> or<00:02:14.030> do<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.570> think

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
took place decades ago or do you think

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.450 
took place decades ago or do you think
it's<00:02:14.930> happening<00:02:15.380> more<00:02:15.530> often<00:02:15.770> than<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.160> and

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
it's happening more often than that and

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.000 
it's happening more often than that and
if<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:16.880> how<00:02:17.480> could<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.810> be<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:17.960> secretive<00:02:18.830> I

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
if so how could it be so secretive I

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.280 
if so how could it be so secretive I
mean<00:02:19.190> most<00:02:19.400> people<00:02:19.550> would<00:02:19.910> think<00:02:20.270> this<00:02:20.930> can't

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
mean most people would think this can't

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.320 
mean most people would think this can't
be<00:02:21.440> true<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:21.890> is<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:22.250> stuff<00:02:22.700> this<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.120> stuff

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
be true this is a stuff this is stuff

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.050 
be true this is a stuff this is stuff
out<00:02:23.480> of<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.660> movie

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
out of a movie

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.140 
out of a movie
right<00:02:26.710> it<00:02:27.710> was<00:02:27.860> not<00:02:28.100> just<00:02:28.280> one<00:02:28.490> program<00:02:28.700> back

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
right it was not just one program back

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.180 
right it was not just one program back
in<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.450> 50s<00:02:29.810> 67<00:02:30.410> he<00:02:30.500> said<00:02:30.680> was<00:02:30.800> Harvard<00:02:31.900> Yale

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
in the 50s 67 he said was Harvard Yale

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.940 
in the 50s 67 he said was Harvard Yale
Tulane<00:02:34.690> UCLA<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:36.320> we<00:02:36.440> know<00:02:36.590> there<00:02:36.830> was<00:02:36.890> more

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
Tulane UCLA so we know there was more

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.130 
Tulane UCLA so we know there was more
than<00:02:37.280> one<00:02:37.340> University<00:02:37.910> involved<00:02:38.270> more<00:02:38.900> than

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
than one University involved more than

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.780 
than one University involved more than
one<00:02:39.290> branch<00:02:39.530> of<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:39.800> military<00:02:39.950> more<00:02:40.460> than<00:02:40.640> one

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
one branch of the military more than one

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.630 
one branch of the military more than one
program<00:02:41.000> for<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:41.540> fact<00:02:42.160> what's<00:02:43.160> going<00:02:43.460> on

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
program for a fact what's going on

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.020 
program for a fact what's going on
currently<00:02:44.270> of<00:02:44.510> course<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:45.050> all<00:02:45.200> classified

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
currently of course is all classified

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.910 
currently of course is all classified
people<00:02:47.030> tell<00:02:47.240> you<00:02:47.360> stories<00:02:47.750> about<00:02:48.020> it<00:02:48.200> but<00:02:48.380> I

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
people tell you stories about it but I

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.370 
people tell you stories about it but I
can't<00:02:49.220> actually<00:02:49.400> prove<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.840> it's<00:02:51.020> happening

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
can't actually prove that it's happening

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.040 
can't actually prove that it's happening
today<00:02:51.560> I'm<00:02:52.370> certain<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.210> it<00:02:53.420> is<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:53.720> can't

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
today I'm certain that it is I can't

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.560 
today I'm certain that it is I can't
prove<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.440> okay<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:55.250> did<00:02:55.580> these<00:02:55.790> people<00:02:56.240> know

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
prove it okay so did these people know

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.960 
prove it okay so did these people know
what<00:02:56.600> was<00:02:56.960> happening<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.770> them<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:57.950> mean<00:02:58.340> in<00:02:58.880> a

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
what was happening to them I mean in a

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.580 
what was happening to them I mean in a
lot<00:02:59.150> of<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.360> articles<00:02:59.720> I've<00:02:59.990> read<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.380> seemed

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
lot of the articles I've read it seemed

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.680 
lot of the articles I've read it seemed
like<00:03:00.770> they<00:03:00.920> kind<00:03:01.160> of<00:03:01.250> volunteered<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.270> be<00:03:02.390> part

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
like they kind of volunteered to be part

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.920 
like they kind of volunteered to be part
of<00:03:02.810> some<00:03:03.110> sort<00:03:03.320> of<00:03:03.380> experiment<00:03:04.040> right<00:03:04.930> yeah

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
of some sort of experiment right yeah

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.480 
of some sort of experiment right yeah
and<00:03:06.080> a<00:03:06.200> lot<00:03:06.530> of<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.740> different<00:03:07.010> experiments

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
and a lot of the different experiments

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.610 
and a lot of the different experiments
like<00:03:07.640> there<00:03:07.850> was<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.000> group<00:03:08.510> of<00:03:08.750> children<00:03:09.200> in<00:03:09.530> a

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
like there was a group of children in a

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.620 
like there was a group of children in a
school<00:03:10.100> for<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.430> mentally<00:03:10.520> retarded<00:03:11.120> in<00:03:11.480> New

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
school for the mentally retarded in New

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.130 
school for the mentally retarded in New
England

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
England

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.870 
England
their<00:03:12.770> parents<00:03:13.190> were<00:03:13.310> told<00:03:13.550> that<00:03:13.700> the

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
their parents were told that the

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.030 
their parents were told that the
children<00:03:14.210> were<00:03:14.300> participating<00:03:14.870> in<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.320> study

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
children were participating in a study

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.400 
children were participating in a study
of<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.340> dietary<00:03:16.790> supplement<00:03:17.090> but<00:03:18.020> actually

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
of a dietary supplement but actually

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.050 
of a dietary supplement but actually
plutonium<00:03:19.100> was<00:03:19.250> being<00:03:19.520> added<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:19.910> their

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
plutonium was being added to their

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.990 
plutonium was being added to their
cereal<00:03:20.470> so<00:03:21.470> there's<00:03:21.680> all<00:03:21.890> types<00:03:22.550> of<00:03:22.700> different

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
cereal so there's all types of different

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.120 
cereal so there's all types of different
experiments<00:03:23.300> where<00:03:23.930> no<00:03:24.140> real<00:03:24.410> consent<00:03:24.950> was

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
experiments where no real consent was

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.949 
experiments where no real consent was
given<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.910> people<00:03:26.180> didn't<00:03:26.390> really<00:03:26.660> know<00:03:26.780> what

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
given the people didn't really know what

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.890 
given the people didn't really know what
was<00:03:27.080> going<00:03:27.110> on<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:28.600> they<00:03:29.600> were<00:03:29.660> basically

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
was going on and they were basically

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.620 
was going on and they were basically
tricked<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:31.459> I<00:03:31.730> think<00:03:31.940> in<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.239> brain

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
tricked and I think in the brain

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.090 
tricked and I think in the brain
electrode<00:03:33.050> experiments<00:03:33.650> it's<00:03:33.770> kind<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.010> a

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
electrode experiments it's kind of a

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.840 
electrode experiments it's kind of a
combination<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:35.030> both<00:03:35.890> some<00:03:36.890> patients<00:03:37.430> we

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
combination of both some patients we

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.460 
combination of both some patients we
were<00:03:37.970> told<00:03:38.180> you<00:03:38.600> have<00:03:38.720> electrodes<00:03:39.170> put<00:03:39.380> in

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
were told you have electrodes put in

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.140 
were told you have electrodes put in
your<00:03:39.560> brain<00:03:39.800> but<00:03:40.340> it's<00:03:40.489> for<00:03:40.670> some<00:03:40.880> therapy

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
your brain but it's for some therapy

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.470 
your brain but it's for some therapy
purpose<00:03:41.750> when<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.470> was<00:03:42.620> really<00:03:42.890> research

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
purpose when it was really research

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.810 
purpose when it was really research
others<00:03:44.480> were<00:03:44.660> told<00:03:45.040> go<00:03:46.040> go<00:03:46.550> here<00:03:46.730> and

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
others were told go go here and

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.100 
others were told go go here and
volunteer<00:03:47.300> and<00:03:47.420> you<00:03:47.480> don't<00:03:47.630> really<00:03:47.810> have<00:03:47.930> much

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
volunteer and you don't really have much

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.770 
volunteer and you don't really have much
choice<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:49.459> others<00:03:49.730> were<00:03:49.910> given<00:03:50.060> sort<00:03:50.690> of<00:03:50.750> a

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
choice and others were given sort of a

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.360 
choice and others were given sort of a
more<00:03:51.100> exact<00:03:52.100> story<00:03:53.140> so<00:03:54.140> what<00:03:54.500> exactly<00:03:55.130> would

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
more exact story so what exactly would

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.890 
more exact story so what exactly would
the<00:03:55.580> government<00:03:56.030> do<00:03:56.239> when<00:03:56.570> they<00:03:56.720> would

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
the government do when they would

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.350 
the government do when they would
control<00:03:57.500> someone's<00:03:58.070> mind<00:03:58.430> what<00:03:58.910> could<00:03:59.180> they

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360
