got you know great fire simulation great

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.199 
got you know great fire simulation great
smoke<00:02:09.530> simulation<00:02:10.129> a<00:02:10.399> lot<00:02:10.789> of<00:02:10.909> environmental

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
smoke simulation a lot of environmental

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.759 
smoke simulation a lot of environmental
is<00:02:11.720> going<00:02:11.989> on<00:02:12.080> here<00:02:13.959> so<00:02:14.959> you<00:02:15.019> know<00:02:15.349> we<00:02:15.500> wanted

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
is going on here so you know we wanted

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.530 
is going on here so you know we wanted
to<00:02:15.890> make<00:02:16.040> sure<00:02:16.069> that<00:02:16.280> project<00:02:17.060> shield<00:02:17.239> gave

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
to make sure that project shield gave

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.030 
to make sure that project shield gave
the<00:02:17.720> most<00:02:17.930> immersive<00:02:18.230> gaming<00:02:18.560> experience

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
the most immersive gaming experience

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.009 
the most immersive gaming experience
possible<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.519> what<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.819> means<00:02:20.150> is<00:02:20.450> not<00:02:20.720> only

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
possible and what that means is not only

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.930 
possible and what that means is not only
the<00:02:21.260> visual<00:02:21.799> effects<00:02:22.099> but<00:02:22.310> also<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.610> want<00:02:22.909> to

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
the visual effects but also you want to

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.920 
the visual effects but also you want to
make<00:02:23.000> sure<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.239> you<00:02:23.450> have<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.599> audio

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
make sure that you have the audio

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.660 
make sure that you have the audio
quality<00:02:23.989> to<00:02:24.440> back<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:24.739> up<00:02:24.799> you<00:02:25.250> know<00:02:25.370> part<00:02:25.580> of

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
quality to back that up you know part of

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.250 
quality to back that up you know part of
the<00:02:25.730> long<00:02:26.090> hard<00:02:26.330> hours<00:02:26.450> that<00:02:26.750> our<00:02:26.870> engineers

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
the long hard hours that our engineers

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.660 
the long hard hours that our engineers
have<00:02:27.319> put<00:02:27.590> into<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:27.890> project<00:02:28.010> shield<00:02:28.430> has

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
have put into the project shield has

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.880 
have put into the project shield has
gone<00:02:28.879> into<00:02:29.120> acoustic<00:02:29.989> characterization<00:02:30.739> and

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
gone into acoustic characterization and

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.830 
gone into acoustic characterization and
what<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.489> means<00:02:31.700> is<00:02:31.939> that<00:02:31.969> the<00:02:32.359> onboard

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
what that means is that the onboard

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.620 
what that means is that the onboard
speakers<00:02:33.409> on<00:02:33.590> project<00:02:34.040> shield<00:02:34.249> are<00:02:34.519> tuned

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
speakers on project shield are tuned

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.110 
speakers on project shield are tuned
to<00:02:35.780> replicate<00:02:36.740> accurate<00:02:37.340> distortion-free

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
to replicate accurate distortion-free

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.120 
to replicate accurate distortion-free
sound<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.140> make<00:02:39.530> it<00:02:39.650> sound<00:02:39.860> like<00:02:39.920> the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
sound and make it sound like the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.740 
sound and make it sound like the
speakers<00:02:40.520> are<00:02:40.640> actually<00:02:40.970> bigger<00:02:41.270> than<00:02:41.390> they

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
speakers are actually bigger than they

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.010 
speakers are actually bigger than they
actually<00:02:41.870> are<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.240> was<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.390> quick<00:02:44.630> look<00:02:44.870> at

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
actually are so that was a quick look at

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.380 
actually are so that was a quick look at

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
how we're redefining AFK make sure to

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.180 
how we're redefining AFK make sure to
