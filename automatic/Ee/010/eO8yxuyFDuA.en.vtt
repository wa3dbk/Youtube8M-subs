having the case on or off the docking
port<00:04:18.090> at<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.509> bottom<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.049> iPhone<00:04:19.169> is

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620

this<00:04:21.409> little<00:04:22.610> door<00:04:23.610> at<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:23.849> bottom

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
this little door at the bottom

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.690 
this little door at the bottom
I<00:04:25.470> imagine<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:26.620> some<00:04:26.650> charging<00:04:27.370> accessories

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
I imagine that some charging accessories

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.880 
I imagine that some charging accessories
wouldn't<00:04:28.510> be<00:04:28.630> compatible<00:04:28.990> with<00:04:29.260> this<00:04:29.500> device

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
wouldn't be compatible with this device

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.010 
wouldn't be compatible with this device
simply<00:04:30.370> because<00:04:30.700> there's<00:04:31.420> a<00:04:31.480> little<00:04:31.780> bit<00:04:31.900> of

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
simply because there's a little bit of

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.620 
simply because there's a little bit of
depth<00:04:32.260> between<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.860> case<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:34.240> iPhone

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
depth between the case and the iPhone

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.070 
depth between the case and the iPhone
but<00:04:35.230> that's<00:04:35.410> not<00:04:35.560> really<00:04:35.770> an<00:04:35.890> issue<00:04:36.870> in<00:04:37.870> order

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
but that's not really an issue in order

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.540 
but that's not really an issue in order
to<00:04:38.200> open<00:04:38.470> that<00:04:38.590> phone<00:04:38.800> jack<00:04:39.040> at<00:04:39.160> the<00:04:39.220> bottom

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
to open that phone jack at the bottom

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.490 
to open that phone jack at the bottom

port right there and to use waterproof

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.310 
port right there and to use waterproof
headphones<00:04:45.250> under<00:04:45.790> water<00:04:46.120> you<00:04:46.360> just<00:04:46.630> plug

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
headphones under water you just plug

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.890 
headphones under water you just plug
this<00:04:47.500> in<00:04:47.710> like<00:04:48.130> that<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:48.580> don't<00:04:49.480> need<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:49.750> put

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
this in like that you don't need to put

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.730 
this in like that you don't need to put
this<00:04:50.020> in<00:04:50.170> every<00:04:50.410> time<00:04:50.590> you're<00:04:50.710> using

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
this in every time you're using

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.930 
this in every time you're using
headphones<00:04:51.130> it's<00:04:51.460> just<00:04:51.640> when<00:04:51.760> you're<00:04:51.850> going

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
headphones it's just when you're going

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.710 
headphones it's just when you're going
underwater<00:04:52.620> so<00:04:53.620> just<00:04:53.830> screws<00:04:54.040> in<00:04:54.160> like<00:04:54.310> that

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
underwater so just screws in like that

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.300 
underwater so just screws in like that
so<00:04:55.720> it's<00:04:55.810> a<00:04:55.870> bit<00:04:55.990> so<00:04:56.440> it's<00:04:56.560> tied<00:04:56.740> in<00:04:56.860> there<00:04:57.010> and

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
so it's a bit so it's tied in there and

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.420 
so it's a bit so it's tied in there and
then<00:04:57.820> you<00:04:57.880> can<00:04:58.030> use<00:04:58.150> headphones<00:04:58.330> on<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.690> water

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
then you can use headphones on the water

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.000 
then you can use headphones on the water
so<00:05:00.430> it's<00:05:00.580> a<00:05:00.900> little<00:05:01.900> bit<00:05:02.290> lengthy<00:05:02.680> but<00:05:02.890> if

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
so it's a little bit lengthy but if

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.930 
so it's a little bit lengthy but if
you're<00:05:03.130> underwater<00:05:03.460> you're<00:05:03.640> not<00:05:03.760> really

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
you're underwater you're not really

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.270 
you're underwater you're not really
gonna<00:05:04.060> be<00:05:04.150> thinking<00:05:04.480> about<00:05:04.660> it<00:05:05.280> also

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
gonna be thinking about it also

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.960 
gonna be thinking about it also
underwater<00:05:06.970> this<00:05:07.210> case<00:05:07.510> does<00:05:08.140> work<00:05:08.430> but<00:05:09.430> you

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
underwater this case does work but you

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.550 
underwater this case does work but you
can't<00:05:10.240> use<00:05:10.420> the<00:05:10.450> touch<00:05:10.720> screen<00:05:10.750> like<00:05:11.350> any

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
can't use the touch screen like any

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.710 
can't use the touch screen like any
iPhone<00:05:11.890> underwater<00:05:12.520> simply<00:05:12.910> because<00:05:13.210> the

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
iPhone underwater simply because the

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.320 
iPhone underwater simply because the
touch<00:05:13.930> response<00:05:14.110> is<00:05:14.770> triggered<00:05:15.100> by<00:05:15.330> your

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
touch response is triggered by your

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.360 
touch response is triggered by your
finger<00:05:16.660> and<00:05:16.870> when<00:05:17.200> you<00:05:17.320> were<00:05:17.440> underwater

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
finger and when you were underwater

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.330 
finger and when you were underwater
touch<00:05:19.060> screen<00:05:19.480> is<00:05:19.800> limited<00:05:20.800> because<00:05:21.100> all<00:05:21.220> the

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
touch screen is limited because all the

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.130 
touch screen is limited because all the
waters<00:05:21.640> going<00:05:21.790> on<00:05:21.970> it<00:05:22.090> and<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:22.570> heat<00:05:22.780> is<00:05:22.930> just

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
waters going on it and the heat is just

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.990 
waters going on it and the heat is just
disorientated<00:05:23.950> the<00:05:24.430> power<00:05:24.670> button<00:05:24.910> on<00:05:24.940> the

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
disorientated the power button on the

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.700 
disorientated the power button on the
top<00:05:25.120> is<00:05:25.450> really<00:05:25.720> easy<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:25.930> press<00:05:26.140> down<00:05:26.350> as<00:05:26.530> well

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
top is really easy to press down as well

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.350 
top is really easy to press down as well
so<00:05:26.920> when<00:05:27.040> you're<00:05:27.160> underwater<00:05:27.430> with<00:05:27.850> this<00:05:28.000> case

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
so when you're underwater with this case

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.700 
so when you're underwater with this case
on<00:05:28.630> you<00:05:28.810> won't<00:05:28.960> be<00:05:29.050> able<00:05:29.110> to<00:05:29.260> use<00:05:29.350> the<00:05:29.500> touch

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.860 
on you won't be able to use the touch
screen<00:05:29.740> only<00:05:30.400> if<00:05:30.490> you<00:05:30.580> open<00:05:30.910> it<00:05:31.000> up<00:05:31.180> to<00:05:31.840> the
