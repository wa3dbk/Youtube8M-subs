00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hey here is christian and again 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.220
 After yesterday 's sacrifice first 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.350
 I would like to present seven plus 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.030
 Show you this today though only seven 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.410
 because the Chinese smartphone 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.049
 Manufacturer does not just have a big one 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.460
 tray with 6 inches in the case that first 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.350
 seven plus presented but also one 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.840
 slightly smaller model with five inches 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.490
 but also with full hd display the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.820
 We also have a resolution 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.130
 from 1920 x 1080 pixels we have too 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.349
 here a 3 megapixel camera 2 a 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.869
 housing with magnesium alloy and also 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.700
 the possibility of the device by means of a 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.920
 quick-charge device to load the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.809
 means by means of bug it is possible that 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.399
 gets back within 70 minutes 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.680
 completely recharge 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.570
 how the device feels like it is 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.129
 in my first hands-on beat 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.140
 and with what devices maybe that 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.360
 sacrifice is only comparable to seven 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.360
 here after a very short break a lot 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.579
 fun as in the intro already tease 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.829
 although the seven a whole corner 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.570
 smaller than the car first every plus and 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.030
 In this case, we speak of a 5 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.440
 inch display on the front 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.799
 again an amoled panel and also 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.830
 with a full-hd resolution that is 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.909
 1920 x 1080 pixels and also exists here 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.159
 the device comes back from one 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.840
 Magnesium alloy means very high quality 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.890
 very stable and it feels right 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.409
 good at 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.689
 what else do we have in our judgment 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.470
 in weight and 63 millimeters in the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:27.030
 Cover to a height of 143 mm and a 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.189
 width of 71 mm since a pact oppo 1 2320 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.130
 millipole strong battery with 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.900
 called quick charger or at occ and 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.850
 what I see you that's it 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.590
 The final device will be in the beginning of june 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.390
 germany comes then we still have 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.189
 on the front or in the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.960
 Upper area of ​​course the earpiece 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.540
 to telephone an eight megapixel 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.790
 front camera with f2 of four aperture 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.950
 various sensors and you can do it on 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.720
 edge see the display is to the edge 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.430
 a bit rounded that means you have one 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.380
 really good feeling when you are 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.600
 with your finger over the edge of the display 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.369
 the outside sweeps in the lower area 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.170
 then we have the buttons and this one 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.210
 not on the display as in the car 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.829
 appeared plus is below but 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.140
 displays so that the display really 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.700
 with its 5 inches is completely usable 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.770
 on the left again the setting 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.370
 button in the middle the homebutton and 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.080
 on the right side to the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.120
 back button you take a look 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.400
 the upper area of ​​the backside finds 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.980
 there is the 13 megapixel camera with f 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.049
 2.2 aperture and a single led 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.580
 means the victim only seven did not have 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.769
 many things in common with the courses 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.200
 or the first seven plus that's what we mean 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.120
 have no two colored led no reader 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.010
 autofocus and no fingerprint 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.720
 Scanner at the technical data 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.079
 Let's talk about the following points 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.480
 snapdragon 615 opta choir 1 8 cores with 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.970
 64 bit 1 5 gigahertz two gigabytes 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.700
 main memory and the internal memory 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.739
 16gb is also something here 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.420
 less than the victim appeared plus 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.760
 However , here is the again 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.620
 memory expandable via micro sd card 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.900
 or you can also the micro 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.060
 sd cards slot for a second nano sim 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.659
 use a card and have a dual sim 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.120
 device 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:03.250
 Of course, there are also lte and 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.109
 bluetooth 4.0 and take a look 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.000
 on the left side of the housing one finds 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.190
 there the power button so the on and 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.629
 switch off on the opposite 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.159
 side we have the one-piece 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.859
 volume rocker, however, divided into two parts 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.680
 design is the slot for the nano sim 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:20.620
 card and the micro sd card slot or 1 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.840
 2 nano sim card slot means you can 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.280
 This device also use dual sim in the 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.930
 feet of the device we have then 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.510
 of course, the micro USB port 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.459
 to load the device or 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.859
 to exchange with any data 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.510
 and a microphone and how the first 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:37.150
 seven plus the audio connection for the 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.010
 headphones in the head area of ​​the device 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.500
 let's just got a look at the 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.120
 surface of the sacrifice 7 throw 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.609
 the victim only seven plus comes here 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.340
 unfortunately no android 5.0 lollipop to 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.349
 use but only android 4.4 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.230
 point 2 kitkat but again 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.239
 with color os 2.1 that's the po 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.680
 own surface and I have too 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.510
 here again the possibility of this 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.419
 change the wallpapers to change 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.129
 or from our own team store like 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:04.930
 even more design templates 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.730
 of course I can too 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.739
 here the backgrounds would change 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.199
 add or even the 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.810
 to arrange the whole homescreens a bit differently 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:15.340
 already quite indicated to me 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.320
 bottom left you have a setting 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.060
 button in the middle the homebutton and 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.799
 on the right side the back 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.660
 do you look then the settings so 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.550
 you also have the attitude here 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.830
 again three tabs in the upper 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.600
 area namely display tones and 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.910
 general settings you go to 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.490
 over the telephone one finds there still 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.880
 times some notes namely android 454 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.669
 point yes it is 4 kitkat here with the 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.200
 kaller os 2.1 surface the surface 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.030
 really makes one in this case too 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.230
 very fluid impression and you will 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.520
 Here is a look in the camera 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.790
 Application can be found again 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.580
 Similarities to Apple iPhone or to 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.110
 was white i motion louis 3.0 that is 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.880
 I really have the possibilities here 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.560
 in the simplest way 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.810
 to apply different modes 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.669
 i have an ultra hd mode i have 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.760
 a normal mode and I can too 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:07.840
 to record the videos in 1080p that is 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.850
 full hd with 1920 x 1080 pixels 4k 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.470
 Recordings are just the sacrifice 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.660
 Unfortunately not possible 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.070
 Even when sacrificing only seven I can only 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.139
 say that the device is really 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.210
 feels really good magnesium alloy 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.580
 as a housing we have a weight here 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.240
 of 147 grams a very thin smartphone 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.979
 with only 63 mm and with the calorie 2.1 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.910
 surface really fast 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.919
 operating system 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.500
 To what extent does the opto choir take the form of the 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.660
 qualcomm snapdragon 615 so good gas 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.830
 Of course we have to do that first 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.300
 see benchmark test 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.590
 however, the surface has us 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.960
 she really likes it 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.760
 just very nice overlays nice 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.860
 animations and you can call the system 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.900
 really on yourself personally 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.520
 completely really good to cut 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.100
 that was my first hands-on 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.289
 a first impression with the victim first 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.000
 Seven if you like the video to see if you can 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.620
 just have not seen you look 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.169
 in my channel there I have that, too 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.300
 video listed or in the 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.500
 description of the victim 7 I link 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.330
 Of course I would be glad if you have the 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.700
 channel and also at future 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.110
 Watch videos again by then 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.110
 do it well and ciao
