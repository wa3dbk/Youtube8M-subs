not<00:01:54.899> even<00:01:54.930> edible<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:56.070> make<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.060> into

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
not even edible and then make it into

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.569 
not even edible and then make it into
this<00:01:57.450> corn<00:01:57.899> syrup<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.009> cheaper<00:01:59.549> than
