00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello welcome to our videos for 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.660
 today's exercise we would like 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.460
 present you the beautiful seen the hunchback is 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.289
 an element of physical training 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.109
 which allows to work on the balanced 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.680
 and proprioception for this first 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.230
 exercise 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.210
 sevenair will introduce us how 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.150
 get on the hunchback and hold his 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.490
 balance as you can notice 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.210
 there is permanent work at the level 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.920
 ankles 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.899
 this is called a recovery of 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.870
 balance this word allows him in 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.180
 constantly stimulate the muscles of the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.640
 foot those who are in contact 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.649
 directly with the soil very interesting 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.270
 in running it's important 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.550
 also to understand the interest of 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.710
 start his workout to start 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.660
 a workout by the pedestal 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.460
 by the body tray because it is him who you 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.690
 door it is he who supports you in 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.059
 your general posture 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.039
 the first exercise simply consists of 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.809
 to get the equilibrium standing on the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.329
 hunchback that it's important in this 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.600
 exercise to keep a maximum of 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.159
 postures a maximum of stretching 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.280
 as if you wanted to go to touch the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.320
 sky with your hair simultaneously 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.939
 continue to breathe a little bit more 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.530
 high at the thorax 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.220
 for your guen to level 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.990
 the abdomen remains permanently constricted 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.240
 feel and stability in this 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.670
 basic position before you venture 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.270
 in dynamic exercises first 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.549
 repetition of the squad on the hunchback in 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.259
 now a most upright position 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.450
 possible to more vertical possible at 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.700
 back level in order to avoid all 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.770
 creeps in the lower back every 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.000
 belly pushes forward and 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.250
 all the camber at the level of the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.340
 column we will ask séverine in 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.220
 expiring by tightening the maximum 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.960
 abdominals to go down almost as if 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.030
 she squats it's what we can 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.460
 notice did that Severine strongly leaned 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.070
 forward thanks to the mirror or thanks 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.079
 with reflections in a window you can 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.540
 check your alignment 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.010
 we do them once 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.370
 see the position at leaned towards 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.039
 front 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.840
 if this is the case with you, we will 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.700
 propose our next missions for 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.740
 this learning option you can 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.350
 see that séverine now half 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.180
 on the only on the half-way sold 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.490
 on the buzz got on the heels this 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.170
 position will favor a better 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.830
 alignment at the column level 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.570
 vertebral 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.850
 it's the same instructions to the news 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.190
 at the level of breathing and at the level 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.709
 from the posture to you séverine keep the 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.020
 right as much as possible imagine that you have 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.580
 a stick all along your back and that you 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.860
 your line compared to this one very 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.630
 well we start again pay attention to 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.580
 alignment at your knees the 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.800
 knees should not exceed the tip 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.600
 feet so as not to overload the 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.890
 pressures at the level of your death 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.500
 knee the kneecap again very 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.070
 well we are back on 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.959
 the overall exercise with now the 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.820
 two feet in contact with the hunchbacked you 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.670
 notice that you are no longer 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.410
 willingly on the front half of boziu 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.890
 you are not yet at the top of 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.820
 this one but rather forward I 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.440
 go d severine kept his position on 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.170
 as long as possible at the back 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.840
 go on and for all that time she 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.030
 will be able to focus on the effect 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.400
 beneficial toning of your thighs 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.140
 and your buttocks because that's the goal 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.330
 principal of this exercise a 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.080
 overall strengthening of both members 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.200
 lower 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.840
 coupled with posture-level work 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.489
 trunk home you can you 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.350
 hold a door class 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.200
 you can help a partner 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.019
 or you can insure your position 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.410
 with something stable in front of you 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.510
 Now we will bind it without help 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.799
 are the arms that will extend towards 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.600
 front 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.010
 toning is still much more 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.620
 important at the level of the members 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.870
 inferior part points out this 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.910
 permanent work of the members 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.280
 lower and this exercise you 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.840
 will learn little by little to be able to you 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.940
 to crouch again 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.920
 you will notice that we insist 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.620
 much on the qualitative aspect of 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.330
 exercises for us the important before 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.639
 the intensity of the exercise is first the 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.889
 quality that's what will make sure that your 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.169
 exercise will be safe and will be at 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.169
 performing term we will resume 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:27.020
 together the three variations on this 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.180
 custom squat exercise the first 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.150
 is carried out with the feet half 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.460
 the need is half on the ground think 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.139
 always to recruit in the member 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.930
 lower backstage and in the 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.710
 gluteal 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:45.680
 after that you will ensure a good exercise 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.229
 introduction level you spend on the 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.450
 hunchback with help 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.729
 it's the same principle use your arms 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:56.870
 as a contract then it is they who make the 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:59.510
 counterweight to allow your 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.380
 posture remains equal from beginning to end 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.630
 some exercice 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.210
 once you master this work to 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:09.169
 2 you just have to perform 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:12.080
 general exercise always with the 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:15.530
 same posture safety guidelines 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.360
 of breathing notice the posture 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.370
