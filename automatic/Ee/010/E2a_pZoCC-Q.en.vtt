00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
there - Oh first yeah I just find it a

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.800 
there - Oh first yeah I just find it a
bit<00:02:07.759> easier<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:09.119> needed<00:02:09.599> that

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
bit easier just needed that

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.700 
bit easier just needed that
yeah

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
yeah

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:21.470 
yeah
so<00:02:13.290> they<00:02:14.290> have<00:02:14.410> put<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.800> in<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.370> two<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:20.220> then

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
so they have put it in the two so then

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.170 
so they have put it in the two so then
you<00:02:22.480> would<00:02:22.660> put<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.530> in<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:24.070> then<00:02:24.220> turn<00:02:25.150> it

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
you would put it in and then turn it

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.410 
you would put it in and then turn it
clockwise<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.830> I've<00:02:27.400> got<00:02:27.610> buck<00:02:27.820> deer<00:02:28.000> when

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
clockwise so I've got buck deer when

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.870 
clockwise so I've got buck deer when
I've<00:02:28.810> done<00:02:29.170> them<00:02:29.590> all<00:02:31.770> so<00:02:32.770> now<00:02:33.190> for<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.670> whales
