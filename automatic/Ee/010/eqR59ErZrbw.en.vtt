00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.500
 by twitter yesterday via twitter 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.890
 posted a tweet saying that already 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.219
 we had that and it was confirmed for them 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.059
 ios 6 a tester and this was achieved by 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.920
 the developer planet ping ok if not what 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.020
 I knew I leave your twitter in the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.980
 description of the video not good then there 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:04.410
 they are what they publish and good then 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.430
 yesterday he published it yesterday night 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.040
 Yesterday the news came out 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.300
 yesterday I published it on my own 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.120
 twitter and facebook then good if 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:22.160
 they did not see it here and I bring you the video 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:24.290
 good yesterday he did in his blog a this one a 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.400
 statement saying that he already had the 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.920
 gamer a tt for ios 6 confirmed and that 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.190
 I already had it, I already had the gamer 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.430
 running on his iphone 5 he already had syria 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:41.899
 then it's good news for 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.390
 ours for us since we already 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.450
 we took this jailbreak for dead and 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.600
 we thought that we no longer had skills 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.460
 to be able to make this james possible but 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.369
 here the developer planet main and 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:02.600
 potosí that I think was the one that helped him 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:05.750
 so then as I was telling you this is 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.860
 the official blog of pose I think 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.440
 then for this one 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.230
 communicated to expressed the following ok 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.780
 I'm going to read a bit then I said yes 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.240
 I'm not quite sure what all this 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.280
 itself it's about the fact is that I have 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:27.470
 a book günter ios six points 0.2 that 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.209
 go touring on my iphone 5 now 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.030
 same reasons why I do not know 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.890
 they release are because a release would be 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.319
 record an exploit that we want to save 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.470
 for ourselves so we always 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.910
 can try to see the new firmware and 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.010
 help the jailbreak in the future 2 of 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.920
 6.1 comes very soon and I expect everything 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.580
 likely to break a small part of 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.160
 she 2 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.320
 anyway it does not make sense in the 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.890
 sacrifice of the many mistakes that do not 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:02.610
 they break ok this means that the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.490
 planet does not want to still make public 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:10.170
 this facebook since the place was published 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.410
 to launch for the new version that is 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.760
 the 6.1 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:20.810
 can plug ying blues then what 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:25.580
 what he means is that he is going to 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.470
 wait until the 6.2 leave and this 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.960
 power and make this game public but 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.140
 for us and so 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.320
 would run an on an iphone an ipad or on 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.260
 any apple device the carry a 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.440
 jailbreak a bottle that there are friends that 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.080
 it's very good then do not despair 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.020
 that soon we will have the liverpool in 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.750

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.390
 here it just says it's for iphone 5 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.540
