smacking this away the hand slaps
sideways<00:01:23.140> to<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.500> blade<00:01:23.740> presses<00:01:24.670> down<00:01:24.909> and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
sideways to the blade presses down and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.109 
sideways to the blade presses down and
again<00:01:26.350> I<00:01:26.530> can<00:01:26.740> use<00:01:26.770> to<00:01:27.189> handle<00:01:27.400> the<00:01:27.670> strike<00:01:27.939> the

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119
