f/8<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.890> picture<00:02:44.310> becomes<00:02:44.670> very<00:02:45.090> sharp

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
f/8 the picture becomes very sharp

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.560 
f/8 the picture becomes very sharp
indeed<00:02:45.770> but<00:02:46.770> aberrations<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.700> purple<00:02:48.330> haze

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
indeed but aberrations and purple haze

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.920 
indeed but aberrations and purple haze
still<00:02:49.200> remain<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:50.640> generally<00:02:51.239> this<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.900> a

is a lot of ugly purple haze and
chromatic<00:03:05.489> aberration<00:03:06.030> which<00:03:06.570> really<00:03:06.930> spoils
