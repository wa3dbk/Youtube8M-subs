I'm not sure if it's exactly the same

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.999 
I'm not sure if it's exactly the same
test<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.100> if<00:02:07.159> it<00:02:07.280> works<00:02:07.520> exactly<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.720> same

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
test and if it works exactly the same

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.770 
test and if it works exactly the same
but<00:02:10.009> this<00:02:10.489> is<00:02:10.610> this<00:02:10.789> corner<00:02:11.209> I<00:02:11.420> was<00:02:11.599> getting

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
not sure I'm not sure ok let's go around

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.250 
not sure I'm not sure ok let's go around
14<00:02:39.500> 10<00:02:39.860> so<00:02:40.610> very<00:02:41.120> very<00:02:41.239> identical<00:02:41.810> doesn't

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
14 10 so very very identical doesn't

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.800 
14 10 so very very identical doesn't
jump<00:02:42.470> around<00:02:42.830> around<00:02:43.459> that<00:02:44.239> much<00:02:44.420> as<00:02:44.630> we

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
jump around around that much as we

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.440 
jump around around that much as we
usually<00:02:44.930> see<00:02:45.230> in<00:02:45.260> android<00:02:45.650> devices<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.450> this

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
usually see in android devices so this

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.420 
usually see in android devices so this
is<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.780> again<00:02:48.049> and<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.560> will<00:02:48.620> jump<00:02:48.890> top<00:02:49.069> 6<00:02:49.280> I

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
is to again and I will jump top 6 I

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.800 
is to again and I will jump top 6 I
don't<00:02:49.580> remember<00:02:49.700> what<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.090> got<00:02:50.299> things<00:02:50.510> up<00:02:50.660> &amp;

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
don't remember what I got things up &amp;

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.620 
don't remember what I got things up &amp;
open<00:02:51.069> 57.4<00:02:52.069> but<00:02:53.000> if<00:02:53.090> you<00:02:53.150> have<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.480> Vice

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
open 57.4 but if you have the Vice

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.570 
open 57.4 but if you have the Vice
running<00:02:53.989> that<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.319> course<00:02:54.500> again<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:54.980> try<00:02:55.519> it

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
running that of course again you try it

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.050 
running that of course again you try it
out<00:02:55.810> compare<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:56.840> may<00:02:57.110> be<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:58.760> can<00:02:58.910> kind

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
out compare it may be and you can kind

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.660 
out compare it may be and you can kind
of<00:02:59.180> see<00:02:59.390> if<00:02:59.540> they<00:02:59.720> have<00:03:00.340> increased<00:03:01.340> or

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
of see if they have increased or

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.180 
of see if they have increased or
decreased<00:03:02.110> something<00:03:03.110> in<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.830> background

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
decreased something in the background

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.780 
decreased something in the background
maybe<00:03:04.850> perhaps<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:06.110> this<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:07.100> cool<00:03:07.370> for<00:03:07.519> nerds

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
maybe perhaps and this is cool for nerds

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.090 
maybe perhaps and this is cool for nerds
to<00:03:08.150> see<00:03:08.359> if<00:03:08.480> something<00:03:08.810> is<00:03:08.900> going<00:03:09.079> up<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:09.620> yeah

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
to see if something is going up so yeah

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.850 
to see if something is going up so yeah
