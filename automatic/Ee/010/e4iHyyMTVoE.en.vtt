00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
been at the NHL level yet so maybe it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.649

an advantage to guys that have been
playing<00:01:46.979> juniors<00:01:48.049> otherwise<00:01:49.049> uh<00:01:49.110> would<00:01:50.009> be<00:01:50.100> a

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
playing juniors otherwise uh would be a
