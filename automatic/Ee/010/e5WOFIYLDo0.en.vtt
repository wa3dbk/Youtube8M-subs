of<00:01:07.000> chemistry<00:01:07.690> actually<00:01:07.840> turned<00:01:08.260> out<00:01:08.350> quite

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
of chemistry actually turned out quite

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.990 
of chemistry actually turned out quite
different<00:01:09.040> from<00:01:09.160> what<00:01:09.550> I'm<00:01:09.640> actually<00:01:09.790> doing

different from what I'm actually doing
now<00:01:10.450> I<00:01:11.250> assumed<00:01:12.250> I<00:01:12.430> would<00:01:12.490> be<00:01:12.790> just<00:01:13.000> working<00:01:13.360> in

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
now I assumed I would be just working in

now I assumed I would be just working in
the<00:01:13.540> lab<00:01:13.720> and<00:01:14.080> a<00:01:14.350> career<00:01:15.280> in<00:01:15.370> CHEM<00:01:15.520> she<00:01:15.730> doesn't

the lab and a career in CHEM she doesn't

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.790 
the lab and a career in CHEM she doesn't
necessarily<00:01:16.060> mean<00:01:16.720> that<00:01:16.750> because<00:01:17.260> I<00:01:17.290> do<00:01:17.440> spend

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
necessarily mean that because I do spend

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.710 
necessarily mean that because I do spend
a<00:01:17.920> lot<00:01:18.070> of<00:01:18.100> time<00:01:18.340> doing<00:01:18.970> a<00:01:19.030> wide<00:01:19.180> variety<00:01:19.450> of

career in science because has a lot more
variety<00:01:27.730> than<00:01:28.000> you<00:01:28.270> might<00:01:28.450> think<00:01:28.480> and<00:01:29.020> it<00:01:29.350> also

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
variety than you might think and it also

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.610

on how to formulate Sun care products

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.830 
on how to formulate Sun care products
which<00:01:39.850> is<00:01:40.000> something<00:01:40.300> you<00:01:40.390> might<00:01:40.510> not<00:01:40.570> expect

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
which is something you might not expect

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.680 
which is something you might not expect
from<00:01:41.410> a<00:01:41.500> career<00:01:41.800> in<00:01:41.920> science<00:01:42.310> if<00:01:42.940> you<00:01:43.570> were

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
from a career in science if you were

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.420 
from a career in science if you were
considering<00:01:44.290> a<00:01:44.350> career<00:01:44.470> in<00:01:44.740> science<00:01:44.980> I'd<00:01:45.280> say

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
considering a career in science I'd say

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.950 
considering a career in science I'd say
the<00:01:45.580> first<00:01:45.790> step<00:01:45.940> is<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.450> speak<00:01:46.720> to<00:01:46.840> your

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
the first step is to speak to your

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.960 
the first step is to speak to your
careers<00:01:47.260> advisor<00:01:47.620> find<00:01:48.340> out<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.580> companies

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
careers advisor find out the companies

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.370 
careers advisor find out the companies
in<00:01:49.090> your<00:01:49.240> local<00:01:49.540> area<00:01:49.690> that<00:01:49.930> would<00:01:50.170> take<00:01:50.350> a

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
in your local area that would take a

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.140 
in your local area that would take a
placement<00:01:50.710> student<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.460> do<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:51.910> work

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
placement student and do a work

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.700 
placement student and do a work
placement<00:01:52.420> because<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:53.080> gives<00:01:53.320> you<00:01:53.410> a<00:01:53.440> really

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
placement because it gives you a really

in<00:02:12.810> science<00:02:13.200> it's<00:02:14.130> really<00:02:14.190> important<00:02:14.880> that

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
in science it's really important that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.720 
in science it's really important that
there<00:02:15.180> are<00:02:15.210> support<00:02:15.900> organizations

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730

one<00:02:21.870> example<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:23.070> UK<00:02:23.550> Resource<00:02:24.030> Center

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
one example is the UK Resource Center

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.860 
one example is the UK Resource Center
and<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:25.620> DRI<00:02:25.830> project<00:02:26.460> so<00:02:27.090> these<00:02:27.300> are<00:02:27.480> centers

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
and the DRI project so these are centers

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.750 
and the DRI project so these are centers
where<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.710> go<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:28.890> get<00:02:29.070> information<00:02:29.310> and

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
where you can go and get information and
