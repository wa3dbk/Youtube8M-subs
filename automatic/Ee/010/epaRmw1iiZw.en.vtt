really<00:01:06.820> gross<00:01:07.000> but<00:01:07.690> you<00:01:07.840> paint<00:01:08.140> your

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
really gross but you paint your

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.160 
really gross but you paint your
foundation<00:01:08.830> onto<00:01:08.980> your<00:01:09.220> face<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:10.600> only<00:01:10.840> one

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
foundation onto your face it's only one

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.859 
foundation onto your face it's only one
pump<00:01:11.470> so<00:01:11.890> it<00:01:12.640> can<00:01:12.910> cover<00:01:13.090> my<00:01:13.300> entire<00:01:13.420> face<00:01:13.810> and

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
pump so it can cover my entire face and

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.990 
pump so it can cover my entire face and
I<00:01:14.080> usually<00:01:14.380> actually<00:01:14.560> have<00:01:14.950> a<00:01:15.190> little<00:01:15.820> bit

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
I usually actually have a little bit

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.760 
I usually actually have a little bit
left<00:01:16.180> over<00:01:16.390> but<00:01:16.720> I<00:01:16.780> like<00:01:17.050> to<00:01:17.080> start<00:01:17.440> on<00:01:17.650> my

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
left over but I like to start on my

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.020 
left over but I like to start on my
cheeks<00:01:19.860> because<00:01:20.860> they<00:01:21.250> are<00:01:21.400> the<00:01:21.430> most<00:01:21.670> read

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
cheeks because they are the most read

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.420 
cheeks because they are the most read
and<00:01:22.270> then<00:01:22.479> I<00:01:22.510> focus<00:01:23.140> on<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.530> less<00:01:23.740> red<00:01:24.100> parts

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
and then I focus on the less red parts

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.380 
and then I focus on the less red parts
like<00:01:24.850> my<00:01:25.119> nose<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:25.840> um<00:01:26.580> my<00:01:27.580> forehead<00:01:27.970> for<00:01:28.210> less

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
like my nose and um my forehead for less

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.469 
like my nose and um my forehead for less
foundation<00:01:29.050> and<00:01:29.290> that's<00:01:30.190> just<00:01:30.580> so<00:01:30.790> my<00:01:31.150> skin

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
foundation and that's just so my skin

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.440 
foundation and that's just so my skin
isn't<00:01:31.690> super<00:01:32.260> heavy<00:01:32.760> where<00:01:33.760> it<00:01:33.970> doesn't<00:01:34.180> need

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
isn't super heavy where it doesn't need

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:49.090 
isn't super heavy where it doesn't need
to<00:01:34.510> be
