how to make an origami fortune-teller so

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.600 
how to make an origami fortune-teller so
first<00:00:06.930> off<00:00:07.080> you're<00:00:07.230> going<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.410> start<00:00:07.620> off<00:00:07.770> with

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.490 
a square sheet of paper um you know the
bigger<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:12.030> square<00:00:12.420> screw<00:00:12.570> paper<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.320> bigger

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
bigger the square screw paper the bigger

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.829 
bigger the square screw paper the bigger
your<00:00:13.769> origami<00:00:14.700> fortune-tellers<00:00:15.540> going<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.750> be

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
your origami fortune-tellers going to be

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.290 
your origami fortune-tellers going to be
and<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.590> can<00:00:16.619> experiment<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:18.180> know<00:00:18.270> a

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
and you can experiment it you know a

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.550 
and you can experiment it you know a
smaller<00:00:18.600> piece<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.840> paper<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.260> whatnot

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
smaller piece of paper and whatnot

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.859 
smaller piece of paper and whatnot
alright<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:20.760> I've<00:00:21.150> square<00:00:21.449> sheet<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.689> paper

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
alright so I've square sheet of paper

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.929 
alright so I've square sheet of paper
and<00:00:22.199> we're<00:00:22.650> just<00:00:22.800> going<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:22.980> ignore<00:00:23.279> this

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and we're just going to ignore this

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.160 
and we're just going to ignore this
little<00:00:24.900> diagonal<00:00:25.350> line<00:00:25.830> right<00:00:26.730> here<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.170> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
little diagonal line right here so the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.359 
little diagonal line right here so the
first<00:00:28.380> thing<00:00:28.500> I'm<00:00:28.590> going<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.740> do<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.010> I'm<00:00:29.160> going

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.299 
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:00:29.460> create<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:30.119> horizontal<00:00:30.990> fold<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.949> what's

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
to create a horizontal fold so what's

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.049 
to create a horizontal fold so what's
gonna<00:00:32.430> happen<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.700> I'm<00:00:32.730> gonna<00:00:32.850> take<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
gonna happen is I'm gonna take the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.670 
gonna happen is I'm gonna take the
bottom<00:00:33.329> half<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.750> float<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.170> top<00:00:34.260> half

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
bottom half on a float to the top half

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:47.180 
bottom half on a float to the top half
and<00:00:39.680> make<00:00:40.680> sure<00:00:41.180> they<00:00:42.180> are<00:00:42.480> aligned<00:00:46.010> I'm<00:00:47.010> just

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
and make sure they are aligned I'm just

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.389 
and make sure they are aligned I'm just
going<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.370> give<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> good<00:00:48.030> full<00:00:49.129> I'm<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.280> going

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
going to give a good full I'm just going

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.310 
going to give a good full I'm just going
to<00:00:50.460> unopen<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.539> now<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:52.079> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
to unopen it and now we have a

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.310 
to unopen it and now we have a
horizontal<00:00:53.039> line<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.719> now<00:00:54.809> we're<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.170> do

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
horizontal line so now we're going to do

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.350 
horizontal line so now we're going to do
is<00:00:55.530> we're<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.399> take<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.730> right<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
is we're going to take it right to the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.200 
is we're going to take it right to the
left<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:59.210> I<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:01.050> turn<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.440> right<00:01:01.469> here<00:01:02.210> makes

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
left and I just turn it right here makes

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.880 
left and I just turn it right here makes
it<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.420> little<00:01:03.510> easier<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:04.559> yourself<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:06.890> just

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
it a little easier on yourself and just

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.450 
it a little easier on yourself and just
fold<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:09.860> that<00:01:10.860> should<00:01:11.070> give<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.280> your

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
fold and that should give you your

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.020 
fold and that should give you your
vertical<00:01:11.850> line<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:14.520> what<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:14.909> right

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
vertical line so what do we have right

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.210 
vertical line so what do we have right
now<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> cross<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.530> one<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.159> down

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
now we have a cross so one going down

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.719 
now we have a cross so one going down
here<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.759> another<00:01:18.420> going<00:01:18.689> right<00:01:18.840> here<00:01:19.729> so

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
here and another going right here so

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.280 
here and another going right here so
what<00:01:20.850> we're<00:01:20.939> going<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:21.299> now<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:22.110> we're

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
what we're going to do now is we're

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.160 
what we're going to do now is we're
going<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.439> take<00:01:22.590> each<00:01:22.830> corner<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:24.170> we're

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
going to take each corner and we're

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.270 
going to take each corner and we're
going<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.320> take<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> corner<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.040> we're<00:01:26.159> going

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
going to take the corner and we're going

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.530 
going to take the corner and we're going
to<00:01:26.310> fold<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> spot<00:01:27.060> where<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> two

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
to fold it to the spot where the two

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.109 
to fold it to the spot where the two
lines<00:01:27.720> meets<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.320> middle<00:01:28.979> spot<00:01:29.250> right<00:01:29.369> here

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.359 

so<00:01:33.119> that's<00:01:33.420> going<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:33.900> fold<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.369> we're

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
so that's going to be one fold and we're

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:44.130 
so that's going to be one fold and we're
do<00:01:35.549> three<00:01:35.880> more<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.180> these<00:01:36.299> side

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.679 

make<00:01:45.140> sure<00:01:45.320> when<00:01:45.830> you<00:01:45.950> go<00:01:46.189> on<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:47.330> put<00:01:47.509> this

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
make sure when you go on to put this

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.910 
make sure when you go on to put this
fold<00:01:48.500> on<00:01:48.820> you<00:01:49.820> don't<00:01:50.000> want<00:01:50.299> it<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.869> go<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.080> more

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
fold on you don't want it to go to more

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.830 
fold on you don't want it to go to more
than<00:01:51.950> it<00:01:52.340> should<00:01:52.670> be<00:01:52.820> or<00:01:53.030> less<00:01:53.330> than<00:01:53.570> it<00:01:53.659> should

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
than it should be or less than it should

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.940 
than it should be or less than it should
be<00:01:58.420> all<00:01:59.420> right<00:01:59.509> so<00:02:00.110> now<00:02:00.500> we<00:02:00.560> have<00:02:00.740> something

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
be all right so now we have something

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.639 
be all right so now we have something
like<00:02:01.190> this<00:02:01.869> all<00:02:02.869> right<00:02:02.899> now<00:02:02.990> what<00:02:03.320> we<00:02:03.440> do<00:02:03.619> is

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
like this all right now what we do is

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.370 
like this all right now what we do is
we're<00:02:03.950> going<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.130> flip<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.610> over<00:02:04.759> and<00:02:05.380> we're

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
we're going to flip it over and we're

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.990 
we're going to flip it over and we're
going<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.560> do<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.890> exact<00:02:07.250> same<00:02:07.280> thing<00:02:07.700> see

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
going to do the exact same thing see

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.460 
going to do the exact same thing see
these<00:02:08.149> lines<00:02:08.390> right<00:02:08.630> here<00:02:09.280> Center<00:02:11.260> well<00:02:12.260> we're

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
these lines right here Center well we're

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.990 
these lines right here Center well we're
going<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.620> take<00:02:12.890> these<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.520> we're<00:02:13.819> going<00:02:13.940> to

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
going to take these and we're going to

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.530 
going to take these and we're going to
fold<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.630> right<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.989> that<00:02:15.110> Center<00:02:16.330> so<00:02:17.330> that's

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
fold it right to that Center so that's

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.259 
fold it right to that Center so that's
one<00:02:18.130> now<00:02:19.130> we<00:02:19.220> have<00:02:19.340> three<00:02:19.640> more<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.940> go<00:02:19.970> on

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
one now we have three more to go on

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.750 
one now we have three more to go on
these<00:02:20.600> sides<00:02:21.819> so<00:02:22.819> that's<00:02:23.120> two<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.950> this<00:02:25.580> is

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
these sides so that's two and this is

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.350 
these sides so that's two and this is
number<00:02:26.000> three<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:28.239> this<00:02:29.239> is<00:02:29.420> number<00:02:29.600> four<00:02:31.360> all

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
number three and this is number four all

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.070 
number three and this is number four all
right<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:32.569> now<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:32.780> should<00:02:32.840> have<00:02:32.959> something

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
right so now you should have something

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.370 
right so now you should have something
like<00:02:33.470> this<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:34.360> we're<00:02:35.360> very<00:02:35.600> close<00:02:36.260> to

to do is we want to make another

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.640 
to do is we want to make another
horizontal<00:02:40.040> fold<00:02:40.489> so<00:02:41.269> down<00:02:41.510> here<00:02:41.780> goes<00:02:42.350> up<00:02:42.500> to

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
horizontal fold so down here goes up to

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
we're going to do is we're gonna take

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.330 
we're going to do is we're gonna take
right-to-left<00:02:54.500> create<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.370> vertical<00:02:55.549> fold

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
right-to-left create a vertical fold

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.640 
right-to-left create a vertical fold
okay<00:02:58.370> so<00:02:59.120> now<00:02:59.269> what<00:02:59.480> we<00:02:59.660> done<00:02:59.810> is<00:03:00.109> we<00:03:00.290> create<00:03:00.590> a

okay so now what we done is we create a

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.410 
okay so now what we done is we create a
better<00:03:00.829> crease<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.579> help<00:03:01.700> us<00:03:01.850> with<00:03:02.030> this<00:03:02.120> next

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
better crease to help us with this next

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.660 
better crease to help us with this next
step<00:03:02.600> so<00:03:03.470> now<00:03:03.739> what<00:03:03.920> we<00:03:04.010> do<00:03:04.130> is<00:03:04.340> we're<00:03:04.489> going<00:03:04.579> to

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
step so now what we do is we're going to

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.630 
step so now what we do is we're going to

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
right here you want to open it up a

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.080 
right here you want to open it up a
little<00:03:09.799> bit<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.220> make<00:03:10.340> sure<00:03:10.370> this<00:03:10.579> spot<00:03:10.940> like

side as well so something like that and

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.580 
side as well so something like that and
it<00:03:17.989> same<00:03:18.170> thing<00:03:18.200> on<00:03:18.470> this<00:03:18.560> side<00:03:20.200> just<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.350> little

then something like this now the next

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.479 
then something like this now the next
step<00:03:32.450> is<00:03:32.660> pretty<00:03:32.870> self-explanatory<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:34.340> we're

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
step is pretty self-explanatory so we're

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.060 
step is pretty self-explanatory so we're
going<00:03:34.579> to<00:03:34.640> do<00:03:34.730> is<00:03:34.820> going<00:03:34.970> to<00:03:35.030> take<00:03:35.180> these<00:03:35.329> two
