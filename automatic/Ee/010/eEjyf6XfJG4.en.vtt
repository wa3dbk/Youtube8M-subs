00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.020
 from two different companies to 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.530
 check if the release code that 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.750
 has provided us daily because it is the 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.170
 right that will surely work 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.739
 without any problem 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.780
 good as you can see it is vodafone and 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.700
 I'm just going to turn off the terminal and 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.700
 let's proceed to 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:19.390
 enter a card of another operator 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.520
 and verify when the terminal 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.440
 I requested 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.320
 do not request 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.610
 the code can enter it to see if 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.710
 everything works correctly 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.500
 and there we introduce the card 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.730
 come on I put it on the cover let's give it 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.790
 march to see what happens 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.960
 meanwhile we will look for the mail that 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.960
 has facilitated tyranny 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.369
 with the code that we have here 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.570
 perfectly 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.750
 in short then good mobile is being 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.750
 starting 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.929
 is starting well asks us for the code 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.929
 pin 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.020
 and now he is asking us 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.810
 enter lock control key 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.590
 network 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.100
 and this is where we enter the number 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.880
 that you have provided us daily 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.880
 we'll see 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.560
 35 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.510
 it's 5 end 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.510
 and everything is unlocked 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.650
 unlocking concrete 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.959
 well this 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.040
 and warned in the mail that I could 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.040
 happen but what 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.900
 a colleague has taken me 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.450
 I'm going to pay 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.610
 and finish 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.980
 to start I'll try to make a 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.730
 call to see if it works 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.730
 correctly 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.120
 let's start 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.090
 more perfect 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.019
 the pin code is requested 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.439
 it does not tell us anymore it does not request any 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.870
 another unlock code obviously 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.550
 because the terminal is unlocked 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.880
 correctly 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:11.350
 here already indicates us 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:14.370
 I like a company because the quality 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.370
 from the camera very good 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.650
 and I will try to make a call 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.340
 to see if it actually works well 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.650
 - 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:40.870
 As you can see it sounds 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.870
 perfectly 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.460
 in order this is all 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.460
 it has worked perfectly
