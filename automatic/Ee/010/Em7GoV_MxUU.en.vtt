00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
your music on the watch and one thing I

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.189 
your music on the watch and one thing I
have<00:04:03.940> noticed<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.449> when<00:04:04.569> you<00:04:04.690> click<00:04:04.870> on<00:04:04.959> apps

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:05.199 
have noticed is when you click on apps

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.080 
have noticed is when you click on apps
it<00:04:05.379> does<00:04:05.530> take<00:04:05.829> a<00:04:05.859> few<00:04:05.949> seconds<00:04:06.579> to<00:04:06.699> load<00:04:06.729> for

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
it does take a few seconds to load for

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.490 
it does take a few seconds to load for
example<00:04:07.180> I've<00:04:07.510> hit<00:04:07.659> the<00:04:07.750> play<00:04:07.900> button<00:04:07.930> here

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
example I've hit the play button here

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.770 
example I've hit the play button here
there's<00:04:09.459> actually<00:04:09.579> a<00:04:09.819> tiny<00:04:10.239> bit<00:04:10.479> of<00:04:10.569> lag

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
there's actually a tiny bit of lag

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.780 
there's actually a tiny bit of lag
between<00:04:11.379> using<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.040> watch<00:04:12.220> and<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.579> phone

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
between using the watch and the phone

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.509 
between using the watch and the phone
which<00:04:13.629> is<00:04:13.870> not<00:04:14.349> too<00:04:14.560> surprising<00:04:14.709> since

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
which is not too surprising since

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.640 
which is not too surprising since
technically<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:16.419> watch<00:04:16.599> it<00:04:16.900> doesn't<00:04:17.560> have

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
technically the watch it doesn't have

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.710 
technically the watch it doesn't have
anything<00:04:17.889> on<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.459> it's<00:04:19.000> syncing<00:04:19.479> with<00:04:19.599> the

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
anything on it it's syncing with the

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.120 
anything on it it's syncing with the
phone<00:04:19.930> buttons<00:04:20.530> that's<00:04:20.680> a<00:04:20.739> quick<00:04:20.889> run<00:04:21.099> through

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
phone buttons that's a quick run through

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.500 
phone buttons that's a quick run through
a<00:04:21.280> couple<00:04:21.669> of<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:21.909> app<00:04:22.030> so<00:04:22.240> I'll<00:04:22.360> give<00:04:22.479> you

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.200 
849 dollars in Canada and hundred
dollars<00:04:41.800> less<00:04:41.950> in<00:04:41.979> the<00:04:42.159> US<00:04:42.430> which<00:04:42.969> is<00:04:43.000> so

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
dollars less in the US which is so

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.120 
dollars less in the US which is so
expensive<00:04:43.510> but<00:04:44.440> keep<00:04:44.620> in<00:04:44.770> mind<00:04:44.979> as<00:04:45.099> I

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
expensive but keep in mind as I

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.279 
expensive but keep in mind as I
mentioned<00:04:45.430> earlier<00:04:45.760> that

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
mentioned earlier that

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.540 
mentioned earlier that
you<00:04:46.349> know<00:04:46.439> you're<00:04:46.740> paying<00:04:46.860> a<00:04:47.009> lot<00:04:47.099> more<00:04:47.369> over

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
you know you're paying a lot more over

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.980 
you know you're paying a lot more over
the<00:04:47.759> silikal<00:04:48.119> model<00:04:48.360> you're<00:04:48.539> not<00:04:48.659> getting<00:04:48.869> any

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
the silikal model you're not getting any

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.659 
the silikal model you're not getting any
more<00:04:49.139> specs<00:04:49.469> than<00:04:49.619> stainless<00:04:50.069> on<00:04:50.219> any<00:04:50.520> other

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
more specs than stainless on any other

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.609 
more specs than stainless on any other
stainless<00:04:50.999> steel<00:04:51.149> model<00:04:51.330> so<00:04:51.629> it's<00:04:52.199> one<00:04:52.409> thing

00:04:52.609 --> 00:04:52.619 
stainless steel model so it's one thing

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:54.320 
stainless steel model so it's one thing
I<00:04:52.740> questioned<00:04:53.309> whether<00:04:53.339> really<00:04:53.909> if<00:04:53.999> it's

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
I questioned whether really if it's

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.399 
I questioned whether really if it's
worth<00:04:54.569> the<00:04:54.599> extra<00:04:54.779> few<00:04:55.110> hundred<00:04:55.139> dollars

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
worth the extra few hundred dollars

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:57.439 
worth the extra few hundred dollars
especially<00:04:55.830> for<00:04:56.249> the<00:04:56.339> stainless<00:04:56.699> steel<00:04:56.729> one

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
especially for the stainless steel one

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.299 
especially for the stainless steel one
with<00:04:57.629> the<00:04:57.839> links<00:04:58.349> there's<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.770> quick<00:04:58.979> look<00:04:59.189> at

00:04:59.299 --> 00:04:59.309 
with the links there's a quick look at

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:00.889 
with the links there's a quick look at
what<00:04:59.460> it<00:04:59.520> looks<00:04:59.550> like<00:04:59.819> on<00:04:59.969> my<00:04:59.999> skinny<00:05:00.599> arms

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:00.899 
what it looks like on my skinny arms

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:02.809 
what it looks like on my skinny arms
here<00:05:01.199> and<00:05:01.229> this<00:05:01.439> is<00:05:01.559> the<00:05:01.680> 30<00:05:01.949> millimeter<00:05:02.550> as<00:05:02.669> I

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
here and this is the 30 millimeter as I

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:04.670 
here and this is the 30 millimeter as I
mentioned<00:05:03.119> earlier<00:05:03.389> in<00:05:03.449> this<00:05:03.539> video<00:05:03.719> the<00:05:04.529> nice

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
mentioned earlier in this video the nice

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.350 
mentioned earlier in this video the nice
thing<00:05:04.830> about<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:05.129> classic<00:05:05.610> band<00:05:05.849> is<00:05:06.119> that

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
thing about the classic band is that

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.540 
thing about the classic band is that
it's<00:05:06.509> nice<00:05:06.719> and<00:05:06.960> secure<00:05:07.080> I<00:05:07.919> question<00:05:08.460> the

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
it's nice and secure I question the

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.519 
it's nice and secure I question the
magnetic<00:05:08.969> ones<00:05:09.149> on<00:05:09.330> how<00:05:09.539> easy<00:05:09.839> someone<00:05:10.319> could

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:10.529 
magnetic ones on how easy someone could

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:12.980 
magnetic ones on how easy someone could
remove<00:05:10.830> it<00:05:11.009> or<00:05:11.159> accidentally<00:05:11.789> fall<00:05:12.029> off<00:05:12.270> which

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
remove it or accidentally fall off which

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.379 
remove it or accidentally fall off which
hopefully<00:05:13.169> won't<00:05:13.349> happen<00:05:13.619> but<00:05:14.309> again<00:05:14.729> classic

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
hopefully won't happen but again classic

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.760 
hopefully won't happen but again classic
band<00:05:15.599> definitely<00:05:16.349> no<00:05:16.409> it's<00:05:16.529> going<00:05:16.649> to<00:05:16.710> be

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
band definitely no it's going to be

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.730 
band definitely no it's going to be
