00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.289
 hello this is my first tutorial 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:10.500
 explaining how we can model a helmet 

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:12.419
 of a sailing ship the general program 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.730
 the length ratio mandates say 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:19.050
 length width of sailboats 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.769
 it is in three to one or two and a peak 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.289
 a website to start modeling Basque 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.699
 We will start by starting from 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.800
 a box a box he has fixed us 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.230
 here on the left and a witness that we 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.600
 going to be saying the keys that we're going 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.760
 pressing if he ever spoke so 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.820
 fast that is not understood that we know 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.950
 that if we have pressed to that to that to 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.449
 press we have pressed a nosequé to 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.129
 whatever is ore we add a dry bucket 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.910
 very big we do it a little bit more 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.650
 small and we are more or less there in 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.280
 where are the three axes 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.130
 let's do that is we destroy with 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.309
 arrangement to the axis and that is this green axis 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:09.390
 the axes are x red green 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.830
 iceta blue bone rgb accordaros great 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.440
 green blue rgb is xyyz good 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.170
 we were along the axis and for that 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.540
 press the s key then the y key 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.270
 we take this, we are going to do it by eye 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.550
 since there are neither mathematical formulas nor 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.340
 good stories once we have you 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.920
 there points out today we are in object mode not 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.690
 we go to editing mode and we are 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.750
 select everything we 're going to 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.450
 Use the key to select and now we 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.690
 to make a series of cuts here as 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.060
 we make it very simple with the loop 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.670
 kutz but the best thing is that you remember in 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.170
 the famous control of the king controller and 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.350
 we already have one there and now we say 3 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.479
 and when we give enter it makes us three 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.460
 cuts this is going to be the test and this 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.890
 more in the stern 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.890
 let's see if we select this face 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:11.220
 We will destroy you without limiting any 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.920
 axis simply type the s key and 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.990
 we do a little bit like that and now with the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.920
 side view we get it by pressing 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.530
 the 3 key we raise a little in 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.840
 address to the z axis so that we stay 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.330
 more or less at the height of the cover 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.790
 what would this be up there 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.860
 well the aft part we're going to do 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.490
 exactly as we select 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.410
 we destroy a little less than the bow 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.440
 and now we are going to lift it in the direction 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.570
 to the vertical axis we rotate a little bit to 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.810
 that is the mirror so you know how you 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.730
 I say in this way of the boats to 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.170
 some the old and many ways we 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.819
 they take him here 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.500
 well well this is our basis for a 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.510
 sailboat man if any of 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.280
 you will say what the hell 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.280
 believe a lot to see here a ship of 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.430
 good candle do not worry about pressing 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.380
 here the edges let's point this out 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.670
 border and you have noticed that it has already 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:15.569
 result and we will throw it towards leh 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.640
 forward along the axis and ge and the 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.130
 we return like this the boats already have of candle 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.720
 formerly they had very thrown test and 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.239
 those of now are a little more vertical 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.980
 this is already to the liking of the good consumer 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.400
 what we 're going to modeling 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.730
 simple and basic we are afraid of 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.040
 faces and we select this is this and 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.330
 this other one and we make an extrusion to what 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.370
 long x axis ie sxy what 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.930
 we diminish as well as if we were to do 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.930
 a knife 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.790
 Well, once we have it there 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.350
 we select this this face that 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.780
 we select everything and select 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.060
 we have to be sure that this 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.330
 selection to which we select that 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.020
 key 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:02.260
 and extrusion along the z-axis a 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.810
 thing like that and we take it back to what 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.910
 long axis and 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.870
 it seems to me that we have passed and we are going to 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.840
 eta lift've done too much of 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:17.709
 counterbalance too much of centerboard that would be 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.320
 the technical name of that piece say 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.870
 well we still do not see a sailboat 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.510
 right now do not worry we press 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.669
 here in this key that is the modifier 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.560
 that has blender and one of them is the 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.529
 best of all and the one I like the most 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.619
 is this from your division to the surface 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:39.789
 a sailing ship a course really good 

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:41.479
 do not worry sailing ship good 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.789
 real ship 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.469
 omella is looking something like a boat 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.359
 candle of these forms is still a 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:49.969
 sailboat a little weird but not 

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:52.609
 worry controller rafts do not come 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:55.969
 here we raise this up there to the edge 

00:04:52.609 --> 00:04:58.909
 we did not come here we did control r here 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:01.159
 we do not come control r we put it here and 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:03.469
 this is already looking like a boat 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:05.869
 candle man is very panzón the truth 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:08.479
 that there is left me bread are all very 

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:10.789
 simple tell us to select everything 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:14.239
 with the be key we make a rectangle and 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:16.340
 we select all this and say that z 

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:19.190
 and nothing up 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.889
 and man is not an American Cup design 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.470
 but it can appear in the 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.090
 zone of the half flora had to put 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.250
 a little more demand and in everything that 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.880
 we do it with key we select 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:35.210
 all that and we destroy along the axis 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.790
 x sx and we got a little bit like that from 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:41.480
 manga very well 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.860
 in the part of the stern we go for the 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.190
 fin, then another one would have to be made 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.890
 little bit of more manga 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.580
 It seems good because we do the same thing 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.580
 that and x 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.650
 the test that has been left has been a bit 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.990
 done search well we're going here 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.960
 first of we select everything then 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.390
 we select that that by the way that if 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.729
 we are not selected this and that's what 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:12.659
 bad only this we did 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.659
 Y 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:21.210
 and we do that and X and we throw it 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:25.110
 little bit good is not wonderful but 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:28.080
 let's say this is a boat months a 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.449
 design is a basic design means 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.229
 that then everyone can do with the 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:36.509
 boat what seems best but is not 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:39.120
 a bad start we think I think 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:41.189
 this logically to remove these 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.719
 squares here that appear in very 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:47.400
 simple we have here and you give 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:52.060
 softened is and then it looks 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:54.450
 clearly you clearly see what 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.450
 and 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:00.850
 although this already has another story 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.560
 I insist is a basic and good design of 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.060
 what it was about was that starting from 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.010
 a cube we can do this way 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.770
 complex I already say using this 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.890
 Subdivision modifier 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:14.440
 surfaces good, nothing if you 

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:18.180
 liked to comment and tell me some 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.180
 cosilla to see what happens to them
