00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.240 
galaxy s6 edge and the Apple iPhone 6
here<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.250> these<00:00:18.029> are<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.510> our<00:00:18.840> drivers<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:19.800> we

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
here so these are to our drivers so we

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.630 
here so these are to our drivers so we
just<00:00:20.490> have<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.390> compare<00:00:22.199> them<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.920> detail

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
just have to compare them in detail

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.210 
just have to compare them in detail
right<00:00:23.970> now<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.630> first<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.500> all<00:00:25.590> let's<00:00:25.890> take<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
right now so first of all let's take a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.810 
right now so first of all let's take a
look<00:00:26.490> at<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.939> designs<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.510> these<00:00:27.720> handsets

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
look at the designs of these handsets

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.510 
look at the designs of these handsets
they're<00:00:29.820> kind<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.240> similar<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:31.520> quite

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
they're kind of similar to quite

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.670 
they're kind of similar to quite
different<00:00:33.149> quite<00:00:33.690> different<00:00:33.809> at<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.440> same

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
different quite different at the same

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.580 
different quite different at the same
time<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.309> they<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.480> look<00:00:36.630> at<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.989> front<00:00:37.260> sides

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
time so they can look at the front sides

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.799 
time so they can look at the front sides
of<00:00:37.829> these<00:00:37.980> devices<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:39.030> biggest<00:00:39.450> difference

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
of these devices the biggest difference

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.020 
of these devices the biggest difference
of<00:00:39.960> course<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:40.649> notice<00:00:41.040> right<00:00:41.070> away<00:00:41.340> is

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
of course we can notice right away is

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.200 
of course we can notice right away is

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
sensor now the backside Apple is taking

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.160 
sensor now the backside Apple is taking
two<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:34.140> an<00:01:34.290> aluminum<00:01:35.040> unibody<00:01:35.490> design<00:01:36.170> as

two with an aluminum unibody design as

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.670 
two with an aluminum unibody design as
you<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.530> see<00:01:37.800> it's<00:01:38.460> aluminum<00:01:38.970> but<00:01:39.530> Samsung<00:01:40.530> is

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
you can see it's aluminum but Samsung is

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.060 
you can see it's aluminum but Samsung is
actually<00:01:41.160> actually<00:01:41.490> object<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:43.380> glass

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
actually actually object to have a glass

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.090 
actually actually object to have a glass

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.030 
back camera for the galaxy s6 and the s6
edge<00:01:47.670> right<00:01:48.420> here<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.020> flat<00:01:49.200> glass

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040

edge right here so it's a flat glass
back<00:01:51.000> cover<00:01:51.300> the<00:01:51.840> downside<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.380> it

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
back cover the downside of it

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.370 
back cover the downside of it
the<00:01:53.430> biggest<00:01:54.060> downside<00:01:54.690> is<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.290> a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
the biggest downside is that it's a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.180 
the biggest downside is that it's a
fingerprint<00:01:55.890> magnet<00:01:56.250> really<00:01:56.910> but<00:01:57.979> it<00:01:58.979> also

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
fingerprint magnet really but it also

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.790 
fingerprint magnet really but it also
looks<00:01:59.490> quite<00:02:00.090> flashy<00:02:00.630> actually<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.740> very

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
looks quite flashy actually and very

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.270 
looks quite flashy actually and very
fancy<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.790> well<00:02:03.330> we<00:02:03.930> do<00:02:04.110> think<00:02:04.290> that

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
fancy so well we do think that

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.430 
fancy so well we do think that
the<00:02:05.520> same<00:02:05.760> here<00:02:06.120> so<00:02:08.539> in<00:02:09.539> terms<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.140> place

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
the same here so in terms of this place

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.600 
the same here so in terms of this place

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
like beer it's my point one inches

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.580 
like beer it's my point one inches

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
order to prove in terms of cameras so we

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.330 
order to prove in terms of cameras so we

straightforward

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730

more straightforward experience but one

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.270 
more straightforward experience but one
that<00:06:23.490> also<00:06:23.640> just<00:06:24.150> works<00:06:24.480> so<00:06:24.690> that's<00:06:25.020> a<00:06:25.320> benefit

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
that also just works so that's a benefit
