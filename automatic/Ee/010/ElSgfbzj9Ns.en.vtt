00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.740
 my purchases of products that I 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.049

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.260

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.730
 The day before yesterday when I bought the game I bought 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.490

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.489

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.010
 one 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.870
 you need to put them in the freezer in principle 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.210

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.730

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.930
 eat when you just stand with her on 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.050
 the place is kind of easy when you go and 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.359
 go long enough meters 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.700
 three hundred or four hundred here to say that nonsense 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.390

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.790
 grams about a little more than 14 kilograms 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:44.159
 go with them well, not very comfortable that is 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:47.000
 he kept this box and lay on top 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.409
 package with these dumplings with milk and 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.600
 brought together the most interesting thing today 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.229
 I saw in the department store I was doing everything my aunt 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.409
 order and 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.750
 and rolled a bottle a bottle of something there 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.299
 beer seems you are a summary unlikely she is there 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.100
 saw but it was a beer a hundred percent of it 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.810
 her eyes were red she sat rolling 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.580
 and at the same time punched people that horror 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.819
 some here in general, then I said he 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.120
 until that milk is cheap enough 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.340
 3990 ie 40 rubles 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.360
 and think up I drink a day somewhere 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.700
 one and a half liter 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.140
 sometimes it is 2 liters that is roughly 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.530
 saying two liters a day how not 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.510
 enough 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.879
 times two three 4 5 6 but say 7 days in 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.459
 week number more than a week for 10 days 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:34.590
 that's all that's enough for me here with you 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:37.629
