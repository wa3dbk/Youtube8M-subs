monday lunchtime and after the bridge
astounding<00:03:58.340> progress<00:03:58.760> really<00:03:59.390> very<00:03:59.569> good

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
astounding progress really very good

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:18.140 
astounding progress really very good
indeed

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.189 

it's<00:04:19.150> pretty<00:04:19.329> obvious<00:04:19.600> what<00:04:19.720> they're<00:04:20.079> now

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
it's pretty obvious what they're now

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.689 
it's pretty obvious what they're now
doing<00:04:20.259> they're<00:04:20.680> bringing<00:04:21.009> the<00:04:21.130> earth<00:04:21.340> down

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
doing they're bringing the earth down

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.719 
doing they're bringing the earth down
from<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.120> embankment<00:04:23.250> spreading<00:04:24.250> it<00:04:24.310> out<00:04:24.430> and

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
from the embankment spreading it out and

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.700 
from the embankment spreading it out and
then<00:04:24.759> this<00:04:25.080> compactor<00:04:26.080> comes<00:04:26.289> along<00:04:26.590> and

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
then this compactor comes along and

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.159 
then this compactor comes along and
pushes<00:04:26.979> it<00:04:27.100> down<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:28.210> they<00:04:28.570> started<00:04:28.930> over

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
pushes it down and they started over

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.730 
pushes it down and they started over
again<00:04:30.479> you<00:04:31.479> gradually<00:04:31.780> build<00:04:31.900> up<00:04:32.169> a<00:04:32.259> very<00:04:32.470> firm

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
again you gradually build up a very firm

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.279 
again you gradually build up a very firm
basilar<00:04:33.539> will<00:04:34.539> support<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.930> weight<00:04:35.080> of<00:04:35.110> the

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
basilar will support the weight of the

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:44.850 
basilar will support the weight of the
Flying<00:04:35.500> Scotsman<00:04:43.139> it<00:04:44.139> does<00:04:44.320> hopefully<00:04:44.500> mean

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
Flying Scotsman it does hopefully mean

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.560 
Flying Scotsman it does hopefully mean
that<00:04:44.979> most<00:04:45.130> of<00:04:45.190> these<00:04:45.280> embankment<00:04:45.850> will<00:04:46.090> soon

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
that most of these embankment will soon

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.710 
that most of these embankment will soon
disappear<00:04:48.120> then<00:04:49.120> of<00:04:49.240> course<00:04:49.270> they've<00:04:49.539> got<00:04:49.570> to

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
disappear then of course they've got to

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.409 
disappear then of course they've got to
start<00:04:49.900> on<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.080> very<00:04:50.229> big<00:04:50.410> one<00:04:50.590> which<00:04:50.830> is<00:04:51.419> those

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
start on the very big one which is those

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:58.620 
start on the very big one which is those
you<00:04:52.600> don't<00:04:52.840> know<00:04:53.020> over<00:04:54.010> there

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.970 

that's<00:04:59.140> the<00:04:59.230> other<00:04:59.320> side<00:04:59.560> of<00:04:59.650> him<00:04:59.770> for<00:04:59.860> home

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
that's the other side of him for home

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.620 
that's the other side of him for home
bridge<00:05:00.570> so<00:05:01.570> there's<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:01.900> mountain<00:05:02.350> and<00:05:03.630> then

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
bridge so there's the mountain and then

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.830 
bridge so there's the mountain and then
they're<00:05:04.870> going<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.050> put<00:05:05.170> it<00:05:05.290> all<00:05:05.380> in<00:05:05.590> and

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
they're going to put it all in and

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.460 
they're going to put it all in and
that's<00:05:07.840> where<00:05:07.990> they're<00:05:08.080> actually<00:05:08.170> working

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
that's where they're actually working

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.870 
that's where they're actually working
