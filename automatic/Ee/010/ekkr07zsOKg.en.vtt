00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.340 
sushi rice and the gray come from my
hometown<00:02:03.820> so<00:02:04.330> this<00:02:04.990> is<00:02:05.140> my<00:02:05.350> mother's<00:02:05.770> gift<00:02:07.350> so

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
hometown so this is my mother's gift so

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.270 
hometown so this is my mother's gift so
this<00:02:09.040> amount<00:02:09.550> this<00:02:10.420> is<00:02:10.720> just<00:02:11.230> for<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.620> fatty

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
this amount this is just for the fatty

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.810 
this amount this is just for the fatty
tuna

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
tuna

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.300 
tuna
so<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:13.750> fatty<00:02:14.050> tuna<00:02:14.350> this<00:02:14.770> is<00:02:14.830> one<00:02:15.130> of<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
so this fatty tuna this is one of the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.470 
so this fatty tuna this is one of the
most<00:02:15.520> highest<00:02:15.820> fat

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
most highest fat

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.780 
most highest fat
Pontus<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.700> then<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:19.020> roll<00:02:20.020> over<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.520> just

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
Pontus and then a roll over this is just

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.860 
Pontus and then a roll over this is just
mixed<00:02:22.209> and<00:02:22.330> roll

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
mixed and roll

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:32.370 
mixed and roll
so<00:02:23.020> this<00:02:23.380> is<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.620> lower<00:02:24.160> sushi<00:02:30.450> when<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.660> have

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
so this is a lower sushi when you have
