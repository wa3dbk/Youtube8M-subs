00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
like a lot and i'm going to die MIT here

appears to be right it's got Grover's on

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.760 
appears to be right it's got Grover's on
it<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:55.330> as<00:02:56.330> far<00:02:56.540> as<00:02:56.600> hearing<00:02:57.020> it<00:02:57.140> clean<00:02:57.470> and

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770
