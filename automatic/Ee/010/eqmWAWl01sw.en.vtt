00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.420
 hello nerds and access to the games here who 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.730
 talk is the fall and today we are going to do 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.580
 Something a little different for you here. 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.980
 that will continue going forward one 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.130
 Some PC or mounting tabs 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.140
 buy only this time it will be an amd guide 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.930
 and in the future we will make some 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.700
 nvidia and vice versa only with 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.579
 nvidia and intel processors 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.950
 amd with nitin region board my understand 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.120
 and today we are going to build a pc 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.250
 basically for those who have the pocket 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.050
 tight and I want to have a game machine and 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.850
 function that should edit video and everything 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.410
 more without spending too much 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.440
 ok then this machine will battle around 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.329
 of R $ 1,500, depending on 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.050
 availability of the parts you 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.839
 meet 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.730
 so let's start with our 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.069
 assembly or choose a motherboard as well 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.620
 Basic Basic that even we are trying 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:06.120
 tightening here will spend on the most 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.790
 important here then if you do not go 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.450
 need an expansion where several 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.510
 video cards you go with the gigabyte 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.100
 68m mts2 upright socket am3 that is from 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.780
 our supporter that we did not choose you 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.630
 see ready in the next 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.810
 she always prayed ddr3 of coca until 3 and 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.490
 33 mega-hertz ok it's got two lots 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.320
 only that it has a maximum limit of eight 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.740
 gigas so I recommend you buy two 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.630
 4gb days or one of 18 chic but me 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.750
 I recommend you take the lots and you will have 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.899
 more performance it has a controller 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.329
 video up to 13 thousand and is the technician 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.000
 audio snake even standard who thinks 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:49.079
 which brings a 2.0 slot here and a PCI slot 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.979
 express in a pc and normal who are the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.460
 processors 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.020
 the processor is an act one x 2 270 is one 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.939
 of a generation as much as 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.009
 former only that his performance by the 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.520
 price if you will not find anywhere 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.649
 nothing like that at all. 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.140
 it is a dual core processor or who 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.360
 it has two meters of quay 43.4 of 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.190
 work island networks to overclock one 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.790
 a certain way the people's work 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.500
 cope 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.970
 so you can pull a good one 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.650
 performance the viewer only I 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.080
 I recommend that if you do the cut 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.300
 really in spc jeopardize cooler o 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.760
 that this involves more spending here but 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.099
 is to keep in stock at standard will 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.520
 since as such you will not be 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.110
 regret 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.660
 Ok it's great, even if we go to the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.690
 ram ram i choose something well 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.090
 basic nothing to not lose the price more 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.520
 what time ddr3 ram is in fact that 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.740
 They are usually a little expensive here then 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.030
 you will get a 4gb ddr3 of 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.280
 kingston is 13 33% and 44 defend where you 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.670
 buy what this average because I found 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.980
 price in stores here the performance 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.090
 She will not have it for anyone but you. 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.280
 You will not need it any more here. 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.340
 few games plus four gigs here I 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.500
 I recommend in the future you put 88 x ac 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.060
 but to keep this price a thousand and 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.400
 five hundred reais was necessary to place 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.240
 only 41 3015 know the most standard model 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.220
 that you will find whoever you want by 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.290
 other brand eg two of four 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.540
 steed gigas you can because only 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.690
 you will not be able to enjoy the 1600mhz 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.450
 edson 1018 my she pack the ram 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.220
 because this card supports up to 13 33 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.320
 here then I recommend season two of 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.400
 four days out of 33 more to keep the 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.830
 Our humble is cheap so only four 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.680
 here on the video card that I 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.000
 I decided to invest heavily what it is I go 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.180
 give two options here in this video 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.850
 chosen the region 77 70 came by ex 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.620
 this failure because it partly arises because 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.390
 She has two fans so you can 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.030
 to overclock this board it has a 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.680
 video game just because it's not going to do 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.830
 a lot of difference few games do not require 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.280
 more with g memory that has 128 bits 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.500
 of PCI Express data traffic has 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.690
 hdmi displayport port 22 port 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.510
 the link should and should go all 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.270
 selections known is the other pac 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.950
 would recommend it would be 78 50 only this 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.700
 involves a hundred more reais here you will get 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:18.630
 a good performance is even more a 650 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:22.169
 but for the price of 490 reais to 7 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:25.800
 71% Supports very good is a very port 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:30.950
 It's good to be able to play four games on 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:33.450
 medium high not clear not fall from 30 is 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.490
 Face this plate 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.500
 I do not know what else to say to her because 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.050
 She's at her cost , you will not find it. 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.259
 nothing in this book nothing at 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.810
 never in a universe that we go to 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:47.550
 storage only that hd or choose 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.550
 western digital caviar duke is the most 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.759
 so solid hard disk standard 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.879
 kids club hard drive and amenities 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:59.490
 magnetic here is not if it has 500 gb 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:03.000
 storage box has a box of six 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:06.150
 mega 7200rpm then on a better hd than 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.060
 this you will not find what you 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.509
 want to jump to exercise in the future but 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.849
 you are carlos but whatever the 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.259
 cost-benefit ratio of the most has been 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.629
 more reliable you can have more where 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.909
 I'm one of the best-known 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:23.879
 with a good performance 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:25.199
 so for machines for games also 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:27.840
 you will be able to tinker with the exception of 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:30.270
 future touch but for games fifth game 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.219
 It's good, I was going in a way that will not 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.740
 lose any games here so it's 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:36.509
 quiet and now it was mourning here 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.340
 that the pv is a little I said so let's go 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:41.129
 invest a little more in the source because 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.620
 Are you mounting pmdb to even 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.940
 video card and find non safari 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.039
 we chose it pulls a little bit more 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.300
 force I think she needs 400 but I 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.419
 I'm already thinking about the processor and everything 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.759
 and more so if you want to make is 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.509
 next to fall at the end new arrears of 2 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:59.370
 77 can do here but develop and 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:00.990
 change the motherboard then but finally I 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.969
 I got over 600 votes because 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.460
 You will have strength to spare and will not 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:10.199
 to win anything here in mt pulls much more 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:12.629
 that the fans are already 94 then 64 I found 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.909
 a very good price $ 217 I found the 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:16.800
 source 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:18.629
 I found this network source next to it 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.810
 has certified 80 plants he has 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:24.150
 even 64 efficiency are real here then 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.009
 you will have plenty of energy until you switch 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.300
 only in the future keep the source knows at the time 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:30.270
 to worry about nothing 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:34.159
 and to finish our god I chose 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:40.409
 a cabinet of the hollow era testifies gtm 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:42.690
 523 It's beautiful, there's plenty of room for your 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:44.669
 hd video card a lot and 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.490
 really beautiful aesthetic of him is beautiful 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:49.830
 He is all handsome white and everything and by 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.129
 stretch er $ 90 serious face - ninety reals 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:55.309
 it's very little for a cabinet 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:57.020
 It's pretty good to know it has got usb port 

00:06:55.309 --> 00:07:01.999
 entered a team that was no longer 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:06.009
 3,000 Chinese shops in the morning that mpx 

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:08.479
 we chose that she is a friend then a 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:10.369
 basically it comes with a fan I guess 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:11.869
 who does not come with a fan has to stay 

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:14.959
 version that is buying us more 

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:19.249
 It has not come to 5 over 2 hours 25 minutes 

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:21.289
 of 125 - then to finalize this 

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:23.419
 angle the parts market of fondling 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:25.399
 with an average of 1,500 depending on where 

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:27.769
 you buy you can reach 1600 or 

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:28.490
 1,400 moment depends very much on where you 

00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:30.740
 go buy 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.929
 I recommend you buy direct from stores 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:36.289
 the visa you end up saving a 

00:07:32.929 --> 00:07:38.599
 good money about 300 because that is 

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:41.479
 Our first kiss will gmd 

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:44.679
 cheaper wines here with up to 11 

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:47.449
 when it was as much as possible and 

00:07:44.679 --> 00:07:49.369
 constructions of very expensive 

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:53.059
 4,500 and 5,000 reais for those who do not have the 

00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:55.219
 pocket not even a shallow end 

00:07:53.059 --> 00:07:56.929
 so that's hope is in you 

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:58.669
 near the medical area for those who like 

00:07:56.929 --> 00:07:59.809
 of this collection of pieces 

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:02.029
 shopping guide 

00:07:59.809 --> 00:08:06.039
 so this is the next to the middle area 

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:06.039
 Until then, he said bye
