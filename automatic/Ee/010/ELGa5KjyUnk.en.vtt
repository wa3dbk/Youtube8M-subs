00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.930
 hello and welcome each 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.960
 decides hardware and software 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:20.980
 reviews today with the last video for 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.320
 song phoenix project server picture lok on 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.270
 my channel and first I want 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.630
 Thanks to you for being up to 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:32.349
 This sport followed me on time 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:35.470
 away to your own home server image and as 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.559
 First I want you again 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.650
 remember what we have seen so far 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.739
 We have that first thing 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.800
 seen as the cpu in the case 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.350
 Intel processor on an asus mainboard 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.229
 the word was built in the times or 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.550
 the first part of the second part sets 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.600
 Then get together from the installation 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.430
 of the main memory or short 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.890
 in the third part we saw 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.239
 as the location intel boxed cooler 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.640
 was built 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.830
 actually planned was another cool 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.650
 we were the way further doc rock pro 2 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.950
 the pastoral for reasons of space in the 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.270
 bitfenix housing not pure 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.090
 So what did we see then? 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.789
 then the installation of hard drives 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.829
 with the tool the system was with little 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:28.030
 seen of course for the bitfenix 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:30.340
 project team we have the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.369
 Institutions of the mainboard in the housing 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.030
 See what was a little tricky too 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.810
 film 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.640
 but you have certainly seen that 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.030
 then it went on already 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.750
 with the power adapter when I am now 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.460
 not exactly with the power supply that 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.369
 installing a network in the BitFenix 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.409
 Product housing without modular 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.210
 cable management 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.310
 Everything went wonderfully and afterwards 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.130
 already followed the wiring 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.799
 all components are called the 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.929
 power cables and cabling from sata 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.880
 devices etc 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.800
 yes, as I have noticed, I have 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.800
 extra now the wiring of the 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.900
 left out in the front 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.990
 for the simple reason that the whole 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.760
 quite difficult to film and here 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.890
 you would have seen almost nothing 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.700
 there the 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.390
 To dispensers was the possibility that 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.670
 to film 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.260
 but very limited was therefore references 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.030
 I'll make you one here 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.459
 Another video for a very long time 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.880
 my channel online is where it is 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.130
 the front panel cabling goes and 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.290
 that would be the point of events for me 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.630
 front panel wiring thus 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.220
 completed 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.630
 yes we just start here now 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.180
 with a round trip or a few 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.330
 optical impressions with phoenix 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.540
 prodigy housing first that's one 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.540
 mini itx housing so there fits only 1x 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.290
 mainboard pure what we are right now 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.730
 will see more of an unboxing and 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.959
 Review on this trip is also on 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.840
 I left you my channel from left 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.910
 of course in the description 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.730
 Here we see the housing especially 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.890
 open from different angles 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.890
 Everything seems very tidy that can 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.230
 you organize everything so well that 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.730
 that works must be very much space 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.430
 for cable management in this very much 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:32.850
 small housing and here we have now 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:37.320
 First of all the position for one 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.310
 few information about the mainboard cpu and 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.370
 the working memory 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:48.060
 here we see the asus 8 77 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.160
 mainboard the e is for a video too 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.549
 of course, there is also the board 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.290
 a very soon on my channel 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.760
 special board a very small word 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.850
 of course suitable for this bitfenix 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.510
 housing offers all the features like one 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.970
 full atx board and is thus 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.650
 also perfectly adequate and perfect 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.870
 suitable 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.880
 yes next we have this here 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.310
 RAM We have two rules 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:19.650
 makes four gigabytes of kingston 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:21.720
 total 8 gb ddr3 1333 march module 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.870
 absolutely enough for a server 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.780
 or 1 homeserver and further see 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.550
 Here's the Intel Pentium processor 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.380
 Of course we do not see here but 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.350
 we only see the intel boxed cooler 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.840
 Among them is the intel pentium ii 860 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:40.440
 Processor that is a cpu of the sandy 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.270
 bridge architecture so 200 signals 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.810
 meter manufacturing it is a dual core 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.140
 processor with 3.0 gigahertz without 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.390
 hyperthreading and an intel hd graphic 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:54.600
 the boxed cooler one sees exactly and 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.100
 at nothing yet another fan 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.310
 this place we see now in total 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.280
 five hard drives in 3.5 inch format 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.570
 the lowest one contains a windows 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.880
 operating system 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.060
 the other four are pure data 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.160
 plates an additional hard disk 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.460
 sixth would be that then I could be in the fifth 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.270
 simple inch drive shaft obstruct 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.860
 so I would have him together 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.560
 possibility of six hard disks too 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.630
 operate necessary needs provided that 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.320
 the mainboard from so many sata 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:28.010
 Connections also has to see here 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:33.330
 power supply we have a power supply of 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:36.180
 sonic with 430 watts without modular cable 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:40.260
 construction or cable management but what 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:44.340
 Here, too, would be completely useless 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:46.530
 this server and i think that now 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.050
 at this point to this picture blog 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.300
 have now been final 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.170
 Of course I thank you for your help 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.330
 watch 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:57.240
 I'm glad you're mine 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.620
 followed so far and yes maybe 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.370
 could i help you with yours 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.870
 computer construction or home server construction and yes 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.830
 if you have questions write me that 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.540
 simply by pn on facebook or youtube 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.660
 there is this function and yes 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.220
 the annotation box will start easily 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.360
 it is full and it is not anymore 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:21.530
 clear and yes I think that 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.530
 his skin has been clean
