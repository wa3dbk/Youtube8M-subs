from<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.340> hips<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.649> transverse<00:02:05.399> plane

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
from the hips so this transverse plane

really<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:08.009> eight<00:02:08.190> board<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.899> it's<00:02:09.899> very

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
really is the eight board and it's very

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.390 
really is the eight board and it's very
important<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:10.920> physical<00:02:11.310> therapy<00:02:11.819> whereby
