00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
to be able to get these here I only have

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.630 
to be able to get these here I only have
two<00:03:36.700> slots<00:03:36.970> left<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.840> aren't<00:03:38.530> filled<00:03:38.800> which

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
two slots left that aren't filled which

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.190 
two slots left that aren't filled which
I'll<00:03:39.820> eventually<00:03:40.090> be<00:03:40.360> able<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.780> get<00:03:40.900> a<00:03:40.930> couple

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
I'll eventually be able to get a couple

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
these and that was pretty lucky because

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.890 
these and that was pretty lucky because
you<00:03:45.580> don't<00:03:45.730> see<00:03:45.880> these<00:03:46.060> games<00:03:46.360> every<00:03:46.870> day

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
you don't see these games every day

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.140

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
you'll see the original ones that

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.940 
you'll see the original ones that
normally<00:03:49.720> come<00:03:49.900> with<00:03:50.050> this<00:03:50.200> like<00:03:50.410> wild<00:03:50.709> gunman

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
normally come with this like wild gunman

and Pro Wrestling in baseball even the
mahjong<00:03:54.310> one<00:03:54.550> is<00:03:54.670> quite<00:03:54.880> common<00:03:55.750> but<00:03:55.959> these

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
mahjong one is quite common but these

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.590 
mahjong one is quite common but these
three<00:03:56.739> here<00:03:57.010> are<00:03:57.160> a<00:03:57.190> little<00:03:57.459> bit<00:03:57.580> more<00:03:57.880> rare<00:03:58.180> so

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
three here are a little bit more rare so

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.690 
three here are a little bit more rare so

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
seems to be pretty nice awesome works

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.050 
seems to be pretty nice awesome works
out<00:04:16.510> pretty<00:04:16.690> good<00:04:17.609> wrecking<00:04:18.609> crew<00:04:18.640> is<00:04:18.910> one

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
that I've wanted for quite some time but

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.810 
that I've wanted for quite some time but
every<00:04:23.620> time<00:04:23.770> I<00:04:23.830> come<00:04:24.010> across<00:04:24.130> it<00:04:24.490> it's<00:04:24.610> pretty

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
every time I come across it it's pretty

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.790 
every time I come across it it's pretty
expensive<00:04:25.060> normally<00:04:25.900> these<00:04:26.080> games<00:04:26.410> will<00:04:26.620> cost

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
expensive normally these games will cost

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.710 
expensive normally these games will cost
about<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.900> want<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:28.990> say<00:04:29.110> about<00:04:29.260> 6000<00:04:30.190> yen<00:04:30.310> each

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
about I want to say about 6000 yen each

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.320 
about I want to say about 6000 yen each
but<00:04:31.720> I<00:04:32.229> was<00:04:32.590> lucky<00:04:32.979> enough<00:04:33.010> to<00:04:33.250> come<00:04:34.090> across

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
but I was lucky enough to come across

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.409 
but I was lucky enough to come across
these<00:04:34.810> ones<00:04:35.080> for<00:04:35.380> about<00:04:35.770> I<00:04:36.190> think<00:04:36.700> it<00:04:36.970> cost<00:04:37.180> me

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
these ones for about I think it cost me

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.440 
these ones for about I think it cost me
maybe<00:04:38.200> three<00:04:38.470> thousand<00:04:38.979> again<00:04:39.490> for<00:04:40.030> each<00:04:40.150> game

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
maybe three thousand again for each game

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.740 
maybe three thousand again for each game
so<00:04:41.320> not<00:04:41.919> too<00:04:42.100> bad<00:04:42.130> and<00:04:42.640> it's<00:04:43.120> about<00:04:43.240> half<00:04:43.510> price

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
so not too bad and it's about half price

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.070 
so not too bad and it's about half price
for<00:04:43.870> these<00:04:44.200> but<00:04:45.060> yeah<00:04:46.090> nonetheless<00:04:46.450> you<00:04:46.930> can

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
for these but yeah nonetheless you can

for these but yeah nonetheless you can
see<00:04:47.320> that<00:04:47.530> it's<00:04:48.400> working<00:04:48.880> here<00:04:49.120> let's<00:04:49.390> reset

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990
