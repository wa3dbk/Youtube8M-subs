27<00:00:40.770> plus<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.430> very<00:00:41.640> similar<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.969> 29<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:43.050> let's

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
27 plus it's very similar to 29 so let's

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.440 
27 plus it's very similar to 29 so let's
take<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> closer<00:00:43.890> look<00:00:44.129> at<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.460> genius<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.239> see

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
take a closer look at the genius to see

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.630 
take a closer look at the genius to see
what<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:45.780> all<00:00:45.899> about<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.440> see<00:00:46.920> why<00:00:47.129> Scott

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
what it's all about and see why Scott

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.760 
what it's all about and see why Scott
I've<00:00:47.820> invested<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.390> much<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:49.260> launch<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
I've invested so much in launch and a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:01:00.139 
I've invested so much in launch and a
full<00:00:49.980> range<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.399> 27<00:00:50.910> points<00:00:51.120> 5<00:00:51.270> plus<00:00:51.510> bi

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.450 

so<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.809> new<00:01:00.960> boost<00:01:01.350> standard<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.190> something

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
so this new boost standard is something

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.979 
so this new boost standard is something
that<00:01:02.610> track<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.180> surround<00:01:03.480> worked<00:01:03.809> on

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
that track and surround worked on

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.980 
that track and surround worked on
originally<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.920> its<00:01:05.610> 110<00:01:06.240> mil<00:01:06.510> wide<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
originally in its 110 mil wide on the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.899 
originally in its 110 mil wide on the
front<00:01:07.320> compared<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> normal<00:01:08.130> hundred<00:01:08.729> mil

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
front compared to a normal hundred mil

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.330 
front compared to a normal hundred mil
wide<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:10.200> off<00:01:10.380> see<00:01:10.530> you've<00:01:10.710> got<00:01:10.830> these<00:01:10.950> Fox

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
wide so off see you've got these Fox

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.120 
wide so off see you've got these Fox
fork<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.330> extra<00:01:12.780> width<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.830> brand

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
fork in that extra width it's a brand

new 3400 10 mil 148 on the rear that
extra<00:01:18.690> width<00:01:18.869> Oz<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.380> gives<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.830> clear

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
extra width Oz it gives you that clear

extra width Oz it gives you that clear
into<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.520> tires<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.509> also<00:01:21.659> that's<00:01:22.050> given

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
into the tires but also that's given

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.260 
into the tires but also that's given
this<00:01:22.680> angle<00:01:23.190> for<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.369> spokes<00:01:23.670> gives<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.240> a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
this angle for the spokes gives you a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.090 
this angle for the spokes gives you a
stiffer<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.869> stronger<00:01:25.080> wheel<00:01:25.350> plus<00:01:25.770> size

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
stiffer and stronger wheel plus size

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.149 
stiffer and stronger wheel plus size
wheels<00:01:26.490> also<00:01:26.820> come<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.450> much<00:01:27.750> wider<00:01:28.229> rims<00:01:28.890> on

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
wheels also come with much wider rims on

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.999 
wheels also come with much wider rims on
there<00:01:29.840> obviously<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.020> lot<00:01:31.320> more<00:01:31.500> volume<00:01:31.799> for

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
there obviously a lot more volume for

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.740 
there obviously a lot more volume for
these<00:01:32.250> tires<00:01:32.550> sort<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.060> height<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.509> width

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
these tires sort of height and width

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.499 
these tires sort of height and width
that<00:01:34.679> gives<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> lot<00:01:35.490> more<00:01:35.520> rubber<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.060> for

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
that gives you a lot more rubber on for

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.560 
that gives you a lot more rubber on for
so<00:01:36.899> increased<00:01:37.470> traction<00:01:38.149> but<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.270> rolling

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
so increased traction but the rolling

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.359 
so increased traction but the rolling
resistance<00:01:39.660> is<00:01:40.110> almost<00:01:40.410> identical<00:01:40.619> which<00:01:41.220> is

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
resistance is almost identical which is

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.919 
resistance is almost identical which is
definitely<00:01:41.610> worth<00:01:41.970> noting<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.509> they

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
definitely worth noting that they

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.859 
definitely worth noting that they
recognized<00:01:43.320> only<00:01:43.440> about<00:01:43.679> 1%<00:01:44.220> slower<00:01:45.060> with

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
recognized only about 1% slower with

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.050 
recognized only about 1% slower with
this<00:01:46.080> big<00:01:46.320> tire<00:01:46.560> compared<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> normal<00:01:47.340> 27

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
this big tire compared to a normal 27

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.149 
this big tire compared to a normal 27
1/2<00:01:48.240> inch<00:01:48.450> tire<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.110> that's<00:01:49.710> really<00:01:49.950> really

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
1/2 inch tire so that's really really

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.999 
1/2 inch tire so that's really really
similar<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:51.000> large<00:01:51.240> tires<00:01:52.050> come<00:01:52.530> from<00:01:52.770> sound

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
similar the large tires come from sound

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.580 
similar the large tires come from sound
volume<00:01:53.460> gives<00:01:54.300> you<00:01:54.450> those<00:01:54.569> same<00:01:54.899> advances<00:01:55.470> you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
volume gives you those same advances you

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.859 
volume gives you those same advances you
get<00:01:55.800> with<00:01:55.950> 29er<00:01:56.460> from<00:01:56.789> rolling<00:01:57.210> over<00:01:57.360> things<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
get with 29er from rolling over things a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.240 
get with 29er from rolling over things a
little<00:01:57.960> bit<00:01:58.140> better<00:01:58.319> over<00:01:58.679> those<00:01:58.920> smaller

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
little bit better over those smaller

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.520 
little bit better over those smaller
bumps<00:01:59.550> so<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.179> the<00:02:00.300> back<00:02:00.509> end<00:02:00.869> you've<00:02:01.140> got<00:02:01.170> that

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
bumps so on the back end you've got that

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.169 
bumps so on the back end you've got that
extra<00:02:01.590> width<00:02:02.100> as<00:02:02.310> well<00:02:02.340> obviously<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:03.030> means

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
extra width as well obviously that means

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.719 
extra width as well obviously that means
everything<00:02:03.780> at<00:02:03.929> 3<00:02:04.259> mil<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.369> cassettes

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
everything at 3 mil so the cassettes

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.999 
everything at 3 mil so the cassettes
it's<00:02:06.060> 3<00:02:06.599> mil<00:02:06.869> wider<00:02:07.229> than<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.709> would<00:02:07.860> on<00:02:07.890> a

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
it's 3 mil wider than it would on a

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.999 
it's 3 mil wider than it would on a
normal<00:02:08.099> bike<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.899> maintain<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.500> same

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
normal bike and to maintain that same

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.860 
normal bike and to maintain that same
q-factor<00:02:11.670> what<00:02:12.180> they've<00:02:12.360> done<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.720> they've

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
q-factor what they've done is they've

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.809 
q-factor what they've done is they've
got<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.020> special<00:02:13.349> boost<00:02:13.830> chain<00:02:14.250> ring<00:02:14.489> that<00:02:14.670> also

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
got a special boost chain ring that also

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.270 
got a special boost chain ring that also
moves<00:02:15.209> at<00:02:15.450> 3<00:02:15.750> mils<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.260> chain<00:02:16.500> line<00:02:16.739> still

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
moves at 3 mils the chain line still

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.190 
moves at 3 mils the chain line still
works<00:02:17.489> as<00:02:17.760> normal<00:02:18.150> still<00:02:18.420> really<00:02:18.780> nice<00:02:18.900> chain

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
works as normal still really nice chain

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.470 
works as normal still really nice chain
line<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:19.680> this<00:02:19.830> front<00:02:20.129> and<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.730> genius<00:02:20.970> plus

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
line so this front and the genius plus

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.410 
line so this front and the genius plus
is<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.260> same<00:02:22.470> as<00:02:22.770> their<00:02:23.129> genius<00:02:23.550> 29<00:02:24.180> inch

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
is that the same as their genius 29 inch

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.720 
is that the same as their genius 29 inch
but<00:02:25.170> obviously<00:02:25.590> you've<00:02:25.770> got<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:26.160> special

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
but obviously you've got this special

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.930 
but obviously you've got this special
wider<00:02:27.420> rear<00:02:27.780> end<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.319> fit<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:28.950> bigger<00:02:29.640> tire

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
wider rear end to fit that bigger tire

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.270 
wider rear end to fit that bigger tire
and<00:02:30.420> extra<00:02:30.900> width<00:02:31.050> on<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.379> back<00:02:31.560> obviously

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
and extra width on the back obviously

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.220 
and extra width on the back obviously
match<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:33.030> wider<00:02:33.239> fork<00:02:33.540> on<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.780> front<00:02:34.020> but

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
match that wider fork on the front but

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.830 
match that wider fork on the front but
this<00:02:34.379> is<00:02:34.620> their<00:02:35.160> standard<00:02:35.430> 29<00:02:36.030> inch<00:02:36.239> front<00:02:36.629> end

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
this is their standard 29 inch front end

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.350 
this is their standard 29 inch front end
so<00:02:37.230> they're<00:02:37.410> Scott's<00:02:37.920> new<00:02:38.190> range<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.550> 27<00:02:39.150> plus

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
so they're Scott's new range of 27 plus

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.210 
so they're Scott's new range of 27 plus
