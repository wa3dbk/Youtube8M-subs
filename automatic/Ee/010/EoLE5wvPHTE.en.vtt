00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.340
 Hello This time we made a trap using a trap chest 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.340
 It falls when I open it like this 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:27.539
 If you say what happens to Cairo 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:32.669
 First of all, this repeater sends a signal from the trap chest to the doctor. 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:36.060
 And this is why it is output to the adhesive piston 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.570
 Let's make it from the beginning 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:44.580
 It is four squares that become a pitfall this time 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:50.240
 If I say even 3 masu but that was opened from 3 Masuda and far away 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.240
 And the high made of four trout may not fall 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.579
 By putting a red stone torch here 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.579
 I will color it 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.220
 I think 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.060
 helped 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.060
 Here Place repeater 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.799
 The rest is ok if you play Akaishi up to the trap chest 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:40.619
 Let's be careful about the direction of the repeater put here 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:44.880
 Since the repeater here is the output from the trap chest, from the trap chest side 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:49.070
 Please set up a trap chest here 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.780
 In this way the circuit is activated and opened 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:58.409
 This is roughly finished this 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.409
 After that, let's hide the circuit by surrounding it as usual 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:16.530
 Actually there is a drawback in this situation 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:19.430
 It feels like it doesn't fall off when it gets close to the trap chest and opened 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:24.590
 It will fall if it is only a little away 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:30.970
 I would like to put an iron grate in front of the trap chest 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.970
 It will not come close to the last minute, so it will fall unless it is destroyed 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.230
 Well there is only one story here only capture 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.250
 Say something 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.170
 There is a place that can be opened without falling 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.170
 This is the range of Hana 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.409
 The circuit went crazy when I dug a little 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.849
 I guess it's sticking piston offset 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.230
 I'll repair 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:36.730
 It does not fall if it does at this last-minute position with this 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:43.210
 Well why because you fell surely if the person is your trout want to anymore becomes longer passage 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:46.920
 4 I think it is good I will try to actually use it here 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.920
 It is like the ruins 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.350
 Here is a real chest 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.830
 I 'm jealous 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.570
 I think that it is good to use it for dungeons like this 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.880
 Thank you for your viewing
