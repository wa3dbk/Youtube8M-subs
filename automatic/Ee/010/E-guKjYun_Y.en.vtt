think<00:03:24.150> that's<00:03:24.390> called<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:25.049> upper<00:03:25.739> water<00:03:26.099> line

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
think that's called the upper water line

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.750 
think that's called the upper water line

and then I also go along my upper lash

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.869 
and then I also go along my upper lash
line<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.510> kind<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:30.930> wing<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.260> out<00:03:31.530> into<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:32.519> cat

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
line and kind of wing it out into a cat

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.750

eye<00:03:32.909> kind<00:03:33.629> of<00:03:33.750> thing<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.950> I<00:03:35.190> blend<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:35.640> out
