00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
here is a world war 2 lotting anti-tank

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.200 
here is a world war 2 lotting anti-tank
weapon<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.219> started<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.850> all<00:00:33.000> along

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
weapon and this is started it all along

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.790 
weapon and this is started it all along
and<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:34.230> was<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.649> originally<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> armored

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
and this was the originally the armored

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.260 
and this was the originally the armored
vehicles<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.920> very<00:00:38.129> thin<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.969> can<00:00:39.120> have<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
vehicles is very thin so you can have a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.880 
vehicles is very thin so you can have a
shoulder-fired<00:00:39.690> rifle<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.440> would<00:00:40.590> take<00:00:40.739> out

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
shoulder-fired rifle that would take out

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.250 
shoulder-fired rifle that would take out
tanks<00:00:41.219> now<00:00:42.059> as<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.390> years<00:00:42.570> progressed<00:00:43.079> that

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
tanks now as the years progressed that

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.529 
tanks now as the years progressed that
these<00:00:43.620> faded<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.160> because<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.120> armor<00:00:45.360> kept

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
these faded out because the armor kept

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.930 
these faded out because the armor kept
getting<00:00:45.809> better<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.140> better<00:00:46.789> but<00:00:47.789> we

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
getting better and better but we

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.549 
getting better and better but we
designed<00:00:48.239> these<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:48.719> for<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.200> military

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
designed these here for for military

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.209 
designed these here for for military
application<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.969> taking<00:00:51.660> out<00:00:51.890> light<00:00:52.890> skinned

cals and it's just we've been doing 50s

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.440 
cals and it's just we've been doing 50s
for<00:01:25.320> about<00:01:25.470> 18<00:01:25.800> years<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.270> all

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
and it just this is probably the biggest

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.180 
and it just this is probably the biggest
caliber<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:35.010> do

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190

shoulder-fired<00:01:36.170> is<00:01:37.170> what<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.470> got<00:01:37.650> here<00:01:37.860> is

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
shoulder-fired is what you got here is

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.980 
shoulder-fired is what you got here is
like<00:01:38.190> here's<00:01:38.370> a<00:01:38.430> 50<00:01:38.760> BMG<00:01:38.940> and<00:01:39.510> then<00:01:39.750> here's<00:01:39.930> a

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
like here's a 50 BMG and then here's a

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.340 
like here's a 50 BMG and then here's a
20<00:01:40.350> millimeter<00:01:40.850> so<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.030> would<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.050> what<00:01:43.260> you

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
20 millimeter so it's would you what you

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.930 
20 millimeter so it's would you what you
have<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.590> three<00:01:43.830> times<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.250> powder<00:01:44.490> three

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
have is three times the powder three

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.000 
have is three times the powder three
times<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.390> payload<00:01:45.750> capacity<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.560> it's

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
times the payload capacity and it's

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.790 
times the payload capacity and it's
three<00:01:47.250> times<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.610> fun<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.470> just<00:01:49.710> a

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
three times the fun so it's it's just a

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.110 
three times the fun so it's it's just a
lot<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:49.979> fun<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.370> shoot<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.790> if<00:01:50.850> you've<00:01:51.000> been

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
shooting a long time once you shoot this

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:02.290 
shooting a long time once you shoot this
you<00:01:54.150> won't<00:01:54.240> want<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.510> shoot<00:01:54.660> your<00:01:54.810> other<00:01:54.960> guns

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.730 

so<00:02:03.300> what<00:02:03.840> do<00:02:03.900> you<00:02:03.960> see<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> future<00:02:04.440> of<00:02:04.560> your
