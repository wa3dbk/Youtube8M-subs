00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
peanut psychology but I can imagine

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.630

peanuts<00:00:35.350> in<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.710> fields<00:00:36.039> like<00:00:36.160> wanting<00:00:36.609> to

were<00:00:42.309> you<00:00:42.430> concerned<00:00:42.910> and<00:00:43.359> possibly<00:00:43.930> worried

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:44.289 
were you concerned and possibly worried

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:45.540 
were you concerned and possibly worried
about<00:00:44.410> messing<00:00:44.590> with<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:44.980> classic<00:00:45.370> PBJ

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
about messing with the classic PBJ

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.880 
about messing with the classic PBJ
recipe<00:00:46.180> I<00:00:46.329> was<00:00:46.719> not<00:00:46.870> concerned<00:00:47.170> because<00:00:47.410> to<00:00:47.769> me

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
recipe I was not concerned because to me

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.290 
recipe I was not concerned because to me
I<00:00:47.920> mean<00:00:48.129> it's<00:00:48.250> called<00:00:48.489> peanut<00:00:48.850> butter<00:00:49.059> and

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
I mean it's called peanut butter and

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.729 
I mean it's called peanut butter and
jelly<00:00:49.329> there's<00:00:49.809> reason<00:00:50.109> why<00:00:50.199> they<00:00:50.289> put<00:00:50.410> peanut

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
jelly there's reason why they put peanut

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.650 
jelly there's reason why they put peanut
butter<00:00:50.769> first<00:00:51.219> in<00:00:51.609> the<00:00:51.969> name<00:00:52.120> of<00:00:52.149> this<00:00:52.390> food

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.150 
butter first in the name of this food
and<00:00:52.870> that<00:00:53.019> is<00:00:53.140> because<00:00:53.410> peanut<00:00:53.739> butter<00:00:53.920> is<00:00:54.010> the

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
and that is because peanut butter is the

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.889 
and that is because peanut butter is the
featured<00:00:54.489> ingredient<00:00:54.640> here<00:00:55.179> jelly<00:00:55.449> is<00:00:55.629> really
