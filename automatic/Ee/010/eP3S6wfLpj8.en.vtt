00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:08.440
 Haie Hello parade Woman de Sea of Kita you today I that zero-based 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:16.570
 I think you want to talk about zero-based thinking 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:20.259
 Well this is that if you start now and start paying some more now 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.750
 It's a story of whether or not to do it 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.610
 How much 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:31.580
 The fact that sound is the base, for example, I recently bought the style of work of this time is it's the funds 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.960
 But But I'm Do not amazing say whether that has topped 100,000 copies I'm reading this book 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.830
 But massage or later 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.200
 Such the pin and is Tan did not come I Well honest little I kinda not good enough 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:46.790
 Did not fit a little to me rather than in the sense that the increase this statement 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:49.880
 When I thought that do not fit to come up to the middle at that time in but what is 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:55.940
 It is the judgment whether it continues reading as it is 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:57.770
 In really when I found the Tteyuu if now this isnt a state to buy this book 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:03.380
 I'm such that if you read 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:06.780
 If the answer is my front capsule, stop it reading this book anymore 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.690
 It means that you throw it away 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.430
 On whether say that Well Yousui 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:16.020
 Such as throw away because you not become If you do not read bought a book put out the money to the other of rain Dawn 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.860
 It will be mon 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.280
 In However further and continue to see the reason would be to throw away the time from which money + from there 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.550
 is 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.680
 In say the time is really here because it is the biggest asset that can not buy with money 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.930
 The 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:38.530
 If you think that you lose only money or money and also the time from here 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.510
 This is a judgment that you should quit 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.290
 so 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:47.440
 This is Ney 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:52.990
 Is Well decision I really it means that throw away all the time has been reading a book Toka money until there 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.680
 It's difficult, but if you do this it will really increase your time, or you can use it effectively 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.050
 is not it 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.280
 In this is not up to Poi in all business not only to another Japan 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.630
 For example, you 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:11.200
 Well, let's say we have about 3 million services and started up some business 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:14.590
 In in or does not work If we do not hit profit very much to continue about half a year 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:19.209
 In making the crab to say 3 million if you look for you 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.300
 Well, I spent half a year as I continued for half a year 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:26.090
 Because 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.910
 After all I do not want to stop 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.190
 Even if I continue 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.550
 I can not have the image of how high sales are rising 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:41.940
 After all, when it comes to being, it is to stop making a plunge 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:46.890
 8 a Return to total zero and still think that you will do this class 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:52.620
 When I made the decision of the brain, it was an answer of no, but if I dare to stop it, that's it 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:57.630
 Considering the energy and time that people use from there, it is much more efficient than that 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.450
 It's a good story. Zero-based thinking is really something like time management. 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.930
 Though I think that it is the strongest special move 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.710
 Just Ney It is difficult 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.380
 see 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.010
 For example 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:12.660
 I'm there is that you have a variety of study until I also you now, for example, 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.770
 One about 500,000 while various selfish or buy teaching materials and studying of such information business 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:20.610
 I have used 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:24.400
 Another longer but at that time not out results to know the state in which no out this achievement 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:29.049
 Thinking that say whether went through 500,000 from zero 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:33.579
 What kind of judge do you do when you 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:39.099
 So and it even to I should continue as long as the fact that I do after all and this 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:43.700
 After all, if you didn't do it, stop here too and have it already 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:50.120
 It is that make easy to say that is better to use in fashion 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:51.349
 It's a very difficult way of thinking , but hey if you can really do it, you will really earn money 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.720
 I think it will go up 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:04:00.980
 I 'm working quite well now, but it's quite difficult, but still a cat-like book 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.980
 First time going to be the Akono child candidate from Toka that sort of thing 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.879
 That's why today 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.340
 So if there is a place to be taken if either would have been how I tried to like this story 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:12.810
 I would like you to introduce 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.810
 Well, excuse me in this area today
