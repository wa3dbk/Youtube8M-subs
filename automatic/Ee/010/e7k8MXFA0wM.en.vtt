 that there is a staff there who played 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.650
 including me when I met the super 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.780
 nintendo few years after 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.670
 launch of this game was in the early 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:43.379
 games that I had the opportunity to 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:46.350
 playing on my friends called 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.750
 game of caveman was released the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.969
 game boy is the super nintendo that was the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.670

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.250
 very beautiful colorful game with a 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.730

 pre story and 2 that was made version 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.600
 two consoles 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.820
 you can notice the similarity and if you 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.520
 I found these conversions ipc-a 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.229
 epc console console happens on days 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.229
 today was mistaken is 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.830
 even though a conversion was 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.970
 practically a new game and incidentally is a 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.399
 great game 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.049
 you being that cranky dude who is 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.049
 mine to humiliate the game character the 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.539
 emelec 2 and your goal is to go behind 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.430
 food dinosaurs stole 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.539
 before winter comes everyone 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.710
 starve 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:56.899
 food only sucks are fast food cake 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.350

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:08.239
 but woman is everything going good to her weapon 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.429

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.730

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.630
 that if you do not want you can jump in and out 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.910
 running at frenetic speed this 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.150
 help and sometimes it bothers and 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.160
 opinion the best attack is the scream is like 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.510
 if it was a spell you execute and 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.430
 waiting to recharge 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.470

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.200
 is your screen and see a video of my

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.540
 The crazy ones you use have a 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.430
 example but more famous is hang gliding 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:13.260

 time the difficulty increases more 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.819
 the game has a high difficulty but as 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.400
 the gameplay is fluid and calm 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.920
