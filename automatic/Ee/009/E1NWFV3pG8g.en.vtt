00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.380
 so many questions from their 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.390
 maxi session compatriots shot down myself 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.309
 probably have not heard at the end of the evening 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.559
 football players would be exhausted as from 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.390
 long workout yuli was easier he 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.520
 fluent in armenian especially 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.620
 free jokes in their native language but rather 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.430
 the race was clearly not at ease he answered 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.430
 little and english 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.270
 I just got off at the end of the evening 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.070
 relaxed when meeting host 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.690
 proposed football player to play between 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.180
 is a football on the console 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.550
 instead of Spartak, I chose Real Jura 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.630
 your favorite arsenal game to one goal 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.630
 and ozbiliz won 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.250
 Of course, those who came to the meeting could not not 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.890
 ask about the crisis of Spartacus 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.180
 joined them and we are honest more 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.860
 serious topic says a lot 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.200
 today spartak still if one 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.940
 so what do you think is connected with 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.790
 all eat this recession this crisis 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.110
 teams you thought a lot about it 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.849
 faith here is a living word 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.099
 our players stopped believing in themselves and 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.750
 teammates I think what exactly 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.470
 so we are not playing the best 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.319
 football 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.450
 why suddenly lost faith itself. 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.069
 hard to say about any particular 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.870
 the reason for the defeat was strong 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.819
 psychological pressure is not 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.260
 allowed players to showcase their 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.180
 the best qualities are very much now 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:07.010
 it is said that there are enough physics teams 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.910
 you do not agree that is all in pamukkale 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.769
 famous russian question now what 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.269
 to do or it's too late for us to stay 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.519
 one game against dynamo 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.900
 we have something to prove we need to win 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.370
 victory everyone eat this goal make 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.170
 you have a lot of friends in Krasnodar this is not 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.970
 Thought to write a text message that give us 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:32.670
 European cups guys we have to win 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.100
 ticket to Europe and Krasnodar holds 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:40.739
 your best season and on the right and play 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.980
 European league unexpected question not you 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.390
 it seems that considering 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.640
 in Spartacus difficult times of formation 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.110
 new team could be better without league 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.760
 Europe next year something calm 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.709
 focus on the new championship 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.370
 new team if Spartak will not go 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.510
 European Cups 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.129
 Personally, I would have played a lot of times 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.220
 you believe not all the same in Spartak all 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:02.739
 get better 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.420
 pumps up before arrival but speak fontus 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.340
 here take levin 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.440
 three years ago the old signora took 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.920
 seventh place and now the best team 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.170
 Italy 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.470
 so we need 7 place to climb 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.419
 the top that Spartak and try to do 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.130
 especially since Juventus in many ways helped the new 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.410
 the stadium which have red and white soon 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:29.550
 It will be generally out of the forest to get out quite 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:29.550
 really important to believe Kamaz squirrels 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.820
 but the truth is that the atmosphere is not taught Spartak 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:41.620
 you at least one 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:44.699
 and the new index you know when everything is bad 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:49.539
 then everything is bad and if everything was good 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:51.849
 then nobody even asked us about it 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.830
 do not understand what is happening hilyatsya 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.530
 maybe something new and so I already 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.360
 said the stadium will help us voice 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.490
 we will try to get out of 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:07.410
 crisis at least we want 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:10.689
 take a plan he is blyw 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.759
 the best of Armenians is Yura Movsisyan 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:17.499
 no shame about you screaming like that for days 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:19.299
 can be the best measures but by whom of 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:20.889
 cord gases have nothing to be offended if u 

00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:22.809
 The best football team ever 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.879
 cause head to the beat time so 

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:26.979
 it is important to be the most loved let me 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:29.829
 I will always be better to bang the guest 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:33.099
 we put who carried to dinner your motive you you 

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:34.389
 you you are not he so she me still you 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.919
 really think that after the match with 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.539
 you no longer have wings of advice 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.789
 chances against manchester and us and 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.049
 laser fall on it is clear that if i 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.300
 people have ilya another club but 

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:45.339
 got interested in one unsuccessful 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.919
 match on twitch they wo n't give up on 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:48.969
 me but anyway now i am then 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.169
 exactly in line 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:54.269
 no point talking about friend for team 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.129
 diff discussions 

00:05:54.269 --> 00:06:00.189
 but if tomorrow they call from music 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:02.979
 barn and what do you say to the stranded part I 

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:07.409
 says the same year will see Spartak 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:07.409
 the champion will blow then speak
