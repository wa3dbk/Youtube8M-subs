00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
okay guys so what I wanted to show you

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.999 
okay guys so what I wanted to show you
then<00:00:02.399> was<00:00:02.610> how<00:00:03.300> do<00:00:03.360> you<00:00:03.449> get<00:00:03.659> your<00:00:04.009> magnetic

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
then was how do you get your magnetic

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.810 
then was how do you get your magnetic
tank<00:00:05.460> bag<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:06.390> fit<00:00:06.690> on<00:00:07.080> plastic<00:00:07.799> fairings<00:00:08.160> more

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
tank bag to fit on plastic fairings more

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:21.980 
tank bag to fit on plastic fairings more
stuff<00:00:09.030> more<00:00:09.300> specifically<00:00:10.080> on<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.800> CB<00:00:11.309> ours

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:52.430 

you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:51.219 

you

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.550 

okay<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:54.149> your<00:01:54.390> tank<00:01:54.659> Fang<00:01:55.020> and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
okay so this is your tank Fang and

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.200 
okay so this is your tank Fang and
essentially<00:01:56.070> for<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.430> mod<00:01:56.670> all<00:01:57.000> we're

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
essentially for this mod all we're

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.120 
essentially for this mod all we're
really<00:01:57.240> doing<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.049> taking<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.740> tank<00:01:58.950> fair

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
really doing is taking the tank fair

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.560 
really doing is taking the tank fair
enough<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.610> if<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.909> look<00:02:00.119> underneath

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
enough and if you look underneath

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.830 
enough and if you look underneath
there's<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.470> little<00:02:01.829> foam<00:02:02.100> padding<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.840> all

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
there's just little foam padding and all

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.230 
there's just little foam padding and all
we're<00:02:04.170> doing<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.680> removing<00:02:05.399> some<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.060> and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
we're doing is removing some of it and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.680 
we're doing is removing some of it and
placing<00:02:06.929> like<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.110> metal<00:02:07.500> sheet<00:02:07.770> under<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.160> so

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
placing like a metal sheet under it so

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.350 
placing like a metal sheet under it so
that<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.500> magnets<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.160> your<00:02:11.910> tank<00:02:12.120> bag

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
that the the magnets in your tank bag

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.690 
that the the magnets in your tank bag
we're<00:02:12.569> actually<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:13.019> suck<00:02:13.380> on<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.700> because

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
we're actually to suck on it because

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.370 
we're actually to suck on it because
this<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:14.970> quite<00:02:15.269> a<00:02:15.360> thick<00:02:16.080> piece<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.470> plastic

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
this is quite a thick piece of plastic

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.770 
this is quite a thick piece of plastic
like<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.410> said<00:02:19.700> when<00:02:20.700> doing<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.090> mod<00:02:21.330> most

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
like I said when doing this mod most

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.820 
like I said when doing this mod most
people<00:02:22.230> would<00:02:22.470> go<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.459> take<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.569> like<00:02:25.410> a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
people would go and take a a like a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.580 
people would go and take a a like a
metal<00:02:26.580> sheet<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.060> put<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.870> under<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.319> foam

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
metal sheet and put it under this foam

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.190 
metal sheet and put it under this foam
padding<00:02:28.980> but<00:02:29.640> for<00:02:29.850> me<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.420> feel<00:02:30.660> like<00:02:30.930> that

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
padding but for me I feel like that

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.509 
padding but for me I feel like that
isn't<00:02:31.470> really<00:02:31.799> enough<00:02:31.890> what<00:02:32.700> I'm<00:02:32.910> gonna<00:02:33.150> do<00:02:33.450> is

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
isn't really enough what I'm gonna do is

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.740 
isn't really enough what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:02:35.519> going<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.760> take<00:02:35.910> these<00:02:36.150> little<00:02:36.330> magnets

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
I'm going to take these little magnets

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.309 
I'm going to take these little magnets
and<00:02:37.110> put<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.530> under<00:02:37.739> there<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.540> for<00:02:39.540> me<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:40.019> feel

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
and put it under there and for me I feel

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.930 
and put it under there and for me I feel
like<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.590> magnets<00:02:40.950> would<00:02:41.040> be<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> lot<00:02:41.549> stronger

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
like the magnets would be a lot stronger

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.820 
like the magnets would be a lot stronger
connection<00:02:42.540> between<00:02:42.690> magnet<00:02:43.290> on<00:02:43.380> magnet

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
connection between magnet on magnet

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.330 
connection between magnet on magnet
magnet<00:02:44.580> on<00:02:44.700> magnet<00:02:45.090> then<00:02:45.330> magnet<00:02:46.019> on<00:02:46.340> thin

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
magnet on magnet then magnet on thin

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.259 
magnet on magnet then magnet on thin
little<00:02:47.569> little<00:02:48.569> sheet<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.870> steel<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:50.700> I'll

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
little little sheet of steel so I'll

00:02:51.269 --> 00:03:01.880 
little little sheet of steel so I'll
suggest<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.720> at<00:02:51.900> this<00:02:52.049> round

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:05:28.470 

you

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.540 

you
