think that the iphone for the white one

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.910 
think that the iphone for the white one
at<00:01:03.420> least<00:01:03.660> they're<00:01:04.049> not<00:01:04.080> going<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.439> waste<00:01:04.650> all

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.520 
at least they're not going to waste all
those<00:01:05.129> parts<00:01:05.610> they're<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.930> resell

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
those parts they're just going to resell

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.800 
those parts they're just going to resell
them<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.460> white<00:01:08.670> iphone<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.420> when<00:01:09.630> it's

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
them as the white iphone for when it's

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.390 
them as the white iphone for when it's
going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.110> dumbed<00:01:10.350> down<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.890> about<00:01:11.130> one

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
going to be dumbed down to about one

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.580 
going to be dumbed down to about one
hundred<00:01:11.580> dollars<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.479> when<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> iphone<00:01:13.140> five

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
hundred dollars and when the iphone five

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.410 
hundred dollars and when the iphone five
comes<00:01:13.619> out<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.490> doesn't<00:01:14.850> happen<00:01:15.000> my

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
comes out if that doesn't happen my

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.300 
comes out if that doesn't happen my
other<00:01:15.630> prediction<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.350> kind<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.830> bad<00:01:17.009> and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
other prediction is kind of bad and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.219 
other prediction is kind of bad and
something<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:18.060> wouldn't<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:18.750> want<00:01:19.049> to

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
something that I wouldn't really want to

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.530 
something that I wouldn't really want to
see<00:01:19.409> could<00:01:19.710> Apple<00:01:19.920> be<00:01:20.340> actually<00:01:20.759> saving<00:01:21.180> these

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
see could Apple be actually saving these

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.260 
see could Apple be actually saving these
parts<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.110> something<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.740> an<00:01:22.890> iphone<00:01:23.400> 4s

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
parts for something like an iphone 4s

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.620 
parts for something like an iphone 4s
like<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.200> 3gs<00:01:25.920> except<00:01:26.460> for<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.939> iphone<00:01:27.330> 4

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
like the 3gs except for the iphone 4

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.600 
like the 3gs except for the iphone 4
model<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.200> reason<00:01:28.650> i<00:01:28.829> wouldn't<00:01:29.189> want<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.400> see

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
model the reason i wouldn't want to see

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.819 
model the reason i wouldn't want to see
this<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:30.030> because<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.600> 3gs<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.439> didn't<00:01:31.710> really

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
this is because the 3gs it didn't really

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.100 
this is because the 3gs it didn't really
bring<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.250> new<00:01:32.400> design<00:01:32.820> or<00:01:33.180> too<00:01:33.509> much<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
bring a new design or too much to the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.710 
bring a new design or too much to the
table<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.979> iphone<00:01:35.369> 4<00:01:35.729> did<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.180> mean<00:01:36.540> with

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
table like the iphone 4 did I mean with

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.179 
table like the iphone 4 did I mean with
