little<00:02:43.310> dark<00:02:43.579> for<00:02:43.640> me<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.879> mentioned<00:02:44.329> in<00:02:44.390> my

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
little dark for me I mentioned in my

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.259 
little dark for me I mentioned in my
more<00:02:44.750> recent<00:02:44.780> haul<00:02:45.670> it's<00:02:46.670> weird<00:02:46.970> though

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
more recent haul it's weird though

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.050 
more recent haul it's weird though
because<00:02:47.720> it<00:02:48.140> is<00:02:48.440> definitely<00:02:48.769> too<00:02:49.340> dark<00:02:49.609> but<00:02:49.909> it

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
because it is definitely too dark but it

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.210 
because it is definitely too dark but it
seems<00:02:50.329> to<00:02:50.540> cover<00:02:50.780> up<00:02:51.079> because<00:02:51.590> of<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:51.859> warmth

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
seems to cover up because of the warmth

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.270 
seems to cover up because of the warmth
in<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.489> color<00:02:52.849> without<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.450> being<00:02:53.629> too<00:02:54.280> light

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
in the color without it being too light

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.610 
in the color without it being too light
I<00:02:55.579> guess<00:02:55.819> so<00:02:56.000> I'm<00:02:56.299> trying<00:02:56.540> it<00:02:56.840> out<00:02:56.930> using<00:02:57.409> a

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620
