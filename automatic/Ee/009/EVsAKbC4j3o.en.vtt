00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
Baron Samedi and Baron Samedi I think

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.840 
Baron Samedi and Baron Samedi I think
he's<00:00:44.410> from<00:00:44.560> one<00:00:44.770> of<00:00:44.829> the<00:00:44.920> movies<00:00:45.250> I'm<00:00:45.430> not<00:00:45.579> sure

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
he's from one of the movies I'm not sure

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.370 
he's from one of the movies I'm not sure
but<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:49.149> interesting<00:00:49.660> thing<00:00:49.720> about<00:00:49.930> him<00:00:50.350> is

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
but the interesting thing about him is

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.319 
but the interesting thing about him is
we<00:00:50.620> actually<00:00:50.950> need<00:00:51.130> to<00:00:51.250> kill<00:00:51.489> him<00:00:51.700> three<00:00:52.030> times

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
we actually need to kill him three times

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.850 
we actually need to kill him three times
before<00:00:53.200> we<00:00:54.130> can<00:00:54.280> end<00:00:54.430> the<00:00:54.520> level<00:00:54.820> so<00:00:55.860> there's

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
before we can end the level so there's

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.860 
before we can end the level so there's
the<00:00:57.100> Golden<00:00:57.460> Gun<00:00:57.579> there<00:00:57.910> and<00:00:58.210> soon<00:00:58.600> we're

the tiles properly that's got a yeah so
many<00:01:53.200> ways<00:01:53.320> that's<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.590> pattern<00:01:53.920> there<00:01:54.130> that

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
many ways that's the pattern there that

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.940 
many ways that's the pattern there that
glass<00:01:54.670> is<00:01:54.850> gonna<00:01:55.000> slide<00:01:55.300> down<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:55.750> we

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
glass is gonna slide down and we

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.469 
glass is gonna slide down and we
basically<00:01:56.950> get<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.490> Golden<00:01:57.880> Gun<00:01:58.000> we'll<00:01:58.270> take

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
basically get the Golden Gun we'll take

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.670 
basically get the Golden Gun we'll take
that<00:01:58.630> out<00:01:58.690> right<00:01:58.960> now<00:01:59.020> because<00:01:59.500> it's

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
that out right now because it's

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.889 
that out right now because it's
obviously<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.310> most<00:02:01.090> powerful<00:02:01.540> weapon<00:02:01.810> in

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
obviously the most powerful weapon in

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.440 
obviously the most powerful weapon in
the<00:02:01.990> game<00:02:02.200> aside<00:02:03.190> from<00:02:03.220> I'd<00:02:03.729> say<00:02:03.759> maybe<00:02:04.240> the

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
to kill him once more to end the level I

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.270 
to kill him once more to end the level I
think<00:02:50.510> he's<00:02:50.780> yes<00:02:51.139> so<00:02:51.349> that<00:02:51.500> smoke<00:02:51.829> there<00:02:52.040> just

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
think he's yes so that smoke there just

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.379 
think he's yes so that smoke there just
kind<00:02:52.459> of<00:02:52.489> lets<00:02:52.639> you<00:02:52.760> know<00:02:52.909> that's<00:02:53.120> where<00:02:53.299> he

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:53.389 
kind of lets you know that's where he

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.949 
kind of lets you know that's where he
respawn<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.980> I'm<00:02:55.069> just<00:02:55.189> gonna<00:02:55.659> kill<00:02:56.659> him<00:02:56.840> again

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.879 
respawn so I'm just gonna kill him again
and<00:02:58.269> we<00:02:59.269> need<00:02:59.299> to<00:02:59.540> obviously<00:02:59.780> kill<00:03:00.439> him<00:03:00.650> once

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
and we need to obviously kill him once

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.940 
and we need to obviously kill him once
more<00:03:01.900> I'm<00:03:02.900> pretty<00:03:03.109> sure<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.319> know<00:03:03.470> where<00:03:03.709> he<00:03:03.829> is

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
more I'm pretty sure I know where he is

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.500 
more I'm pretty sure I know where he is
now<00:03:04.159> and<00:03:04.519> you're<00:03:04.730> gonna<00:03:04.849> notice<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:05.359> the

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.649 
now and you're gonna notice that the
level<00:03:05.659> just<00:03:05.900> got<00:03:06.109> really<00:03:06.349> dark<00:03:07.120> which<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.299> guess

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
level just got really dark which I guess

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.750 
level just got really dark which I guess
it<00:03:08.810> adds<00:03:08.959> some<00:03:09.230> you<00:03:09.379> know<00:03:09.500> some<00:03:09.829> suspension<00:03:10.519> or

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
it adds some you know some suspension or

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.750 
it adds some you know some suspension or
some<00:03:11.090> drama<00:03:11.569> to<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.489> end<00:03:13.609> of<00:03:13.700> this

only<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.879> only<00:03:34.939> real<00:03:35.359> bad<00:03:36.229> thing<00:03:36.560> about<00:03:36.680> this

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
only the only real bad thing about this

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:42.399 
only the only real bad thing about this
gun<00:03:37.129> is<00:03:37.430> um<00:03:37.810> as<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:39.049> can<00:03:39.079> tell<00:03:39.439> it's<00:03:39.680> uh<00:03:41.409> it

actually well-placed as opposed to just

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:03.819 
actually well-placed as opposed to just
you<00:04:00.259> know<00:04:00.319> just<00:04:00.590> firing<00:04:00.859> every<00:04:01.639> which<00:04:01.819> way<00:04:02.829> so

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
you know just firing every which way so

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.439 
you know just firing every which way so
like<00:04:03.979> I<00:04:04.129> guess<00:04:04.189> that's<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.579> only<00:04:04.669> the<00:04:05.269> only

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.449 
like I guess that's the only the only

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.030 
like I guess that's the only the only
negative<00:04:05.840> thing<00:04:05.870> about<00:04:06.199> this<00:04:06.379> gun<00:04:06.560> I<00:04:06.620> think<00:04:06.769> we

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
negative thing about this gun I think we

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.770
