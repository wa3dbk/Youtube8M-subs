you<00:02:08.910> pick<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.300> random<00:02:09.509> number<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.289> let's<00:02:10.560> just

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
you pick a random number so let's just

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.770 
you pick a random number so let's just
say<00:02:10.979> there<00:02:11.220> were<00:02:11.370> 30<00:02:11.670> people<00:02:12.090> there<00:02:12.270> would<00:02:12.750> be

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
say there were 30 people there would be

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.700 
say there were 30 people there would be
a<00:02:12.900> random<00:02:13.200> number

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
a random number

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.800 
a random number
hat<00:02:13.920> from<00:02:14.130> 1-230<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.420> would<00:02:15.540> go<00:02:15.630> in<00:02:15.750> a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
hat from 1-230 and you would go in a

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.180 
hat from 1-230 and you would go in a
line<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.230> pick<00:02:16.470> out<00:02:16.620> your<00:02:16.740> random<00:02:17.160> number

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
line and you pick out your random number

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.250 
line and you pick out your random number
so<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.060> keep<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.480> random<00:02:18.870> number<00:02:19.140> and

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
so you keep that random number and

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.710 
so you keep that random number and
basically<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.430> first<00:02:20.640> person<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.030> go<00:02:21.270> whoever

basically the first person to go whoever

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.140 
basically the first person to go whoever
picked<00:02:21.990> number<00:02:22.110> one<00:02:22.500> has<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.190> pick<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.490> random

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.160 
have the last licks so the one downside
about<00:04:35.640> it<00:04:36.000> is<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.120> lot<00:04:36.420> of<00:04:36.450> people<00:04:36.570> have<00:04:36.990> their

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
about it is a lot of people have their

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.780 
about it is a lot of people have their
gifts<00:04:37.440> locked<00:04:37.650> up<00:04:37.860> because<00:04:38.070> a<00:04:38.220> lot<00:04:38.430> of<00:04:38.460> steals

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
gifts locked up because a lot of steals

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.730 
gifts locked up because a lot of steals
have<00:04:38.970> been<00:04:39.120> going<00:04:39.360> on<00:04:39.450> so<00:04:40.020> a<00:04:40.050> lot<00:04:40.500> of<00:04:40.530> people

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
have been going on so a lot of people

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.230 
have been going on so a lot of people
have<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:41.070> lottery<00:04:41.340> tickets<00:04:41.670> locked<00:04:41.940> the

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
have the lottery tickets locked the

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.090 
have the lottery tickets locked the
alcohol<00:04:42.690> locked<00:04:43.020> all<00:04:43.260> of<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.710> good<00:04:43.860> things

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
alcohol locked all of the good things

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.830 
alcohol locked all of the good things
that<00:04:44.220> people<00:04:44.520> are<00:04:44.610> really<00:04:44.940> sought-after<00:04:45.330> are

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
that people are really sought-after are

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.690 
that people are really sought-after are
all<00:04:46.230> locked<00:04:46.560> up<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:46.950> you<00:04:47.010> can't<00:04:47.250> steal<00:04:47.520> from

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
all locked up and you can't steal from

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.880 
all locked up and you can't steal from
them<00:04:47.880> so<00:04:48.300> that's<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.780> only<00:04:48.870> downside<00:04:49.710> to

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
them so that's the only downside to

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.920 
them so that's the only downside to
being<00:04:50.010> number<00:04:50.250> 30<00:04:50.640> but<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.120> good<00:04:51.330> side<00:04:51.570> is<00:04:51.750> is

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
being number 30 but the good side is is

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.290 
being number 30 but the good side is is
that<00:04:52.230> you<00:04:52.380> know<00:04:52.650> what<00:04:52.950> everyone<00:04:53.340> has<00:04:53.730> all<00:04:54.090> of

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
that you know what everyone has all of

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.730 
that you know what everyone has all of
the<00:04:54.390> gifts<00:04:54.570> have<00:04:54.840> pretty<00:04:55.110> much<00:04:55.170> been<00:04:55.290> taken

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
the gifts have pretty much been taken

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.130 
the gifts have pretty much been taken
off<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:55.860> table<00:04:56.160> and<00:04:56.490> everyone<00:04:57.480> has<00:04:57.630> a<00:04:57.660> gift<00:04:57.990> in

steal<00:05:00.000> or<00:05:00.270> just<00:05:00.840> think<00:05:01.380> about<00:05:01.560> so<00:05:02.250> basically
