00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.770
 touches comeback and before the sport 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.700
 barcelona had the last evaluation of 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.190
 your chances to carry it out 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.350
 if you do not play xavi the options are for a 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.260
 tiago side despite their quality 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.619
 Saturday missed several passes like this one to 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.619
 villa 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.960
 and lost balls that before a rival like 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.590
 the milan can be very dangerous 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.110
 so he also failed so much in attack 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.760
 as in control of the game and left 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.760
 of the field with this whistle 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.359
 doubts and therefore a reason for the 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:43.359
 concern 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.920
 another argument to think that the barÃ§a 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:54.270
 it will not happen is a lack of marksmanship 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.190
 in many occasions and too many failures 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.440
 seeing this villa before the bottom of 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.340
 the league put to think in a 3 to 0 before 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.340
 the italian championship 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.930
 but in the barÃ§a de x they also saw each other 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.930
 things to think so 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.750
 for example the good match of alexis and 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.750
 your goal 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.810
 on the bench with roura not only 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.010
 encouraging but doing continuous 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.010
 corrections to yours 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.460
 the interaction between members of the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.460
 technical body and with the outside was 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.930
 continued something that invites you to think that 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.930
 the players are not alone 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.330
 another image that invites optimism is 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.900
 is that of messi a sad gesture 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.900
 putting on the bench 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.260
 but nevertheless ironist wants to dream 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.030
 with the rooms of the changes nothing 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.150
 better than being entrusted to the talent of 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.150
 iniesta 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.740
 especially to the month and after doing 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.740
 reality the most complicated mission 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.980
 because if there is something that can be 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.730
 hold on to the boat to believe 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.730
 it's him
