00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
to go and the fingertips are nice for

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.970 
to go and the fingertips are nice for
grabbing<00:02:40.980> things<00:02:41.209> it<00:02:42.209> feels<00:02:42.810> about<00:02:43.739> as

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
grabbing things it feels about as

grabbing things it feels about as
natural<00:02:44.340> as<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.459> canned<00:02:44.730> it's<00:02:44.969> not<00:02:45.209> as<00:02:45.480> much

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
natural as the canned it's not as much

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.050 
natural as the canned it's not as much
you<00:02:46.650> don't<00:02:46.829> get<00:02:46.950> as<00:02:47.040> much<00:02:47.189> feedback<00:02:47.519> as<00:02:47.699> you<00:02:47.909> do

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
you don't get as much feedback as you do

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.459 
you don't get as much feedback as you do
with<00:02:48.180> like<00:02:48.389> the<00:02:48.540> latex<00:02:48.870> gloves<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.409> the

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:49.469 
with like the latex gloves of the

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.830 
with like the latex gloves of the
nitrile<00:02:49.889> gloves<00:02:50.329> that's<00:02:51.329> that's<00:02:51.629> the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
nitrile gloves that's that's the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.509 
nitrile gloves that's that's the
drawback<00:02:52.079> but<00:02:52.919> there's<00:02:53.099> a<00:02:53.159> lot<00:02:53.340> more

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
drawback but there's a lot more

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:54.979 
drawback but there's a lot more

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
insulated from the work that you're

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.689 
insulated from the work that you're
doing<00:02:56.849> which<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:57.989> helpful<00:02:58.260> with<00:02:59.099> things<00:02:59.430> like

00:02:59.689 --> 00:02:59.699 
doing which is helpful with things like

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.809 
doing which is helpful with things like
heat<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.389> we<00:03:00.930> have<00:03:01.109> stuff<00:03:01.379> for<00:03:01.409> that<00:03:01.819> heading

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
heat and we have stuff for that heading

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.789 
heat and we have stuff for that heading
down<00:03:02.969> here<00:03:03.269> now<00:03:03.419> these<00:03:03.659> I<00:03:03.719> did<00:03:04.379> not<00:03:04.560> get<00:03:04.769> a

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
down here now these I did not get a

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.470 
down here now these I did not get a
chance<00:03:05.069> to<00:03:05.250> try<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:05.669> these<00:03:05.819> are<00:03:05.969> specifically

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
chance to try but these are specifically

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.619 
chance to try but these are specifically
made<00:03:07.379> to<00:03:07.409> handle<00:03:08.010> hot<00:03:08.280> things<00:03:08.639> so<00:03:09.359> it<00:03:09.449> also

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
made to handle hot things so it also

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.140 
made to handle hot things so it also
comes<00:03:09.930> with<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.169> nice<00:03:10.319> sticker<00:03:10.969> but<00:03:11.969> that's

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
comes with a nice sticker but that's

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.449 
comes with a nice sticker but that's
what<00:03:12.299> these<00:03:12.389> are<00:03:12.449> for<00:03:12.780> these<00:03:13.079> are<00:03:13.290> for<00:03:13.530> I'm<00:03:14.250> not

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
what these are for these are for I'm not

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.920 
what these are for these are for I'm not
sure<00:03:14.699> if<00:03:14.879> I'd<00:03:15.030> call<00:03:15.269> these<00:03:15.449> welding<00:03:15.840> gloves

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
sure if I'd call these welding gloves

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.429 
sure if I'd call these welding gloves
I'd<00:03:16.259> actually<00:03:16.560> have<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.709> look<00:03:17.040> yeah<00:03:17.639> these<00:03:17.819> are

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:18.439 
I'd actually have to look yeah these are

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.339 
I'd actually have to look yeah these are
molded<00:03:19.439> silicone<00:03:19.680> palm<00:03:20.569> it<00:03:21.569> has<00:03:21.780> these<00:03:22.079> have<00:03:22.290> a

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
molded silicone palm it has these have a

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.309 
molded silicone palm it has these have a
Kevlar<00:03:22.859> shield<00:03:23.220> which<00:03:24.030> yeah<00:03:24.689> this<00:03:25.169> is

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
Kevlar shield which yeah this is

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.439 
Kevlar shield which yeah this is
probably<00:03:25.680> why<00:03:25.949> these<00:03:26.220> are<00:03:26.519> heat<00:03:27.000> resistance

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
probably why these are heat resistance

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.149 
probably why these are heat resistance
because<00:03:27.659> these<00:03:27.750> are<00:03:27.930> have<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.470> Kevlar<00:03:28.829> shield

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
because these are have the Kevlar shield

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.610 
because these are have the Kevlar shield
on<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.400> inside<00:03:29.669> which<00:03:29.909> I<00:03:30.150> didn't<00:03:30.359> realize<00:03:30.659> but

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
on the inside which I didn't realize but

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.319 
on the inside which I didn't realize but
way<00:03:31.889> cool<00:03:32.129> so<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.400> next<00:03:32.579> time<00:03:32.699> I<00:03:32.729> go<00:03:32.909> to<00:03:32.970> handle

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
way cool so the next time I go to handle

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.749 
way cool so the next time I go to handle
hot<00:03:33.479> exhaust<00:03:33.870> I'm<00:03:34.620> gonna<00:03:34.949> go<00:03:35.129> for<00:03:35.310> these<00:03:35.549> I

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:35.759 
hot exhaust I'm gonna go for these I

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:37.520 
hot exhaust I'm gonna go for these I
also<00:03:36.569> didn't<00:03:36.870> get<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:36.989> chance<00:03:37.199> to<00:03:37.290> use<00:03:37.379> these

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
also didn't get a chance to use these

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.280 
also didn't get a chance to use these
it's<00:03:37.769> still<00:03:37.979> summer<00:03:38.389> but<00:03:39.389> I<00:03:39.419> did<00:03:39.659> try<00:03:39.900> these<00:03:39.959> on

it's still summer but I did try these on

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.179 
it's still summer but I did try these on

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
and shovel outside or something like

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.170 
and shovel outside or something like
that<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:51.439> mean<00:03:52.439> yeah<00:03:52.590> they're<00:03:52.799> thick<00:03:53.129> but<00:03:53.969> if

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
that I mean yeah they're thick but if

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.709 
that I mean yeah they're thick but if
you're<00:03:54.419> someplace<00:03:54.689> cold<00:03:55.969> yeah<00:03:56.969> these<00:03:57.479> guys

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:57.719 
you're someplace cold yeah these guys

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:59.869 
you're someplace cold yeah these guys
right<00:03:57.989> here<00:03:58.259> but<00:03:59.009> I'm<00:03:59.280> kind<00:03:59.549> of<00:03:59.609> sweating

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
right here but I'm kind of sweating

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.699 
right here but I'm kind of sweating
already<00:04:00.060> I<00:04:00.299> mean<00:04:00.509> it's<00:04:00.629> a<00:04:00.840> it's<00:04:01.169> a<00:04:01.319> warm<00:04:01.530> day

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
already I mean it's a it's a warm day

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.219 
already I mean it's a it's a warm day
here<00:04:01.819> so<00:04:02.819> not<00:04:03.030> exactly<00:04:03.449> appropriate<00:04:03.689> for<00:04:04.109> this

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:04.229 
here so not exactly appropriate for this

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:05.390 
here so not exactly appropriate for this
time<00:04:04.409> of<00:04:04.530> year<00:04:04.709> which<00:04:04.859> is<00:04:05.009> why<00:04:05.129> I<00:04:05.159> haven't

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
time of year which is why I haven't

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.179 
time of year which is why I haven't
tried<00:04:05.669> these<00:04:05.879> but<00:04:06.209> bulky<00:04:07.199> I<00:04:07.349> mean<00:04:07.680> these<00:04:08.009> are

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
tried these but bulky I mean these are

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.399 
tried these but bulky I mean these are
winter<00:04:08.459> gloves<00:04:08.789> now<00:04:09.269> these<00:04:09.419> box<00:04:09.689> handlers<00:04:10.169> I

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
winter gloves now these box handlers I

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.259 
winter gloves now these box handlers I
did<00:04:10.889> use<00:04:11.069> these<00:04:11.280> for<00:04:11.519> a<00:04:11.549> bit<00:04:11.789> they<00:04:11.969> have<00:04:12.000> these

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
did use these for a bit they have these

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.379 
did use these for a bit they have these
special<00:04:12.959> grippy<00:04:13.379> insides<00:04:14.310> here<00:04:14.699> but<00:04:14.969> I<00:04:15.150> kind

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
special grippy insides here but I kind

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:16.640 
special grippy insides here but I kind
of<00:04:15.449> didn't<00:04:15.659> like<00:04:15.840> them<00:04:16.049> because<00:04:16.380> of<00:04:16.530> these

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
of didn't like them because of these

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.199 
of didn't like them because of these
fingertips<00:04:17.039> at<00:04:17.400> least<00:04:17.549> for<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:17.789> work<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:17.969> I

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
fingertips at least for the work that I

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:18.469 
fingertips at least for the work that I
do

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
do

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.629 
do
they<00:04:19.079> say<00:04:19.260> box<00:04:19.560> handlers<00:04:20.010> so<00:04:20.190> this<00:04:20.340> might<00:04:20.519> be

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
they say box handlers so this might be

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.279 
they say box handlers so this might be
good<00:04:20.849> if<00:04:21.029> say<00:04:21.359> you<00:04:21.419> work<00:04:21.599> in<00:04:21.719> a<00:04:21.779> warehouse<00:04:21.900> or

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
good if say you work in a warehouse or

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.060 
good if say you work in a warehouse or
something

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
something

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.680 
something
but<00:04:23.430> because<00:04:23.700> when<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:23.970> put<00:04:24.150> these<00:04:24.300> on<00:04:24.360> these

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
but because when you put these on these

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.210 
but because when you put these on these
little<00:04:24.870> bumps<00:04:25.140> stick<00:04:25.560> out<00:04:25.740> when<00:04:25.980> you're

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
little bumps stick out when you're

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.920 
little bumps stick out when you're
trying<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.490> do<00:04:26.670> fine<00:04:27.060> mechanical<00:04:27.600> work<00:04:27.720> like

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
trying to do fine mechanical work like

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.930 
trying to do fine mechanical work like
starting<00:04:28.230> a<00:04:28.290> screw<00:04:28.560> or<00:04:28.590> something<00:04:29.130> makes<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:29.910> a

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
starting a screw or something makes it a

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.880 
starting a screw or something makes it a
little<00:04:30.000> bit<00:04:30.300> difficult<00:04:30.510> once<00:04:31.170> again<00:04:31.380> I<00:04:31.410> can't

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
little bit difficult once again I can't

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.280 
little bit difficult once again I can't
stress<00:04:32.130> enough<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:33.420> mechanic<00:04:33.870> ones<00:04:34.080> are

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
stress enough I the mechanic ones are

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.720 
stress enough I the mechanic ones are
the<00:04:34.410> ones<00:04:34.530> that<00:04:34.680> I<00:04:34.830> went<00:04:35.010> for<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.340> most<00:04:35.550> I

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
the ones that I went for the most I

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.760 
the ones that I went for the most I
tried<00:04:36.000> all<00:04:36.330> these<00:04:36.600> here<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.110> I<00:04:37.500> use<00:04:37.650> the

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
tried all these here and I use the

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.750 
tried all these here and I use the
mechanic<00:04:38.160> ones<00:04:38.450> these<00:04:39.450> are<00:04:40.040> impact<00:04:41.040> vibration

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
mechanic ones these are impact vibration

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.390 
mechanic ones these are impact vibration
and<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.870> reason<00:04:43.110> why<00:04:43.260> is<00:04:43.320> because<00:04:43.680> they<00:04:44.220> have

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
and the reason why is because they have

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.820 
and the reason why is because they have
these<00:04:44.750> the<00:04:45.750> special<00:04:46.110> padding<00:04:46.440> on<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.560> palms

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
these the special padding on the palms

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.550 
these the special padding on the palms
now<00:04:47.100> I<00:04:47.130> did<00:04:47.460> not<00:04:47.550> use<00:04:47.760> these<00:04:47.910> at<00:04:48.090> all<00:04:48.270> why

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
now I did not use these at all why

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.090 
now I did not use these at all why
because<00:04:49.560> it<00:04:49.650> didn't<00:04:49.800> have<00:04:49.890> any<00:04:50.040> the

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
because it didn't have any the

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.090 
because it didn't have any the
fingertips<00:04:50.550> and<00:04:51.320> if<00:04:52.320> I'm<00:04:52.620> trying<00:04:52.800> to<00:04:52.920> stay

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
fingertips and if I'm trying to stay

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.860 
fingertips and if I'm trying to stay
clean<00:04:53.280> which<00:04:53.490> is<00:04:53.520> mostly<00:04:54.030> why<00:04:54.360> I<00:04:54.390> use<00:04:54.630> the

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
clean which is mostly why I use the

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.440 
clean which is mostly why I use the
gloves<00:04:55.140> in<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:56.070> past<00:04:56.310> was<00:04:56.730> to<00:04:56.760> try<00:04:57.120> to<00:04:57.180> keep<00:04:57.360> my

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
gloves in the past was to try to keep my

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.420 
gloves in the past was to try to keep my
hands<00:04:57.660> relatively<00:04:58.140> clean<00:04:58.560> so<00:04:59.130> I<00:04:59.190> could<00:04:59.340> go

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
hands relatively clean so I could go

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.430 
hands relatively clean so I could go
from<00:04:59.610> car<00:04:59.790> to<00:04:59.820> car<00:04:59.940> to<00:05:00.180> car<00:05:00.360> I<00:05:00.630> wouldn't<00:05:01.290> be

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
from car to car to car I wouldn't be

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.080 
from car to car to car I wouldn't be
able<00:05:01.500> to<00:05:01.590> do<00:05:01.740> that<00:05:01.890> with<00:05:02.010> these<00:05:02.160> but<00:05:02.430> if<00:05:02.670> you're

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
able to do that with these but if you're

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.050 
able to do that with these but if you're
using<00:05:03.330> an<00:05:03.510> impact<00:05:03.840> gun<00:05:04.050> a<00:05:04.110> lot<00:05:04.350> you<00:05:05.340> may<00:05:05.550> notice

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
using an impact gun a lot you may notice

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.670 
using an impact gun a lot you may notice
that<00:05:06.090> your<00:05:06.360> wrist<00:05:06.630> starts<00:05:06.900> to<00:05:06.990> hurt<00:05:07.170> and

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
that your wrist starts to hurt and

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.360 
that your wrist starts to hurt and
sometimes<00:05:08.550> your<00:05:08.700> hand<00:05:08.970> can<00:05:09.210> get<00:05:09.390> numb<00:05:10.370> that's

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
sometimes your hand can get numb that's

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.640 
sometimes your hand can get numb that's
what<00:05:11.550> these<00:05:11.640> guys<00:05:11.880> would<00:05:12.570> be<00:05:12.690> good<00:05:12.840> for<00:05:13.050> but<00:05:13.530> my

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
them through the wash yet but I'm sure

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.260 
them through the wash yet but I'm sure
you<00:05:50.220> could<00:05:50.370> run<00:05:50.580> these<00:05:50.670> through<00:05:50.850> the<00:05:50.940> washer

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.710 
and clean them up and use them over and
over<00:05:52.950> so<00:05:53.100> this<00:05:53.160> this<00:05:53.820> is<00:05:53.880> the<00:05:54.090> other<00:05:54.300> advantage
