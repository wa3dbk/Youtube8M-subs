00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
power yeah as you can see it's a pretty

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.470 
power yeah as you can see it's a pretty
small<00:02:12.630> deer<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.460> got<00:02:14.610> down<00:02:14.760> low<00:02:15.000> over<00:02:15.300> the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
small deer and I got down low over the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.360 
small deer and I got down low over the
ice<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:16.110> was<00:02:16.350> actually<00:02:16.500> blowing<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:17.100> lot<00:02:17.220> of

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
ice I was actually blowing a lot of

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.830 
ice I was actually blowing a lot of
stuff<00:02:17.640> on<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.910> eyes<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.450> thought<00:02:18.660> well

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
stuff on the eyes so I thought well

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.200 
stuff on the eyes so I thought well
maybe<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.890> could<00:02:20.160> get<00:02:20.250> close<00:02:20.550> enough<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.910> where

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
maybe I could get close enough to where

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.120 
maybe I could get close enough to where
if<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:21.750> beer<00:02:22.020> gets<00:02:22.260> his<00:02:22.380> back<00:02:22.620> feet<00:02:22.890> out

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
if this beer gets his back feet out

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.130 
if this beer gets his back feet out

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
which I was worried that it would come

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.620 
which I was worried that it would come
out<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.430> could<00:02:26.610> just<00:02:26.760> blow<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.180> over<00:02:27.360> to

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630
