unsavable<00:02:07.140> yeah<00:02:08.140> that's<00:02:08.410> what<00:02:08.560> it<00:02:08.679> sort<00:02:08.800> of

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
unsavable yeah that's what it sort of

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.020 
unsavable yeah that's what it sort of
looks<00:02:08.920> like<00:02:09.160> obviously<00:02:09.729> it's<00:02:09.820> not<00:02:10.030> perfect

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
looks like obviously it's not perfect

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.580 
looks like obviously it's not perfect
you<00:02:13.030> know<00:02:13.209> but<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:13.630> mean<00:02:13.870> once<00:02:14.170> it's<00:02:14.290> actually

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
you know but I mean once it's actually

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
most of it you won't notice I'm gonna

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.640 
most of it you won't notice I'm gonna
get<00:02:58.000> them<00:02:58.480> done<00:02:58.660> in<00:02:58.720> black<00:03:00.660> I'm<00:03:01.660> not<00:03:01.900> going<00:03:02.530> to

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
get them done in black I'm not going to

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.460 
get them done in black I'm not going to
actually<00:03:02.770> get<00:03:03.190> these<00:03:03.340> done<00:03:04.440> anymore

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
actually get these done anymore

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.110 
actually get these done anymore
originally<00:03:06.070> I<00:03:06.250> was<00:03:06.400> going<00:03:06.550> to<00:03:06.640> get<00:03:06.760> this<00:03:06.850> done

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
originally I was going to get this done

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.520 
originally I was going to get this done
but<00:03:07.630> okay<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.590> should<00:03:08.830> say<00:03:08.980> I<00:03:09.220> found<00:03:09.460> a<00:03:09.640> video

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
but okay I should say I found a video

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.090 
but okay I should say I found a video
made<00:03:11.530> by<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.860> one<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.280> only<00:03:12.340> fragment<00:03:12.940> of<00:03:13.030> car

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
made by the one and only fragment of car

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.930 
made by the one and only fragment of car
that<00:03:15.990> showed<00:03:16.990> off<00:03:17.140> his

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
that showed off his

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.930 
that showed off his
foot<00:03:19.600> pegs<00:03:19.990> and<00:03:20.410> I<00:03:21.040> really<00:03:21.280> liked<00:03:21.460> them<00:03:21.580> so<00:03:21.730> I

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
foot pegs and I really liked them so I

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.080 
foot pegs and I really liked them so I
decided<00:03:22.570> I'll<00:03:23.530> go<00:03:23.770> and<00:03:24.580> get<00:03:25.030> that<00:03:25.560> he's<00:03:26.560> got

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
decided I'll go and get that he's got

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.410 
decided I'll go and get that he's got
another<00:03:28.090> thing<00:03:28.330> I<00:03:28.450> had<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.720> do<00:03:29.220> was<00:03:30.270> with<00:03:31.270> this

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
another thing I had to do was with this

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.360 
another thing I had to do was with this
brake<00:03:31.630> lever<00:03:34.530> where<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.800> previous<00:03:36.190> owner

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
brake lever where the previous owner

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.550 
brake lever where the previous owner
didn't<00:03:37.180> really<00:03:37.450> care<00:03:37.690> too<00:03:37.840> much<00:03:37.870> about<00:03:38.080> his

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
didn't really care too much about his

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.370 
didn't really care too much about his
see<00:03:39.160> what<00:03:40.030> he'd<00:03:40.180> done<00:03:40.390> is<00:03:40.720> he<00:03:40.810> had<00:03:40.900> dropped<00:03:41.110> it

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
see what he'd done is he had dropped it

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.330 
see what he'd done is he had dropped it
in<00:03:41.830> such<00:03:42.610> a<00:03:42.640> way<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.780> peg<00:03:44.050> had<00:03:44.440> dug<00:03:44.950> in<00:03:45.130> and

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
in such a way the peg had dug in and

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.930 
in such a way the peg had dug in and
made<00:03:45.750> very<00:03:46.750> deep<00:03:48.780> marks<00:03:49.780> basically<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:51.730> what

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
made very deep marks basically and what

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.890 
made very deep marks basically and what
I<00:03:51.970> had<00:03:52.120> to<00:03:52.150> do<00:03:52.390> is<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:53.470> had<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:53.770> file<00:03:54.010> it<00:03:54.190> out<00:03:54.900> into

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
I had to do is I had to file it out into

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.810 
I had to do is I had to file it out into
the<00:03:55.990> same<00:03:56.200> shape<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:56.770> then<00:03:56.890> sand<00:03:57.160> it<00:03:57.280> down<00:03:57.310> so

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
the same shape and then sand it down so

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.010 
the same shape and then sand it down so
it<00:03:57.940> looks<00:03:58.000> pretty<00:03:59.490> so<00:04:02.100> as<00:04:03.100> if<00:04:03.280> nothing<00:04:03.670> ever

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
it looks pretty so as if nothing ever

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.350 
it looks pretty so as if nothing ever
happened<00:04:05.020> I<00:04:05.080> mean<00:04:05.230> there<00:04:05.410> are<00:04:05.440> a<00:04:05.500> few<00:04:05.650> marks

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
happened I mean there are a few marks

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.740 
happened I mean there are a few marks
still<00:04:07.360> but<00:04:07.930> once<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.260> powder<00:04:08.410> coats<00:04:08.710> on<00:04:08.860> that

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
still but once the powder coats on that

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.220 
still but once the powder coats on that
hopefully<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:10.840> shouldn't<00:04:11.140> even<00:04:11.230> notice<00:04:13.230> the

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
hopefully you shouldn't even notice the

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.320 
hopefully you shouldn't even notice the
aim<00:04:15.030> them<00:04:16.030> well<00:04:16.540> right

aim them well right

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.530 
aim them well right
engine-wise<00:04:19.980> still<00:04:20.980> here<00:04:21.160> obviously<00:04:21.459> as<00:04:22.300> you

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
engine-wise still here obviously as you

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.689 
engine-wise still here obviously as you
can<00:04:22.690> see

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
can see

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:30.589 
can see

00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:38.379 
hopefully he'll shoot I'm hoping it'll

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:40.140 
hopefully he'll shoot I'm hoping it'll
go<00:04:38.500> off<00:04:38.560> at<00:04:38.710> the<00:04:38.770> same<00:04:38.889> time<00:04:39.129> as<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.580> frame<00:04:39.819> and

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
go off at the same time as the frame and

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.279 
go off at the same time as the frame and
stuff<00:04:41.759> so<00:04:42.759> it<00:04:42.819> should<00:04:43.000> all<00:04:43.150> kind<00:04:43.870> of<00:04:43.960> be<00:04:44.139> done

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
stuff so it should all kind of be done

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.080 
stuff so it should all kind of be done
together<00:04:44.439> although<00:04:45.159> I<00:04:45.310> think<00:04:45.490> I'm<00:04:45.729> gonna<00:04:45.849> send
