00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 that there are people today I bring them the 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.700
 true history of pokemon history 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.160
 complete where did they come from what 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.410
 they feed xd xd xd without more than talking 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.630
 let's start the pokemon are creatures 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.030
 strange which will replace the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.940
 existing fauna on the planet casting 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.310
 by land God's theory is not yet 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.570
 evidence that they can mate 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.119
 successfully with his distant relatives 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.310
 the digimon is being experienced at 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.039
 respect as there is not much information 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.599
 even some argue that simply not 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.430
 agrees with the theory that 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.800
 dinosaurs and dogs existed 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.020
 turning these strangers into a myth 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.210
 others claim that the adventure 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.040
 develops in the not too distant future in 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.800
 which is an insemination of 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.450
 extraterrestrial life on earth 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.030
 extinguishing pre-existing species 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.399
 all except the human which accomplishes 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.870
 tame the new beings other 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.000
 propose that it is only a possibility 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.850
 parallel to the theory of the origin of the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.370
 life by spontaneous creation history 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.010
 it does not have a lot of history itself 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.960
 a boy of 10 or 11 years old weird and 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.580
 obsessed with the pokemon to the degree of 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.740
 suffer from the disease that we named 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.140
 because filial 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.270
 the boy is called ace ketchup and 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.299
 I wanted to become a pokemon master 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.330
 extinguishing them I say catching the a 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.210
 all this child goes on a trip with the 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.950
 excuse to catch yourself example capture 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.200
 any pokemon that crosses it by the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.210
 way when he actually leaves home 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.979
 at an early age because of his mother 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.619
 it's a whore bitch slut that wants 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.200
 flirt with the teacher oak I say the 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.929
 diseases suffered by his mother 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.640
 boy curiously does not have father there 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.229
 various theories that deal with 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.509
 who some say was 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.240
 marine and would have been part 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.220
 of the Vietnam squad others claim that 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.590
 is a gray haired teacher and grandfather of 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.360
 oak there are even people who risk that 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.549
 actually his father is the head of 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.380
 team rocket unfinished theories due 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.450
 to the hectic life of the mother for me 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.819
 allocation of a game between brock and 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.039
 the two geese of the rock &amp; james team and 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.170
 boots to start the trip you have to 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.179
 meet a scientist too 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.520
 because physical lover of the pokemon that 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.860
 is dedicated to studying and raising them for 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.810
 give him one of his own as he was late to 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.880
 the repartition awarded him the last 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.650
 it was the most stupid and deficient 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.530
 that I was only able to repeat a 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.510
 word among these the different this 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.880
 it was a cardiac yellow rat is 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.710
 beautiful skillful mind manipulator that 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.020
 the teacher pulled out from between some cables 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.510
 who were chewing his name was 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.030
 pikachu and from that moment it would be 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.040
 your master supreme cheerful companion besides 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.840
 of the diseases that suffered from this 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.910
 mouse was highlighted by some powers 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.280
 characteristics that all the 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.160

 with friends who join you on your trip 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.730
 mere interest a smith and a girl 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.200
 spoiled and badly combed he became obsessed 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.820
 to follow the ego is only for the money 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.400
 I owed him when he broke the 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.500
 bicycle is also joined by a stranger 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.540
 Brunette who has no eyes called broke 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.270
 who is terribly obsessed by 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.610
 the pokemon breasts was expelled from his 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.560
 village by pedophile physical poke when 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.780
 they found him in the middle of an orgy 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.390
 together his seven younger brothers who 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.950
 then leaves with his evil father fits 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.930
 mention that he is a disgusting and 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.730
 ambitious unhappy that when bored 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.720
 of his partner changes it for another more 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.060
 stupid and curved 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.040
 Among them is a cock that has 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.870
 stupid pokemons that only serve to 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.820
 enter the pokemon contests since 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.160
 obviously they are fixed because their 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.960
 enemies are disgustingly homosexual 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.940
 arrogant but dismisses it as this 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.190
 falls in love with a green metrosexual movie 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.590
 and apart she is tired of exploitation 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.990
 sexual attitude of h goes on a trip with 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.970
 a gay with bad taste of fashion so 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.740
 you got another stupider even though you 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.630
 called down since he has that syndrome and 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.840
 who is 10 years old though what below 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.670
 of the miniskirt say otherwise 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.400
 obviously a series would not be complete 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.380
 without an enemy in this case they are a trio 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.510
 of complexed with clothes of the 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.850
 70 and out of series hairstyles that go 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.700
 accompanied by a talking cat pokémon 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.500
 and is as beast as its owners 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.990
 he also has another enemy that is gary 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.260
 pacifist less sick and much more 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.000
 successful that the failure of ace the origin 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.650
 it is assumed that the story told by 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.590
 pokemon happens in the future not very 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.870
 distant one track of this extinction in 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.750
 mass is when in a chapter the mother of 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.580
 us says look at a pokémon type dog this 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.380
 highlights our theory that 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.320
 once in the past there were 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.090
 dogs in recent years has 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.030
 shuffled the determinist theory of 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.770
 pokemon that enunciates no matter how you are 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.330
 there is at least one pokemon that you 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.220
 you seem different studies have 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.530
 demonstrated this theory with greater or lesser 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.480
 success but certainly the one that we proceed to 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.700
 show is the most irrefutable proof of 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.010
 how many have this simple compiled 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.200
 diagram clearly demonstrates the theory 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.150
 determinist of the pokemon and therefore the 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.130
 Darwin's lies must be understood 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.110
 as obsolete and humanity must 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.020
 accept that it comes from the pokemon not from 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.120
 good site actually yes that proceeds 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.340
 of the ape but the ape also proceeds 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.200
 of polemic pokemon among others 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.480
 things have also commented that 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.130
 some songs of course created 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.230
 by fans of all ages 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.420
 transmitted in the episodes of said 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.030
 series contain the so-called messages 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.590
 subliminals to mention some are 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.240
 the rap poke is supposed to say 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.980
 messages are exposed to the 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.930
 be mentioned in an inverted way 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.910
 names of the pokemon monsters and the 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.250
 melody of the team rocket you hear 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.200
 references to various blasphemy like 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.100
 that the mont is vol is not the only god or 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.410
 that Catholicism is the religion true 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.470
 I knew that pokemon has a list 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.710
 quite complete of 493 pokémons 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.330
 cataloged and described as ketchup and 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.700
 company are a Russian attempt of 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.340
 control the pokemon world has been 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.630
 become a religion 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.250
 arcelús is the creator god of the 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.130
 pokemon if you say that because of your hatred for 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.110
 mones ball also created this fashion what 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.990
 only good thing about this franchise are its 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.610
 video games and they were not mentioned in 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.590
 this article 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.510
 in South Park there is a chapter where 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.730
 refers to these bugs called 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.270
 shampoo as it does not have a demand towards 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:12.420
 digimon for 12-3 thousand 434 million 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:16.120
 dollars because pikachu is not picha mont

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.980
 with curb and graphs rules and coins 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.900
 just like you go fuck you hyo and the 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.990
 new pokémon came out of the strokes of 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.940
 a child down of 3 years 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.790
 people eat more ketchup for being 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:42.780
