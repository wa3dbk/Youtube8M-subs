00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.150
 I will now try to teach you how to play with my old 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:06.630
 Daniel Guichard 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.429
 it's a runestone way missing 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.019
 to do it again because I left Kyrgyzstan 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.849
 it's my paper version 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.999
 as right following the lyrics of the song 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:23.999
 he will lose these are different chords and artists 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.919
 article written on the other hand I am mainly of the fact 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.919
 what's life like I start like this and it starts with a 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.790
 04 12 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.570
 not complicated complicated for it's a commando on the back 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.520
 Pierrot agree with the bad weather 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.520
 for a while his full 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.320
 because it's complicated to inch to follow 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.320
 then the second 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.680
 left 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.430
 accor in France 5% to 4 2% 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.430
 arkansas what but here 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.570
 so that makes 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.660
 because it's downhill 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:29.789
 a bracelet 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:47.649
 then I go back down public contracts 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:50.779
 so we come down to face the cold 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.779
 airport 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.079
 that's okay 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.009
 it's the second different time of another 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.289
 we can add a chord simply with a sweet sun and friends 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.709
 vassallo 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:57.989
 eh yes 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.989
 before the left and the right 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.840
 for the right as on the left it is this agreement 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.439
 or not 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.539
 jack 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:49.029
 heat 

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:06.559
 difficult to do without 11 to 3 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:09.559
 because in his report 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.619
 for 48 hours in the final Friday 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:19.619
 from day to day the trumpet 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:40.699
 i hope that m 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:42.939
 click on this song for my best 

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:45.939
 it's not easy to explain why I prefer to play again 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:48.050
 explanations 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.819
 I hope it will serve us if you have any questions 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:53.029
 I'm trying 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:54.249
 in fact better next time
