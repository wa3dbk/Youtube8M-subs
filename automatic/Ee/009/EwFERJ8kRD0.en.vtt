00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
how to use the title command of in

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.339 
how to use the title command of in
Minecraft<00:00:28.050> now<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.830> title<00:00:29.550> command<00:00:29.849> was<00:00:30.359> used

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
Minecraft now the title command was used

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.350 
Minecraft now the title command was used
or<00:00:32.279> even<00:00:32.730> created<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.450> 14<00:00:33.989> w<00:00:34.350> 20<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
or even created in 14 w 20 a and the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.440 
or even created in 14 w 20 a and the
snapshot<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:36.899> I'm<00:00:36.989> using<00:00:37.200> right<00:00:37.469> now<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:38.030> 25<00:00:39.030> be

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
snapshot so I'm using right now is 25 be

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.569 
snapshot so I'm using right now is 25 be
so<00:00:40.079> make<00:00:40.260> sure<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.950> most<00:00:41.070> recent

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
so make sure you have the most recent

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.600 
so make sure you have the most recent
snapshot<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.110> minimize<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.399> amount

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
snapshot so that we minimize the amount

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.380 
snapshot so that we minimize the amount
of<00:00:44.910> bugs<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.680> forth<00:00:46.829> but<00:00:47.520> as

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
of bugs and so on and so forth but as

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.240 
of bugs and so on and so forth but as
you<00:00:48.510> guys<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.809> see<00:00:48.870> right<00:00:49.140> here<00:00:49.350> there<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.890> a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.250 
you guys can see right here there is a
actual<00:00:51.059> command<00:00:51.360> as<00:00:51.719> /<00:00:52.530> title<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:54.180> I'm<00:00:55.050> going

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
actual command as / title and I'm going

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.229 
actual command as / title and I'm going
to<00:00:55.350> go<00:00:55.530> through<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.100> guys<00:00:56.250> how<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.699> do<00:00:57.090> it

to go through of you guys how to do it

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.270 
to go through of you guys how to do it
now<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> description<00:00:58.800> there's<00:00:59.010> going<00:00:59.190> to

now in the description there's going to

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.490 
now in the description there's going to
be<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.399> paste<00:00:59.760> bin<00:01:00.030> link<00:01:00.359> which<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.109> going<00:01:01.289> to

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
be a paste bin link which is going to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.240 
be a paste bin link which is going to
contain<00:01:02.070> some<00:01:03.030> text<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.899> within<00:01:04.619> those<00:01:04.799> texts

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
contain some text and within those texts

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.149 
contain some text and within those texts
are<00:01:05.280> going<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.580> be<00:01:05.700> two<00:01:06.320> commands<00:01:07.320> which<00:01:07.950> are

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
are going to be two commands which are

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.219 
are going to be two commands which are
two<00:01:08.460> templates<00:01:08.939> I've<00:01:09.150> created<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.960> guys

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
easier so in this first command block

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.660 
easier so in this first command block
right<00:01:16.020> here<00:01:16.049> what<00:01:16.500> we're<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.920> do<00:01:17.159> is

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
we're going to use our first command

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.679 
we're going to use our first command
which<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.360> course<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.840> /<00:01:22.409> title<00:01:22.950> command

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
which is of course the / title command

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.649 
which is of course the / title command
but<00:01:24.689> we<00:01:25.080> are<00:01:25.290> referring<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.280> at<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:27.150> meaning

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
but we are referring it to at a meaning

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.109 
but we are referring it to at a meaning
all<00:01:27.960> players<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.640> guys<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:30.060> see

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
right here we have to specify a mode for

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.649 
right here we have to specify a mode for
the<00:01:34.680> command<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.909> are<00:01:35.970> using<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.630> title<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659
