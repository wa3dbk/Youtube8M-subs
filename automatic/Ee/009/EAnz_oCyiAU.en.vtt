00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
didn't notice in my stats I've got a

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.700 
didn't notice in my stats I've got a
dungeoneering<00:00:21.180> level<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:22.050> fishing<00:00:22.410> levels

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
dungeoneering level to fishing levels

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.650 
dungeoneering level to fishing levels
and<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.430> believe<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> crafting<00:00:24.330> level<00:00:24.539> as<00:00:24.630> well

and I believe a crafting level as well

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.179 
and I believe a crafting level as well
so<00:00:25.019> that's<00:00:25.140> going<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.410> making<00:00:25.680> progress<00:00:25.830> while

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
so that's going to making progress while

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.300 
so that's going to making progress while
