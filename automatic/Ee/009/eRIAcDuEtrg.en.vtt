00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
I see if we can make that out on there

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.770 
I see if we can make that out on there
there<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.799> go<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.640> middle<00:01:53.939> play<00:01:54.539> pause

I'm<00:03:17.890> gonna<00:03:18.190> guess<00:03:18.580> I<00:03:18.820> mean<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.090> would<00:03:19.420> be<00:03:19.450> mean

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
I'm gonna guess I mean it would be mean

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.229 
I'm gonna guess I mean it would be mean
to<00:03:19.989> say<00:03:20.170> without<00:03:20.470> testing<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.070> but<00:03:21.370> I'm<00:03:22.090> gonna

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
to say without testing it but I'm gonna

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.699 
to say without testing it but I'm gonna
guess<00:03:22.480> that<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.840> headphones<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.320> come<00:03:23.560> with

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
guess that the headphones that come with

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.020 
guess that the headphones that come with
it<00:03:23.739> aren't<00:03:24.010> gonna<00:03:24.130> be<00:03:24.310> superb<00:03:24.820> quality

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
it aren't gonna be superb quality

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.330 
it aren't gonna be superb quality
they're<00:03:25.480> just<00:03:25.600> gonna<00:03:25.720> be<00:03:25.900> bog-standard<00:03:26.140> so<00:03:26.800> if

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
they're just gonna be bog-standard so if

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.430 
they're just gonna be bog-standard so if
you're<00:03:27.519> AB<00:03:27.640> your<00:03:27.880> own<00:03:28.000> set<00:03:28.390> like<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.989> like<00:03:29.230> to
