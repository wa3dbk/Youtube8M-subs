00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:04.470
 I do not know if you remember me but I'm the one who lived a few months ago 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.450

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.669
 known by his best friends wildcard sum owed chuc will know why 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.779
 a so you're the interviewer 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.189
 oo sobhi your fucking mother 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.650
 uli forgive me is that I respond aggressively when they tell me things 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:30.669
 obvious 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.390
 if you do not mind I'm going to say a few words and you tell me what you think 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.070
 think or know about them 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.050
 I do not know what that coherence has 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.250
 but anyway at least I will not have to think much about the answers 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.810
 douchebag 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.780
 I honestly do not know what that word means 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.560
 many times they tell me that I am, so I guess it will be some kind of 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:52.490
 praise 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.870

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.830
 is better than internet explorer since it has tabs the sites are displayed 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.760
 better and viruses do not enter 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.410
 I will never know what they do not understand their instructions they always say put 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.100

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.490
