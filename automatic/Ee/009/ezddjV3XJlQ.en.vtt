00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
like you guys couldn't translate your

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.360 
like you guys couldn't translate your
advantage<00:00:58.109> fast<00:00:58.440> enough<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:58.920> what<00:00:59.190> do<00:00:59.280> you

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
advantage fast enough so what do you

advantage fast enough so what do you
think<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.670> should<00:00:59.850> have<00:00:59.940> done<00:01:00.090> between<00:01:00.270> early

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
think you should have done between early

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.840 
think you should have done between early
and<00:01:00.870> mid<00:01:00.989> game<00:01:01.309> nother<00:01:02.309> thing<00:01:02.460> there's<00:01:02.699> much

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
and mid game nother thing there's much

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.670 
and mid game nother thing there's much
we<00:01:03.000> could<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.210> done<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.420> was<00:01:03.989> mostly<00:01:04.559> about

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
we could have done it was mostly about

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.760 
we could have done it was mostly about
