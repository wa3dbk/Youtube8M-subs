00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.219
 good really invisible as your own 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.790
 indicated name is that part of the 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.650
 training that sometimes does not 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.080
 we contemplate or we do not have so much in 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.150
 account is not we could talk about what is 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.119
 that part that takes place just 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.250
 just finish the training 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.349
 physical or training as such good 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.860
 be by bicycle race and others 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.450
 would be that part that happens from the 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.670
 first minute of finishing the 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.649
 training until we start the 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.570
 next training either in the 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.570
 same day or the next day 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.860
 if there is a bit is that part let's say 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.470
 complementary to what is proper 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.570
 training itself where we included 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.210
 different sections or different 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.010
 aspects that we will allow on 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.409
 all take a leap of quality and 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.479
 assimilation of our work as well 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.479
 you say are those sections where 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.119
 We can include the hours of sleep where 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.009
 we can include the rest of one's own 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.259
 nap day where we can 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.950
 include feeding hydration 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.979
 hygiene the level equilibrium 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.690
 psychological including those others 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.500
 means of recovery that we can have 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.990
 through physiotherapy osteopathy 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.170
 cryotherapy 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.210
 even more traditional methods like 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.950
 they can be complementary work to 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.950
 justice flexibility level 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.520
 today in elite sport the 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.630
 invisible training is something that 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.299
 practically everyone lives with 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.100
 them even where right now they are 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.159
 developing in the main advances 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.130
 if we analyze carefully we will give 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.709
 mind that nowadays to become 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.630
 Olympic medalist are going to be those 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.579
 small details that give you that 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.740
 puntito or that quality jump is going to 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.370
 improve a tenth we have it in 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.260
 sports where winning or losing is in 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.390
 very small factors such as the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.079
 swimming or even in races of 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.260
 athletics where in the end by small 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:24.360
 tenths of seconds it is ruled who 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.579
 is champion or who is your champion and 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.489
 possibly that difference may be 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:32.280
 very linked to that process we talked about 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.170
 impossible training of those 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.690
 aspects taken care of in a very much way 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.489
 more thorough and without going any further 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.489
 can come now to the head a little 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.109
 as aspects of a 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.410
 sportsman that right now is very 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.630
 boga he 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.460
 in national sport and worldwide 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.560
 that it can be mireia belmonte that 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.680
 recently his coach talked about 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.450
 that one of the steps or the points that 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.190
 had included in their process 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.510
 training was to control the quality 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.510
 of sleep in at night 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.420
 anyone has access to training 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.610
 invisible is mainly linked 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:17.060
 to an educational process is more than 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.040
 let's say its putting us an effort from 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.810
 the economic point of view from the 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.410
 point of view 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.030
 the logistics is an internal matter of 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.860
 want to do things well is a 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.099
 question of acquiring habits of 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.900
 educate ourselves about what we should do 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.230
 just finish our training 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.200
 and possibly our improvement our 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.390
 performance increase always 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.190
 attending our level many times 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.019
 is going to come marked by those little ones 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.209
 details and not so much why you should 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.400
 train train more today 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.400
 Quality prevails over quantity 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.970
 there are aspects that are common and aspects 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.209
 that aspects do not logically coincide 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.220
 common can come marked by hours 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.440
 of sleep may come marked by 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.840
 recovery processes well be with 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.600
 a professional in the field or with 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.950
 alternative media but then there are other 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.510
 issues related to 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.910
 invisible training at the level of 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.380
 hydration at the feeding level that 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.690
 will come marked by the kind of 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.000
 effort does not have the same expense 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.430
 has the same energy source a 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.590
 football or indoor soccer player 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.270
 a marathoner with which that part of 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.520
 invisible training even if we talk 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.430
 of feeding can not be the same 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.900
 feeding for a sportsman of 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.030
 individual sport or long 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.590
 endurance and a sports athlete 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.990
 collective whose efforts are 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.310
 intermittent whose level needs 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.310
 metabolic are other 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:53.909
 d 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:56.339
 provided that seeks improves 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:58.499
 invisible training is the pillar 

00:04:56.339 --> 00:05:00.869
 basic in which we have to support us 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:02.849
 There comes a time where our ability 

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:05.539
 of adaptation to training and 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:08.369
 others have a process of stagnation 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:12.529
 then we have to get out of that state 

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:14.669
 of stagnation by changing certain things 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:17.279
 many of those things are going to come 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.809
 unconsciously linked to 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:21.990
 invisible training from the 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:23.879
 ignorance for example that 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.930
 sportsman who wants to improve his brand 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:29.129
 in a 10- kilometer race and that 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.289
 determines that your solution is in 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:32.699
 Take off the kilos you are doing 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.189
 resorting to invisible training 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:38.339
 with the purpose of removing the kilos 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:40.770
 what happens that possibly to the best 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:43.199
 we made that decision to take away two 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.330
 kilos in an inadequate way because no 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.159
 it is the same to resort to taking away two 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.169
 kilos from a control the 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:51.659
 feed you resort to take away two 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.599
 kilos because he stopped eating what my 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:57.150
 body demands me to try to improve 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:06:00.150
 then unconsciously it is done 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.130
 success is being able to have control 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.920
 about that invisible training equal 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.870
 that we control the time in our 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.270
 series is the same as we control the time 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.920
 when we go running we must also 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.550
 to have control over that 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.550
 invisible training 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:23.219
 and talking about an exact data is complicated 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.729
 because you would have to test what would 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:28.680
 assess from a point of view of 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.539
 studies and others but we can 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.169
 be talking about an improvement 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:36.419
 of 10 15 20 percent depending on the 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.699
 level that the athlete has when 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:41.580
 we talk about percentages practically 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:44.879
 between 10 15 20 percent if you 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:49.219
 we extrapolate on time in a test x is 

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:53.249
 a long time then in the end yes that 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:56.969
 possibly if our level limit 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:59.159
 of genetics is close to the maximum and 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:02.189
 we want to make a leap in quality 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:04.409
 that margin is possibly reduced in 

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:06.029
 an elite athlete can even 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:08.939
 reduce much more than we talked about 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:10.710
 because he already has some control over that 

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:14.520
 and what they have to do is to spin very thin 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:16.589
 but in people that we say that it leads 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.870
 certain habits no longer all of the 

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:21.330
 invisible training the improvement in 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:25.639
 that is going to assume in your performance is 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.639
 a qualitative and quantitative improvement 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.449
 recently in 2002
