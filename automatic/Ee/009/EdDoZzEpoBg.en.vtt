00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
discussed the Celtics draft philosophy

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.100 
discussed the Celtics draft philosophy
this<00:00:11.070> year<00:00:11.460> as<00:00:11.610> well<00:00:12.120> as<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.420> potential<00:00:12.960> to

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
this year as well as the potential to

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.300 
this year as well as the potential to
trade<00:00:13.349> up<00:00:13.790> generally<00:00:14.790> speaking<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.299> the

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:16.310 
trade up generally speaking that the

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.439 
trade up generally speaking that the
philosophy<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.910> know<00:00:18.029> drafting

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
philosophy is that you know drafting

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.500 
philosophy is that you know drafting
more<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:19.080> typically<00:00:19.500> better<00:00:20.270> because<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.420> get

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
more is typically better because you get

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.150 
more is typically better because you get
more<00:00:21.720> cracks<00:00:22.020> at<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.800> know<00:00:22.830> there's<00:00:23.100> a

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
more cracks at it and you know there's a

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.920 
more cracks at it and you know there's a
lot<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.550> really<00:00:24.000> good<00:00:24.150> players<00:00:24.300> around<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
lot of really good players around the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.859 
lot of really good players around the
league<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:25.350> are<00:00:25.529> 15<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:26.160> 30<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.760> 40<00:00:27.240> that's

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
league that are 15 to 30 to 40 that's

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.700 
league that are 15 to 30 to 40 that's
picks<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> draft<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.750> sometimes

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
picks in the draft and so and sometimes

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.319 
picks in the draft and so and sometimes
the<00:00:31.830> team<00:00:32.009> will<00:00:32.189> pick<00:00:32.460> three<00:00:32.759> pics<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.239> their

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
the team will pick three pics and their

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.819 
the team will pick three pics and their
best<00:00:33.540> player<00:00:33.809> will<00:00:34.020> be<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.290> guy<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.440> was<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
best player will be the guy that was the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.310 
best player will be the guy that was the
third<00:00:35.040> pick<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.520> they<00:00:35.670> drafted<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> think

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
third pick that they drafted so I think

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.920 
third pick that they drafted so I think
that<00:00:37.790> you<00:00:38.790> know<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:38.969> have<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.780> have<00:00:39.840> to

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
that you know you have to you have to

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.740 
that you know you have to you have to
really<00:00:40.170> identify<00:00:40.559> what<00:00:41.190> you're<00:00:41.370> what<00:00:41.670> you're

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
really identify what you're what you're

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.020 
really identify what you're what you're
capable<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:43.079> doing<00:00:43.250> with<00:00:44.250> your<00:00:44.430> assets<00:00:44.879> and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
