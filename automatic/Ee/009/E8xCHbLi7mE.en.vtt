00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.259
 Mr. Peña, grandson- so let's start 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.150
 good afternoon Mr. Peña grandson look at the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.690
 Mexican community wanted to ask 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.700
 where you buy your gel and if you have a discount 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.190
 mira juay de rito I buy it in chedraui 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.020
 because it costs less but I'll tell you my 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.570
 presidential proposals that to that 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.910
 I come I do not come to tell you about my hair 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.740
 silky with head and shoulders I think 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.500
 that no more what more do you want than you 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.689
 Tell me your proposals ok yo ay 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.000
 look at the truth is that if it came to be 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.640
 president would boost our economy 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.110
 robbing the monetary fund 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.270
 international- then with that money 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.059
 I would buy tortillas for all 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.760
 Mexicans would make Carlos Slim- deal 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.070
 his fortune to all Mexicans already by 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.649
 last would kill elba esther gordillo or 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.660
 I already know what happens after interviewing 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.489
 to elba and carlos salinas to workshop or 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.620
 this old man who stopped by I realized 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.629
 that they are all like you give proposals 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.120
 false to win and now I 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.489
 I ask the Mexicans have the courage 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.890
 or they are worth it by the way I tried 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.659
 retire and the congress does not leave me all 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.999
