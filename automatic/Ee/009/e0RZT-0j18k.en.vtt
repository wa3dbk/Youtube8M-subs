there<00:00:11.250> they<00:00:11.550> had<00:00:11.760> this<00:00:12.650> interactive<00:00:13.650> section

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
there they had this interactive section

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.599 
there they had this interactive section
where<00:00:14.370> they<00:00:14.580> had<00:00:14.880> kids<00:00:15.590> build<00:00:16.590> circuits<00:00:16.949> using

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
where they had kids build circuits using

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.220 
where they had kids build circuits using
these<00:00:18.300> snap<00:00:19.140> circuits<00:00:19.800> by<00:00:20.700> Alenko<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.630> asked

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
these snap circuits by Alenko I asked

comes like now this is very durable I've

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.600 
comes like now this is very durable I've
had<00:02:40.260> her<00:02:40.410> playing<00:02:40.799> with<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> few<00:02:41.580> times

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
had her playing with this a few times

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.900 
had her playing with this a few times
and<00:02:42.209> I<00:02:42.390> don't<00:02:42.540> see<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.019> breaking<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.910> since

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
and I don't see this breaking and since

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.410 
and I don't see this breaking and since
this<00:02:45.209> was<00:02:45.510> in<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:46.260> commercial<00:02:46.709> environment<00:02:47.420> at

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
this was in a commercial environment at

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.410 
this was in a commercial environment at
the<00:02:48.690> Museum<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:50.209> saw<00:02:51.209> that<00:02:51.599> those<00:02:52.500> items<00:02:52.890> really

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
the Museum I saw that those items really

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.150 
the Museum I saw that those items really
stood<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.599> test<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.989> time<00:02:55.200> as<00:02:55.590> far<00:02:55.769> as<00:02:55.920> which

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
stood the test of time as far as which

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.740 
stood the test of time as far as which
kid<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.700> get<00:02:57.290> that's<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.500> toughy<00:02:59.120> because<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.150> was

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
kid to get that's a toughy because I was

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.870 
kid to get that's a toughy because I was
really<00:03:01.110> contemplating<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.160> get<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.519> smaller

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
really contemplating to get the smaller

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.479 
really contemplating to get the smaller
kit<00:03:03.299> but<00:03:03.660> but<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.140> ended<00:03:04.620> up<00:03:04.739> paying<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.190> little

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
kit but but I ended up paying a little

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.210 
kit but but I ended up paying a little
more<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.940> get<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.239> complete<00:03:06.690> kit<00:03:07.220> just

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
more to get the complete kit just

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.160 
more to get the complete kit just
because<00:03:08.579> it's<00:03:08.790> much<00:03:09.090> harder<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.510> then

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
because it's much harder to then

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.190 
because it's much harder to then
complete<00:03:10.799> kits<00:03:11.190> then<00:03:11.549> then<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.540> just<00:03:12.780> get<00:03:13.049> the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
complete kits then then to just get the

complete kits then then to just get the
complete<00:03:13.590> kit<00:03:14.099> so<00:03:14.700> overall<00:03:15.329> I<00:03:15.870> really<00:03:16.290> really

understand<00:03:20.549> how<00:03:20.880> circuit<00:03:21.450> here<00:03:21.690> works<00:03:22.109> and<00:03:22.410> of

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
understand how circuit here works and of

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.819 
understand how circuit here works and of
course<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:24.120> parent<00:03:24.480> needs<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:25.200> know<00:03:25.380> how<00:03:25.739> to

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
course the parent needs to know how to

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.479 
course the parent needs to know how to
explain<00:03:26.549> stuff<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.389> child<00:03:28.040> for<00:03:29.040> them<00:03:29.190> to

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
explain stuff to the child for them to

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.520 
explain stuff to the child for them to
understand<00:03:30.209> how<00:03:30.389> things<00:03:30.840> work<00:03:31.019> otherwise

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
understand how things work otherwise

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.770 
understand how things work otherwise
it's<00:03:31.889> just<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:33.090> would<00:03:33.209> be<00:03:33.389> pretty<00:03:33.720> much

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
it's just it would be pretty much

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.069 
it's just it would be pretty much
worthless<00:03:34.560> if<00:03:35.100> there's<00:03:35.459> no<00:03:35.639> guidance<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.750> let

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
worthless if there's no guidance so let

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.569 
worthless if there's no guidance so let
me<00:03:37.170> show<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.500> some<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.859> the<00:03:37.980> products<00:03:38.459> that

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
today we did the alarm circuit and a

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.150 
today we did the alarm circuit and a
laser<00:03:53.609> gun<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.540> was<00:03:54.930> really<00:03:55.319> nice<00:03:55.530> because<00:03:55.560> I

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
laser gun it was really nice because I

laser gun it was really nice because I
you<00:03:57.000> know<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.150> showed<00:03:57.510> her<00:03:57.720> what<00:03:57.930> happens<00:03:58.349> when

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
you know I showed her what happens when

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.809 
you know I showed her what happens when
you<00:03:58.590> disconnect<00:03:58.859> some<00:03:59.549> lines<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:02.670> what

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
you disconnect some lines and and what

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.550 
you disconnect some lines and and what
happens<00:04:03.209> if<00:04:03.359> you<00:04:03.480> put<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.750> vault<00:04:04.109> divider

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
happens if you put a vault divider

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.699 
happens if you put a vault divider
somewhere<00:04:05.250> hair-like<00:04:06.090> here<00:04:06.569> we<00:04:06.780> we<00:04:07.290> added<00:04:07.620> a

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
somewhere hair-like here we we added a

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.150 
somewhere hair-like here we we added a
vault<00:04:07.950> divider<00:04:08.370> so<00:04:09.090> for<00:04:09.419> all<00:04:09.540> this<00:04:09.889> this<00:04:10.889> kit
