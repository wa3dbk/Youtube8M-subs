he has like brownish hair and yellow
hair<00:04:15.750> which<00:04:16.750> might<00:04:16.959> be<00:04:17.079> cool<00:04:17.259> depending<00:04:17.620> upon

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
hair which might be cool depending upon

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.770 
hair which might be cool depending upon
if<00:04:18.579> you<00:04:18.729> think<00:04:18.880> it<00:04:18.970> looks<00:04:19.299> good<00:04:19.479> with<00:04:19.660> more

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
if you think it looks good with more

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.210 
if you think it looks good with more
detail<00:04:20.109> I<00:04:20.259> actually<00:04:20.380> kind<00:04:20.709> of<00:04:20.739> like<00:04:20.889> it<00:04:20.919> I

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
detail I actually kind of like it I

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.570 
detail I actually kind of like it I
think<00:04:22.210> it<00:04:22.300> gives<00:04:22.419> more<00:04:22.660> texture<00:04:23.050> to<00:04:23.169> his<00:04:23.289> hair

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
think it gives more texture to his hair

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.960 
think it gives more texture to his hair
so<00:04:24.580> it's<00:04:24.759> gonna<00:04:24.970> focus<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.479> on<00:04:25.570> him<00:04:26.639> his<00:04:27.639> face

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
so it's gonna focus it on him his face

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.339 
so it's gonna focus it on him his face
is<00:04:28.240> nice<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:29.530> eyes<00:04:29.740> are<00:04:29.770> well<00:04:30.220> painted<00:04:31.349> very

nice<00:04:32.560> details<00:04:33.039> even<00:04:33.699> on<00:04:33.970> his<00:04:34.090> shoulder<00:04:34.479> pad

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
nice details even on his shoulder pad

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.890

and they even went through the trouble
even<00:05:00.120> though<00:05:00.300> you're<00:05:00.449> not<00:05:00.509> gonna<00:05:00.660> really<00:05:00.840> see

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
pattern to them as well

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.749

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.629 
it right on face he can move oh I guess
they<00:05:18.720> meant<00:05:18.900> it<00:05:19.020> like<00:05:19.139> no<00:05:19.410> probably<00:05:19.800> not<00:05:19.949> but

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
they meant it like no probably not but

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.700 
they meant it like no probably not but
it's<00:05:20.940> not<00:05:21.000> really<00:05:21.300> secure<00:05:21.720> it's<00:05:22.440> kind<00:05:22.650> of

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
it's not really secure it's kind of

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:29.640 
it's not really secure it's kind of
wobbly<00:05:24.289> sorry<00:05:25.289> let<00:05:25.440> me<00:05:25.470> zoom<00:05:25.650> that<00:05:25.889> back<00:05:26.100> out

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.150 

it's<00:05:30.220> pretty<00:05:30.460> wobbly<00:05:31.620> so<00:05:32.620> this<00:05:32.740> is<00:05:32.860> definitely

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
it's pretty wobbly so this is definitely

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.439 
it's pretty wobbly so this is definitely
not<00:05:33.250> the<00:05:33.310> kind<00:05:33.490> of<00:05:33.580> thing<00:05:33.760> that<00:05:33.790> you<00:05:33.970> want<00:05:34.210> on
