David thanks for having me Colin what
should<00:00:22.420> you<00:00:22.540> look<00:00:22.570> for<00:00:22.720> when<00:00:22.960> buying<00:00:23.230> hardware

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
should you look for when buying hardware

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.270 
should you look for when buying hardware
for<00:00:24.220> virtualization<00:00:24.730> projects<00:00:25.800> well<00:00:26.800> in<00:00:27.070> many

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.280 
for virtualization projects well in many

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.070 
for virtualization projects well in many
ways<00:00:27.490> buying<00:00:28.210> hardware<00:00:28.540> for<00:00:28.720> virtualization

ways buying hardware for virtualization

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.750 
ways buying hardware for virtualization
is<00:00:29.620> not<00:00:29.800> much<00:00:29.980> different<00:00:30.340> from<00:00:30.370> buying

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
is not much different from buying

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.030 
is not much different from buying
hardware<00:00:31.570> for<00:00:31.750> any<00:00:31.870> other<00:00:32.050> you<00:00:32.379> know<00:00:32.439> typical

and<00:00:38.109> performance<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:39.670> me<00:00:39.820> what<00:00:40.120> makes<00:00:40.149> the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
and performance to me what makes the

difference when you go shopping for
virtualization<00:00:42.730> hardware<00:00:43.600> is<00:00:43.809> that<00:00:44.440> you

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
virtualization hardware is that you

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.079 
virtualization hardware is that you
really<00:00:44.769> want<00:00:44.920> to<00:00:45.010> look<00:00:45.129> for<00:00:45.370> CPU<00:00:45.879> and<00:00:46.030> RAM

performance and expandability Ram seems
to<00:00:49.659> be<00:00:49.780> you<00:00:49.989> know<00:00:50.079> one<00:00:50.230> of<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.409> big

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
to be you know one of the big

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.529 
to be you know one of the big
bottlenecks<00:00:51.100> especially<00:00:51.760> when<00:00:51.940> you<00:00:52.030> drive<00:00:52.300> up

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
bottlenecks especially when you drive up

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.639 
bottlenecks especially when you drive up
the<00:00:52.719> consolidation<00:00:53.440> ratios<00:00:53.890> on<00:00:54.190> a<00:00:54.249> server

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
the consolidation ratios on a server

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.369 
the consolidation ratios on a server
local<00:00:56.649> storage<00:00:57.239> unlike<00:00:58.239> a<00:00:58.449> typical<00:00:58.749> physical

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379

local storage unlike a typical physical
server<00:00:59.559> local<00:00:59.979> storage<00:01:00.219> really<00:01:00.609> isn't<00:01:00.789> going

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
server local storage really isn't going

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.419 
server local storage really isn't going
to<00:01:01.030> be<00:01:01.120> that<00:01:01.649> utilized<00:01:02.649> because<00:01:02.949> you're<00:01:03.280> going

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:03.429 
to be that utilized because you're going

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.790 
to be that utilized because you're going
to<00:01:03.489> have<00:01:03.639> some<00:01:03.879> shared<00:01:04.150> storage<00:01:04.620> that<00:01:05.620> you'll

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
to have some shared storage that you'll

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.350 
to have some shared storage that you'll
be<00:01:05.950> putting<00:01:06.280> all<00:01:06.490> those<00:01:06.580> virtual<00:01:06.880> machines<00:01:06.940> on

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
be putting all those virtual machines on

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.490 
be putting all those virtual machines on
so<00:01:07.720> again<00:01:08.350> RAM<00:01:08.620> and<00:01:08.920> CPU<00:01:09.899> performance<00:01:10.899> and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
so again RAM and CPU performance and

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.490 
so again RAM and CPU performance and
expandability<00:01:12.009> is<00:01:12.310> what<00:01:12.460> I<00:01:12.490> would<00:01:12.700> look<00:01:12.820> for

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
expandability is what I would look for

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.539 
expandability is what I would look for
what<00:01:14.500> are<00:01:14.619> some<00:01:14.649> of<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:14.979> new<00:01:15.100> hardware

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
what are some of the new hardware

to virtualization well some of the
newest<00:01:20.829> virtualization<00:01:21.460> options<00:01:21.820> that<00:01:21.939> I've

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
newest virtualization options that I've

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.060 
newest virtualization options that I've
seen<00:01:22.329> that<00:01:22.450> have<00:01:22.600> been<00:01:22.689> really<00:01:22.840> exciting<00:01:23.439> the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
seen that have been really exciting the

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.130 
seen that have been really exciting the
first<00:01:24.340> one<00:01:24.610> is<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:25.030> new<00:01:25.149> cisco<00:01:25.570> unified

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
first one is the new cisco unified

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.580 
first one is the new cisco unified
computing<00:01:26.530> system<00:01:27.219> or<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:27.490> UCS<00:01:28.450> which<00:01:29.409> is

all<00:01:39.759> of<00:01:40.090> this<00:01:40.240> infrastructure<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:41.710> really

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
all of this infrastructure it's really

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.920 
all of this infrastructure it's really
high<00:01:42.100> performance<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:42.969> expandable<00:01:43.539> and<00:01:43.780> and

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
high performance and expandable and and

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.990 
high performance and expandable and and
it's<00:01:44.619> tailored<00:01:45.189> you<00:01:45.460> know<00:01:45.549> just<00:01:45.789> for

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
it's tailored you know just for

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.569 
it's tailored you know just for
virtualization<00:01:46.950> I've<00:01:47.950> also<00:01:48.100> seen<00:01:48.369> a<00:01:48.429> number

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
virtualization I've also seen a number

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.999 
virtualization I've also seen a number
of<00:01:48.789> options<00:01:49.000> like<00:01:49.570> pivot<00:01:50.200> three<00:01:50.439> serverless

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
of options like pivot three serverless

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.340 
of options like pivot three serverless
computing<00:01:51.640> which<00:01:51.850> is<00:01:52.060> again<00:01:52.929> a<00:01:52.960> similar

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
computing which is again a similar

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.830 
computing which is again a similar
concept<00:01:53.920> but<00:01:54.100> on<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.579> much<00:01:54.789> smaller<00:01:54.850> scale<00:01:55.210> it's

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
concept but on a much smaller scale it's

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.260 
concept but on a much smaller scale it's
like<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.170> server<00:01:56.530> with<00:01:56.679> storage<00:01:57.340> and

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
like a server with storage and

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.899 
like a server with storage and
virtualization<00:01:58.960> software<00:01:59.350> all<00:02:00.070> in<00:02:00.609> a<00:02:00.700> box

virtualization software all in a box

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.700 
virtualization software all in a box
it's<00:02:01.240> an<00:02:01.359> appliance<00:02:01.749> of<00:02:02.079> virtualization

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
it's an appliance of virtualization

one<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:37.720> exciting<00:02:37.989> options<00:02:38.440> I've<00:02:38.620> seen<00:02:38.860> is

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
one of the exciting options I've seen is

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.000 
one of the exciting options I've seen is
i-gos<00:02:39.519> io<00:02:40.150> director<00:02:40.780> which<00:02:41.739> really

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
i-gos io director which really

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.640 
i-gos io director which really
eliminates<00:02:42.819> so<00:02:43.450> much<00:02:43.629> of<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.959> cabling<00:02:44.470> that

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
eliminates so much of the cabling that

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.319 
eliminates so much of the cabling that
you<00:02:44.739> typically<00:02:45.069> have<00:02:45.340> for<00:02:45.730> Ethernet<00:02:46.209> and

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
you typically have for Ethernet and

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.210 
you typically have for Ethernet and
fibre<00:02:46.540> channel<00:02:46.890> could<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.010> potentially

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
fibre channel could it potentially

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.309 
fibre channel could it potentially
eliminate<00:02:48.849> most<00:02:49.629> of<00:02:49.870> your<00:02:50.019> Fibre<00:02:50.200> Channel

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
eliminate most of your Fibre Channel

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.130 
eliminate most of your Fibre Channel
ports<00:02:51.000> which<00:02:52.000> also<00:02:52.359> eliminates<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:52.989> lot<00:02:53.019> of

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
ports which also eliminates a lot of

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.349 
ports which also eliminates a lot of
expense<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.890> complexity<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:54.670> then<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:55.299> gives

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
expense and complexity and then it gives

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.229 
expense and complexity and then it gives
you<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.569> lot<00:02:55.750> of<00:02:55.810> performance<00:02:57.239> virtualizing

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
you a lot of performance virtualizing

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.030 
you a lot of performance virtualizing
the<00:02:58.480> i/o<00:02:58.599> and<00:02:58.870> allowing<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.349> to<00:02:59.470> dynamically

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
the i/o and allowing you to dynamically

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.539 
the i/o and allowing you to dynamically
create<00:03:00.519> new<00:03:00.900> io<00:03:01.900> adapters<00:03:02.739> on<00:03:03.069> your<00:03:03.250> virtual

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
create new io adapters on your virtual

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.599 
create new io adapters on your virtual
servers<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:05.010> finally<00:03:06.010> when<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.310> comes<00:03:06.489> to

servers and finally when it comes to

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.759 
servers and finally when it comes to
hardware<00:03:06.849> is<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.329> better<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.569> scale<00:03:08.019> up<00:03:08.230> or<00:03:08.409> to

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
hardware is it better to scale up or to

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.039 
hardware is it better to scale up or to
scale<00:03:09.010> up<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.430> hate<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.180> be<00:03:10.299> political<00:03:10.840> about

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
scale up I hate to be political about

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.720 
scale up I hate to be political about
you<00:03:11.290> know<00:03:11.409> the<00:03:11.530> answer<00:03:11.889> but<00:03:12.069> I<00:03:12.129> think<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.549> little

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
you know the answer but I think a little

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.110 
you know the answer but I think a little
bit<00:03:12.879> of<00:03:12.940> both<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:14.139> right<00:03:14.579> way<00:03:15.579> to<00:03:15.639> go<00:03:15.730> I

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
bit of both is is the right way to go I

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.050 
bit of both is is the right way to go I
mean<00:03:16.299> you<00:03:16.780> don't<00:03:16.900> want<00:03:17.109> to<00:03:17.200> scale<00:03:17.379> up<00:03:17.560> too<00:03:17.739> much

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
mean you don't want to scale up too much

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.210 
mean you don't want to scale up too much
because<00:03:19.060> you'll<00:03:19.420> end<00:03:19.690> up<00:03:19.780> spending<00:03:20.159> more<00:03:21.159> than

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
because you'll end up spending more than

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.150 
because you'll end up spending more than
you<00:03:21.400> need<00:03:21.549> to<00:03:21.609> on<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.269> price<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.930> CPUs<00:03:23.470> you

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
you need to on the price of the CPUs you

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.250 
you need to on the price of the CPUs you
know<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:25.060> latest<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.840> greatest<00:03:25.989> and

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
know the the latest and greatest and

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.960 
know the the latest and greatest and
fastest<00:03:26.620> cpus<00:03:27.010> are<00:03:27.040> always<00:03:27.489> going<00:03:27.639> to<00:03:27.760> be<00:03:27.819> the

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
fastest cpus are always going to be the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.059 
fastest cpus are always going to be the
most<00:03:28.090> expensive<00:03:28.389> so<00:03:28.930> I<00:03:29.109> think<00:03:29.470> it's<00:03:29.709> best<00:03:29.919> to

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
most expensive so I think it's best to

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.860 
most expensive so I think it's best to
take<00:03:30.129> kind<00:03:30.489> of<00:03:30.549> a<00:03:30.609> middle<00:03:30.879> road<00:03:31.120> middle<00:03:31.690> of<00:03:31.780> the

take kind of a middle road middle of the

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.780 
take kind of a middle road middle of the
road<00:03:32.049> approach<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.859> get<00:03:33.519> you<00:03:33.699> know

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
road approach and get you know

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.030 
road approach and get you know
reasonably<00:03:34.299> priced<00:03:34.629> but<00:03:34.930> fast<00:03:35.230> CPUs<00:03:35.799> and<00:03:35.829> the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
reasonably priced but fast CPUs and the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.909 
reasonably priced but fast CPUs and the
server's<00:03:36.459> a<00:03:36.970> reasonable<00:03:37.690> amount<00:03:37.989> of<00:03:38.319> RAM<00:03:38.620> so

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:38.919 
server's a reasonable amount of RAM so

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.140 
server's a reasonable amount of RAM so
that<00:03:39.040> you<00:03:39.099> don't<00:03:39.280> have<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.459> buy<00:03:39.639> the<00:03:39.699> highest

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
that you don't have to buy the highest

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.509 
that you don't have to buy the highest
density<00:03:40.569> Ram<00:03:41.139> you<00:03:41.739> know<00:03:41.859> there's<00:03:42.069> out<00:03:42.220> there

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
density Ram you know there's out there

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.240 
density Ram you know there's out there
and<00:03:43.419> then<00:03:43.569> also<00:03:43.720> scale<00:03:44.260> out<00:03:44.500> at<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.859> same<00:03:45.040> time

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
and then also scale out at the same time

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.869 
and then also scale out at the same time
so<00:03:45.519> scale<00:03:45.819> out<00:03:46.030> those<00:03:46.329> middle<00:03:47.139> of<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.349> road

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
so scale out those middle of the road

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.789 
so scale out those middle of the road
