let's<00:00:05.200> learn<00:00:05.440> now<00:00:05.680> how<00:00:05.920> to<00:00:06.010> control<00:00:06.970> Logic<00:00:07.420> Pro

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:07.469 
let's learn now how to control Logic Pro

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:12.419 
let's learn now how to control Logic Pro
using<00:00:08.469> your<00:00:08.680> iOS<00:00:09.219> device<00:00:09.610> and<00:00:09.879> touch<00:00:10.270> osc<00:00:11.429> as

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:12.429 
using your iOS device and touch osc as

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.490 
using your iOS device and touch osc as
usual<00:00:12.910> the<00:00:13.120> first<00:00:13.150> step<00:00:13.599> is<00:00:13.840> to<00:00:14.050> make<00:00:14.200> sure

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500
