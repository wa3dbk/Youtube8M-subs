different jobs without giving you too
much<00:01:54.860> of<00:01:55.369> I<00:01:56.680> guess<00:01:57.680> a<00:01:57.710> benefit<00:01:58.280> of<00:01:58.400> doing<00:01:58.520> that

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
much of I guess a benefit of doing that

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.490 
much of I guess a benefit of doing that
because<00:01:58.909> if<00:01:59.090> you<00:01:59.180> can<00:01:59.420> then<00:01:59.630> obviously<00:01:59.750> the

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
because if you can then obviously the

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.460 
because if you can then obviously the
best<00:02:00.799> way<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.009> play<00:02:01.189> will<00:02:01.460> be<00:02:01.610> to<00:02:02.470> make

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
best way to play will be to make

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.200 
best way to play will be to make
everyone<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:03.890> particular<00:02:04.130> class<00:02:04.490> right<00:02:05.060> when

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
everyone a particular class right when

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.060 
everyone a particular class right when
you<00:02:05.299> need<00:02:05.330> it<00:02:05.570> and<00:02:05.600> then<00:02:05.810> immediately<00:02:06.229> change

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
you need it and then immediately change

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.589 
you need it and then immediately change
them<00:02:07.220> all<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.520> fighters<00:02:07.880> or<00:02:08.149> something<00:02:08.419> right

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
them all to fighters or something right

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:09.879 
them all to fighters or something right
before<00:02:08.719> fight<00:02:09.109> and<00:02:09.289> then<00:02:09.379> change<00:02:09.619> them<00:02:09.769> all

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:09.889 
before fight and then change them all

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.610 
before fight and then change them all
back<00:02:10.039> to<00:02:10.279> workers<00:02:11.090> so<00:02:11.959> we<00:02:12.079> don't<00:02:12.169> want<00:02:12.439> to

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
back to workers so we don't want to

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.809 
back to workers so we don't want to
enable<00:02:12.829> that<00:02:13.069> gameplay

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
enable that gameplay

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.830 
enable that gameplay
and<00:02:13.930> we<00:02:14.930> think<00:02:15.230> we<00:02:15.319> have<00:02:15.439> ways<00:02:15.799> of<00:02:16.040> making<00:02:16.879> sure

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
and we think we have ways of making sure

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.170 
and we think we have ways of making sure
that<00:02:18.139> that's<00:02:18.859> not<00:02:19.129> a<00:02:19.189> viable<00:02:19.519> way<00:02:19.819> to<00:02:19.849> play<00:02:20.060> the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
that that's not a viable way to play the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.330 
that that's not a viable way to play the
game<00:02:20.329> but<00:02:20.810> that<00:02:21.109> you<00:02:21.230> still<00:02:21.499> have<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:22.219> know

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
game but that you still have you know

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.789 
game but that you still have you know
the<00:02:22.459> freedom<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:22.819> you<00:02:22.969> need<00:02:23.409> so<00:02:24.409> that's<00:02:24.590> that

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
the freedom that you need so that's that

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.379 
the freedom that you need so that's that
so<00:02:25.370> let's<00:02:25.760> move<00:02:25.909> on<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.269> next<00:02:26.329> thing<00:02:28.389> okay

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:29.389 
so let's move on to the next thing okay

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.539 
so let's move on to the next thing okay
so<00:02:29.719> here<00:02:29.989> is<00:02:30.109> a<00:02:30.139> test<00:02:30.409> world<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.069> built<00:02:31.400> to

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
so here is a test world that I built to

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.270 
so here is a test world that I built to
show<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.939> second<00:02:32.269> feature<00:02:32.359> that<00:02:33.260> I<00:02:33.650> want

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
show you the second feature that I want

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.160 
show you the second feature that I want
to<00:02:34.370> show<00:02:34.489> off<00:02:34.639> this<00:02:34.760> week<00:02:34.969> and<00:02:35.209> that<00:02:35.389> is<00:02:35.569> shops

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
to show off this week and that is shops

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.099 
to show off this week and that is shops
so<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:37.129> can<00:02:37.670> see<00:02:37.879> that<00:02:37.909> there's<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.540> stockpile

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
so you can see that there's a stockpile

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:40.509 
so you can see that there's a stockpile
here<00:02:39.439> and<00:02:39.620> what's<00:02:39.769> in<00:02:39.919> it<00:02:40.040> we've<00:02:40.189> got<00:02:40.340> some

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
here and what's in it we've got some

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.479 
here and what's in it we've got some
pumpkins<00:02:40.909> but<00:02:41.120> what<00:02:41.299> is<00:02:41.419> this<00:02:41.769> it's<00:02:42.769> gold<00:02:43.189> it's

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
pumpkins but what is this it's gold it's

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.000 
pumpkins but what is this it's gold it's
money<00:02:43.730> yes<00:02:44.419> so<00:02:45.049> we're<00:02:45.290> introducing<00:02:45.769> money

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
money yes so we're introducing money

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.569 
money yes so we're introducing money
into<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.400> game<00:02:46.549> which<00:02:46.939> come<00:02:47.150> in<00:02:47.269> these<00:02:48.579> chests

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
into the game which come in these chests

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.080 
into the game which come in these chests
of<00:02:49.639> gold<00:02:49.700> coins<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:51.099> each<00:02:52.099> one<00:02:52.400> can<00:02:52.699> contain

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090
