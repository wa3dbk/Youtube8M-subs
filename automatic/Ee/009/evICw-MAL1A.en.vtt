00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
that do that so that way rearranging

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.350 
that do that so that way rearranging
your<00:01:56.250> bases<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.850> going<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.060> be<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> lot<00:01:57.299> easier

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.499 
you don't have to drag all the walls one
by<00:01:59.280> one<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.759> thought<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.090> was<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.240> neat

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
by one so I thought that was a neat

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.240 
by one so I thought that was a neat
thing<00:02:00.659> they<00:02:01.290> let<00:02:01.469> us<00:02:01.500> know<00:02:01.740> about<00:02:01.979> and
