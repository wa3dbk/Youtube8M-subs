00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.210 
about it he's McDonald's National Player
of<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.500> Year<00:00:56.820> he<00:00:57.820> plays<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.449> way<00:00:58.600> he<00:00:58.750> moves

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
of the Year he plays the way he moves

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.740 
of the Year he plays the way he moves
but<00:01:00.220> I<00:01:00.280> want<00:01:00.729> to<00:01:00.820> see<00:01:00.970> him<00:01:01.180> develop<00:01:01.360> that<00:01:03.750> for

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
but I want to see him develop that for

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.990 
but I want to see him develop that for
him<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:05.199> dominate<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:06.190> best<00:01:06.490> players<00:01:06.790> in<00:01:06.880> the

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.639 
country and I still think as he grows
and<00:01:09.880> he<00:01:09.970> continues<00:01:10.390> to<00:01:10.509> mature<00:01:10.660> he'll<00:01:11.500> become

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
and he continues to mature he'll become

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.620 
and he continues to mature he'll become
more<00:01:11.830> of<00:01:12.280> an<00:01:12.460> assertive<00:01:12.940> basketball<00:01:13.420> player

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
I think it's similar the way they play

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.030 
I think it's similar the way they play
their<00:01:46.420> moves<00:01:46.689> at<00:01:47.380> times<00:01:47.649> it<00:01:47.799> could<00:01:47.860> look<00:01:47.979> like

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
their moves at times it could look like

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.039 
their moves at times it could look like
he's<00:01:48.280> coasting<00:01:48.549> but<00:01:48.880> he's<00:01:49.000> not<00:01:49.210> he's<00:01:49.659> a<00:01:49.689> stat

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049
