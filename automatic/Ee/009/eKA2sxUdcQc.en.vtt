00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:19.019 
one of the things I've been thinking

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.640 
one of the things I've been thinking

about it some jalapeno poppers so I did

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.739 
about it some jalapeno poppers so I did
some<00:00:22.859> research<00:00:23.099> I've<00:00:23.699> never<00:00:24.150> made<00:00:24.419> them<00:00:24.570> this

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:24.749 
some research I've never made them this

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:26.630 
some research I've never made them this
particular<00:00:25.079> way<00:00:25.409> but<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.800> sure<00:00:26.009> sounds<00:00:26.039> good

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
particular way but it sure sounds good

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.819 
particular way but it sure sounds good
it's<00:00:26.909> kind<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.179> a<00:00:27.239> mix<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.320> three<00:00:28.560> or<00:00:28.650> four

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
it's kind of a mix of three or four

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.669 
it's kind of a mix of three or four
recipes<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.519> saw<00:00:29.730> out<00:00:29.939> there<00:00:30.499> but<00:00:31.499> we're<00:00:31.589> gonna

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
recipes I saw out there but we're gonna

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.140 
recipes I saw out there but we're gonna
give<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.829> shot<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.310> i<00:00:32.369> think<00:00:32.550> i<00:00:32.700> think<00:00:32.790> i<00:00:33.000> can

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
give a shot and i think i think i can

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.760 
give a shot and i think i think i can
make<00:00:33.239> something<00:00:33.510> turn<00:00:33.690> out<00:00:33.810> that's<00:00:34.020> edible<00:00:34.260> so

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
make something turn out that's edible so

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.710 
make something turn out that's edible so

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.120 
it in the oven but stick with me let's
see<00:01:08.369> how<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.610> turns<00:01:08.670> out<00:01:09.620> all<00:01:10.620> right<00:01:10.830> I'm<00:01:10.980> my

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
see how this turns out all right I'm my

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.210 
see how this turns out all right I'm my
all<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.659> wasn't<00:01:13.590> sure<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:14.130> to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
all in on this I wasn't sure just to

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.940 
all in on this I wasn't sure just to
make<00:01:14.370> an<00:01:14.520> off<00:01:14.840> just<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.960> do<00:01:16.080> these<00:01:16.260> peppers<00:01:16.590> I

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
make an off just to do these peppers I

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.710 
make an off just to do these peppers I
think<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.670> stuff<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.120> spilling<00:01:18.600> is

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
think this stuff this spilling is

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.790 
think this stuff this spilling is
probably<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.140> freeze<00:01:19.409> all<00:01:19.590> right

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
probably going to freeze all right

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.120 
probably going to freeze all right
because<00:01:20.220> everything<00:01:21.590> everything<00:01:22.590> goes<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:23.010> it

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
because everything everything goes in it

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.590 
because everything everything goes in it
has<00:01:23.310> been<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.760> freezer<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.450> would

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
has been in the freezer so I would

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.760 
has been in the freezer so I would
imagine<00:01:24.810> why<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.110> wouldn't<00:01:25.290> freeze<00:01:25.560> together

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
imagine why I wouldn't freeze together

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.770 
imagine why I wouldn't freeze together
fine<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:27.120> I'm<00:01:27.180> going<00:01:27.300> to<00:01:27.360> do<00:01:27.510> is<00:01:27.659> I'm

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
