in the info box

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.690 
in the info box
and<00:00:21.720> I'm<00:00:21.870> starting<00:00:22.230> out<00:00:22.500> my<00:00:22.800> optional<00:00:23.400> page

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
and I'm starting out my optional page

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.720 
and I'm starting out my optional page
with<00:00:24.450> a<00:00:24.720> stencil<00:00:24.990> by<00:00:25.410> prima<00:00:25.950> marketing<00:00:26.430> and

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
with a stencil by prima marketing and

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.859 
with a stencil by prima marketing and
I'm<00:00:27.480> using<00:00:27.690> a<00:00:27.990> very<00:00:28.020> fine<00:00:29.210> texture<00:00:30.210> paste<00:00:30.510> here

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
I'm using a very fine texture paste here

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.630 
I'm using a very fine texture paste here
a<00:00:30.900> very<00:00:31.200> lightweight<00:00:31.470> fine<00:00:32.010> texture<00:00:32.460> paste

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
a very lightweight fine texture paste

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.820 
a very lightweight fine texture paste
and<00:00:32.970> as<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.660> see<00:00:33.840> I'm<00:00:33.930> just<00:00:33.960> scraping<00:00:34.530> it

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
and as you can see I'm just scraping it

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.670 
and as you can see I'm just scraping it
onto<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> stencil<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.720> my<00:00:37.110> palette<00:00:37.650> knife

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
onto the stencil with my palette knife

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.220 
onto the stencil with my palette knife
so<00:00:38.580> that<00:00:38.730> leaves<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.180> nice<00:00:39.450> dimensional

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
so that leaves a nice dimensional

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.940 
so that leaves a nice dimensional
texture<00:00:40.650> on<00:00:40.770> my<00:00:40.980> page<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.450> next<00:00:43.140> I'm<00:00:43.320> using<00:00:43.379> my

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
texture on my page so next I'm using my

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.530 
texture on my page so next I'm using my
stays<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.520> ink<00:00:45.450> which<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.230> waterproof<00:00:47.540> since

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
stays on ink which is waterproof since

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.420 
stays on ink which is waterproof since
