to<00:02:58.880> press<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.360> dough<00:02:59.480> down<00:02:59.750> with<00:02:59.990> a<00:03:00.020> fork<00:03:00.470> and

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
to press the dough down with a fork and

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.460 
to press the dough down with a fork and
a<00:03:00.860> cross<00:03:01.160> pattern<00:03:01.690> you<00:03:02.690> don't<00:03:02.720> see<00:03:03.290> the

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
a cross pattern you don't see the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.810 
a cross pattern you don't see the
pattern<00:03:03.830> when<00:03:03.950> they<00:03:04.070> come<00:03:04.310> out<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.790> oven

pattern when they come out of the oven

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.660 
pattern when they come out of the oven
but<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:05.600> just<00:03:05.840> helps<00:03:06.380> them<00:03:06.560> flatten<00:03:07.160> out<00:03:07.400> and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
but it just helps them flatten out and

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.190 
but it just helps them flatten out and
so<00:03:07.820> they<00:03:07.940> don't<00:03:08.090> just<00:03:08.360> stay<00:03:08.570> in<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.750> big<00:03:08.930> mound

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
so they don't just stay in a big mound
