00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.450
 do the people who are personal and 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.120
 welcome the exclusive episode of trade 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.380
 From our series our way is in the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.719
 last episode we finished 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.940
 doing some traders that was Tuesday 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.430
 Friday night pre content of the decision and 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.689
 these images are also from Tuesday 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.150
 pre a decision here I bought or 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.189
 wrong I did not see it was version 87 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.260
 since the first report and I thought it was 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.150
 his second version reports that 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.610
 I ended up buying by 180,000 copies 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.260
 is the maximum price of it completely 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.730
 Sometimes we feel depressed. 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.710
 his mistakes if he really was 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.540
 late I was not taking the best 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.800
 decisions put him to sell back 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.050
 for 140 million 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.989
 he sold almost immediately only 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.960
 In this game we lost seven thousand 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.969
 dogs and I said no, I was going to bed and it's 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.770
 do this is the last 3g but I solved it 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.110
 do a little more three on Tuesday 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.879
 because I really did not want to leave 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.219
 by default I did some more workouts 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.530
 simple meet some more players 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.539
 and then I went back to the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.070
 with last decision because when 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.290
 the market is down, there are reports and 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.270
 we have decision for me are the players 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.799
 have been taken into account and killed 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.810
 we bought 71 thousand 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.180
 I put it to sell at night for 87 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.890
 million the maximum profit of almost 15 thousand 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.350
 copies in a single letter and then 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.869
 looked in the head in the appetite this one 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.600
 for 93 thousand copies we had for 100 thousand 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.680
 over the market average it is more 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.140
 three hours 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.640
 was at least 105 107 thousand copies only 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.590
 I decided to put this process of 3 thousand 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.009
 cuts about eight thousand 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.540
 6 million profit is and before 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.920
 sleeping I did some simple effects 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.630
 just to show you can do it too 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.560
 three buying players for the price 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.380
 Minimum 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.600
 make this arango I solved the collection 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.060
 because it is very horrible and if the new 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.829
 I do not know how you talk about fish 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.840
 with the barclays defender for sure 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.899
 sell well sold for 1,900 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.579
 million but with 550 and the others are 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.619
 simpler coconut players to sell 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.240
 more quiet and ramifies that you bought 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.560
 I could have done all the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.420
 Prefect fast sale that we do not 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.460
 I made a sale to sell one 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.990
 little more expensive because on Tuesday our 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.479
 night from Tuesday to Wednesday had not 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.670
 almost nothing on the market and certainly the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.200
 players will sell well gave to see 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.530
 that during the night the players sells 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.850
 the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.010
 without exception all for the price that people 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.360
 recovered the loss that the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.280
 people had 7 million 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.110
 and adds a profit of 12 thousand things 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.140
 in your account then it was theoretically a 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.720
 more than 19,000 dogs 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.040
 It's just that we had this 7 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.780
 in the nightclub I showed in 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.300
 I start then, from here on out. 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.520
 how to do a little more than 13 states 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.650
 already on pre -Wednesday not a little bit 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.750
 more liberal team needs a lot of 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.120
 desperate people trying to get rid of 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.000
 players I bought this bad now yes 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.709
 the correct version 88 seconds informs him 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.660
 incredible attributes gives a 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.250
 Look at football in the future says 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.330
 really cool, if you want 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.800
 put in your team 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.450
 I do not know how to attack but probably 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.970
 how midfielder advanced the midfielder he 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.709
 works very well we buy for 201 thousand 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.989
 it's almost almost you get it 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.280
 stop paying he did not put it but not 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.459
 When I showed but I put it on. 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.340
 sell at most 240 and at least 225 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:12.420
 at most they bought for 240 thousand copies or 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.920
 that gave us a profit of 2 8 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.019
 millions in a single player 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.450
 and here the team will not order I ended up seeing 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.579
 an apple open his purple open letter 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.530
 always very much wanted by her 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.239
 usually the maximum price that these 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.760
 eight thousand cuts but this fall the 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.799
 market some did not know by 45 44 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.910
 I put my price a little below 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.860
 because I wanted to sell 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.570
 fast players before he left 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.519
 last win because I knew they would 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.530
 They were going to fall in price here too 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.750
 luck find the demand for 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.000
 players are too small to take the 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.170
 Profit range tava not the greatest because 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.209
 how about putting the players to sell 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.519
 far below what I would put in a day 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.920
 normal because as soon as the team came out 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.720
 trains the building for sure. 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.430
 players would fall as it actually ended 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.829
 falling but managed to buy this 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.150
 mandate 74,000 I was a bit in doubt 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.579
 that the profit margin at the time of 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.950
 bigger but still both ended up 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.989
 selling quickly without much trouble 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.420
 in relation to these two of our two 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.370
 no fear decision a little split and 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.390
 in the sequence but I'll send it to see 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.579
 that people were desperate 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.380
 trying to get rid of his letters not 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.359
 I know if you're afraid of taking 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.859
 I know if to make fashion to open pecs 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.289
 What I know is that we win by 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.470
 several and several and several good letters 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:24.510
 in the interim but not put to 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.030
 sell 84 thousand almost a little bit before 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.639
 recalled a decision here had you 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.580
 the last victory in fact and I started 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.220
 find several good cheap cards and 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.110
 neymar is for 102 thousand which I got 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.090
 sell at almost the maximum price 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.950
 met 18 other neymar 64 million 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.630
 I put to sell it flowing out 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.340
 maximum price return only swings one 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.320
 I started to put a 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.120
 market is this and if 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.710
 neymar for 54 million 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.230
 people actually start getting rid of 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.790
 many players do not know about pec or 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.800
 either for whatever reason they 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.410
 They wanted but I know that we managed to 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.690
 make a violent profit in these seas 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.430
 He has to see that already has 286 million 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.630
 another for 52 thousand things like I got out 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.850
 neymar behind neymar 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.680
 all this happening in less than two 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.640
 hours the things we did in that 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.800
 I did not understand the episode at the beginning. 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.140
 I left the night but neymar's 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.270
 front was at most two hours from 13 and 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.919
 just keep looking at our amount of 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.510
 coins as it grows here 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.400
 I started doing three charges because the 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.139
 brazil was already released in the pacs or 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.790
 is practically at the price 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.560
 The maximum I put to sell and 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.630
 obviously much cheaper to 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.220
 people make a new fast because letters 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.030
 that a decision may be that it rains 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.590
 in the market and out of nowhere the price to unseat is 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.330
 then the price falls so that it is 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.130
 important you do not stay too long 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.750
 with these cards that are in the last 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.180
 determinant to keep week is there which 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.710
 is the team that is up for the week 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.330
 so he used players to sell already 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.250
 we are with 300 thousand copies 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.500
 and then we can buy another one 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.690
 brave for 100 thousand dogs very cheap 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.310
 putting the sale for 128 thousand with this 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.260
 my very good profit of almost 20 thousand 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.300
 almost the player while selling gives to 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.370
 see the coin goes up and down 10 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.960
 while he was selling and buying another 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.990
 people stayed in this cycle for a long time 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.220
 This bravo was doing very well, it's just 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.200
 that death seems like a player does not 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.660
 appears more did not return for neymar with 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.940
 prices 30 thousand which only want the version 87 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.380
 I put it to sell 78,000 which 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.880
 is not a very large profit but with 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.190
 sure a good profit 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.080
 in these two letters and was almost 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.700
 400,000 with your child, do you want to know me? 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.919
 make a poster with mascherano because 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.979
 had a version of him reporting this team 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.840
 and certainly the letter from normal and getting 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.060
 a little more expensive and we managed to 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.410
 sell almost all immediately 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.390
 buying very easy with your 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:40.710
 desperate to get rid of the IIPA 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:43.560
 nothing 400 billion in one day 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:46.860
 in one night one day we jumped from 220 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.470
 230 thousand copies to 400,000 with r 170 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.150
 millions profit look at this one million 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.440
 five hundred and forty-two thousand 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.270
 transfer prof 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.410
 what is simply amazing for us 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.390
 taking into account that people already 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.220
 have a sensational team I know that two 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.390
 episodes were relatively short in the 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.430
 next game we will have more
