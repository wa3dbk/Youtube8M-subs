it's done and ready when it's ready and

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.640 
it's done and ready when it's ready and
you<00:03:29.600> know<00:03:29.660> we<00:03:29.810> really<00:03:29.960> do<00:03:30.140> want<00:03:30.320> to<00:03:30.380> get<00:03:30.470> all

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
you know we really do want to get all

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.200 
you know we really do want to get all
the<00:03:30.770> game<00:03:30.920> parts<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.340> game<00:03:31.460> functioning<00:03:32.060> and

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
the game parts the game functioning and

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.820 
the game parts the game functioning and
farm<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:32.720> polished<00:03:33.080> before<00:03:33.260> we<00:03:33.530> release<00:03:33.800> you

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
farm and polished before we release you

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.120 
farm and polished before we release you
know<00:03:34.730> we<00:03:34.880> really<00:03:35.320> nearly<00:03:36.320> are<00:03:36.560> at<00:03:36.710> a<00:03:36.740> point<00:03:36.890> we

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
know we really nearly are at a point we

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.070 
know we really nearly are at a point we
can<00:03:37.250> say<00:03:37.430> when<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.730> final<00:03:38.060> date<00:03:38.240> will<00:03:38.390> be<00:03:38.420> but

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
can say when the final date will be but

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.570 
can say when the final date will be but
you<00:03:39.260> know<00:03:39.290> early<00:03:39.620> 2014<00:03:39.980> is<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.310> really<00:03:40.490> good

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
you know early 2014 is a really good

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.880 
you know early 2014 is a really good
estimate<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:41.150> it's<00:03:42.050> very<00:03:42.290> unlikely<00:03:42.620> they'll

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
estimate and it's very unlikely they'll

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.760 
estimate and it's very unlikely they'll
get<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.220> low<00:03:43.340> pass<00:03:43.520> then
