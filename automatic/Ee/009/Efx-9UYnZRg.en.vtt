00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
had three dead pixels in it straight

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.439 
had three dead pixels in it straight
from<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> start<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.970> center<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.330> the

that<00:00:42.540> was<00:00:42.719> all<00:00:42.809> about<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:43.460> I<00:00:44.460> don't<00:00:45.120> even<00:00:45.270> know

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
that was all about but I don't even know

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.420 
that was all about but I don't even know
the<00:00:45.510> model<00:00:45.840> number<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.289> computer<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.710> already

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the model number that computer I already

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.549 
the model number that computer I already
tossed<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.969> saved<00:00:48.690> some<00:00:48.960> parts<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:51.559> that

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
tossed it saved some parts and that

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.740 
tossed it saved some parts and that
might<00:00:52.710> be<00:00:52.800> another<00:00:52.949> video<00:00:53.160> but<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.270> thing<00:00:54.480> is

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
might be another video but the thing is

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.580 
might be another video but the thing is
the<00:00:55.910> had<00:00:56.910> three<00:00:57.120> dead<00:00:57.300> pixels<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.199> hardware

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the had three dead pixels the hardware

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.549 
the had three dead pixels the hardware
is<00:00:58.770> flaky<00:00:59.390> right<00:01:00.390> straight<00:01:00.719> from<00:01:00.899> start<00:01:01.260> had<00:01:01.530> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
is flaky right straight from start had a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.539 
is flaky right straight from start had a
mono<00:01:01.829> speaker<00:01:01.980> which<00:01:02.520> sounded<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.300> and

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
mono speaker which sounded like but and

screen for the three dead pixels this

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.370 
screen for the three dead pixels this
involves<00:01:11.729> using<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.210> special<00:01:12.600> tool<00:01:12.810> used<00:01:13.229> to

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
picking up from the top of your screen

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.719 
picking up from the top of your screen
gently<00:01:33.110> set<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:33.530> screen<00:01:33.770> down<00:01:33.979> on<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.250> concrete

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
gently set the screen down on a concrete

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.679 
gently set the screen down on a concrete
floor<00:01:36.580> that<00:01:37.580> totally<00:01:37.910> was<00:01:38.060> allowed

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.469 

and<00:01:40.960> now

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
and now

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.170 
and now
we're<00:01:42.600> going<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.899> be<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:44.039> dead<00:01:44.219> pixels<00:01:44.729> as<00:01:44.969> far

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
we're going to be the dead pixels as far

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.060 
we're going to be the dead pixels as far
as<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.479> remember<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.590> really<00:01:46.920> was

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
as I can remember and this really was

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.520 
as I can remember and this really was
true<00:01:47.369> there<00:01:48.119> were<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.479> weird<00:01:48.899> dead<00:01:49.110> pixels

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
true there were really weird dead pixels

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.990 
true there were really weird dead pixels
in<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.680> screen<00:01:49.890> I'm<00:01:50.039> not<00:01:50.219> making<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.640> up<00:01:50.820> for

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
in the screen I'm not making this up for

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.980 
in the screen I'm not making this up for
another<00:01:51.179> reason<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.509> kill<00:01:51.719> it<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:53.990> roughly

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
another reason to kill it but roughly

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.450 
another reason to kill it but roughly
three<00:01:55.320> dead<00:01:55.469> pixels<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.039> center<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
three dead pixels in the center of the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.499 
three dead pixels in the center of the
screen<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:56.850> they<00:01:56.939> weren't<00:01:57.090> right<00:01:57.299> together

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
screen but they weren't right together

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.510 
screen but they weren't right together
they're<00:01:57.780> scrunched<00:01:58.259> down<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.439> little<00:01:58.560> bit<00:01:58.710> so

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
they're scrunched down a little bit so

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.749 
they're scrunched down a little bit so
let's<00:01:59.789> see<00:01:59.909> if<00:01:59.970> we<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.179> find<00:02:00.329> them<00:02:01.640> then<00:02:02.640> as

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
let's see if we can find them then as

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.919 
let's see if we can find them then as
you<00:02:02.909> can<00:02:03.030> see<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.750> fact<00:02:03.960> get<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:05.450> light<00:02:06.450> there
