00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.650
 hi the cards on cats and I 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.589
 thank you for the new year on easy machine 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.160
 make-up ncaa for new video 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.590
 today I am going to present to you 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.750
 how do I realize my pre date a break 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.100
 a parade and well it's not reacted anymore 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.560
 end of the care I had my hair with 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.439
 African black soap that I got 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.119
 at the fair of paris 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.710
 I condition to like hair with a 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.670
 mixture of two conditioners from the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.790
 margin and gc stickers at my hair 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.829
 with a t-shirt and gÃ©rin c'est mes 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:41.370
 hair on vanilla so keep in 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:43.410
 does the definition of loops so for 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.469
 work more easily I'm just going 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.420
 tied all the vanilla on top 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.469
 of my head in order to be able to work 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.879
 vanilla by valli my moisturizer will be the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.879
 curling breath and tracking dogs 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.840
 and my if we will be the Egyptian magic 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.430
 so it's a Kabul-based butter 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.970
 I will start with irons at the 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.020
 vanilla slowly all together 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.080
 gently quietly 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:21.130
 I will then apply a little hydra 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:22.540
 time I start from the root and I 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.060
 go down to the painters by pressing 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.050
 the hair between my two palms 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:33.050
 hands here I apply moisturizer well and 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:37.340
 it will also aim this movement of 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.500
 roots towards the point of defining 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.590
 the loops then I apply my 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.570
 butter always with the same movement 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.690
 you see that defines quite well the 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.610
 loops and then the loops that get 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.610
 draws naturally I'm just going to 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.510
 separate and roll them up a little bit 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.940
 it's just for her to be well 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.090
 separated and well defined so and then 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.470
 I do not wait by stretching the hair well 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.720
 for the banks to be good and he 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.780
 so is I realize onco the same 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.210
 operation I undo the vanilla 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.210
 I apply hydra ton by doing this 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.730
 pressure movement between the two 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.480
 apples tomorrow duo finally roots towards 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.480
 the tips here 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.110
 then I apply my butter 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.400
 and then I know by the curls 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.629
 one by one the curls actually that get 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:52.379
 are formed naturally and then I 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:52.379
 note begins to do a little shula 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.859
 I will show you what it looks like 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:04.450
 a wick on their side so the same 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:08.579
 move and then town hall that actually 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.579
 I do not know the loops one by one 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.200
 I do not spend too much time defining the 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.959
 balls because actually it's a king 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.859
 chengdu I really want to just 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.859
 separated the curls in fact that's it 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.489
 here I have put my little separation 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.860
 on the side as fluid 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:43.659
 so here I could multiply that much 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.650
 that he is then before the ben summit 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.159
 jap games 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.599
 I put on my scarf so that's what 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:53.319
 it gives the next day so he 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:55.060
 will not reach quiet I'm ironing a 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.470
 little bit of butter to seal again 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.760
 hydration bring a little bit of 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.970
 shine and avoid frizz 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.970
 sure 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.940
 so I have delicately celebrations 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:45.790
 mats always in the back in case if 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.790
 the style and misfires never know 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.970
 so that's what separates 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:17.940
 So then I go it seems a little 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:19.080
 little loops one by one and in fact 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.300
 see that loops actually is this 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:27.210
 she stands out of herself I just 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.320
 attract a little bit on the spikes and 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.040
 it separates itself 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.040
 here 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:46.059
 a good definition of goats and that's it 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:49.059
 without having to manipulate it too much 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:51.339
 quickly from the frizz already it avoids 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:53.289
 to manipulate his hair too much and therefore the 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:06:06.099
 bouquets separates itself touches us 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:06:08.830
 not too dated date so the pop have 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:11.559
 sounded like it's the first day of the bre 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.599
 date I will not separate them 

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:16.089
 branches the locks of hair I'm going 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.399
 leave them like that so what you 

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:20.439
 have just launched my copy before and here 

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:24.849
 montbrÃ© that after and with the new 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:26.469
 technique so really better defined and 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:28.029
 I do not even need to be afraid of 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:30.279
 to separate them because it separates everything 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:32.529
 alone and of which much larger 

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:34.749
 also a lot better finances 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:36.429
 I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:37.659
 I'll tell you very soon scoops to 

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:40.979
 redeem me on social networks 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:40.979
 kisses kisses lease
