00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 valid 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:11.539
 hi everyone these debates should do 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:12.520
 so today 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.400
 they find themselves going to make my fourth video on the theme of 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.999
 weapons of yesterday 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:20.449
 so today we are sure 'call of duty black ops are on the map 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:23.890
 and we are in a match with my team 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.220
 on this part I will play with 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.220
 the escorts 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.390
 and I know that customers of these weapons 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.669
 you are all here 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.370
 featherweight looming pirates 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.320
 I wanted to make accept in his hours 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.370
 our partners who were with me on this part 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.370
 so that was for what he is 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.980
 4330 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.430
 little teaser legend 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.430
 in tibet looking 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.770
 disarming ennjimi 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.730
 because the scope of 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.350
 of this weapon 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.130
 going 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.200
 nbc 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.710
 not very high 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.330
 fire with a weapon 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.790
 that's average 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.880
 so here I know him 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.660
 - spies 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.420
 but here it is again this one who wanted the enemies are close to 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.190
 you 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.540
 she is wreaking havoc 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.500
 even frankly it's 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.500
 it's a weapon that has a lot of goals that's a lot of damage 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.410
 these two enemies are too good watchmakers of wars 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.350
 in euros the night she disappears 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.350
 what's there m but no spy albert 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.480
 blackburn has penetrated beans 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.230
 rather than on this map 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.780
 I think I saw 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.310
 I have more on the opponents 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.270
 because there are a lot of buildings that you have to go around like that 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.660
 and to go 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.090
 and therefore the elect are charmed 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.320
 very long months so my share at this place but shhh 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.030
 I will take cover 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.030
 so here I pick up the barp that I could but all the ammo 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.329
 of sanctis remains to me 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.329
 one of the tunes to have the bac the order 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.829
 so here I am my level of play 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.029
 the 18th and new york is unlocked 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:42.519
 my blackberry 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.859
 it is thanks to the reader of 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.859
 I unlock average 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.859
 once again for the wheat of europe 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.359
 a whole season more 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.189
 here I can see that the enemies 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.189
 muto tour so I can support the struggles 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.949
 that Sens 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:12.179
 so here I get killed plan a layer 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:14.939
 he was killed for the first time on this part 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.069
 the goal of the match at ajaccio - yes but 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.479
 optical change 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:20.350
 d 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.529
 t 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:23.509
 which means that 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:26.159
 so we will change 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.299
 but unfortunately I do not know why I had the impression that 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.149
 it's a bit of a foot 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:35.139
 as for the party will resume 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.139
 you will see what happens what will happen 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.259
 so here I feel it thanks to jokes art day the building 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:44.939
 I'm here I'm turning I'm going there 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:46.639
 you are and what you have seen 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.639
 personally I do not have any 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.959
 the Turkish people his clothes 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.369
 frankly I do it 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:58.989
 so here you go 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.469
 you have to see your card 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.369
 it's really my advantage 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:06.719
 easily 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.719
 and there I see nobody I see you eat you wet 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:16.209
 so here is a little lenient who also dissected who did not bother me 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.669
 I am with my enemy 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.669
 8h10 qq of 13 degrees 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:35.749
 for the parquet the can 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.610
 we have one who becomes one 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.389
 franck thilliez 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.199
 so this is income or soap study report 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.289
 between its members 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.650
 unfortunately I can not exclude 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.400
 which is really a pity 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.720
 marie will unlock 10 million this summer December 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:11.529
 after the killings the opponents are right 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.930
 this is actually the trunk 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.580
 while he was in a hurry 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.580
 and per cent I was in a hurry 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:28.259
 and here I am 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:29.900
 I fall into the void 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.479
 again I'm recovering 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.979
 it's been twice that I go 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.979
 orally stupidly 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.089
 go on 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:46.699
 bypassing 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:48.789
 who flesh out their career plan 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.789
 unfortunately he notes that m 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.290
 I am going to make a new space that sets sail without much difficulty 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.629
 I buy my enemies very quickly with this weapon 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.729
 the action I'm sketching hectares 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:13.930
 mm 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.210
 we have gone beyond the big 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.550
 take it on cartons 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.479
 circumvent it 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.289
 very easily 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:26.289
 this is not there for example if here an enemy falls in front of you 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:30.779
 you finally have i think that csa you already have two alarming weapons 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:35.240
 manage twice as many balls as alone in europe fitting this mallet art 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:37.749
 she is preparing her patent 

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:40.749
 we harvest the mans the advantage 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:46.339
 except to the cheeks with this weapon on small cards 

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:48.819
 you are will be there 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:50.629
 I assure you sister 

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:52.080
 a facility 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.849
 so that's the end of this video 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:57.849
 we find ourselves for a fifth mass in video 

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:00.669
