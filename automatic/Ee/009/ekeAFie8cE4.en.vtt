really harm you see it though great but
there<00:03:44.410> is<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.530> little<00:03:44.799> marking<00:03:45.280> there<00:03:45.519> on<00:03:46.000> the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
there is a little marking there on the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.089 
there is a little marking there on the
plate<00:03:46.389> on<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.720> main<00:03:46.870> plate<00:03:47.109> again<00:03:47.769> you<00:03:47.919> can't

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
plate on the main plate again you can't

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.670 
plate on the main plate again you can't
notice<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:48.519> because<00:03:48.639> obviously<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.959> is<00:03:50.349> silver

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
notice it because obviously it is silver

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.430 
notice it because obviously it is silver
on<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:51.069> inside<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:52.840> can<00:03:53.019> do<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.319> you

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
on the inside and you can do it you

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.930 
on the inside and you can do it you
can't<00:03:53.620> tell<00:03:53.829> it<00:03:53.949> there<00:03:54.129> simply<00:03:54.639> because<00:03:54.910> of

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
can't tell it there simply because of

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.420 
can't tell it there simply because of
the<00:03:55.060> color<00:03:55.269> so<00:03:56.169> it's<00:03:56.349> not<00:03:56.500> very<00:03:56.799> visible

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
the color so it's not very visible

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.000 
the color so it's not very visible
anyway<00:03:58.030> all<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.169> stones<00:03:59.379> in<00:03:59.530> place<00:03:59.709> there<00:03:59.949> are
