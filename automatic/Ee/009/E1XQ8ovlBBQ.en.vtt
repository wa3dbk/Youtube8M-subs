so<00:00:11.459> started<00:00:11.760> us<00:00:11.820> off<00:00:11.910> with<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.119> top<00:00:12.299> link<00:00:12.510> at

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:12.629 
so started us off with the top link at

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.480 
so started us off with the top link at
the<00:00:12.690> construction<00:00:13.350> we've<00:00:13.770> got<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.949> hinge

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
the construction we've got a hinge

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.400 
the construction we've got a hinge
two-piece<00:00:15.059> design<00:00:15.240> give<00:00:15.690> me<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.840> good<00:00:16.049> mobility

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
two-piece design give me a good mobility

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.140 
two-piece design give me a good mobility
gonna<00:00:17.130> let<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.430> do<00:00:17.580> what<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:17.820> want<00:00:18.030> without

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
getting bound up out there now we've got

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.610 
getting bound up out there now we've got
some<00:00:20.970> really<00:00:21.210> great<00:00:21.360> features<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.410> whole

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:22.620 
some really great features on this whole

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.710 
some really great features on this whole
20k<00:00:23.130> line<00:00:23.340> especially<00:00:23.880> these<00:00:24.090> elbow<00:00:24.480> pads

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
20k line especially these elbow pads

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.170 
20k line especially these elbow pads
first<00:00:25.320> one<00:00:25.530> is<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.800> all<00:00:26.070> HD<00:00:26.610> foam<00:00:26.880> or

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
first one is this all HD foam or

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.510 
first one is this all HD foam or
high-density<00:00:27.750> foam<00:00:27.990> upper<00:00:28.680> bicep<00:00:28.890> guard

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
high-density foam upper bicep guard

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.970 
high-density foam upper bicep guard
I<00:00:29.550> mean<00:00:29.910> they've<00:00:30.780> done<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> really<00:00:31.080> good<00:00:31.530> job<00:00:31.710> at

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
I mean they've done a really good job at

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.350 
I mean they've done a really good job at
engineering<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.699> material<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.329> really

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
engineering this material it really

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.990 
engineering this material it really
feels<00:00:33.810> like<00:00:34.020> plastic<00:00:34.260> but<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:34.829> all<00:00:35.040> foam<00:00:35.489> so

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
feels like plastic but it's all foam so

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.670 
feels like plastic but it's all foam so
this<00:00:36.120> would<00:00:36.239> be<00:00:36.300> highly<00:00:36.750> protective<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.530> you

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
this would be highly protective for you

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.470 
this would be highly protective for you
and<00:00:37.920> all<00:00:38.130> the<00:00:38.340> other<00:00:38.460> guys<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> ice<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
and all the other guys on the ice of the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.630 
and all the other guys on the ice of the
rink<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.560> has<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> really<00:00:41.130> nice<00:00:41.310> coverage

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
rink and it has a really nice coverage

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.370 
rink and it has a really nice coverage
to<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.600> could<00:00:42.720> see<00:00:42.870> has<00:00:43.020> some<00:00:43.200> good

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
to it you could see has some good

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.740 
to it you could see has some good
segmentation<00:00:44.160> has<00:00:44.700> some<00:00:44.880> good<00:00:45.120> graphics<00:00:45.329> on

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
segmentation has some good graphics on

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.120 
segmentation has some good graphics on
it<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.200> looks<00:00:46.440> good<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.010> gonna

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
it so it looks good but it's gonna

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.280 
it so it looks good but it's gonna
protect<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.760> even<00:00:48.030> better<00:00:48.180> now<00:00:48.870> as<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.110> get

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
protect you even better now as we get

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.010 
protect you even better now as we get
down<00:00:49.500> into<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.399> forearm<00:00:50.790> guard<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:51.989> a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
down into the forearm guard we do have a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.660 
down into the forearm guard we do have a
plastic<00:00:52.410> insert<00:00:52.680> down<00:00:52.860> here<00:00:53.130> but<00:00:53.370> its<00:00:53.489> back

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
plastic insert down here but its back

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.700 
plastic insert down here but its back
with<00:00:53.910> high<00:00:54.059> density<00:00:54.270> foams<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.989> top<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.590> on

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
with high density foams on top and on

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.190 
with high density foams on top and on
bottom<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.190> you're<00:00:56.460> getting<00:00:56.790> just<00:00:57.600> supreme

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
bottom so you're getting just supreme

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.319 
bottom so you're getting just supreme
level<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.010> coverage<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.670> protection<00:00:59.790> with

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
level of coverage and protection with

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.869 
level of coverage and protection with
this<00:01:00.510> forearm<00:01:01.379> guard<00:01:01.440> now<00:01:02.280> as<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.700> down

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
this forearm guard now as we get down

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.729 
this forearm guard now as we get down
into<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.570> elbow<00:01:03.809> cap<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.259> is<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.619> be

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
into the elbow cap this is going to be

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.260 
into the elbow cap this is going to be
probably<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> best<00:01:05.429> feature<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.060> see

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
probably the best feature that we see

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.989 
probably the best feature that we see
it's<00:01:07.139> just<00:01:07.319> absolutely<00:01:08.039> outstanding<00:01:08.249> because

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:08.999 
it's just absolutely outstanding because

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:11.539 
it's just absolutely outstanding because
it's<00:01:09.359> all<00:01:09.630> foam<00:01:10.109> there's<00:01:10.439> no<00:01:10.619> plastic<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.340> this

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
it's all foam there's no plastic in this

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.580 
it's all foam there's no plastic in this
elbow<00:01:11.969> cap<00:01:12.209> that's<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.990> first<00:01:13.229> one<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.530> its

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
elbow cap that's the first one of its

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.489 
elbow cap that's the first one of its
kind<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.249> you<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:14.999> see<00:01:15.209> how<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.659> could<00:01:15.869> pinch<00:01:16.319> it

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:16.499 
kind so you can see how I could pinch it

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:18.410 
kind so you can see how I could pinch it
in<00:01:16.649> and<00:01:16.859> out<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.520> if<00:01:17.609> you<00:01:17.639> were<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.029> try<00:01:18.270> and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
in and out but if you were to try and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.599 
in and out but if you were to try and
pinch<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:18.959> way<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.529> feels<00:01:19.889> like<00:01:20.100> plastic

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:20.609 
pinch it this way it feels like plastic

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:22.999 
pinch it this way it feels like plastic
just<00:01:20.819> super<00:01:21.569> protective<00:01:22.139> but<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:22.560> even<00:01:22.799> more

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
just super protective but it's even more

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.889 
just super protective but it's even more
lightweight<00:01:23.639> which<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.999> a<00:01:24.029> great<00:01:24.389> feature<00:01:24.659> in

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
lightweight which is a great feature in

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.899 
lightweight which is a great feature in
itself<00:01:25.289> and<00:01:25.649> we<00:01:25.979> got<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.340> all<00:01:26.579> the<00:01:26.819> way

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
itself and we got that all the way

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.839 
itself and we got that all the way
throughout<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.479> got<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:28.079> a<00:01:28.200> thick<00:01:28.469> layer<00:01:28.849> now

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:29.849 
throughout we got just a thick layer now

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:31.969 
throughout we got just a thick layer now
as<00:01:30.060> we<00:01:30.209> get<00:01:30.389> into<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.049> inside<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.649> I<00:01:31.740> go<00:01:31.859> ahead

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
as we get into the inside and I go ahead

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.929 
as we get into the inside and I go ahead
open<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.609> up<00:01:32.759> show<00:01:32.969> you<00:01:33.029> the<00:01:33.209> liner<00:01:33.450> has<00:01:34.939> a

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
open it up show you the liner has a

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.910 
open it up show you the liner has a
really<00:01:36.270> comfortable<00:01:36.659> liner<00:01:36.959> down<00:01:37.560> here

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
really comfortable liner down here

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.980 
really comfortable liner down here
really<00:01:38.459> soft<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.849> the<00:01:38.880> touch<00:01:38.999> helps<00:01:39.630> wick<00:01:39.840> away

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
really soft to the touch helps wick away
