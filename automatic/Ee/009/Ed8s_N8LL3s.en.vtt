00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.950
 on 17 now only Kober transformed the sports hall of Eckernförder 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.279
 School Center South 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.359
 again in a KGaA Kurt Kräß and Kochel Halle 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.639
 the small animal show of the Eckernförder breed poultry breeders and 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.639
 Rabbit breeding club i opposite the stage 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.519
 an instructive look at you already at the entrance the astonished visitors the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.619
 great variety of different was all made visible 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.240
 almost 500 feathered and lent the creatures pleased small 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.640
 Fleece visitors 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.640
 including the biggest winners in the world 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.050
 Manser known and extraordinary 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.120
 For example, geese who are not looking forward to Christmas 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.760
 and who evidently apprenticed to a v 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.480
 Ducks who prefer to take another nap 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.790
 and very sweet, fluffy chicks 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.800
 some hatched so fresh 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.800
 that they still humiliated the heat lamp 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.640
 but as a normal urban person you can really be astonished how 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.070
 many different bold geese and pigeons it admits 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.230
 and how many were shown 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.710
 a whole points family 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.740
 and costume full pheasants 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.230
 the immense ingenuity of nature makes the draw doubt that 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.470
 People with all sorts of breeding tricks and crosses helped a little 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.540
 Has 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.810
 a fascinating play of colors and patterns of long and short feathers 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.810
 are leading and drawing 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.340
 Of course, the children's favorites were once again the rabbits 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.009
 and there too was from dwarf to enjoy 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.009
 everything represented 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.730
 It is also instructive that chickens do not care where they are 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.840
 Flock and that is inhuman and criminal is intelligent and 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.330
 sentient beings 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.249
 imprisoned in laying batteries 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.159
 and that's how you grasp the connection again 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.729
 from now on only eggs for friendly attitude to buy 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.799
 dearest to the farmer directly 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.919
 and as if the chicken had read my mind 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.830
 he is also grateful and voluntarily a part 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.059
 and looks proudly out of the cage 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:48.059
 the desire to finally leave again soon 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.449
 Of course, such a show is the crowning glory and reward for so many 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:56.219
 breeder 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:00.809
 if the most beautiful specimens receive appropriate trophies you 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:03.809
 then full of pride in the domestic shelf can 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.169
 certainly a successful weekend for exhibitors and visitors 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.249
 but equally safe for the animals 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:14.999
 do not know them exhausting
