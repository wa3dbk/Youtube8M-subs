wise this one really wasn't that bad as
people<00:00:33.660> say<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.410> has<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> lot<00:00:34.920> of

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
people say it is it has a lot of

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.790 
people say it is it has a lot of
gimmicks<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:38.690> Morpher<00:00:39.690> has<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> lot<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.590> nice

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
gimmicks the Morpher has a lot of nice

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.860 
gimmicks the Morpher has a lot of nice
detail<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.700> sculpting<00:00:42.180> which<00:00:42.360> I'll<00:00:42.510> bring<00:00:42.690> up

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
detail and sculpting which I'll bring up

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.500 
detail and sculpting which I'll bring up
close<00:00:43.200> has<00:00:44.070> some<00:00:44.309> nice<00:00:44.460> tread<00:00:44.879> work<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
close has some nice tread work for the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.740 
close has some nice tread work for the
tires<00:00:46.460> emblem<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.789> RPM<00:00:48.180> Morpher

tires emblem of the RPM Morpher

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.100 
tires emblem of the RPM Morpher
or<00:00:48.870> well<00:00:49.110> anyway<00:00:50.120> nice<00:00:51.120> paint<00:00:51.449> apps<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.899> guess

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
or well anyway nice paint apps I guess

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.630 
or well anyway nice paint apps I guess
back<00:00:52.670> it's<00:00:53.670> pretty<00:00:53.820> plain<00:00:54.649> this<00:00:55.649> Morpher<00:00:56.430> does

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
back it's pretty plain this Morpher does

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.639 
back it's pretty plain this Morpher does
take<00:00:57.000> LR<00:00:57.329> 44<00:00:57.360> s<00:00:57.930> which<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.199> typical<00:00:58.590> of

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
take LR 44 s which is typical of

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.010 
take LR 44 s which is typical of
cellphone<00:00:59.070> morphers<00:00:59.520> but<00:01:00.270> other<00:01:00.780> than<00:01:00.930> that

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
cellphone morphers but other than that

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.179 
cellphone morphers but other than that
it's<00:01:01.530> still<00:01:01.859> pretty<00:01:02.010> nice<00:01:03.559> with<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.769> Morpher

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
it's still pretty nice with this Morpher

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.820 
it's still pretty nice with this Morpher
you<00:01:05.339> get<00:01:05.489> these<00:01:05.610> three<00:01:05.909> discs<00:01:06.510> or<00:01:06.810> SD<00:01:07.409> cards<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
you get these three discs or SD cards I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.700 
you get these three discs or SD cards I
guess<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.220> were<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.490> call<00:01:08.670> them<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:09.710> which

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
guess if I were to call them that which

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.250 
guess if I were to call them that which
this<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.520> morph<00:01:11.909> card<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.960> what<00:01:13.110> is

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
this is the morph card this is what is

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.310 
this is the morph card this is what is
used<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.880> three<00:01:15.450> Rangers<00:01:15.900> when<00:01:16.200> they

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
used with the three Rangers when they

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.210 
used with the three Rangers when they
morph<00:01:17.600> this<00:01:18.600> card<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.320> show<00:01:19.560> accurate<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.159> is

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
morph this card is show accurate this is

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.140 
morph this card is show accurate this is
a<00:01:20.369> pretty<00:01:20.640> cheap<00:01:20.759> way<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:22.610> them<00:01:23.610> releasing<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
a pretty cheap way of them releasing the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.840 
a pretty cheap way of them releasing the
cards<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:25.340> they<00:01:26.340> usually<00:01:26.580> had<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.390> thicker

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.670 

more<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.030> thickness<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.450> him<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.049> think<00:01:34.409> if<00:01:34.560> I

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
more of a thickness to him I think if I

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.469 
more of a thickness to him I think if I
had<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> Japanese<00:01:35.400> version<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.090> Morpher

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
had the Japanese version of this Morpher

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.670 
had the Japanese version of this Morpher
I<00:01:36.509> would<00:01:36.720> probably<00:01:36.869> be<00:01:37.079> able<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.259> explain<00:01:37.619> it

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
I would probably be able to explain it

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.429 
I would probably be able to explain it
more<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.950> detail<00:01:38.540> and<00:01:39.540> they<00:01:40.020> were<00:01:40.079> white

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
more in detail and they were white

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.620 
more in detail and they were white
instead<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.040> plain<00:01:41.400> black<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.360> know

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
instead of plain black but you know

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.450 
instead of plain black but you know
black<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.470> cheaper<00:01:43.799> why<00:01:43.979> it's<00:01:44.130> more<00:01:44.250> expensive

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
black is cheaper why it's more expensive

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.770 
black is cheaper why it's more expensive
when<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.659> comes<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:46.020> paint<00:01:47.180> this<00:01:48.180> one<00:01:48.450> is

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
when you it comes to paint this one is

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.109 
when you it comes to paint this one is
used<00:01:49.350> by<00:01:49.530> Flynn<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.310> Blue<00:01:50.490> Ranger<00:01:50.670> although

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
used by Flynn the Blue Ranger although

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.670 
used by Flynn the Blue Ranger although
this<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.450> actually<00:01:51.720> more<00:01:51.869> purple<00:01:52.290> than<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.560> is

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
this is actually more purple than it is

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.310 
this is actually more purple than it is
blue<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.399> guys<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.759> see<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.180> my<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.630> my

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
blue if you guys can see it in my and my

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.889 
blue if you guys can see it in my and my
lighting<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.280> guess<00:01:56.670> because<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.540> guess<00:01:57.750> it

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
lighting I guess because I guess it

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.569 
lighting I guess because I guess it
looks<00:01:57.930> really<00:01:58.259> good<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.680> phone<00:01:58.920> but

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
looks really good on the phone but

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.060 
looks really good on the phone but
that's<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.630> one<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.960> Flynn<00:02:01.320> uses<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.890> guess

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
that's the one that Flynn uses I guess

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.789 
that's the one that Flynn uses I guess
and<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.240> Sony's<00:02:03.570> card<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.590> yellow

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
and this is Sony's card the yellow

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.830 
and this is Sony's card the yellow
ranger<00:02:05.240> so<00:02:07.399> looking<00:02:08.399> at<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> Morpher<00:02:09.119> like<00:02:09.690> I

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
ranger so looking at the Morpher like I

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.930 
ranger so looking at the Morpher like I
showed<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.370> pretty<00:02:11.370> much<00:02:11.489> everything<00:02:11.910> that

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
showed you pretty much everything that

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.339 
showed you pretty much everything that
was<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.270> here<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.660> was<00:02:13.020> getting<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.230> little

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
was in here I was getting a little

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.790 
was in here I was getting a little
scratch

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
scratch

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.180 
scratch
up<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.100> paint<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:14.610> well<00:02:15.710> this<00:02:16.710> is<00:02:16.860> typical

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
up on the paint but well this is typical

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.750 
up on the paint but well this is typical
of<00:02:17.250> cellphone<00:02:17.730> morphers<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.540> molding<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.770> the

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
one in so let's check out this there's

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.240 
one in so let's check out this there's
Flynn's<00:04:18.299> card<00:04:18.570> close<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.680> up

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
Flynn's card close it up

Flynn's card close it up
get<00:04:21.880> a<00:04:21.910> more<00:04:22.480> of<00:04:22.510> a<00:04:22.660> drive<00:04:23.050> up<00:04:23.290> noise<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:24.570> then

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
get a more of a drive up noise and then

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.420 
get a more of a drive up noise and then
you<00:04:25.690> got<00:04:25.810> a<00:04:25.840> driving<00:04:26.170> noise<00:04:26.500> I<00:04:29.250> guess<00:04:30.250> you<00:04:30.310> got

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
you got a driving noise I guess you got

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.990 
you got a driving noise I guess you got
to<00:04:30.520> hold<00:04:30.610> it

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
to hold it

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.260 
to hold it
I<00:04:32.610> don't<00:04:33.610> restart<00:04:34.030> it's<00:04:34.990> pretty<00:04:35.200> much<00:04:35.320> it

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
I don't restart it's pretty much it

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.120 
I don't restart it's pretty much it
so<00:04:37.270> that's<00:04:37.420> Flynn's<00:04:37.690> park<00:04:37.960> next<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:38.740> Sonny's

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
so that's Flynn's park next to Sonny's

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:47.670 
so that's Flynn's park next to Sonny's
card<00:04:42.510> and<00:04:43.510> that's<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.620> calling<00:04:44.950> noise<00:04:46.680> and

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
card and that's the calling noise and

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.380 
card and that's the calling noise and
you'll<00:04:47.830> get<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.070> let's<00:04:48.280> go<00:04:48.460> Rangers<00:04:48.700> and<00:04:49.150> the

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
you'll get the let's go Rangers and the

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.140 
you'll get the let's go Rangers and the
calling<00:04:49.720> noise<00:04:49.960> all<00:04:50.110> over<00:04:50.380> again

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
calling noise all over again

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.210 
calling noise all over again
so<00:04:52.150> that's<00:04:52.270> pretty<00:04:52.390> much<00:04:52.510> it<00:04:53.050> otherwise<00:04:53.890> the

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
so that's pretty much it otherwise the

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.400 
so that's pretty much it otherwise the
gimmick<00:04:54.520> of<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:55.030> cars<00:04:55.330> being<00:04:55.630> inserted<00:04:56.110> I

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
gimmick of the cars being inserted I

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.930 
gimmick of the cars being inserted I
think<00:04:56.710> it's<00:04:56.800> a<00:04:56.860> pretty<00:04:57.040> cool<00:04:57.130> gimmick<00:04:58.680> it's

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
think it's a pretty cool gimmick it's

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.260 
think it's a pretty cool gimmick it's
very<00:05:01.950> cheap<00:05:02.950> compared<00:05:03.670> to<00:05:03.730> the<00:05:03.850> Japanese

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
very cheap compared to the Japanese

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.180 
very cheap compared to the Japanese
version<00:05:04.690> Japanese<00:05:05.170> version<00:05:05.530> as<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:05.800> said<00:05:06.010> had

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
version Japanese version as I said had

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.900 
version Japanese version as I said had
lights<00:05:06.490> and<00:05:06.910> had<00:05:07.390> thicker<00:05:08.760> cards<00:05:09.760> and<00:05:09.880> I

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
lights and had thicker cards and I

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.160 
lights and had thicker cards and I
actually<00:05:10.000> think<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.390> cards<00:05:10.690> actually<00:05:10.840> did

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
actually think the cards actually did

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.460 
actually think the cards actually did
something<00:05:11.410> a<00:05:11.770> little<00:05:12.100> bit<00:05:12.190> more<00:05:12.600> video<00:05:13.600> but

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
something a little bit more video but

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.560 
something a little bit more video but
yeah<00:05:14.980> this<00:05:15.160> is<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.460> RP<00:05:15.820> at<00:05:15.910> Morpher<00:05:16.300> that's

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
yeah this is the RP at Morpher that's

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.430 
yeah this is the RP at Morpher that's
pretty<00:05:17.020> much<00:05:17.140> the<00:05:17.320> basic<00:05:19.169> Morpher<00:05:20.169> for<00:05:20.320> that

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440
