do that in a couple of the lens to the
sensor<00:04:57.620> to<00:04:57.950> make<00:04:58.130> sure<00:04:58.250> they<00:04:58.400> both<00:04:58.640> work

sensor to make sure they both work

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.960 
sensor to make sure they both work
perfectly<00:04:59.570> and<00:05:00.260> that's<00:05:00.440> really<00:05:00.770> our<00:05:01.040> main

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
perfectly and that's really our main

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.300 
perfectly and that's really our main
strength<00:05:04.540> and<00:05:05.540> finally<00:05:05.960> what<00:05:06.290> is<00:05:06.620> in<00:05:06.950> store<00:05:07.100> in

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
strength and finally what is in store in
