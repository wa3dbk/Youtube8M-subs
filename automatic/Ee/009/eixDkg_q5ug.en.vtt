next card in my pile was a seven which I
could<00:04:20.140> also<00:04:20.290> play<00:04:20.739> then<00:04:21.670> I<00:04:21.700> played<00:04:22.090> my<00:04:22.300> 9<00:04:22.540> in<00:04:22.840> my

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
could also play then I played my 9 in my

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
hand to discard and then my turn was

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.370 
hand to discard and then my turn was
over<00:04:27.090> since<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.240> brought<00:04:28.510> one<00:04:28.750> of<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.020> centered

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
over since I brought one of the centered

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.590 
over since I brought one of the centered
piles<00:04:29.680> up<00:04:29.980> to<00:04:30.190> a<00:04:30.220> king<00:04:30.550> she<00:04:30.940> took<00:04:31.120> it<00:04:31.330> out<00:04:31.420> of

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
piles up to a king she took it out of

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.480 
piles up to a king she took it out of
the<00:04:31.630> center<00:04:32.020> and<00:04:32.050> put<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:32.500> over<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:32.890> the<00:04:33.010> side

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
the center and put it over to the side

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.450 
the center and put it over to the side
she<00:04:34.120> drew<00:04:34.330> five<00:04:34.630> more<00:04:34.930> cards<00:04:35.410> but<00:04:35.770> she<00:04:35.950> had<00:04:36.190> no

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
she drew five more cards but she had no

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:45.000 
she drew five more cards but she had no
moves<00:04:36.820> so<00:04:37.480> she<00:04:37.540> discarded

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.640 

we<00:04:45.730> continued<00:04:46.240> through<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:46.510> game<00:04:46.810> until<00:04:47.350> we

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
we continued through the game until we

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:54.869 
we continued through the game until we
were<00:04:47.770> almost<00:04:47.950> out<00:04:48.250> of<00:04:48.280> Center<00:04:48.730> cards

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:54.879 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.299 

we<00:04:55.479> are<00:04:55.599> both<00:04:55.749> now<00:04:56.020> up<00:04:56.229> to<00:04:56.379> four<00:04:56.589> discard<00:04:57.039> piles

00:04:57.299 --> 00:04:57.309 
we are both now up to four discard piles

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:59.760 
we are both now up to four discard piles
so<00:04:57.580> now<00:04:57.909> instead<00:04:58.240> of<00:04:58.719> making<00:04:59.080> new<00:04:59.259> discard

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
so now instead of making new discard

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.159 
so now instead of making new discard
piles<00:05:00.039> we<00:05:00.639> have<00:05:00.819> to<00:05:00.999> keep<00:05:01.179> stacking<00:05:01.479> cards<00:05:02.020> on

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
piles we have to keep stacking cards on

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:08.100 
piles we have to keep stacking cards on
top<00:05:02.409> of<00:05:02.619> other<00:05:02.800> discard<00:05:03.369> piles

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.740 

we<00:05:09.099> ran<00:05:09.340> out<00:05:09.370> of<00:05:09.520> cards<00:05:09.970> in<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.180> center<00:05:10.449> pile

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
we ran out of cards in the center pile

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.110 
we ran out of cards in the center pile
so<00:05:11.379> she<00:05:11.439> took<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.949> not<00:05:12.129> being<00:05:12.370> newest<00:05:12.759> cards

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
so she took the not being newest cards

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.270 
so she took the not being newest cards
and<00:05:13.300> reshuffle<00:05:13.840> them<00:05:14.020> making<00:05:14.650> sure<00:05:14.830> that<00:05:15.129> they

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
and reshuffle them making sure that they

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.950 
and reshuffle them making sure that they
are<00:05:15.310> shuffled<00:05:15.879> good<00:05:16.090> since<00:05:16.389> they're<00:05:16.569> all<00:05:16.780> in

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
are shuffled good since they're all in

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.220 
are shuffled good since they're all in
order

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.340 

I<00:05:21.370> drew<00:05:22.370> two<00:05:22.580> cards<00:05:22.610> a<00:05:23.270> 2<00:05:23.330> and<00:05:23.810> a<00:05:23.900> 6

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
I drew two cards a 2 and a 6

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.680 
I drew two cards a 2 and a 6
I<00:05:24.500> had<00:05:24.950> a<00:05:24.980> three<00:05:25.310> in<00:05:25.400> my<00:05:25.550> face<00:05:25.820> up<00:05:26.060> pile<00:05:26.330> so<00:05:26.630> I

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
I had a three in my face up pile so I

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.630 
I had a three in my face up pile so I
played<00:05:26.990> it<00:05:27.140> on<00:05:27.230> top<00:05:27.500> of<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:27.830> existing<00:05:27.950> two

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
played it on top of the existing two

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.420 
played it on top of the existing two
next<00:05:29.600> card<00:05:29.840> in<00:05:29.960> my<00:05:30.080> pile<00:05:30.320> wasn't<00:05:30.830> helpful<00:05:31.070> so<00:05:31.400> I

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
next card in my pile wasn't helpful so I

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.060 
next card in my pile wasn't helpful so I
put<00:05:31.760> it<00:05:31.880> back<00:05:31.910> down<00:05:32.360> I<00:05:32.630> could<00:05:33.290> play<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:33.620> six<00:05:33.890> I
