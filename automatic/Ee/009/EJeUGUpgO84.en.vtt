a<00:00:31.350> medical<00:00:31.710> coding<00:00:31.950> class<00:00:32.279> what<00:00:32.489> exactly<00:00:33.000> are

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
a medical coding class what exactly are

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.520 
a medical coding class what exactly are
you<00:00:33.300> looking<00:00:33.660> for<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.989> medical<00:00:34.320> coding

you looking for in a medical coding

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.680 
you looking for in a medical coding
class<00:00:34.830> I<00:00:35.160> want<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.180> find<00:00:36.360> out<00:00:36.480> what<00:00:36.629> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
class I want to find out what the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.020 
class I want to find out what the
differences<00:00:37.110> between<00:00:37.290> coding<00:00:37.830> and<00:00:37.980> billing

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
differences between coding and billing

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.280 
differences between coding and billing
coding<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.270> billing<00:00:39.300> that's<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:40.020> great

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
coding and billing that's a great

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.930 
coding and billing that's a great
question<00:00:40.739> because<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.070> lot<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.460> people<00:00:41.790> know<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
question because a lot of people know a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.090 
question because a lot of people know a
lot<00:00:42.360> about<00:00:42.390> billing<00:00:43.230> they<00:00:43.770> don't<00:00:43.949> know<00:00:44.070> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
lot about billing they don't know a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.530 
lot about billing they don't know a
whole<00:00:44.430> lot<00:00:44.460> about<00:00:44.640> coding<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.420> how

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
whole lot about coding and how

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.180 
whole lot about coding and how
everything<00:00:45.870> gets<00:00:46.170> from<00:00:46.410> point<00:00:46.440> A<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.800> point<00:00:46.920> B

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
everything gets from point A to point B

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.700 
everything gets from point A to point B
so<00:00:47.820> we'll<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.149> definitely<00:00:48.750> touching<00:00:49.230> on<00:00:49.530> that

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
so we'll be definitely touching on that

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.860 
so we'll be definitely touching on that
subject<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.340> what<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.120> your<00:00:51.540> reason<00:00:51.840> for

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
subject and what is your reason for

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.080 
subject and what is your reason for
taking<00:00:52.350> mine<00:00:52.739> I'd<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.730> know<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.880> little

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
taking mine I'd like to know a little

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.299 
taking mine I'd like to know a little
more<00:00:54.180> about<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.540> I'm<00:00:54.899> new<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.860> too<00:00:56.040> so<00:00:56.220> I'm

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
more about that I'm new to it too so I'm

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.250 
more about that I'm new to it too so I'm
trying<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.610> figure<00:00:56.880> out<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.809> differences

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
trying to figure out the differences

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.770 
trying to figure out the differences
between<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.739> hospital<00:00:59.219> coding<00:00:59.780> inpatient

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
between the hospital coding inpatient

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.189 
between the hospital coding inpatient
outpatient<00:01:01.700> professional<00:01:02.700> physician<00:01:03.210> office

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
outpatient professional physician office

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.020 
outpatient professional physician office
all<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.680> yeah<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.309> another<00:01:05.729> question

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
all of that yeah and another question

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.880 
all of that yeah and another question
that<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.780> every<00:01:07.020> single<00:01:07.350> class<00:01:07.590> that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
that we get in every single class that

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.040 
that we get in every single class that
we<00:01:08.009> do<00:01:08.190> and<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.090> reason<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.750> because

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
we do and the reason that is is because

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.570 
we do and the reason that is is because
most<00:01:10.740> people<00:01:11.039> that<00:01:11.130> work<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.550> industry

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
most people that work in the industry

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.520 
most people that work in the industry
don't<00:01:12.240> know<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.600> differences<00:01:13.020> between<00:01:13.200> all

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
don't know the differences between all

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.950 
don't know the differences between all
of<00:01:13.560> those<00:01:13.770> coding<00:01:14.160> systems<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.300> we're<00:01:15.869> going

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
of those coding systems so we're going

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.560 
of those coding systems so we're going
to<00:01:16.020> definitely<00:01:16.290> touch<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.220> actually

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
to definitely touch on that and actually

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.180 
to definitely touch on that and actually
that's<00:01:18.570> where<00:01:18.780> we'd<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.170> get<00:01:19.320> started<00:01:19.770> is

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
that's where we'd like to get started is

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.950 
that's where we'd like to get started is
to<00:01:20.220> talk<00:01:20.670> about<00:01:20.850> what<00:01:21.180> are<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.479> differences

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
to talk about what are the differences

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.399 
to talk about what are the differences
between<00:01:22.229> all<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.220> those<00:01:23.930> those<00:01:24.930> coding

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
between all of those those coding

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.969 
between all of those those coding
systems<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.310> which<00:01:27.270> would<00:01:27.510> be<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.560> area<00:01:28.920> that

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
systems and which would be the area that

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.620 
systems and which would be the area that
I<00:01:29.130> would<00:01:29.369> be<00:01:29.490> most<00:01:29.729> interested<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.330> getting

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
I would be most interested in getting

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.450 
I would be most interested in getting
involved<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:32.299> you<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.540> basically<00:01:34.530> inpatient

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
involved in you have basically inpatient

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.390 
involved in you have basically inpatient
services<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.689> medical<00:01:37.409> coding<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:38.220> have

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
services for medical coding you have

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.179 
services for medical coding you have
outpatient<00:01:39.270> hospital<00:01:39.420> services<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.590> then

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
outpatient hospital services and then

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.160 
outpatient hospital services and then
you<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.610> physician<00:01:42.540> services<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:44.479> I'm<00:01:45.479> just

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
you have physician services and I'm just

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.710 
you have physician services and I'm just
going<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.320> let<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.560> know<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.390> we<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.600> have

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
going to let you know that we can have

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.149 
going to let you know that we can have
inpatient<00:01:51.720> services<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:53.250> encompass

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
inpatient services that encompass

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.640 
inpatient services that encompass
different<00:01:56.159> types<00:01:56.400> of<00:01:56.930> components<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.079> medical

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
different types of components of medical

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.219 
different types of components of medical
coding<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.640> for<00:02:00.420> instance<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.869> can<00:02:00.900> have

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
coding so for instance I can have

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.319 
coding so for instance I can have
inpatient<00:02:01.950> professional<00:02:02.579> which<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
inpatient professional which is the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.440 
inpatient professional which is the
doctors<00:02:03.720> component<00:02:04.290> or<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.439> can<00:02:05.310> have<00:02:05.549> just

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
doctors component or I can have just

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.569 
doctors component or I can have just
outpatient<00:02:07.439> technical<00:02:07.920> component<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:08.549> I

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:08.579

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.460 
have a physician and a technical
component<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:11.150> all<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.480> areas<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.019> we

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
component in all of the areas that we

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.310 
component in all of the areas that we
code<00:02:13.739> in<00:02:13.980> with<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.579> exception<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.450> inpatient

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
code in with the exception of inpatient

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.680 
code in with the exception of inpatient
hospital<00:02:17.040> setting<00:02:17.370> which<00:02:18.000> would<00:02:18.180> be<00:02:18.239> strictly

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
hospital setting which would be strictly

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.289 
hospital setting which would be strictly
technical<00:02:19.079> and<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:20.639> reason<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.030> write

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
technical and the reason that I write

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.360 
technical and the reason that I write
this<00:02:21.510> down<00:02:22.019> is<00:02:22.470> because<00:02:22.799> of<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.010> fact<00:02:23.220> that

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
this down is because of the fact that

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.000 
this down is because of the fact that
the<00:02:23.940> professional<00:02:24.540> component<00:02:25.109> requires<00:02:25.560> that

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
the professional component requires that

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.180 
the professional component requires that
the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.750

office visit a face-to-face visit that's

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.610 
office visit a face-to-face visit that's
what<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.060> physician<00:02:33.480> component<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.080> the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
what the physician component is the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.500 
what the physician component is the
technical<00:02:35.130> component<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.390> is

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
technical component and that this is

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.120 
technical component and that this is
really<00:02:36.690> important<00:02:37.260> before<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.710> know<00:02:37.890> what

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
really important before you know what

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.000 
really important before you know what
types<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:39.110> coding<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.230> you're<00:02:40.380> going<00:02:40.680> into

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
types of coding that you're going into

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.220 
types of coding that you're going into
the<00:02:41.550> technical<00:02:42.090> component<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.750> basically

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
the technical component is basically

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.390 
the technical component is basically
covers<00:02:43.790> equipment<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:45.320> hate<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.440> call<00:02:46.620> people

be impatient it could be outpatient a
lot<00:03:10.830> of<00:03:10.980> times<00:03:11.160> we'll<00:03:11.340> say<00:03:11.460> inpatient<00:03:12.060> and

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
lot of times we'll say inpatient and

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.210 
lot of times we'll say inpatient and
people<00:03:12.390> just<00:03:12.630> make<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:12.930> one<00:03:12.990> broad<00:03:13.530> category

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
people just make that one broad category

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.880 
people just make that one broad category
okay<00:03:14.910> but<00:03:15.360> it's<00:03:15.510> not<00:03:15.570> it's<00:03:15.990> professional

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
okay but it's not it's professional

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.590 
okay but it's not it's professional
anywhere<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.310> doctor<00:03:17.730> sees<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:17.970> patient<00:03:18.210> and

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
face and then the technical component is

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.900 
face and then the technical component is
going<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.230> be<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.470> equipment<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.220> office<00:03:29.700> the

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
going to be the equipment the office the

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.690 
going to be the equipment the office the
lights<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.770> know<00:03:31.890> everything<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.430> has

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
lights the you know everything that has

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.260 
lights the you know everything that has
to<00:03:32.910> do<00:03:33.030> with<00:03:33.770> what<00:03:34.770> it<00:03:34.890> costs<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.489> actually<00:03:35.640> run

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
to do with what it costs to actually run

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.729 
to do with what it costs to actually run
whatever<00:03:36.750> facility<00:03:37.380> they're<00:03:37.530> in<00:03:37.620> the

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
whatever facility they're in the

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.240 
whatever facility they're in the
building<00:03:37.950> all<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:39.000> stuff<00:03:39.300> so<00:03:40.170> now<00:03:41.070> that

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
building all of that stuff so now that

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.070 
building all of that stuff so now that
we<00:03:41.340> kind<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:41.610> have<00:03:41.730> an<00:03:41.850> idea<00:03:41.970> of<00:03:42.330> professional

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
we kind of have an idea of professional

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.990 
we kind of have an idea of professional
and<00:03:43.200> technical<00:03:43.739> in<00:03:43.890> all<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.430> those<00:03:44.520> sites<00:03:44.820> of

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
and technical in all of those sites of

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.970 
and technical in all of those sites of
service<00:03:45.360> let's<00:03:45.959> talk<00:03:46.170> about<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.590> difference

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
service let's talk about the difference

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:54.850 
service let's talk about the difference
between<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:50.000> hospital<00:03:51.000> setting<00:03:51.530> and<00:03:53.600> how

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
between the hospital setting and how

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.449 
between the hospital setting and how
it's<00:03:55.860> coded<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:57.570> physician<00:03:58.080> setting

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:02.660 

okay

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
okay

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.190 
okay
the<00:04:03.090> hospital<00:04:03.660> setting<00:04:03.900> in<00:04:04.290> patient<00:04:05.090> actually

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
the hospital setting in patient actually

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.170 
the hospital setting in patient actually
only<00:04:08.120> basically<00:04:09.120> you<00:04:09.450> code<00:04:09.720> only<00:04:10.280> for<00:04:11.280> what<00:04:11.940> a

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
only basically you code only for what a

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.780 
only basically you code only for what a
patient<00:04:12.630> is<00:04:12.720> seen<00:04:12.870> for<00:04:13.110> it<00:04:13.400> okay<00:04:14.400> so<00:04:14.459> that's

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
patient is seen for it okay so that's

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.860 
patient is seen for it okay so that's
the<00:04:14.970> diagnosis<00:04:15.630> code<00:04:16.160> if<00:04:17.160> you're<00:04:17.940> you<00:04:18.600> want<00:04:18.750> to

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
the diagnosis code if you're you want to

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.810 
the diagnosis code if you're you want to
know<00:04:18.959> why<00:04:19.320> are<00:04:19.709> they<00:04:19.919> in<00:04:20.100> a<00:04:20.190> hospital<00:04:20.669> setting

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
know why are they in a hospital setting

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.450 
know why are they in a hospital setting
okay<00:04:21.239> do<00:04:21.690> they<00:04:21.810> have<00:04:21.989> you<00:04:22.800> know<00:04:22.830> congestive

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
okay do they have you know congestive

okay do they have you know congestive
heart<00:04:23.490> failure<00:04:23.730> whatever<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.750> case<00:04:24.900> may<00:04:25.080> be

heart failure whatever the case may be

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.650 
heart failure whatever the case may be
the<00:04:25.919> physician<00:04:26.460> component<00:04:27.060> would<00:04:27.210> actually

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
the physician component would actually

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.540 
the physician component would actually
say<00:04:27.870> what<00:04:28.169> did<00:04:28.320> I<00:04:28.380> do<00:04:28.500> to<00:04:28.830> that<00:04:28.860> patient<00:04:29.430> and

say what did I do to that patient and

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.850 
say what did I do to that patient and

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
why am I seeing them the professional

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.010 
why am I seeing them the professional
component<00:04:32.550> for<00:04:32.640> hospital<00:04:33.000> but<00:04:33.120> for<00:04:33.300> inpatient

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
component for hospital but for inpatient

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.050 
component for hospital but for inpatient
hospital<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.770> we're<00:04:35.550> not<00:04:35.610> going<00:04:35.789> to<00:04:35.850> talk

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
hospital and we're not going to talk

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.969 
hospital and we're not going to talk
much<00:04:36.300> more<00:04:36.330> about<00:04:36.600> inpatient<00:04:37.530> hospital

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
much more about inpatient hospital

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.380 
much more about inpatient hospital
because<00:04:38.280> this<00:04:38.460> class<00:04:38.669> is<00:04:38.880> geared<00:04:39.090> towards

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
because this class is geared towards

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.040 
because this class is geared towards
professional

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
professional

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.719 
professional
but<00:04:40.530> we<00:04:40.650> do<00:04:40.830> want<00:04:41.009> you<00:04:41.099> to<00:04:41.190> understand<00:04:41.610> the

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
but we do want you to understand the

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.540 
but we do want you to understand the
differences<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:42.360> so<00:04:43.020> inpatient<00:04:43.740> hospital<00:04:44.370> is

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
differences and so inpatient hospital is

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.790 
differences and so inpatient hospital is
basically<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.539> diagnosis<00:04:46.199> code<00:04:46.379> for<00:04:46.620> what<00:04:46.770> I

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
basically the diagnosis code for what I

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.219 
basically the diagnosis code for what I
see<00:04:47.099> the<00:04:47.220> patient<00:04:47.610> for<00:04:47.789> and<00:04:48.030> all<00:04:48.659> of<00:04:49.050> the

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
see the patient for and all of the

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.200 
see the patient for and all of the
technical<00:04:49.860> component<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.610> we'll<00:04:50.909> talk<00:04:51.090> about

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
technical component and we'll talk about

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.730 
technical component and we'll talk about
billing<00:04:51.659> in<00:04:51.780> a<00:04:51.840> little<00:04:52.080> bit<00:04:52.199> and<00:04:52.349> how<00:04:52.470> that

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
billing in a little bit and how that

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.010 
billing in a little bit and how that
also<00:04:53.250> is<00:04:53.759> very<00:04:53.909> different<00:04:54.449> in<00:04:54.509> all<00:04:54.629> sites<00:04:54.870> of

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
also is very different in all sites of

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.180 
also is very different in all sites of
service<00:04:55.319> because<00:04:55.560> a<00:04:55.590> lot<00:04:55.770> of<00:04:55.860> people<00:04:56.069> don't

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
service because a lot of people don't

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.649 
service because a lot of people don't
even<00:04:56.310> look<00:04:56.550> at<00:04:56.669> billing<00:04:56.940> as<00:04:57.030> being<00:04:57.270> different

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
even look at billing as being different

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.649 
even look at billing as being different
so<00:04:58.409> inpatient<00:04:59.190> hospital<00:04:59.699> is<00:04:59.849> diagnosis<00:05:00.509> code

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
so inpatient hospital is diagnosis code

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:01.969 
so inpatient hospital is diagnosis code
we're<00:05:00.840> going<00:05:00.930> to<00:05:00.990> go<00:05:01.139> over<00:05:01.349> the<00:05:01.440> books<00:05:01.590> in<00:05:01.800> just

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
we're going to go over the books in just

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.580 
we're going to go over the books in just
a<00:05:02.069> second<00:05:02.430> that<00:05:02.550> you<00:05:02.669> would<00:05:02.819> utilize<00:05:03.440> then<00:05:04.440> you

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
a second that you would utilize then you

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.529 
a second that you would utilize then you
also<00:05:04.949> have<00:05:05.310> a<00:05:05.340> physician<00:05:05.610> interpretation

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
also have a physician interpretation

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.890 
also have a physician interpretation
component<00:05:07.050> so<00:05:07.259> if<00:05:07.560> and<00:05:08.400> my<00:05:08.759> patient<00:05:09.539> name<00:05:09.690> is

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
component so if and my patient name is

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.469 
component so if and my patient name is
Ethel<00:05:10.289> because<00:05:10.830> that's<00:05:11.280> just<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:11.819> me<00:05:11.970> a<00:05:12.150> nice

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
Ethel because that's just to me a nice

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.140 
Ethel because that's just to me a nice
Medicare<00:05:12.960> name<00:05:13.490> nothing<00:05:14.490> against<00:05:14.789> any<00:05:14.909> of<00:05:15.060> the

Medicare name nothing against any of the

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.610 
Medicare name nothing against any of the
Ethel's<00:05:15.449> out<00:05:15.599> there<00:05:15.780> my<00:05:15.930> grandmother's<00:05:16.440> name

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
Ethel's out there my grandmother's name

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.990 
Ethel's out there my grandmother's name
was<00:05:16.680> Ethel<00:05:17.190> or<00:05:17.490> my<00:05:17.669> great-grandmother<00:05:18.150> but

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
was Ethel or my great-grandmother but

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.820 
was Ethel or my great-grandmother but
you<00:05:21.000> know<00:05:21.120> when<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.810> doctor<00:05:21.930> goes<00:05:22.349> in<00:05:22.560> to<00:05:22.680> see

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
you know when the doctor goes in to see

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.820 
you know when the doctor goes in to see
Ethel<00:05:23.220> in<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.520> inpatient<00:05:24.000> setting<00:05:24.830> he

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
Ethel in the inpatient setting he

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.040 
Ethel in the inpatient setting he
utilizes<00:05:26.550> that<00:05:26.759> face-to-face<00:05:27.389> visit<00:05:27.750> as<00:05:27.840> well

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
utilizes that face-to-face visit as well

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.839 
utilizes that face-to-face visit as well
when<00:05:28.319> we<00:05:28.349> get<00:05:28.590> in<00:05:28.770> EAM<00:05:29.220> and<00:05:29.490> things<00:05:29.669> like<00:05:29.789> that

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
when we get in EAM and things like that

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.249 
when we get in EAM and things like that
you'll<00:05:30.210> see<00:05:30.389> those<00:05:30.569> differences<00:05:31.110> for

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
you'll see those differences for

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:33.909 
you'll see those differences for
professional<00:05:31.770> component<00:05:32.250> then<00:05:32.969> you<00:05:33.150> have

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
professional component then you have

professional component then you have
outpatient<00:05:34.919> hospital<00:05:38.509> I'm<00:05:39.509> not<00:05:39.629> a<00:05:39.659> very<00:05:39.900> good

writer<00:05:40.469> I<00:05:40.860> can<00:05:41.250> spell<00:05:41.490> but<00:05:41.789> then<00:05:42.780> you<00:05:42.900> have

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
writer I can spell but then you have

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.870 
writer I can spell but then you have
outpatient<00:05:43.740> hospital<00:05:44.159> outpatient<00:05:44.729> hospital

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
outpatient hospital outpatient hospital

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.140 
outpatient hospital outpatient hospital
is<00:05:45.419> basically<00:05:46.009> the<00:05:47.009> equivalent<00:05:47.430> coding

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
is basically the equivalent coding

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.050 
is basically the equivalent coding
systems<00:05:48.630> of<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:49.020> physician<00:05:49.500> you<00:05:50.340> use<00:05:50.520> CPT

coding and procedures and you get paid

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.670 
coding and procedures and you get paid
basically<00:05:53.849> for<00:05:54.210> the<00:05:54.300> procedures<00:05:54.810> that<00:05:54.990> you're

seeing that patient for all the

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:00.110 
seeing that patient for all the
diagnosis<00:05:58.259> code<00:05:58.469> does<00:05:58.710> really<00:05:59.250> for<00:06:00.029> the

diagnosis code does really for the

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.999 
diagnosis code does really for the
physician<00:06:00.539> is<00:06:00.719> establish<00:06:01.169> medical<00:06:01.349> necessity

physician is establish medical necessity
all<00:06:02.159> right<00:06:02.310> it<00:06:02.430> says<00:06:02.639> you<00:06:03.150> can<00:06:03.330> do<00:06:03.449> it<00:06:03.569> for<00:06:03.719> this

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
all right it says you can do it for this

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.309 
all right it says you can do it for this
reason

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 
reason

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:07.339 
reason
so<00:06:05.150> inpatient<00:06:06.150> hospital<00:06:06.630> is<00:06:06.810> technical

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
so inpatient hospital is technical

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:09.559 
so inpatient hospital is technical
component<00:06:07.860> only<00:06:08.009> and<00:06:08.520> diagnosis<00:06:09.360> coding

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569 
component only and diagnosis coding

component only and diagnosis coding
outpatient<00:06:10.380> hospital<00:06:10.529> is<00:06:11.069> CPT<00:06:11.580> coding<00:06:11.849> and

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
outpatient hospital is CPT coding and

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.990 
outpatient hospital is CPT coding and
icd-9<00:06:12.960> coding<00:06:13.289> we'll<00:06:13.889> go<00:06:14.190> over<00:06:14.370> the<00:06:14.550> bills<00:06:14.759> in

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
icd-9 coding we'll go over the bills in

great thing about taking a professional
component<00:06:26.069> class<00:06:26.279> is<00:06:26.580> the<00:06:27.419> fact<00:06:27.630> that<00:06:27.750> you<00:06:27.960> get

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
component class is the fact that you get

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.100 
component class is the fact that you get
it<00:06:28.199> all<00:06:28.729> okay<00:06:29.729> if<00:06:29.940> you<00:06:30.180> know<00:06:30.389> professional

component and you make that the template
you<00:06:33.990> can<00:06:34.020> eventually<00:06:34.440> go<00:06:34.800> into<00:06:34.830> inpatient
