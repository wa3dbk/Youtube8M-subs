you can't really do much with a name
like<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.989> unfortunately<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.800> problem<00:00:44.250> that

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
like that unfortunately the problem that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.670 
like that unfortunately the problem that
arises<00:00:44.850> sometimes<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.750> local<00:00:46.079> projects<00:00:46.559> is

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
arises sometimes with local projects is

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.119 
arises sometimes with local projects is
that<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> names<00:00:47.280> don't<00:00:48.500> relate<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.710> any<00:00:49.829> way

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
that the names don't relate in any way

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.670 
that the names don't relate in any way
to<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> business<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.230> having<00:00:52.500> quite

to the business and this is having quite
a<00:00:52.739> few<00:00:52.949> times<00:00:52.980> with<00:00:53.550> with<00:00:54.329> actual<00:00:54.690> businesses

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
a few times with with actual businesses

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.410 
a few times with with actual businesses
where<00:00:56.309> where<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.730> name<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.090> just<00:00:57.270> something

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
where where the name is just something

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.170 
where where the name is just something
random<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.989> they<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.590> ring<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.280> it

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
random that they like the ring of and it

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.900 
random that they like the ring of and it
relates<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.750> no<00:01:00.930> way<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:01.739> they<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:01.949> so

relates in no way to what they do so

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.310 
relates in no way to what they do so
it's<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.149> bit<00:01:03.300> more<00:01:03.420> difficult<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.960> try<00:01:04.199> and

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
it's a bit more difficult to try and

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.010 
it's a bit more difficult to try and
incorporate<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:06.030> object<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.659> their<00:01:06.780> business

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
incorporate the object of their business

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.649 
incorporate the object of their business
into<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.680> logo<00:01:08.130> without<00:01:08.909> making<00:01:09.450> something

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
into the logo without making something

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.719 
into the logo without making something
that<00:01:09.810> looks<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.260> completely<00:01:10.680> dissonant<00:01:11.430> and

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
that looks like completely dissonant and

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.390 
that looks like completely dissonant and
it's<00:01:12.479> or<00:01:13.130> incongruent<00:01:14.130> better<00:01:14.640> said<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:16.400> you

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
it's or incongruent better said so you

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.620 
it's or incongruent better said so you
know<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.549> decided<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.030> go<00:01:18.240> with<00:01:18.420> something

like<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:58.590> anyway<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.219> know<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.729> was

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
like that but anyway you know is it was

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.969 
like that but anyway you know is it was
meant<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.450> be<00:02:00.570> something<00:02:00.960> i<00:02:01.229> steamed<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.950> i

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
meant to be something i steamed so i

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.569 
meant to be something i steamed so i
start<00:02:02.430> off<00:02:02.610> with<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.590> an<00:02:04.590> outline<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.219> basic

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
start off with the an outline of a basic

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.240 
start off with the an outline of a basic
font<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.149> then<00:02:06.420> i<00:02:06.570> modified<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.259> by<00:02:07.619> hand<00:02:07.860> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
font and then i modified it by hand to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.130 
font and then i modified it by hand to
make<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.640> look<00:02:08.819> IC<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.110> sharp<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.860> irregular

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
make it look IC and sharp and irregular

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.470 
make it look IC and sharp and irregular
like<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.340> normal<00:02:13.990> you<00:02:14.990> know<00:02:15.020> ice<00:02:16.209> text<00:02:17.209> or<00:02:17.330> ice

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
like a normal you know ice text or ice

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.640 
like a normal you know ice text or ice
shape<00:02:17.870> would<00:02:18.110> look<00:02:18.350> like<00:02:18.530> in<00:02:19.120> nature<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.650> then

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
shape would look like in nature and then

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.520 
shape would look like in nature and then
I<00:02:21.680> just<00:02:22.220> can't<00:02:22.459> it<00:02:22.780> traced<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:23.930> an<00:02:24.050> illustrator

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
I just can't it traced it an illustrator

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.720 
I just can't it traced it an illustrator
but<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:24.890> most<00:02:25.069> difficult<00:02:25.459> thing<00:02:25.610> with

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
but the most difficult thing with

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.460 
but the most difficult thing with
projects<00:02:26.120> like<00:02:26.270> this<00:02:26.420> because<00:02:26.660> it<00:02:27.140> is<00:02:27.319> a

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
projects like this because it is a

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.010 
projects like this because it is a
simple<00:02:27.860> project<00:02:28.430> with<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.120> complexity<00:02:29.840> lies

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
simple project with the complexity lies

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.930 
simple project with the complexity lies
and<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.800> amount<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.070> tweaking<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.820> have

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
and the amount of tweaking that you have

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.150 
and the amount of tweaking that you have
to<00:02:32.090> do<00:02:32.209> after<00:02:32.690> you've<00:02:32.930> established<00:02:33.350> kind<00:02:34.100> of

to do after you've established kind of

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.370 
to do after you've established kind of
what<00:02:34.250> you're<00:02:34.400> going<00:02:34.670> with<00:02:35.380> unfortunately

what you're going with unfortunately

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.820 
what you're going with unfortunately
illustrator<00:02:36.860> has<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.550> tendency<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:39.590> blow

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
illustrator has a tendency to to blow

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.340 
illustrator has a tendency to to blow
certain<00:02:40.280> things<00:02:40.520> up<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:41.660> still<00:02:41.959> has<00:02:42.140> quite

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
certain things up and it still has quite

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.620 
certain things up and it still has quite
a<00:02:42.410> few<00:02:42.470> bugs<00:02:42.830> when<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.100> comes<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:44.239> command

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
a few bugs when it comes to to command

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.680 
a few bugs when it comes to to command
such<00:02:44.900> as<00:02:44.930> offset<00:02:45.680> path<00:02:46.209> quite<00:02:47.209> often<00:02:47.390> it

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
such as offset path quite often it

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.240 
such as offset path quite often it
doesn't<00:02:47.870> really<00:02:48.110> produce<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.739> results<00:02:49.220> that

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
doesn't really produce the results that

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.979 
doesn't really produce the results that
you're<00:02:49.489> looking<00:02:49.550> for<00:02:49.880> so<00:02:50.480> there's<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.780> lot<00:02:50.930> of

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
you're looking for so there's a lot of

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.740 
you're looking for so there's a lot of
tweaking<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.590> be<00:02:51.709> done<00:02:51.920> by<00:02:52.130> hand<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:53.630> would

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
tweaking to be done by hand and it would

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.750 
tweaking to be done by hand and it would
be<00:02:53.870> too<00:02:54.019> easy<00:02:54.050> if<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.830> was<00:02:54.950> just<00:02:55.190> boom<00:02:55.519> boom

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
be too easy if it was just boom boom

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.699 
be too easy if it was just boom boom
done<00:02:56.030> just<00:02:56.450> two<00:02:56.600> commands<00:02:57.019> and<00:02:57.110> that's<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.500> so

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
done just two commands and that's it so

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.500 
done just two commands and that's it so
I'm<00:02:57.739> not<00:02:58.370> complaining<00:02:58.910> about<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.090> but<00:02:59.330> yes

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
I'm not complaining about it but yes

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.030 
I'm not complaining about it but yes
there<00:02:59.810> is<00:02:59.959> a<00:02:59.989> lot<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.230> tweaking<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.739> be<00:03:00.860> done

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
there is a lot of tweaking to be done

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.580 
there is a lot of tweaking to be done
after<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.209> fact<00:03:02.420> simply<00:03:02.750> because<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.320> shapes

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
after the fact simply because the shapes

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.250 
after the fact simply because the shapes
don't<00:03:03.830> align<00:03:04.160> properly<00:03:04.489> or<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.480> offset

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
don't align properly or the the offset

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.960 
don't align properly or the the offset
path<00:03:06.500> doesn't<00:03:06.830> quite<00:03:07.070> correspond<00:03:07.730> with<00:03:07.760> the

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
path doesn't quite correspond with the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.750 
path doesn't quite correspond with the
shape<00:03:08.269> that<00:03:08.300> you<00:03:08.480> started<00:03:08.870> off<00:03:09.050> with<00:03:09.760> but

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
shape that you started off with but

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.009 
shape that you started off with but
something<00:03:11.030> that<00:03:11.150> has<00:03:11.330> been<00:03:11.360> making<00:03:11.660> my<00:03:11.900> life

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
something that has been making my life

something that has been making my life
easier<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.680> past<00:03:13.420> few<00:03:14.420> months<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.930> found<00:03:15.860> this

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
easier the past few months I found this

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.940 
easier the past few months I found this

kind to give that a look they're paid
they're<00:03:44.900> not<00:03:45.019> free<00:03:45.320> but<00:03:46.070> I<00:03:46.400> think<00:03:47.150> that

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
they're not free but I think that

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.300 
they're not free but I think that
they're<00:03:47.480> actually<00:03:47.660> worth<00:03:48.260> it<00:03:48.500> in<00:03:48.680> this<00:03:48.769> case<00:03:49.040> a

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
they're actually worth it in this case a

they're actually worth it in this case a

that<00:04:01.820> you<00:04:02.209> know<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:02.540> could<00:04:02.660> do<00:04:02.750> by<00:04:02.900> hand<00:04:03.079> it

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
that you know you could do by hand it

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.410 
that you know you could do by hand it
just<00:04:03.440> takes<00:04:03.620> a<00:04:03.739> few<00:04:03.769> seconds<00:04:04.190> more<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:04.549> they

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
just takes a few seconds more and they

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.759 
just takes a few seconds more and they
cost<00:04:05.600> like<00:04:05.690> 12<00:04:06.019> dollars<00:04:06.350> but<00:04:06.470> these<00:04:06.620> are

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
cost like 12 dollars but these are

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.590 
cost like 12 dollars but these are
actually<00:04:07.100> quite<00:04:07.220> hefty<00:04:07.489> price<00:04:08.000> like<00:04:08.299> the<00:04:08.450> most

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
actually quite hefty price like the most

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.810 
actually quite hefty price like the most
expensive<00:04:08.810> one<00:04:09.170> I<00:04:09.230> think<00:04:09.440> costs<00:04:09.799> about<00:04:09.890> $85

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
expensive one I think costs about $85

and<00:04:11.030> I'm<00:04:11.810> currently<00:04:11.959> trying<00:04:12.260> out<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.620> trial

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
and I'm currently trying out to trial

version of it and I might actually dish
out<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.870> money<00:04:15.049> for<00:04:15.140> that<00:04:15.290> because<00:04:15.560> I<00:04:16.010> think

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
out the money for that because I think

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.219 
out the money for that because I think
it's<00:04:17.000> indeed<00:04:17.269> worth<00:04:17.479> it<00:04:17.630> it<00:04:17.720> has<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:17.870> lot<00:04:18.200> of

there's<00:04:26.670> always<00:04:26.910> bugged<00:04:27.330> me<00:04:27.420> that<00:04:27.750> I've

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
there's always bugged me that I've

called vector scribe has a brush which

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.520 
called vector scribe has a brush which
basically<00:04:34.410> erases<00:04:35.250> redundant<00:04:36.320> points<00:04:37.320> and

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
basically erases redundant points and

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.920 
basically erases redundant points and
their<00:04:38.010> anchors<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:39.180> that's<00:04:39.360> awesome<00:04:39.540> because

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
their anchors so that's awesome because

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.050 
their anchors so that's awesome because
when<00:04:40.230> I<00:04:40.260> enough<00:04:40.740> often<00:04:41.340> want<00:04:41.490> to<00:04:41.550> draw<00:04:41.670> by<00:04:41.820> hand

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
behind a lot of redundant points which I

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.020 
behind a lot of redundant points which I
then<00:04:49.650> have<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:49.860> delete<00:04:50.220> by<00:04:50.400> hand<00:04:50.640> because<00:04:50.820> the

then have to delete by hand because the

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.120 
then have to delete by hand because the

simplified path command an illustrator
unfortunately<00:04:53.700> is<00:04:53.820> pretty<00:04:54.270> crappy<00:04:54.620> but<00:04:55.620> this

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
unfortunately is pretty crappy but this

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.010 
unfortunately is pretty crappy but this
brush<00:04:56.070> you<00:04:56.850> can<00:04:57.000> set<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.270> tolerance<00:04:57.450> for<00:04:57.930> it

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
brush you can set the tolerance for it

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.020 
brush you can set the tolerance for it
and<00:04:58.170> it<00:04:58.260> basically<00:04:58.380> deletes<00:04:58.950> all<00:04:59.190> redundant

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
and it basically deletes all redundant

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.480 
and it basically deletes all redundant
points<00:05:00.720> while<00:05:01.110> at<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.530> same<00:05:01.770> time<00:05:01.950> keeping

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
points while at the same time keeping

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.720 
points while at the same time keeping
the<00:05:02.760> shape<00:05:03.150> of<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:03.990> object<00:05:04.320> which<00:05:05.280> is<00:05:05.460> great

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
the shape of the object which is great

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.880 
the shape of the object which is great
because<00:05:06.000> not<00:05:06.300> only<00:05:06.330> does<00:05:06.690> it<00:05:06.750> makes<00:05:07.620> it<00:05:07.770> much

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
because not only does it makes it much

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.310 
because not only does it makes it much
faster<00:05:08.190> to<00:05:08.400> work<00:05:08.700> with<00:05:08.940> with<00:05:09.270> big<00:05:09.570> big<00:05:09.990> stuff

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320

shapes and all that but it also makes

to<00:05:32.610> me<00:05:32.730> quite<00:05:32.940> a<00:05:33.000> few<00:05:33.150> times<00:05:33.500> when<00:05:34.500> it<00:05:34.920> crashed

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310

and<00:05:35.640> i<00:05:35.760> lost<00:05:35.790> everything<00:05:36.570> because<00:05:36.750> it

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
and i lost everything because it

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.340 
and i lost everything because it
wouldn't<00:05:37.320> it<00:05:38.250> wouldn't<00:05:38.400> recover<00:05:38.730> the<00:05:38.970> file<00:05:39.350> so

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
wouldn't it wouldn't recover the file so

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.600 
wouldn't it wouldn't recover the file so
something<00:05:40.680> like<00:05:40.710> that<00:05:40.800> is<00:05:40.950> pretty<00:05:41.160> good<00:05:41.430> just

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
something like that is pretty good just

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.400 
something like that is pretty good just
to<00:05:41.760> make<00:05:41.940> everything<00:05:42.090> is<00:05:42.540> as<00:05:42.810> light<00:05:43.170> as

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
to make everything is as light as

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.400 
to make everything is as light as
possible<00:05:43.470> just<00:05:44.220> to<00:05:44.730> avoid<00:05:45.450> freezes<00:05:46.230> and

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
possible just to avoid freezes and

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.970 
possible just to avoid freezes and
whatnot<00:05:46.760> but<00:05:47.760> yeah<00:05:47.940> i<00:05:47.970> mean<00:05:48.180> if<00:05:48.300> you<00:05:48.450> if<00:05:48.810> you<00:05:49.140> do

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
usually just wear them under shirts but

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.800 
usually just wear them under shirts but
it's<00:06:28.470> it's<00:06:28.860> kind<00:06:29.160> of<00:06:29.310> reminiscent<00:06:30.120> of<00:06:30.360> the<00:06:30.630> old

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
it's it's kind of reminiscent of the old

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.780 
it's it's kind of reminiscent of the old
fanboys<00:06:31.290> must<00:06:31.560> die<00:06:31.740> t-shirt<00:06:31.980> which<00:06:32.400> was<00:06:32.610> one

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:32.790 
fanboys must die t-shirt which was one

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.400 
fanboys must die t-shirt which was one
of<00:06:32.880> the<00:06:32.940> most<00:06:33.090> success<00:06:33.480> well<00:06:33.900> the<00:06:34.170> most

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410 
of the most success well the most

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.870 
of the most success well the most
successful<00:06:34.740> one<00:06:35.070> we<00:06:35.190> had

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
successful one we had

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.670 
successful one we had
and<00:06:36.150> so<00:06:36.810> I<00:06:36.840> think<00:06:37.110> people<00:06:37.230> are<00:06:37.410> going<00:06:37.500> to<00:06:37.590> be

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
and so I think people are going to be

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.560 
and so I think people are going to be
kind<00:06:38.040> of<00:06:38.100> hyped<00:06:38.250> about<00:06:38.370> that<00:06:38.670> unfortunately<00:06:39.540> I

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
kind of hyped about that unfortunately I

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.060 
kind of hyped about that unfortunately I
didn't<00:06:39.810> film<00:06:40.020> the<00:06:40.170> design<00:06:40.440> process<00:06:40.620> but<00:06:41.040> I

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
didn't film the design process but I

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.860 
didn't film the design process but I
might<00:06:41.310> rebuild<00:06:41.550> it<00:06:41.910> from<00:06:42.030> scratch<00:06:42.120> that's

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
might rebuild it from scratch that's

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.180 
might rebuild it from scratch that's
what<00:06:43.020> i<00:06:43.050> usually<00:06:43.230> do<00:06:43.530> with<00:06:43.680> projects<00:06:44.070> like

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
what i usually do with projects like

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.720 
what i usually do with projects like
this<00:06:44.280> i<00:06:44.460> make<00:06:44.610> a<00:06:44.690> fast<00:06:45.690> sketch<00:06:46.310> not<00:06:47.310> by<00:06:47.520> hand

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.730 
this i make a fast sketch not by hand

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.280 
this i make a fast sketch not by hand
but<00:06:47.880> it<00:06:48.000> illustrator<00:06:48.450> to<00:06:48.660> show<00:06:48.840> people<00:06:49.140> and

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.290 
but it illustrator to show people and

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.070 
but it illustrator to show people and
then<00:06:49.410> I<00:06:49.560> I<00:06:49.860> take<00:06:50.580> it<00:06:50.700> from<00:06:50.910> from<00:06:51.510> the<00:06:51.630> beginning

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
then I I take it from from the beginning

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.540 
then I I take it from from the beginning
and<00:06:52.260> rebuild<00:06:52.680> everything<00:06:52.980> very<00:06:53.310> carefully

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
and rebuild everything very carefully

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.820 
and rebuild everything very carefully
and<00:06:53.970> align<00:06:54.240> it<00:06:54.270> properly<00:06:54.840> and<00:06:55.080> center<00:06:55.560> it<00:06:55.680> and

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
and align it properly and center it and

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.700 
and align it properly and center it and
whatnot<00:06:56.070> so<00:06:56.280> I'll<00:06:57.240> probably<00:06:57.390> film<00:06:57.840> that<00:06:58.080> just

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
whatnot so I'll probably film that just

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.400 
whatnot so I'll probably film that just
to<00:06:58.920> to<00:06:59.880> show<00:07:00.030> you<00:07:00.090> guys<00:07:00.180> after<00:07:00.720> the<00:07:00.750> t-shirt<00:07:01.230> is

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 
to to show you guys after the t-shirt is

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.760 
to to show you guys after the t-shirt is
released<00:07:01.830> so<00:07:02.730> I'm<00:07:02.850> hyped<00:07:03.090> because<00:07:03.960> this<00:07:04.590> was

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
released so I'm hyped because this was

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.260
