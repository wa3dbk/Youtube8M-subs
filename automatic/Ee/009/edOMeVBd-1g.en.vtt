up<00:00:27.330> right<00:00:27.599> here<00:00:27.779> on<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.109> back<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.590> our<00:00:28.710> I

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
up right here on the back of our I

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.130 
up right here on the back of our I
device<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:30.090> can<00:00:30.240> go<00:00:30.420> ahead<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.630> do

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
device and we can go ahead and do

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.250 
device and we can go ahead and do
panoramas<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.850> darkness<00:00:33.270> or<00:00:33.750> basically

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
panoramas in the darkness or basically

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.069 
panoramas in the darkness or basically
in<00:00:34.559> low<00:00:35.340> light<00:00:35.700> settings<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.870> flash

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
in low light settings so the flash

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.600 
in low light settings so the flash
really<00:00:37.469> helps<00:00:37.829> when<00:00:38.010> you're<00:00:38.160> using<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
really helps when you're using the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.880 
really helps when you're using the
panorama<00:00:39.239> mode<00:00:39.510> previously<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.649> weren't

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
panorama mode previously you weren't

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.440 
panorama mode previously you weren't
able<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.399> do<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.730> within<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.239> camera

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
able to do that within the camera

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.540 
able to do that within the camera
application<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.290> don't<00:00:43.770> know<00:00:43.950> why<00:00:44.219> but

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
obviously you can turn it off or you can

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.830 
obviously you can turn it off or you can
turn<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.430> you're<00:00:48.120> going<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.450> able
