 the bible and balrog today it's going 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.669
 to be a part where we went really well 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.720
 amused no drop t - one was in 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:39.800
 platoon from st to 1 so charmoille a 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.120
 Japanese two-thirds 8 who in my opinion but 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.040
 again this is just my opinion 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.710
 this is the first interesting tank of 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.420
 japanese looking for a part we went 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.199
 amused like crazy people like you 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.059
 louvrier we were the little ones in 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.580
 the party we were also accompanied 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.500
 in the peloton of laurent and its nest and 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.080
 May 3 laurent and his x3 we do not 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.150
 will not see much or part seen 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.810
 that he did not accompany us we have 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.330
 really does a role of playing medium 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.060
 the ninja mediums and in summer that 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.100
 japanese in japanese ninja it was going 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.500
 great together and we will play 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.009
 really no jacket and me in squad 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.320
 and we're really going to have a blast 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:26.360
 in this part like you and power 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.370
 see it already we are totally ignored 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.130
 the campaign finally by ignoring it goes there 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.230
 not because the campaign is estimated that 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.670
 it's written in ways of finding oneself 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.340
 block behind a blockade and nothing 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.840
 fuck all part 1 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.369
 no drop taking the way down 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.689
 me who takes the path of the high one 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.729
 forward for now we are a little 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.490
 separated but do not worry we're going 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.429

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.329
 for you are thousands too the 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:02:01.530
 point of view of blue feet is the 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.659
 famous north cannes so here I 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:09.090
 do not join a best hop we start 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:11.640
 position that is going to be going up in 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.110

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.110

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.329

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.030

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:27.000

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:31.709
 sees that the object senses because in the world 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.709

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.569
 backs down because the object of 140 to the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.829
 return his turret to us and we 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.710

 to go with him we have in the idea 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.030
 advanced c1 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.340

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.769
 t110 to the five that just been spot and 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.230

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.610
 to face them a heavy third say 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:19.949

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:23.470
 a range and nidia not hay anyway 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:26.110
 here we come forward suddenly we change 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.320
 creamery and saw that the t110 to the five 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.620
 were there we look for points 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.479
 here I see that eventually I can 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.340
 protect me with the carcass and shoot 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:40.510
 on the enemies who do not look at me there 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.280

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.990
 not looking to look at me 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.139
 I consult him and his facade - 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.060
 especially the WSF and big holes 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.280

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:29.020

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.990
