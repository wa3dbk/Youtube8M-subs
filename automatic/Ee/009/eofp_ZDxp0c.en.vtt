00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:05.810
 which at the moment is largely unchanged in its 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.349
 Heinos finals fight when he testified 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.349
 advertised for it 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.099
 was a 1 1 addition 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.839
 however, justifies 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.839
 now the Russian is allowed to balance 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.859
 a very spirited comes 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.670
 it's 14 28 cents 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.670
 Ronan is 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.880
 2 II 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.649
 the Russian next 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.649
 Roters 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.030
 obscene 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.030
 20 to calm down 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.620
 in the first round 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.230
 Niedermaier Munich leads this 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.590
 Paris Hilton 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.590
 Secure Bishop Michael Bünker 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.030
 unfortunately, this time 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.550
 or actors 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.780
 The highlight of the show was 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.670
 what a death sentence 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.670
 one seeks 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.920
 Ahrensburg 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.920
 battle zone 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.000
 as last 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Schneider demanded that Barak had almost thought it 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.380
 but that does not quite live up to the IRS stars 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.080
 the president of Albert further adversity 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.040
 and now 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.130
 the Russian 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.020
 the quarterly report 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.429
 left the classic kitchen in the previous year among the Russians in the 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.980
 difficult situation or humid 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.899
 the yellow had been 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.309
 but also 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:12.749
 expected over the result of the first quarter 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:15.579
 a car of two world champions allowed the landlord 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.779
 the plus to be a top class man 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:22.329
 that looks like so far in vain Hans Jürgen Feick is allowed anyway 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:23.299
 looking forward 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.139
 he has outgrown himself, he has grown from a single winner 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:28.919
 the best 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:33.209
 and then his victory in the same direction of his victory, there is nothing to doubt 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.139
 nevertheless a success for there for the German ringer-bund 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.839
 you take part in these 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:41.489
 Lisicki meets 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.749
 expected and hoped for by Wilfried Dietrich 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:48.039
 Unfortunately, he was last eliminated from the tournament 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:50.009
 and we're going through that now 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.889
