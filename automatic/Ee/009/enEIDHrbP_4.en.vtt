there's two things that you can do that
are<00:00:41.910> going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.420> most<00:00:42.690> effective<00:00:43.170> way

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
are going to be the most effective way

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.560 
are going to be the most effective way
of<00:00:43.950> reducing<00:00:44.579> delayed<00:00:45.149> onset<00:00:45.329> muscle

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
of reducing delayed onset muscle

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.360 
of reducing delayed onset muscle
soreness<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.680> first<00:00:47.010> thing<00:00:47.250> is

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
soreness the first thing is

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.930 
soreness the first thing is
supplementation<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.960> particular

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
supplementation and in particular

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.920 
supplementation and in particular

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
have an active effect on reducing muscle

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.280 
have an active effect on reducing muscle
soreness<00:01:05.339> reducing<00:01:06.299> delayed<00:01:06.720> onset<00:01:06.990> muscle

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
soreness reducing delayed onset muscle

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.830 
soreness reducing delayed onset muscle
soreness<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.490> best<00:01:08.760> time<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.540> those

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
soreness and the best time to have those

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.289 
soreness and the best time to have those
branch<00:01:10.140> chain<00:01:10.409> amino<00:01:10.439> acids<00:01:11.159> those<00:01:11.310> BCAAs<00:01:12.030> is

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
branch chain amino acids those BCAAs is

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.649 
branch chain amino acids those BCAAs is
during<00:01:13.260> workout<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.979> then<00:01:14.430> also

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
during workout and then also

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.570 
during workout and then also
post-workout<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.869> then<00:01:16.320> thirdly<00:01:16.710> throughout

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
post-workout and then thirdly throughout

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.999 
post-workout and then thirdly throughout
the<00:01:17.759> day<00:01:17.970> following<00:01:18.659> any<00:01:18.900> particular<00:01:19.320> workout

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the day following any particular workout

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.649 
the day following any particular workout
so<00:01:20.189> that's<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> first<00:01:20.820> thing<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.299> do<00:01:21.509> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
so that's the first thing you can do to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.020 
so that's the first thing you can do to
reduce<00:01:21.810> Dom's<00:01:22.350> or<00:01:22.590> combat<00:01:22.979> DOM<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.430> to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
reduce Dom's or combat DOM is to

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.370 
reduce Dom's or combat DOM is to
supplement<00:01:24.659> with<00:01:24.750> branched<00:01:25.170> chain<00:01:25.350> amino

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
supplement with branched chain amino

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.100 
supplement with branched chain amino
acids<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.549> second<00:01:27.090> thing<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.869> is

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
acids the second thing you can do is

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.429 
acids the second thing you can do is
stretch<00:01:29.299> stretch<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.540> muscle<00:01:30.960> group<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.170> is

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
stretch stretch the muscle group that is

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.230 
stretch stretch the muscle group that is
saw<00:01:31.740> stretch<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.369> muscle<00:01:32.729> group<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:32.970> is

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
saw stretch the muscle group that is

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.120 
saw stretch the muscle group that is
affected<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.990> by<00:01:34.380> stretching<00:01:34.799> you're

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
affected and by stretching you're

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.859 
affected and by stretching you're
actually<00:01:35.400> going<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.640> increase<00:01:36.030> blood<00:01:36.509> flow<00:01:36.570> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
actually going to increase blood flow to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.600 
actually going to increase blood flow to
that<00:01:37.049> muscle<00:01:37.409> group<00:01:37.770> you're<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.369> flush

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
that muscle group you're going to flush

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.520 
that muscle group you're going to flush
nutrients<00:01:39.360> into<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.780> muscle<00:01:40.170> group<00:01:40.380> and

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
nutrients into that muscle group and

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.440 
nutrients into that muscle group and
that<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.310> decrease<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> amount<00:01:42.060> of

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
that is going to decrease the amount of

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.450 
that is going to decrease the amount of
time<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.649> delayed<00:01:43.979> onset<00:01:44.189> muscle

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
time that the delayed onset muscle

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.120 
time that the delayed onset muscle
soreness<00:01:44.850> sets<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.960> for<00:01:45.990> guys<00:01:46.439> if<00:01:46.649> you've<00:01:46.860> got
