00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.960
 Because this diesel 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.960
 It is via a petrolner 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:53.630
 I hope not 's it because voice actors from 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:58.500
 I think that within such a range Well I'd 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:05.280
 The water here is water cooling because it is water 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:08.670
 Well yes it is about once in 2 years for human beings 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.210
 Well as a rule increase 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.590
 Because it is new for a while 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.000
 Oe's one more time 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.000
 I have oil here 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.860
 me 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.100
 In the same way as the diesel that child 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.460
 of 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.010
 Excuse me 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.010
 Please get in from here 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:40.360
 Stay here and leave here 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.300
 Gauge is this 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.420
 In this amount 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.680
 Yes 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.100
 When replacing normally 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.100
 Bad do 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.360
 While looking at the gauge when I could only insert 1 liter 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.500
 Hmm 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.400
 It is useless even if there are too many 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.110
 Well here in the sword cage and here 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.170
 Hmm 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.570
 If you do this, you will lose water 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.460
 this 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:16.400
 Switzerland unusual coolant water but it is 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.900
 It is only when you read or exchange Lactis that year without coming in winter during this or this, too 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.370
 Yes 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.440
 Can this be 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.220
 this is 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:29.110
 I'd tighten if Shimere It is ok cock 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:33.550
 Diesel path and would close seems Pachi path 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:37.810
 I ca n't get into that air 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.989
 And will contain the course is useless Uma air it contains after earthworm 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.860
 Ummm 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.550
 But it is a useless chance to be the air vent of the air air Nde he is no longer in 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.600
 is 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.600
 Air vent wings 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.930
 Oh dear 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.000
 Continue 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.000
 Do these things is voice somewhere between here or 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.200
 In the case of diesel if possible 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:06.390
 Don't empty 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.510
 I think it would be no good if I had a single fuel cycle to stop 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.319
 There was 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.319
 there were 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.100
 The engine is 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.940
 This is here 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:25.190
 Well I do not know this will be a coin 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:30.530
 I have a new date for submission date but I will talk about this 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:32.090
 Sutte said where this is I think I this much let alone the lowest I'm this and Eji 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.640
 Is no sense of incongruity in noodles 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.990
 It's up to here, in a state of blockage 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.770
 We discuss the individual card 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.880
 Ump 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.880
 The handle 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.500
 It is black here to have you eat 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:57.080
 There to here this but in did you say Well 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:59.560
 Or rather in order to pull out this compression left times this child'm about heavy 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.560
