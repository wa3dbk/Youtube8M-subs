gonna try to copy so let's see if

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.370 
gonna try to copy so let's see if
there's<00:01:23.250> some<00:01:23.400> instructions<00:01:23.760> in<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.450> and

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
there's some instructions in here and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.719 
there's some instructions in here and
there<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.740> right<00:01:26.010> on<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> back<00:01:26.340> but<00:01:26.610> we're

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
there is right on the back but we're

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.580 
there is right on the back but we're
going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.880> go<00:01:27.030> ahead<00:01:27.120> and<00:01:27.390> do<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.510> so<00:01:27.690> I<00:01:28.140> have

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
going to go ahead and do that so I have

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.310 
going to go ahead and do that so I have
the<00:01:28.710> gas<00:01:28.890> tank<00:01:29.190> off<00:01:29.510> already<00:01:30.510> I<00:01:30.630> have<00:01:30.900> access

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
the gas tank off already I have access

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.600 
the gas tank off already I have access
to<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:32.930> spark<00:01:33.930> plug<00:01:34.140> wire<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.680> let's<00:01:34.860> just<00:01:35.070> go

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
to a spark plug wire so let's just go

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.210 
to a spark plug wire so let's just go
with<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.229> we<00:01:37.229> can<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.530> run<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.010> rest

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
with that and we can do run the rest

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.910 
with that and we can do run the rest
after<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.090> get<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.330> back<00:01:39.479> together<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.110> let's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
after I get it back together so let's

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.149 
after I get it back together so let's
get<00:01:41.040> started<00:01:42.260> alright<00:01:43.260> so<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.740> see<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.010> got

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
get started alright so you can see I got

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.800 
get started alright so you can see I got
my<00:01:44.310> bike<00:01:44.490> torn<00:01:44.790> apart<00:01:44.909> here<00:01:45.240> for<00:01:45.540> other

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
my bike torn apart here for other

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.570 
my bike torn apart here for other
repairs<00:01:46.170> maintenance<00:01:48.500> but<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.530> think<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.100> can

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
repairs maintenance but I think I can

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.570 
repairs maintenance but I think I can
fit<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.909> right<00:01:51.090> here<00:01:51.390> or<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:52.409> can<00:01:53.010> fit<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.430> right

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
fit it right here or I can fit it right

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.820 
fit it right here or I can fit it right
up<00:01:53.820> here<00:01:54.000> by<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.210> tank<00:01:54.510> so<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.409> any<00:01:55.560> case<00:01:55.799> just

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
up here by the tank so in any case just

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.800 
up here by the tank so in any case just
keep<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.430> mind<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.970> looks<00:01:57.330> like<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.600> comes

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
keep that in mind it looks like it comes

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.649 
keep that in mind it looks like it comes
with<00:01:57.960> plenty<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.380> extra<00:01:59.630> wire

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
with plenty of extra wire

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:02.999 
with plenty of extra wire
let's<00:02:01.930> just<00:02:02.049> go<00:02:02.200> ahead<00:02:02.290> and<00:02:02.439> put<00:02:02.560> on<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.680> spark

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
let's just go ahead and put on the spark

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.469 
let's just go ahead and put on the spark
plug<00:02:03.189> wire<00:02:03.369> I'll<00:02:03.579> let's<00:02:03.729> just<00:02:03.880> hang<00:02:04.030> out<00:02:04.240> till

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
plug wire I'll let's just hang out till

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.090 
plug wire I'll let's just hang out till
I<00:02:04.570> get<00:02:04.689> the<00:02:04.810> rest<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.110> parts<00:02:05.409> back<00:02:05.560> on<00:02:05.799> and

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
I get the rest of the parts back on and

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.109 
I get the rest of the parts back on and
then<00:02:06.640> we'll<00:02:06.820> see<00:02:07.030> where<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.689> fits<00:02:07.899> best

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
then we'll see where it fits best

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.820 
then we'll see where it fits best
alright<00:02:10.119> so<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:10.420> can<00:02:10.450> see<00:02:10.780> my<00:02:10.989> spark<00:02:11.650> plug

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
alright so you can see my spark plug

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.550 
alright so you can see my spark plug
wire<00:02:12.040> is<00:02:12.280> right<00:02:12.519> here<00:02:12.790> so<00:02:13.200> I'm<00:02:14.200> probably<00:02:14.349> just

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
wire is right here so I'm probably just

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.770 
wire is right here so I'm probably just
going<00:02:14.769> to<00:02:14.860> attach<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:17.709> know<00:02:17.800> right<00:02:18.010> here

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
going to attach it you know right here

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:26.339 
going to attach it you know right here
so<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.930> just<00:02:20.050> want<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:24.780> go<00:02:25.780> around<00:02:26.110> about

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
so you just want to go around about

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:32.520 
so you just want to go around about
three<00:02:26.650> or<00:02:26.739> four<00:02:26.980> times

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:03:14.540 

so<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.220> sleep<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.640> around

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.870 

all<00:03:15.030> right<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.360> right<00:03:15.510> there<00:03:15.750> is<00:03:15.840> what<00:03:15.990> I<00:03:16.020> want

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
all right so right there is what I want

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.790 
all right so right there is what I want
got<00:03:17.880> my<00:03:18.030> zip<00:03:18.300> tie<00:03:18.510> here<00:03:21.320> almost<00:03:22.320> need<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.560> third

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
got my zip tie here almost need a third

00:03:22.800 --> 00:04:17.650 
got my zip tie here almost need a third
hand<00:03:23.040> for<00:03:23.250> this

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.690 

all<00:04:18.170> right<00:04:18.290> so<00:04:18.500> that<00:04:18.650> looks<00:04:18.800> good<00:04:18.950> now<00:04:21.700> I'm

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
all right so that looks good now I'm

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:42.700 
all right so that looks good now I'm
going<00:04:22.850> to<00:04:22.910> route<00:04:23.090> this<00:04:25.900> see<00:04:26.900> here

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.740 

I'm<00:04:43.310> not<00:04:43.490> sure<00:04:43.700> of<00:04:43.820> routing<00:04:44.090> right<00:04:44.390> now<00:04:44.540> I

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
I'm not sure of routing right now I

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.000 
I'm not sure of routing right now I
think<00:04:45.110> I'm<00:04:45.230> going<00:04:45.320> to<00:04:45.380> put<00:04:45.560> it<00:04:45.650> behind<00:04:45.770> the

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
think I'm going to put it behind the

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.440 
think I'm going to put it behind the
side<00:04:46.220> panel<00:04:46.610> I<00:04:46.700> don't<00:04:46.850> feel<00:04:46.970> like<00:04:47.120> making<00:04:47.390> a

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
side panel I don't feel like making a

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.950 
side panel I don't feel like making a
bracket<00:04:47.840> for<00:04:47.870> here<00:04:48.110> so<00:04:48.380> that's<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.370> case<00:04:49.960> I'll

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
bracket for here so that's the case I'll

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:59.110 
bracket for here so that's the case I'll
probably<00:04:51.170> just<00:04:52.570> do<00:04:53.570> a<00:04:53.600> tie<00:04:53.930> down<00:04:57.940> sleep<00:04:58.940> some

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
probably just do a tie down sleep some

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
probably just do a tie down sleep some
slack<00:04:59.450> here<00:04:59.780> do<00:05:00.440> a<00:05:00.470> tie<00:05:00.740> down<00:05:00.980> right<00:05:01.190> here<00:05:01.430> and

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
slack here do a tie down right here and

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.220 
slack here do a tie down right here and
the<00:05:03.140> meter<00:05:03.320> will<00:05:03.530> be<00:05:03.650> right<00:05:03.860> about<00:05:04.040> here<00:05:04.340> so

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
the meter will be right about here so

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.680 
the meter will be right about here so
just<00:05:06.230> going<00:05:06.380> to<00:05:06.440> leave<00:05:06.590> it<00:05:06.680> like<00:05:06.800> this<00:05:06.830> for<00:05:07.010> now

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
just going to leave it like this for now

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.640 
just going to leave it like this for now
when<00:05:08.690> I<00:05:08.750> get<00:05:08.870> all<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.050> parts<00:05:09.320> back<00:05:09.500> on<00:05:11.500> we<00:05:12.500> can

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
when I get all the parts back on we can

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.940 
when I get all the parts back on we can
finish<00:05:12.860> it<00:05:13.040> off<00:05:13.870> all<00:05:14.870> right<00:05:14.930> so<00:05:15.200> here's<00:05:15.890> my

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
finish it off all right so here's my

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.190 
finish it off all right so here's my
side<00:05:16.310> panel<00:05:18.010> goes<00:05:19.010> on<00:05:19.220> like<00:05:19.400> this<00:05:19.580> I<00:05:20.200> was

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
side panel goes on like this I was

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.660 
side panel goes on like this I was
thinking<00:05:21.320> to<00:05:21.560> put<00:05:21.710> it<00:05:21.860> right<00:05:22.100> here<00:05:22.160> where<00:05:22.610> you

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
thinking to put it right here where you

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.710 
thinking to put it right here where you
can<00:05:22.820> see<00:05:23.150> it<00:05:24.190> but<00:05:25.190> I<00:05:25.520> think<00:05:26.060> my<00:05:26.180> leg<00:05:26.420> will<00:05:26.600> get

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
can see it but I think my leg will get

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.020 
can see it but I think my leg will get
in<00:05:26.810> the<00:05:26.870> way<00:05:26.900> of<00:05:27.130> you<00:05:28.130> know<00:05:28.160> what<00:05:28.400> when<00:05:28.760> I<00:05:28.820> throw

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
in the way of you know what when I throw

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.370 
in the way of you know what when I throw
my<00:05:29.060> leg<00:05:29.360> forward<00:05:29.720> here<00:05:29.900> I<00:05:29.930> just<00:05:29.990> don't<00:05:30.260> want

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
my leg forward here I just don't want

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.480 
my leg forward here I just don't want
this<00:05:30.530> bump<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:33.110> I<00:05:33.590> don't<00:05:33.950> think<00:05:34.070> I<00:05:34.220> want<00:05:34.430> to

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
this bump and I don't think I want to

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.860 
this bump and I don't think I want to
see<00:05:34.670> it<00:05:34.760> so<00:05:35.000> what<00:05:35.240> I'm<00:05:35.360> going<00:05:35.480> to<00:05:35.510> do<00:05:35.630> is<00:05:35.780> I'm

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
see it so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.180 
see it so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:05:35.900> to<00:05:36.020> mount<00:05:36.230> it<00:05:36.410> right<00:05:36.590> here<00:05:36.890> just<00:05:39.190> going

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
going to mount it right here just going

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.750 
going to mount it right here just going
to<00:05:40.250> lay<00:05:40.430> like<00:05:40.610> that<00:05:42.400> you're<00:05:43.400> not<00:05:43.430> going<00:05:43.610> to<00:05:43.700> be

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
to lay like that you're not going to be

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.670 
to lay like that you're not going to be
able<00:05:43.820> to<00:05:43.910> see<00:05:44.150> it<00:05:44.270> and<00:05:44.450> if<00:05:45.020> you<00:05:45.110> just<00:05:45.140> peek<00:05:45.470> down

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
able to see it and if you just peek down

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.220 
able to see it and if you just peek down
in<00:05:45.920> there<00:05:46.600> you<00:05:47.600> can<00:05:47.780> see<00:05:47.990> it<00:05:48.910> so<00:05:49.910> I<00:05:50.510> don't<00:05:51.050> know

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
in there you can see it so I don't know

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.720 
in there you can see it so I don't know
if<00:05:51.380> I'm<00:05:51.470> going<00:05:51.590> to<00:05:51.650> keep<00:05:51.830> it<00:05:51.980> here<00:05:52.130> for<00:05:52.310> good<00:05:52.460> I

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 
if I'm going to keep it here for good I

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:53.920 
if I'm going to keep it here for good I
know<00:05:52.880> it<00:05:53.060> comes<00:05:53.240> with<00:05:53.390> double-faced<00:05:53.810> tape

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
know it comes with double-faced tape

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.090 
know it comes with double-faced tape
what<00:05:54.290> I'm<00:05:54.380> going<00:05:54.500> to<00:05:54.530> do<00:05:54.650> is<00:05:54.740> I'm<00:05:54.830> just<00:05:54.860> going

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
what I'm going to do is I'm just going

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.070 
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to<00:05:55.160> zip<00:05:55.340> tie<00:05:55.370> it<00:05:55.580> down<00:05:55.880> and<00:05:56.210> I'm<00:05:56.930> going<00:05:57.050> to

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
to zip tie it down and I'm going to

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.010 
to zip tie it down and I'm going to
bundle<00:05:57.290> this<00:05:57.560> up<00:05:57.830> and<00:05:58.250> zip<00:05:58.730> tie<00:05:58.910> it<00:05:58.970> here<00:05:59.360> so<00:05:59.960> I

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
bundle this up and zip tie it here so I

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.290 
bundle this up and zip tie it here so I
could<00:06:00.200> have<00:06:00.290> heard<00:06:00.410> anything<00:06:00.680> that<00:06:01.670> way<00:06:02.120> if<00:06:02.210> I

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
could have heard anything that way if I

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.990 
could have heard anything that way if I
choose<00:06:02.510> to<00:06:02.720> relocate<00:06:03.020> it<00:06:03.410> I<00:06:03.560> can<00:06:04.220> I<00:06:04.490> just<00:06:04.820> cut

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
choose to relocate it I can I just cut

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.100 
choose to relocate it I can I just cut
the<00:06:05.090> zip<00:06:05.270> ties<00:06:05.330> and<00:06:05.690> move<00:06:05.870> it<00:06:06.020> so<00:06:07.720> so<00:06:08.720> let's<00:06:08.960> go

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
the zip ties and move it so so let's go

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.070 
the zip ties and move it so so let's go
ahead<00:06:09.200> and<00:06:09.320> do<00:06:09.470> that<00:06:10.540> alright<00:06:11.540> so<00:06:11.660> this<00:06:11.780> wire

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
ahead and do that alright so this wire

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.210 
ahead and do that alright so this wire
needs<00:06:12.800> to<00:06:14.350> go<00:06:15.350> through<00:06:15.560> the<00:06:15.650> back

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
needs to go through the back

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.930 
needs to go through the back
needs<00:06:18.220> to<00:06:18.400> loop<00:06:18.699> down<00:06:19.440> and<00:06:20.520> back<00:06:21.520> into<00:06:21.759> this

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
needs to loop down and back into this

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.110 
needs to loop down and back into this
hole

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.720

little<00:06:33.940> couple<00:06:34.940> access<00:06:35.330> holes<00:06:35.540> depending<00:06:35.720> on

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
little couple access holes depending on

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:43.820 
little couple access holes depending on
where<00:06:36.260> you<00:06:36.320> want<00:06:36.500> to<00:06:36.560> go<00:06:37.960> so
