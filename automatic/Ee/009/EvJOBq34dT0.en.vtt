00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 and hello how about youtube people I hope 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.390
 that are quite well in this 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.639
 occasion I come with a somewhat 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.110
 different as you will have read in the title 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.480
 this is I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.969
 promises, I only refer to the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.220
 guides of the type four runner a class 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.900
 enemy newly added to the games the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.070
 information that you will hear throughout 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.650
 of the video is official 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.510
 scott warner a former employee of chip for 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.240
 creek revealed it on a panel during the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.269
 gdc of 2013 titled the design of the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.470
 new enemies for halo 4 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.510
 unfortunately the panel was never shown 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.250
 publicly yet many of 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.170
 those who came to see the panel have 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.090
 shared with us his testimony 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.910
 revealing a lot of data about the origin 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.800
 of the promised the prototypes among 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.140
 other things removed from the version 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.059
 end of the game once this is clarified 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.670
 we can start with the video 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.620
 the fiancees were initially 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.570
 inspired by creatures of media like 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.210
 movies and cartoons 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.940
 for example voltron for its appearance of 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.890
 Tamil giant robot by Terminator 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.199
 for the ability to change their 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.299
 shape the creatures that appear in the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.050
 film the thing since at the same time they wanted 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.750
 give a game 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.670
 both monstrous and even relied on 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.860
 the cranium rats of the video game plan 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.270
 skate what the tree trip team 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.430
 he drew attention to these 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.110
 creatures is how they can all 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.150
 create a great dynamic working 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.010
 together while they are separated 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.260
 they act in a different way and a 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.330
 so awkward at an early point of 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.400
 development the fiancÃ©s counted up 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.320
 with six variants completely 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.120
 different these variants were 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.360
 based on a chess analogy 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.030
 counting with a king and a queen the tower 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.280
 the knight the bishop and of course the pawns 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.620
 for the security of programming and 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.780
 by the approach at the end they decided to leave 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.610
 only three of these variants 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.620
 three others were discarded but 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.900
 they can apparently come back in some 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.940
 point of history the pawns are 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.160
 they became the cavaliers and the bishop 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.900
 he became a water the horse 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.790
 I would be the gentleman of Prometheus 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.920
 crifford and started doing experiments 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.930
 with these promises in a gameplay 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.450
 sandbox testing different elements 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.700
 with multiple dynamics for example the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.980
 walker that at this early stage were 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.720
 referred to as bicycle helmets by 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.470
 the particular way they had in a 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.030
 beginning 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.680
 being even similar to the 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.840
 sentinels that we have already seen in other 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.850
 games in this picture we can see that 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.190
 are protecting a shaft brut and what 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.650
 three with an early shield design 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.690
 of dense light at this point of the water was 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.670
 a much more formidable enemy since 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.530
 had multiple skills for example 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.480
 the hyung attack a skill that 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.700
 it consisted of being able to use some 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.010
 environmental objects like projectiles 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.720
 against the player unfortunately many 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.670
 water skills were 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.920
 eliminated from the final version by 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.660
 understandability issues also 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.850
 they added a couple of interesting facts 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.040
 about the wache as the final design of 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.930
 this creature which suffered enough 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.670
 changes throughout the development the 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.530
 fact of having added a face more than 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.690
 nothing is a symbolic issue 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.310
 remember that the water and the promising 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.140
 they are essentially the same as 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.790
 they represent a single soul that is 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.010
 enclosed within the shell of the 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.200
 guide the fact of having added a face 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.850
 was to provoke some sympathy if 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.740
 this character now 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.900
 There was a problem during development 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.030
 of the game the gameplay system of 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.430
 promised was more or less implemented 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.140
 almost completely when in fact not 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.790
 the elements of 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.740
 the story of the game said elements 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.110
 historical limitations limited the system 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.090
 of the gameplay at the end but well let's go 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.650
 to the subject of the knights which in 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.630
 a beginning they had the ability to 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.730
 to be able to transform themselves into a 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.620
 kind of sphere that could be moved from 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.870
 side to side quite quickly in 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.460
 the battlefield is mainly 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.680
 moved to the coverage points of the 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.750
 same environment this as a kind of 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.580
 defensive tactics although this skill 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.860
 was later replaced by the 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.570
 teleportation skill these 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.670
 balls would look similar to the 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.440
 of the star wars and the like droids 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.340
 way they could use this form to 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.230
 attack the player 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.270
 another element that was initially 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.550
 added to the gentlemen was a system 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.930
 of dismemberment is to say that according 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.030
 the player would do more damage to the 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.980
 This gentleman was going to tear 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.020
 little by little and we will be able to observe 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.150
 as its parts were falling one after 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.370
 another is to say to a damage system 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.050
 similar to that of vehicles only 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.300
 imagine what it would look like if 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.000
 tips of the frank gentlemen to 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.410
 slowly as a brutal 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.330
 history is expanding the 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.830
 writers and designers determined 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.050
 what they wanted to do to the knights of 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.780
 way very similar to the spectra that 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.010
 appear in the Lord of the Rings' 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.570
 incorporating that feeling that inside 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.180
 of them is a soul 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.800
 imprisoned and tormented once you 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.600
 determined the background of the story 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.130
 with respect to these characters 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.050
 grifols and ensures that it does not really 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.300
 they made many visual changes though 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.890
 in my opinion they made quite changes 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.200
 relevant to the appearance of these 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.180
 enemies for example at first the 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.250
 Gentlemen would have a face printed 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.020
 much more human though they decided 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.970
 change it later for a skull a 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.710
 skull they claim symbolizes both the 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.660
 human side of the species as the side 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.820
 ford runner but good let's continue with the 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.890
 subject one of the biggest changes that 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.570
 suffered the game were the pawns such 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.070
 it seems that the team of designers of 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.230
 triumph did not like the idea of 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.180
 implement bipedal pawn units 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.860
 since they apparently felt with a 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.020
 style that belonged more to the 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.410
 ruler so they decided to explore 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.640
 other alternatives with this character 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.980
 eventually the team reduced the 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.690
 designs exploring in depth the 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.160
 idea to introduce this enemy as 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.740
 a kind 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.540
 dog and insects arising thus the idea 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.580
 of the trailer in terms of gameplay 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.250
 really the pawns and the crawlers 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.170
 They would be the same to finish 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.030
 scott warner presentation I have a 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.740
 list of things that were not made of the 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.720
 correct way for the development of 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.580
 the new enemies first of all a 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.320
 pretty slow communication on the part 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.360
 Trifon team when the tree 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.070
 team had just started another 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.080
 problem was the absence of vision of 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.610
 high level for a long time this is 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.350
 reflected and not having developed many 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.360
 ideas in a concrete way from the 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.580
 principle causing at the same time a loss 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.140
 of time trying to implement things 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.330
 as the skill of the knights of 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.100
 transform into a sphere the third 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.690
 problem were the walkers since 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.350
 they affected the strategy of the 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.450
 player 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.980
 returning to the gameplay something repetitive to 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.870
 what they mean by this is that 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.400
 basically there was only one solution if 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.200
 you wanted to finish with the averages more 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.270
 fast and effectively and it was 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.890
 eliminating these subjects first what 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.570
 which was tedious for many until 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.250
 certain point since it was something that you have 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.290
 to do again and again during the 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.150
 gameplay the next mistake was the great 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.980
 amount of damage that is required for 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.180
 destroy the knights ie 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.040
 they really wanted to do the 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.639
 more formidable opponents than the 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.990
 covenant 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.909
 but he is aware that he was given 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.340
 too much resistance these gentlemen 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:35.990
 the last and very important mistake was the 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.449
 lack of emotion on the part of 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.249
 prometheos halo is characterized by having 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:41.779
 one of the largest chairs in the 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:43.610
 videogame industry not 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:45.259
 only because they are smart but 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.330
 because they can demonstrate their emotions 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:49.129
 still within this game tends to 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.949
 show your mood either the 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:54.020
 anger fear or even if surprised 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:56.060
 all this is something that the promised ones do not 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.069
 they managed to reflect and it's something that triumphed 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.569
 which promises to improve quite a bit 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:01.610
 possibility of seeing promised 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:03.500
 expressing more emotions in the 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.849
 following games finally what 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.919
 actress audrey wanted to achieve at 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:08.689
 introduce these enemies was to speak a 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:10.129
 little more about the background of the 

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:11.810
 history of the four runner units 

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:13.250
 they wanted to create with them a new 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.319
 game experience but that also 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.389
 outside familiar with those already seen before in 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:19.340
 halo from my point of view the 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:20.120
 promised were enemies pretty 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.009
 innovators 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.259
 a new challenge and offering a story 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:26.300
 quite interesting although they did have 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:27.620
 some glitches during the gameplay and with 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.539
 this now we are sure that 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.819
 taking many deleted items 

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:33.469
 they could be much better now the side 

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:34.820
 good thing is that this gives us enough 

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:37.280
 hopes for the future 

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.990
 It promises you by adding the possibility of 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.970
 see more types of enemies of these 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.290
 aunts four runner I do not say that all this 

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.790
 I will return as such in the 

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.800
 following games since many things 

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:48.020
 they are discarded for something but if we can 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.640
 give us an idea of what awaits us in 

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.470
 order that was all for today 

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.030
 I hope you liked this video or 

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.760

 promise you consider that the promised 

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.980
 originals were better than their version
