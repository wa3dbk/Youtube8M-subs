should have officially won that game but

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.110 
should have officially won that game but
I<00:02:17.560> don't<00:02:17.769> think<00:02:18.040> that's<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.550> moment<00:02:18.880> where<00:02:19.000> you

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
I don't think that's a moment where you

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.640 
I don't think that's a moment where you
where<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.480> left<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.140> said<00:02:20.349> you<00:02:20.500> know<00:02:20.560> the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
where you left and you said you know the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.890 
where you left and you said you know the
wrong<00:02:20.860> between<00:02:21.069> one<00:02:21.549> if<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.269> comes<00:02:22.480> up<00:02:22.660> to

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
wrong between one if it comes up to

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.900 
wrong between one if it comes up to
players<00:02:23.380> making<00:02:23.739> big<00:02:24.040> plays<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.640> that's<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
players making big plays and that's the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.490 
players making big plays and that's the
reason<00:02:25.150> someone<00:02:25.360> looks<00:02:25.599> at<00:02:25.720> Cup<00:02:25.959> that's

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
reason someone looks at Cup that's

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.470
