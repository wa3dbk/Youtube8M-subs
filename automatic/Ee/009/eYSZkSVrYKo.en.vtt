00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 shout a sata disk of 500 gigs here 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.620
 we have the connector as you know is a 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.200
 different connector to I wanted to connect the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.469
 plate and here it would be connected to the disk 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.070
 hard that I have connected here as you know 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.490
 this would be the data and here would be the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.949
 of current and always put on gloves 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.080
 always always whenever we load 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.269
 the components by being with the hands 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.109
 because we are loaded with current 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.840
 we prepare the cable this would go to the plate 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.600
 on the board there are two connectors this 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:42.329
 plates 1 and 2 we put it in the connector 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.090
 we go around there and do not go for another 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.270
 way there we already have the cable quoted 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.000
 put this very easy screwdriver that 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.360
 I hit you 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.500
 I screw you 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.920
 we always put it here I leave the bay 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.920
 we know him 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.990
 very carefully 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.190
 and we let it appear 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.190
 winner 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.870
 and the bolted web would be screwed 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.800
 well we need to now put the 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.510
 current that we get this cable you see 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.730
 of course it has to be a special source 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.630
 that has connectors for hard disk 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.720
 sata 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.090
 this has some colors 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.670
 and it only goes in one position not 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.170
 we can place it in another if we try 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.170
 place it inside will not enter 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.060
 and there he entered he does not have another position anymore 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.220
 we would have the current put they see it 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.920
 we look a little bit of the cable and we see that 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.710
 it is well placed and now this connector 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.509
 that has a job that we see here a 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.259
 downstream goes to the part of the hard disk already 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.259
 has no losses 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.220
 and there 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.349
 ready we would have him said euro 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.400
 connected 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:20.099
 and now we only have to enter the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.660
 bios of our machine and how we entered 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.750
 in our video 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:29.150
 with the key 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:31.460
 delete with the key f 12 f 1 like you 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.890
 you can enter your video we enter the 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.360
 bio 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.880
 we see that the board detects the hard drive 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.040
 and if in life he detects it perfectly 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.170
 more or less they have to have 500 gigas 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.140
 once it detects disk what 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.880
 we have placed sata with the current and 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.120
 with the data that the bios brings 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.010
 verify that it is really correct 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.440
 sales of videos recorded with 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.360
 referrals to your operating system 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.200
 and once it enters the system 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.989
 operative what we are going to do is that 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.390
 let's format the disk the formats 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.800
 that puts on this disc has no 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.959
 format we tell you what we want 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.440
 format the way we love and already 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.420
 we would have the 500gb hard drive 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.730
 placed in our machine and formatted 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.830
 already or my friends remember to put 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.410
 gloves to place any 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.690
 component of our machine that has 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.170
 some guides already or my friends that what 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.170
 have a great time
