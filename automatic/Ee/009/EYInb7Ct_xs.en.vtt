 a small car with the ambulance 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.019

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.430
 rest in the center of utrecht 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.710
 if I am the closest unit 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.420
 then the milk jug will start betting 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.289
 I can already start posting with 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.730
 assistance 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.430

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.079

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.809
 the all 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.190
 driving ahead of what we will deliver 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.870
 and we actually speak of it with 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.760
 each other as soon as we post 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.950
 come then we first look at how we 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.449
 first do that 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.800
 yes it's really teamie yes it's good too 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.570
 that you just really want a driver 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.910
 and a nurse just complete 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.170
 two different service it 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.090
 responsible for nurses 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.989
 assisting image is just being there 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.920
 then with then we have a lot to our 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.210
 first impression 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.600
 you try to bring peace to the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.020
 situation you try to relieve the crowds 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.150
 get it 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.010
 we always work following according 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.200
 the same method here is our whole 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.360
 learned tight and that ensures 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.490
 that we always treat it first 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.500
 yes , the patient comes first 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.930
 would die then stand that problem 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.369
 free grind to take away 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.470
 the blood pressure the heart rhythm that deserve 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.450
 they we always go to work according to one 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.610
 abcd methodology 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.530
 and whether that is a birth or that there is 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.909
 Well someone is the one against the car 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.979
 tree or someone mine 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.960
 post career complaints on the spot 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.130
 we trees around people and there is already now 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.590
 the gray area which is not under the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.670
 protocol falls then I take my healthy one 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.530
 mind you but there morning and then 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.119
 I use that treat first some kills 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.610
 first so treat the first white 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.079
 First dying patients so that we 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.640
 give the best possible chance of survival and 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.850
 to transport hospitals 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.759
 many people think we do 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.470
 when we come that we pick up the people 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.479
 and immediately leave for the hospital 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.380
 meat care is also no transport 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.659
 no worries either 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.430
 neighborhood is the nicest as if to lancia's 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.899
 comes that you are not prosecuted because then you have 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.250
 you chant to post on 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.750
 between us we have rides 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.980
 of course also b transports for people 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.810
 these rocks have to study 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.330
 pick up things from a hospital 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.709
 name radiation and with two years of people 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.780

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.030

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.370

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.360
 ride in ambulance can be that too 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.670
 very special in I the altar and 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.519

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.250
 being able to go as a driver 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.900

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.610
