things maybe there's another emulator
maybe<00:03:40.379> that<00:03:40.530> emulates<00:03:40.889> old<00:03:41.160> hardware<00:03:41.940> like<00:03:42.180> an

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
maybe that emulates old hardware like an

and I'll have to set that to shift for
salt<00:06:16.270> all<00:06:17.270> right<00:06:17.420> now<00:06:17.570> I<00:06:17.600> don't<00:06:17.840> change<00:06:18.230> the

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
salt all right now I don't change the

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.380 
salt all right now I don't change the
default<00:06:18.830> for<00:06:19.070> our<00:06:19.250> player<00:06:19.520> one<00:06:19.730> start<00:06:20.000> is<00:06:20.150> one

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
default for our player one start is one

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.180 
default for our player one start is one
and<00:06:20.660> the<00:06:20.720> coin<00:06:21.020> in<00:06:21.290> is<00:06:22.480> five<00:06:23.480> and<00:06:23.690> six<00:06:24.190> seven

so basically there's one two three and

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.320 
so basically there's one two three and
four<00:06:27.290> players<00:06:27.590> start<00:06:27.920> five<00:06:28.580> six<00:06:28.880> seven<00:06:29.210> and
