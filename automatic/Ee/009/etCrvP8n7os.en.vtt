00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
Stoke top of the league but I think

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.920 
Stoke top of the league but I think
they'll<00:02:55.650> have<00:02:55.739> 85<00:02:56.129> sitting<00:02:57.000> yeah<00:02:57.329> and<00:02:57.540> the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
they'll have 85 sitting yeah and the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.569 
they'll have 85 sitting yeah and the
only<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.379> only<00:02:58.409> fly<00:02:58.739> in<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.859> ointment<00:02:58.949> for<00:02:59.430> me

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
only the only fly in the ointment for me

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.039 
only the only fly in the ointment for me
would<00:02:59.730> be<00:02:59.819> stuck<00:03:00.060> sitting<00:03:00.269> even<00:03:00.659> if<00:03:00.780> they<00:03:00.900> only

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
would be stuck sitting even if they only

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.159 
would be stuck sitting even if they only
take<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.319> point<00:03:01.620> now<00:03:01.799> that<00:03:02.189> would<00:03:02.340> give<00:03:02.459> them<00:03:02.549> 83

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:03.169 
take a point now that would give them 83

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:05.089 
take a point now that would give them 83
so<00:03:04.169> that<00:03:04.349> would<00:03:04.500> still<00:03:04.709> leave<00:03:04.859> them<00:03:05.010> a

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
so that would still leave them a

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.500 
so that would still leave them a
touching<00:03:05.459> distance<00:03:05.639> going<00:03:05.969> into<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.329> game

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510
