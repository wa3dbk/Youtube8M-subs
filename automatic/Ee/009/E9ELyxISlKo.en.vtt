more bulk although i can't really tell
honestly<00:01:27.210> side<00:01:27.630> by<00:01:27.840> side<00:01:28.140> um<00:01:28.909> so<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.210> price

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
honestly side by side um so the price

actually a lot more expensive the
compared<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:34.009> pc<00:01:35.009> version<00:01:35.119> but<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.240> does

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
compared to the pc version but it does

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.929 
compared to the pc version but it does
pack<00:01:36.810> an<00:01:37.110> extra<00:01:37.290> cable<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.220> some<00:01:38.790> more

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.320 
drive so this
this<00:02:04.620> extender<00:02:05.160> actually<00:02:05.580> sticks<00:02:05.910> out<00:02:06.120> of<00:02:06.240> it

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
this extender actually sticks out of it

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.540 
this extender actually sticks out of it
more<00:02:06.510> when<00:02:06.720> you<00:02:06.870> put<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.290> there<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.740> overall

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
more when you put it on there so overall

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.240 
more when you put it on there so overall
once<00:02:08.790> you've<00:02:08.970> got<00:02:09.210> the<00:02:09.540> firewire<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.950> Mac

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
once you've got the firewire and the Mac

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.430 
once you've got the firewire and the Mac
hard<00:02:11.820> drive<00:02:12.030> will<00:02:12.150> set<00:02:12.390> up<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:13.020> actually

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
hard drive will set up it's actually

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.060 
hard drive will set up it's actually
really<00:02:13.680> big<00:02:14.240> as<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.510> can<00:02:15.690> see<00:02:15.930> here<00:02:16.260> but<00:02:16.920> when

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
really big as you can see here but when

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.240 
really big as you can see here but when
the<00:02:17.250> USB<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.120> one<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.630> on<00:02:18.960> its<00:02:19.170> it's<00:02:19.650> just<00:02:20.130> a

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
the USB to one is on its it's just a

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.890 
the USB to one is on its it's just a
little<00:02:20.460> thing<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:21.150> goes<00:02:21.270> on<00:02:21.510> there<00:02:21.750> and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
little thing that goes on there and

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.250 
little thing that goes on there and
you've<00:02:22.560> got<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.770> USB<00:02:23.250> 2.0<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.780> device<00:02:25.020> is

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
you've got the USB 2.0 the device is

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.120 
you've got the USB 2.0 the device is
pretty<00:02:25.770> thin<00:02:26.100> I<00:02:26.280> mean<00:02:26.490> let's<00:02:27.240> compare<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.840> to

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
pretty thin I mean let's compare it to

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.900 
pretty thin I mean let's compare it to
samsung<00:02:29.130> focus<00:02:31.100> it's<00:02:32.100> it's<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.460> decent<00:02:32.880> size

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
samsung focus it's it's a decent size

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.940 
samsung focus it's it's a decent size
but<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.390> course<00:02:33.630> it<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.960> terabyte<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:34.740> it's<00:02:34.860> a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
but of course it is a terabyte so it's a

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.070 
but of course it is a terabyte so it's a
big<00:02:35.130> hard<00:02:35.430> drive<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.910> know<00:02:36.030> for<00:02:36.570> backing<00:02:36.930> up

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
big hard drive you know for backing up

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.380 
big hard drive you know for backing up
and<00:02:37.320> for<00:02:37.590> media<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.010> stuff<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.360> a

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
and for media and stuff so this is a

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.360 
and for media and stuff so this is a
great<00:02:39.810> all-purpose<00:02:40.050> hard<00:02:40.590> drive<00:02:40.800> simply

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
great all-purpose hard drive simply

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.880 
great all-purpose hard drive simply
because<00:02:41.520> it's<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.450> adaptable<00:02:43.260> for<00:02:43.410> whatever

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890

you're using it for you can use this on

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.400 
you're using it for you can use this on
with<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.770> dark<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.490> can<00:02:47.700> use<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:47.910> with<00:02:48.270> USB<00:02:49.110> 3

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
with a dark you can use it with USB 3

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
and it's all interchangeable that's why

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.050 
and it's all interchangeable that's why
I<00:02:54.600> think<00:02:55.080> digo<00:02:55.380> flex<00:02:55.709> our<00:02:56.370> line<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:56.670> products

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
I think digo flex our line of products

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.590 
I think digo flex our line of products
are<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:58.230> good<00:02:58.470> um<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:59.250> works<00:02:59.459> excellent<00:03:00.420> for

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
are so so good um it works excellent for

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.729 
are so so good um it works excellent for
time<00:03:00.750> machine<00:03:01.020> which<00:03:01.140> I'll<00:03:01.290> show<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.620> a

time machine which I'll show you in a

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.580 
time machine which I'll show you in a
minute<00:03:02.030> but<00:03:03.030> for<00:03:03.180> its<00:03:03.300> size<00:03:03.510> its<00:03:03.900> all-purpose

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
minute but for its size its all-purpose

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.390 
minute but for its size its all-purpose
rugged<00:03:05.480> design<00:03:06.480> it's<00:03:06.720> really<00:03:07.050> nice<00:03:07.200> um<00:03:07.739> one<00:03:08.370> of

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
rugged design it's really nice um one of

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.740 
rugged design it's really nice um one of
the<00:03:08.489> difference<00:03:08.940> between<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.330> pc<00:03:09.720> version

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
the difference between the pc version

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.320 
the difference between the pc version
and<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.830> mac<00:03:11.010> version<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.610> this<00:03:11.850> one<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.300> very

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
and the mac version is this one is very

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.560 
and the mac version is this one is very
slick<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.080> captures<00:03:13.530> scratches<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.310> smudges

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
slick it captures scratches and smudges

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.479 
slick it captures scratches and smudges
are<00:03:15.570> quite<00:03:15.959> clearly<00:03:16.320> while<00:03:16.680> this<00:03:16.950> one<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.340> is

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
are quite clearly while this one is is

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.910 
are quite clearly while this one is is
more<00:03:18.150> rubberized<00:03:18.810> it's<00:03:19.170> not<00:03:19.350> complete<00:03:19.739> rubber

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
more rubberized it's not complete rubber

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.740 
more rubberized it's not complete rubber
but<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.190> has<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.310> rubber<00:03:20.580> feel<00:03:20.940> it's<00:03:21.209> really

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
but it has a rubber feel it's really

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.120 
but it has a rubber feel it's really
weird<00:03:21.900> actually<00:03:22.320> if<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.470> look<00:03:22.500> at<00:03:22.799> this<00:03:22.890> this

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
weird actually if you look at this this

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.440 
weird actually if you look at this this
looks<00:03:23.340> like<00:03:23.400> aluminium<00:03:23.700> but<00:03:24.209> it's<00:03:24.330> actually

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
looks like aluminium but it's actually

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.690 
looks like aluminium but it's actually
it's<00:03:25.200> got<00:03:25.410> like<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.590> rubber<00:03:25.890> sort<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.280> texture

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
it's got like a rubber sort of texture

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.330 
it's got like a rubber sort of texture
to<00:03:26.820> which<00:03:26.940> does<00:03:27.180> pick<00:03:27.420> up<00:03:27.570> dust<00:03:27.840> but<00:03:28.320> I'm<00:03:28.620> much

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
to which does pick up dust but I'm much

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.660 
to which does pick up dust but I'm much
more<00:03:29.549> durable<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:30.150> feels<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:31.190> so<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.310> sizing

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
more durable it feels and so the sizing

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.729 
more durable it feels and so the sizing
is<00:03:32.820> really<00:03:33.090> good<00:03:33.299> it<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.870> think<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.320> looks<00:03:34.350> so

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
is really good it I think it looks so

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.060 
is really good it I think it looks so
good<00:03:34.769> because<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.640> how<00:03:36.269> clean<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:37.110> ports<00:03:37.890> are

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
good because of how clean the ports are

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.570 
good because of how clean the ports are
this<00:03:38.430> is<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.910> USB<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:40.320> when<00:03:40.709> it's<00:03:40.890> on<00:03:41.100> there

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
this is the USB to when it's on there

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.120 
this is the USB to when it's on there
but<00:03:41.820> when<00:03:41.970> there<00:03:42.299> is<00:03:42.420> no<00:03:42.739> extender<00:03:43.739> on<00:03:43.799> it<00:03:43.980> it's

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
but when there is no extender on it it's

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.870 
but when there is no extender on it it's
it's<00:03:44.400> virtually<00:03:45.390> tiny<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:46.950> it's<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.610> really

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
it's virtually tiny and it's a really

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.970 
it's virtually tiny and it's a really
awesome<00:03:48.090> all-purpose<00:03:48.750> hard<00:03:49.049> drive<00:03:49.290> in<00:03:49.590> that

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
awesome all-purpose hard drive in that

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.250 
awesome all-purpose hard drive in that
sense<00:03:50.250> now<00:03:50.519> that's<00:03:50.790> gone<00:03:51.030> take<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.720> look<00:03:51.930> at<00:03:52.110> how

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
sense now that's gone take a look at how

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.020 
sense now that's gone take a look at how
it<00:03:52.380> performs<00:03:52.739> on<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:52.860> Mac<00:03:53.100> I<00:03:53.400> think<00:03:53.850> one<00:03:54.000> thing

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
it performs on a Mac I think one thing

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.229 
it performs on a Mac I think one thing
worth<00:03:54.690> mentioning<00:03:54.830> is<00:03:55.830> how<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.640> colorization

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
worth mentioning is how the colorization

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.990 
worth mentioning is how the colorization
of<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.019> product<00:03:58.440> works<00:03:58.769> looks<00:03:59.280> so<00:03:59.549> good<00:03:59.790> with

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
of the product works looks so good with

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.720 
of the product works looks so good with
the<00:04:00.200> macbook<00:04:01.200> pro<00:04:01.230> just<00:04:01.860> something<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.250> throw

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
the macbook pro just something to throw

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.310 
the macbook pro just something to throw
it<00:04:02.820> out<00:04:02.940> there<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.269> design<00:04:03.600> aspect<00:04:04.110> they

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
it out there and the design aspect they

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.229 
it out there and the design aspect they
did<00:04:04.500> an<00:04:04.950> excellent<00:04:05.340> job<00:04:05.549> of<00:04:05.760> color

did an excellent job of color

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.470 
did an excellent job of color
coordinating<00:04:06.989> it<00:04:07.110> with<00:04:07.549> macbooks<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:08.970> so<00:04:09.420> you

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
coordinating it with macbooks and so you

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.470 
coordinating it with macbooks and so you
can<00:04:09.870> definitely<00:04:10.049> tell<00:04:10.290> that<00:04:10.530> it's<00:04:10.799> design

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
can definitely tell that it's design

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.540 
can definitely tell that it's design
x<00:04:11.629> so<00:04:12.260> you've<00:04:12.379> got<00:04:12.409> the<00:04:12.620> drive<00:04:12.830> plugged<00:04:13.190> it<00:04:13.430> in

over onto the hydrogen and see how it

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.750 
over onto the hydrogen and see how it
performs<00:04:20.449> we<00:04:21.320> actually<00:04:21.709> got<00:04:21.859> the<00:04:22.100> goflex

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
performs we actually got the goflex

looks like and it's done it's in around
15<00:04:44.710> seconds<00:04:45.710> yep<00:04:46.010> it's<00:04:46.430> so<00:04:47.300> that<00:04:47.539> was<00:04:47.750> how<00:04:48.050> fast

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
15 seconds yep it's so that was how fast

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.920 
15 seconds yep it's so that was how fast
transferred<00:04:49.010> 250<00:04:49.580> megabytes<00:04:50.000> of<00:04:50.300> data<00:04:50.360> really

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
designed from access center leads they

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.350 
designed from access center leads they
polish<00:04:57.229> the<00:04:57.380> speeds<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:57.860> everything<00:04:58.220> so<00:04:58.520> it

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
polish the speeds and everything so it

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.900 
polish the speeds and everything so it
works<00:04:59.570> very<00:04:59.840> well<00:04:59.930> if<00:05:00.320> we<00:05:00.620> go<00:05:00.650> and<00:05:01.130> open<00:05:01.400> um
