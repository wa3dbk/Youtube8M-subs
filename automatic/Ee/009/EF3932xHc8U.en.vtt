00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the UK and it was very exciting but I

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.410 
the UK and it was very exciting but I
wanted<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> do<00:01:01.230> something<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.590> was<00:01:01.829> special

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
wanted to do something that was special

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.429

to<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:04.199> mark<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.189> end<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.659> ML<00:01:06.869> one<00:01:07.140> run

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
to really mark the end of the ML one run

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.960 
to really mark the end of the ML one run
because<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.860> really<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.250> end<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.729> ML

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.530 
the first concept was to take one of
them<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.020> give<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> guy<00:01:16.979> called<00:01:17.159> James

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.060 
they sound great
my<00:02:03.869> one<00:02:04.079> just<00:02:04.229> happens<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.680> some

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
my one just happens to have some

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.570 
my one just happens to have some
DiMarzio<00:02:05.640> love<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.149> there<00:02:06.829> the<00:02:07.829> wiring<00:02:08.340> is

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
DiMarzio love in there the wiring is

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.350 
DiMarzio love in there the wiring is
different<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:10.400> came<00:02:11.400> across<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.700> wiring<00:02:12.060> that

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
different I came across a wiring that

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.550 
different I came across a wiring that
really<00:02:12.599> suited<00:02:12.959> me

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
really suited me

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.229 
really suited me
while<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:13.890> was<00:02:14.160> in<00:02:14.280> America<00:02:14.370> recording<00:02:15.120> with<00:02:15.209> a

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
while I was in America recording with a

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.380 
while I was in America recording with a
Kramer<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.319> what<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.470> did<00:02:16.650> was<00:02:16.770> this<00:02:16.950> I

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
Kramer and what I did was this I

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.900 
Kramer and what I did was this I
bypassed<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:19.170> tone<00:02:19.380> circuitry<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.640> get

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
bypassed the tone circuitry so you get

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.120 
bypassed the tone circuitry so you get
more<00:02:21.239> hired<00:02:21.810> frequencies<00:02:22.470> more<00:02:22.620> tone<00:02:22.860> going

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
more hired frequencies more tone going

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.130 
more hired frequencies more tone going
through<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.400> system<00:02:23.610> but<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.480> kept<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.900> coil

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
through the system but I kept the coil

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.949 
through the system but I kept the coil
time<00:02:25.349> so<00:02:25.709> this<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:25.980> just<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.250> coil<00:02:26.459> time<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:27.060> took

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
time so this is just a coil time I took

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.350 
time so this is just a coil time I took
out<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.230> shadow<00:02:28.440> kill<00:02:28.709> pop<00:02:29.120> not<00:02:30.120> because<00:02:30.330> I

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
out the shadow kill pop not because I

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.180 
out the shadow kill pop not because I
didn't<00:02:30.599> like<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:31.019> but<00:02:31.470> because<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.800> wanted<00:02:32.130> a

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
didn't like it but because I wanted a

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.390 
didn't like it but because I wanted a
better<00:02:32.750> swell<00:02:33.750> on<00:02:34.140> my<00:02:34.680> volume<00:02:35.069> because<00:02:35.310> it

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
better swell on my volume because it

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.180 
better swell on my volume because it
already<00:02:35.700> can<00:02:35.910> swell<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:36.930> found<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.800> kill<00:02:37.980> pot

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
already can swell I found the kill pot

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.040 
already can swell I found the kill pot
to<00:02:38.310> be<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> little<00:02:38.580> bit<00:02:38.730> jumpy<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.630> remove<00:02:39.959> the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
to be a little bit jumpy so remove the

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.020 
to be a little bit jumpy so remove the
kill<00:02:40.230> port<00:02:40.470> regular<00:02:41.010> higher-quality<00:02:41.400> volume

a camera audio I'm using a dark Tara a
whole<00:04:23.680> bunch<00:04:23.920> of<00:04:24.130> TC<00:04:24.730> Electronics<00:04:25.210> patents

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
whole bunch of TC Electronics patents

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.840 
whole bunch of TC Electronics patents
I'll<00:04:25.840> start<00:04:26.110> with<00:04:26.170> support<00:04:26.530> tap<00:04:26.770> tones<00:04:27.040> and<00:04:27.640> I

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
I'll start with support tap tones and I

00:04:27.850 --> 00:06:17.390 
I'll start with support tap tones and I
gave<00:04:28.000> you<00:04:28.030> some<00:04:28.120> other<00:04:28.360> full<00:04:28.630> bar<00:04:29.140> tones
