 in women, they are well known as migraine

 always starts in 20-30 minutes then 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.810
 for an hour there are signs that show 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.180
 that migraine soon begins to develop in 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.959
 of many people this is the so -called 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.370
 visual aura nenko let's 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.389
 visual aura which manifests itself as 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.239
 flicker 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:48.709
 outbreaks of eyes field loss 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.319
 some kind of 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:57.199
 evil splashes or tongues of fire which 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.639
 partially closes the sight and the person here 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:01.759
 see now it will be seen 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:05.299
 starts slowly starts eyes not 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:07.819
 see here this goal which speaks of 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.650
 the fact that Megre will soon develop 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.620
 need an attack is first there when 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.509
 vessels spasm second stage then 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.549
 serotonin which is responsible for this 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:18.979
 a lot of tryptophan state is 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.340
 the precursor of serotonin in the second 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:25.340
 the stage when the aura passes through the vessels 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.349
 expand dramatically be to the next 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.280
 mock up 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:34.849
 vessels will expand dramatically and appear 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.610
 throbbing headache which 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.490
 branches of the trigeminal nerve will 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.180
 spread to half 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:46.240
 head then serotonin will be the opposite 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:52.810
 little so here if tricks on a trip to 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:56.680
 the tryptophan and in vain i said u those u 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.289
 whom tryptophan many serotonin levels 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.440
 in such situations it still remains 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:05.050
 more or less normal and accordingly 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.220
 severe headaches in such people are not 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.940
 happens here 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:14.009
 flickering our aura beauty is impossible 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.539
 then Megre but if you eat seeds h 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.720
 full order are waiting for the second guest 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:18.720
