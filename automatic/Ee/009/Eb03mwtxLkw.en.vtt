00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.040
 hello we are all going to make this little tree 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.240
 that can serve as a bookmark 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.100
 if we put the stick is behind 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.170
 It would be a bookmark and if we leave it 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.490
 without a stick, it helps us to put it in 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.460
 any card or where we want to decorate 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.640
 to do it let's use a stick 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.640
 of wood 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:33.020
 and these muffin capsules 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:37.910
 these are 9 centimeters and I'm going to use 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.910
 2 this one with little flowers and this one with strawberries 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.970
 I have cost 95 cents each, and 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.140
 You can buy it in a Chinese bazaar 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.020
 find also in supermarkets 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.060
 pastry shops and in many places 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.400
 they sell them 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.500
 if you find them with the drawings in 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.510
 green would be better to make the tree 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.190
 what are you but are the ones that I have and 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.309
 the ones that I'm going to use 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.019
 I made it with two flowers and one of 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.170
 strawberry and now I'm going to do it with two of 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.060
 strawberries and one of flowers the first thing that 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.860
 let's do is going to be take our 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.810
 capsules 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.810
 and we're going to fold it in half 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.480
 once we have it folded we go back 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.480
 to make another doubles 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.450
 and we have that left 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.680
 now so that this does not unfold 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.600
 We are going to put some glue 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.930
 I'm going to use this one that's the one 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.930
 I have 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.880
 and I put there a little bit 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.440
 and it is already fixed 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.840
 and with the other two we're going to do what 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.840
 we fold in half 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.770
 and we bend again 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.280
 we wait 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.749
 and we take the following 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.580
 we put glue 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.830
 and we would have the three parts now 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.260
 to put it together we can put it like this 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.890
 a little more separated or put together a 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.890
 a little more 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.100
 that as we want 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.140
 It would be a thing 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.940
 and putting them on top of each other 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.940
 keep putting glue 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.770
 now more or less 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:35.830
 that would be how we will stay 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.830
 and here I put another bit of glue 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.080
 and we would stay like that 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.550
 now we can paste this in the 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.070
 cardboard on a card or where 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.580
 we want or in my case I'm going to make a 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.650
 bookmark 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.360
 so what I'm going to do here is going to 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.810
 be throwing glue 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.110
 here in the back we put a 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.110
 strip 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.530
 we take our stick 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.360
 and we hit it and it would be 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.380
 As you can see it is very easy and it is done in a 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.720
 moment and they are with materials that we usually 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.409
 have at home because the capsules are 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.349
 of cupcakes 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:44.680
 there are usually some at home 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:47.139
 we make pastries only emotions 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.889
 these sticks if we do not have we would serve 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.889
 the one with an ice cream 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:56.299
 and this is the result I hope that you 

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:58.899
 have liked a greeting and see you in the 

00:04:56.299 --> 00:04:58.899
 next
