00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.600
 normally 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.600
 in the red square of la liga 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.839
 the only time we have time to ramp up 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.670
 that's why the traces of things to say 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.990
 I think 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.740
 will tell 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.740
 to start arriving late 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.100
 but personally I have no pain 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.980
 the decline of the title 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.190
 rescuers 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.410
 this season 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.410
 it is obvious that at the local level 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.300
 the moment only 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.940
 he specifies that things are certainly not going to tomorrow 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.880
 nearly 600 people 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:11.609
 remember 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.609
 not to mention next December 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.509
 this season 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:19.869
 good ok thanks a lot less
