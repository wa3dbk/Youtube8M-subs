as<00:00:07.960> we<00:00:08.960> install<00:00:09.110> vinyl<00:00:09.590> all<00:00:10.010> of<00:00:10.430> us<00:00:10.550> get<00:00:10.760> the

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
as we install vinyl all of us get the

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.970 
as we install vinyl all of us get the
odd<00:00:11.059> bubble<00:00:11.480> and<00:00:11.630> wrinkle<00:00:11.960> but<00:00:12.530> here<00:00:12.740> are<00:00:12.830> some

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
odd bubble and wrinkle but here are some

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.380 
odd bubble and wrinkle but here are some
techniques<00:00:13.370> to<00:00:13.580> make<00:00:13.700> your<00:00:13.970> bubbles<00:00:14.300> and

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:14.390 
techniques to make your bubbles and

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.109 
techniques to make your bubbles and
wrinkles<00:00:14.450> go<00:00:15.019> away<00:00:18.189> first<00:00:19.189> let's<00:00:19.790> talk<00:00:20.060> about

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
vehicle before your squeegee places it

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.790 
vehicle before your squeegee places it
there<00:00:44.480> which<00:00:45.379> results<00:00:45.949> in<00:00:46.070> bubbles<00:00:47.620> here<00:00:48.620> we

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
there which results in bubbles here we

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.950 
there which results in bubbles here we
have<00:00:49.010> a<00:00:49.039> really<00:00:49.489> long<00:00:49.699> bubble<00:00:50.120> and<00:00:50.300> here<00:00:50.809> we

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
have a really long bubble and here we

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.360 
have a really long bubble and here we
have<00:00:51.170> something<00:00:51.469> that<00:00:51.649> could<00:00:51.920> turn<00:00:52.039> into<00:00:52.100> a

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
have something that could turn into a

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.369 
have something that could turn into a
wrinkle<00:00:52.820> and<00:00:53.030> here<00:00:53.929> as<00:00:54.050> well<00:00:56.199> let's<00:00:57.199> get

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
wrinkle and here as well let's get

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.720 
wrinkle and here as well let's get
started<00:00:57.769> with<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.010> long<00:00:58.190> bubble<00:01:00.550> ideally<00:01:01.550> you

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
started with the long bubble ideally you

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.250 
started with the long bubble ideally you
would<00:01:01.820> like<00:01:01.879> the<00:01:02.210> bubble<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:02.660> be<00:01:02.780> this<00:01:02.989> size

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
would like the bubble to be this size

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.560 
would like the bubble to be this size
because<00:01:04.040> if<00:01:04.190> it<00:01:04.309> were<00:01:04.550> you<00:01:05.000> could<00:01:05.180> just<00:01:05.390> touch

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
because if it were you could just touch

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.390 
because if it were you could just touch
it<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.050> would<00:01:06.170> disappear<00:01:06.710> due<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:07.159> the

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
it and it would disappear due to the

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.040 
it and it would disappear due to the
area<00:01:07.760> grass<00:01:07.970> pattern<00:01:08.390> in<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.630> adhesive<00:01:11.050> when

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
area grass pattern in the adhesive when

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.170 
area grass pattern in the adhesive when
you<00:01:12.200> have<00:01:12.410> a<00:01:12.440> long<00:01:12.770> bubble<00:01:13.130> like<00:01:13.310> this<00:01:13.550> simply

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
you have a long bubble like this simply

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.530 
you have a long bubble like this simply
divide<00:01:14.660> it<00:01:14.810> up<00:01:14.900> into<00:01:15.050> smaller<00:01:15.500> bubbles<00:01:16.540> then

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
divide it up into smaller bubbles then

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.630 
divide it up into smaller bubbles then
when<00:01:18.110> all<00:01:18.290> you<00:01:18.500> have<00:01:18.710> are<00:01:18.920> smaller<00:01:19.220> bubbles

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
when all you have are smaller bubbles

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.760 
when all you have are smaller bubbles
simply<00:01:20.450> place<00:01:20.690> your<00:01:20.720> finger<00:01:21.200> or<00:01:21.350> thumb<00:01:21.380> on

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
simply place your finger or thumb on

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.350 
simply place your finger or thumb on
each<00:01:21.800> one<00:01:22.160> and<00:01:22.340> they<00:01:22.760> will<00:01:22.910> completely

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
each one and they will completely

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:32.920 
each one and they will completely
flatten<00:01:23.900> out

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.690 

if<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.410> a<00:01:34.440> potential<00:01:34.950> wrinkle<00:01:35.490> like

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
if you have a potential wrinkle like

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.150 
if you have a potential wrinkle like
this<00:01:36.000> start<00:01:36.780> working<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.410> with<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> Teflon

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
this start working it with the Teflon

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.880 
this start working it with the Teflon
squeegee<00:01:38.700> work<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.870> wrinkle<00:01:40.230> back<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
squeegee work the wrinkle back in the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:52.010 
squeegee work the wrinkle back in the
direction<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.430> came<00:01:41.640> from

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.230 

you<00:01:52.680> can<00:01:52.890> see<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.340> as<00:01:53.520> soon<00:01:53.700> as<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.030> get

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
you can see that as soon as you get

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.359 
you can see that as soon as you get
closer<00:01:54.539> to<00:01:54.810> its<00:01:54.960> origin<00:01:55.469> the<00:01:55.619> wrinkle

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
closer to its origin the wrinkle

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.990 
closer to its origin the wrinkle
develops<00:01:56.850> two<00:01:57.090> corners<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.859> continue<00:01:59.399> cut

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
develops two corners as you continue cut

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.149 
develops two corners as you continue cut
each<00:02:00.240> corner<00:02:00.630> off<00:02:00.899> at<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.229> 45-degree<00:02:02.130> angle

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
each corner off at a 45-degree angle

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.459 
each corner off at a 45-degree angle
until<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.179> work<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.570> back<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.079> edge<00:02:04.229> of

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
until you work it back to the edge of

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.279 
until you work it back to the edge of
the<00:02:04.619> application<00:02:08.119> seal<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.299> edge<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.750> the

the application seal the edge and the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:18.839 
the application seal the edge and the
wrinkle<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.799> undetectable

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.479 

sometimes<00:02:19.810> we<00:02:20.049> may<00:02:20.200> drop<00:02:20.469> the<00:02:20.680> vinyl<00:02:21.069> onto<00:02:21.370> the

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
sometimes we may drop the vinyl onto the

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.550 
sometimes we may drop the vinyl onto the
vehicle<00:02:21.939> and<00:02:22.090> create<00:02:22.659> a<00:02:22.689> field<00:02:23.109> of<00:02:23.290> small

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
vehicle and create a field of small

vehicle and create a field of small
bubbles<00:02:23.799> that<00:02:24.159> don't<00:02:24.340> have<00:02:24.579> a<00:02:24.609> large<00:02:24.939> volume

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
bubbles that don't have a large volume

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.869 
bubbles that don't have a large volume
of<00:02:25.480> air<00:02:25.659> it<00:02:26.499> could<00:02:26.739> take<00:02:26.950> some<00:02:27.189> time<00:02:27.219> to<00:02:27.670> push

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
of air it could take some time to push

here<00:02:44.080> we<00:02:44.260> have<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.530> high-pressure<00:02:45.040> bubble<00:02:45.640> and

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
here we have a high-pressure bubble and

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.850 
here we have a high-pressure bubble and

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
the vinyl is standing off the vehicle

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.729 
the vinyl is standing off the vehicle
quite<00:02:48.099> a<00:02:48.130> bit<00:02:48.599> it<00:02:49.599> also<00:02:49.840> has<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.170> potential

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
quite a bit it also has a potential

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.699 
quite a bit it also has a potential

first<00:02:57.849> fix<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.840> largest<00:02:59.319> bubble<00:02:59.560> we<00:03:00.100> need<00:03:00.310> it

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
first fix the largest bubble we need it

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.070 
first fix the largest bubble we need it
to<00:03:00.520> be<00:03:00.640> round<00:03:03.300> start<00:03:04.300> with<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.569> end<00:03:04.750> of<00:03:04.959> the

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
to be round start with the end of the

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.080 
to be round start with the end of the
wrinkle<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:05.620> follow<00:03:06.160> it<00:03:06.370> all<00:03:06.520> the<00:03:06.580> way<00:03:06.760> back

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
wrinkle and follow it all the way back

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.330 
wrinkle and follow it all the way back
to<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:07.420> bubble<00:03:07.600> cutting<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.350> corners<00:03:08.739> at<00:03:08.860> 45

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340

degrees

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:30.850 

now<00:03:17.930> reshape<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.130> bubble<00:03:19.460> into<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.850> circle

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.250 

repeat<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:31.940> steps<00:03:32.210> of<00:03:32.420> removing<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.930> wrinkle

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
repeat the steps of removing the wrinkle

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:48.640 
repeat the steps of removing the wrinkle
first<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.800> then<00:03:34.520> making<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:35.030> bubble<00:03:35.330> round

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.699

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
we have a fair-sized bubble here - I

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.039 
we have a fair-sized bubble here - I
suggest<00:03:52.610> dividing<00:03:53.450> it<00:03:53.569> first<00:03:53.840> before

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
suggest dividing it first before

suggest dividing it first before
flattening<00:03:54.650> it<00:03:55.599> always<00:03:56.599> remember<00:03:57.080> to<00:03:57.319> round

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
flattening it always remember to round

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.040 
flattening it always remember to round
the<00:03:57.799> corners

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.110 

we'll<00:04:04.620> start<00:04:04.920> with<00:04:05.100> this<00:04:05.280> one<00:04:05.340> because<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:05.970> has
