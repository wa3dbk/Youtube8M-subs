when we all got together in Pasadena in
August<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.360> really<00:01:06.720> started<00:01:07.140> hashing<00:01:08.070> out

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
August and really started hashing out

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.520 
August and really started hashing out
some<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.790> information<00:01:09.320> I've<00:01:10.320> been

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
some of this information I've been

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.140 
some of this information I've been
involved<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.890> many<00:01:11.040> different<00:01:11.220> professional

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
involved in many different professional

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.120 
involved in many different professional
development<00:01:12.570> activities<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.979> by

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
development activities and this is by

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.440 
development activities and this is by
far<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.369> best<00:01:14.700> one<00:01:14.970> I've<00:01:15.119> ever<00:01:15.150> done

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
far the best one I've ever done

far the best one I've ever done
throughout<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.200> project<00:01:16.439> I've<00:01:16.920> learned

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
throughout this project I've learned

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.010 
throughout this project I've learned
that<00:01:17.460> science<00:01:18.060> isn't<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.689> about<00:01:18.810> doing

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
that science isn't just about doing

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.840 
that science isn't just about doing
research<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.860> also<00:01:20.040> about<00:01:20.430> building

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
research it's also about building

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.170 
research it's also about building
relationships<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:22.049> was<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.530> lot<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.830> fun<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:24.000> see

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
relationships it was a lot of fun to see

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.820 
relationships it was a lot of fun to see
the<00:01:24.299> students<00:01:24.659> working<00:01:24.689> with<00:01:25.140> other<00:01:25.470> students

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the students working with other students

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.609 
the students working with other students
from<00:01:25.890> around<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.310> country<00:01:26.460> as<00:01:27.000> one<00:01:27.659> team<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
from around the country as one team the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.530 
from around the country as one team the
most<00:01:28.799> memorable<00:01:29.009> thing<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.700> me<00:01:29.880> during<00:01:30.450> this

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
most memorable thing to me during this

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.539 
most memorable thing to me during this
whole<00:01:30.720> process<00:01:30.900> has<00:01:31.259> been<00:01:31.290> getting<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.220> meet

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
whole process has been getting to meet

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.060 
whole process has been getting to meet
so<00:01:32.579> many<00:01:32.939> interesting<00:01:33.210> people<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.500> teachers

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
so many interesting people the teachers

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.319 
so many interesting people the teachers
that<00:01:35.159> I've<00:01:35.280> been<00:01:35.369> working<00:01:35.549> with<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> students

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
that I've been working with the students

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.040 
that I've been working with the students
I've<00:01:36.420> been<00:01:36.509> working<00:01:36.750> with

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
I've been working with

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.360 
I've been working with
scientists<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.290> project<00:01:38.650> definitely<00:01:39.190> has

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
scientists the project definitely has

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.880 
scientists the project definitely has
changed<00:01:40.090> my<00:01:40.420> attitude<00:01:41.380> toward<00:01:41.710> science

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
changed my attitude toward science

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.740 
changed my attitude toward science
research<00:01:42.460> because<00:01:42.760> I've<00:01:42.880> learned<00:01:43.060> it's<00:01:43.330> more

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
research because I've learned it's more

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.630 
research because I've learned it's more
accessible<00:01:44.560> than<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:44.830> originally<00:01:45.010> thought<00:01:45.430> it

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
accessible than I originally thought it

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.430 
accessible than I originally thought it
was<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.420> higher-level<00:01:46.840> thinking<00:01:47.229> was

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
was the higher-level thinking was

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.200 
was the higher-level thinking was
brought<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.010> level<00:01:48.250> that<00:01:48.550> I<00:01:48.580> feel<00:01:48.910> I<00:01:49.150> could

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210
