00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.580 
is not right and I was like first I was
going<00:04:19.299> off<00:04:19.419> on<00:04:19.450> consistency<00:04:20.079> when<00:04:20.350> I<00:04:20.380> went<00:04:20.530> to

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
going off on consistency when I went to

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.219 
going off on consistency when I went to
when<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:21.280> went<00:04:21.580> to<00:04:21.700> retwist<00:04:22.360> but<00:04:22.599> I<00:04:22.690> was<00:04:22.840> like<00:04:23.020> oh

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
when I went to retwist but I was like oh

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.600 
when I went to retwist but I was like oh
maybe<00:04:23.620> this<00:04:23.800> is<00:04:24.039> the<00:04:24.460> product

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
maybe this is the product

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.130 
maybe this is the product
so<00:04:26.360> I<00:04:26.390> reached<00:04:27.080> with<00:04:27.290> my<00:04:27.500> hair<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:28.040> like<00:04:29.140> maybe

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
so I reached with my hair and like maybe

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.920 
so I reached with my hair and like maybe
three<00:04:30.920> four<00:04:31.190> days<00:04:31.430> later<00:04:31.700> like<00:04:32.090> there<00:04:32.570> was<00:04:32.720> no

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
three four days later like there was no

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.350 
three four days later like there was no
hold<00:04:33.230> like<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:34.160> locks<00:04:34.370> on<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.670> side<00:04:34.910> would<00:04:35.180> be

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
hold like the locks on the side would be

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.690 
hold like the locks on the side would be
coming<00:04:35.630> up<00:04:35.840> a<00:04:35.930> little<00:04:36.050> bit<00:04:36.350> like<00:04:36.920> it<00:04:37.400> just

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
coming up a little bit like it just

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.700 
coming up a little bit like it just
wasn't<00:04:37.880> staying<00:04:38.510> and<00:04:38.960> I<00:04:39.080> was<00:04:39.380> sitting<00:04:39.500> on<00:04:39.650> the

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
wasn't staying and I was sitting on the

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.270 
wasn't staying and I was sitting on the
dryer<00:04:40.010> so<00:04:40.190> I<00:04:40.250> was<00:04:40.370> setting<00:04:40.610> it<00:04:40.730> in<00:04:40.850> I<00:04:42.280> don't

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
dryer so I was setting it in I don't

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.660 
dryer so I was setting it in I don't
know

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
know

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.290 
know
so<00:04:44.030> this<00:04:44.240> definitely<00:04:44.930> was<00:04:45.470> a<00:04:46.010> staple<00:04:46.670> one<00:04:47.180> of

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
so this definitely was a staple one of

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.080 
so this definitely was a staple one of
the<00:04:47.390> best<00:04:48.010> twisting<00:04:49.010> gels<00:04:49.280> I<00:04:49.490> had<00:04:49.670> used

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
the best twisting gels I had used

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.780 
the best twisting gels I had used
unlocks<00:04:50.930> um<00:04:52.900> but<00:04:53.900> then<00:04:54.020> it<00:04:54.140> wasn't<00:04:54.320> I<00:04:54.710> tried<00:04:55.610> it

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
unlocks um but then it wasn't I tried it

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.530 
unlocks um but then it wasn't I tried it
on<00:04:55.940> TV's<00:04:56.660> hair<00:04:56.900> whose<00:04:57.320> locks<00:04:57.560> of<00:04:57.800> course<00:04:58.070> and

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
on TV's hair whose locks of course and

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.140 
on TV's hair whose locks of course and
his<00:04:59.920> demo<00:05:00.920> to<00:05:01.010> all<00:05:01.220> like<00:05:01.460> I<00:05:01.580> only<00:05:01.730> have<00:05:01.820> to<00:05:02.000> put

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
his demo to all like I only have to put

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.940 
his demo to all like I only have to put
it<00:05:02.210> on<00:05:02.330> his<00:05:02.510> new<00:05:02.720> growth<00:05:02.990> because<00:05:03.350> locks<00:05:03.740> are

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
it on his new growth because locks are

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.690 
it on his new growth because locks are
pretty<00:05:04.190> much<00:05:04.340> her<00:05:04.610> and<00:05:06.400> probably<00:05:07.400> within<00:05:07.550> a

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
pretty much her and probably within a

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.630 
pretty much her and probably within a
week<00:05:07.730> of<00:05:08.000> using<00:05:08.420> the<00:05:08.960> gel<00:05:09.200> in<00:05:09.320> his<00:05:09.500> hair<00:05:09.640> his

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
week of using the gel in his hair his

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.910 
week of using the gel in his hair his
new<00:05:11.180> growth<00:05:11.450> was<00:05:11.720> just<00:05:11.930> out<00:05:12.380> of<00:05:12.500> control

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
new growth was just out of control

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.760 
new growth was just out of control
so<00:05:13.730> I<00:05:14.650> can't<00:05:15.650> recommend<00:05:16.580> this<00:05:17.000> for<00:05:17.900> locks<00:05:18.230> at

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
so I can't recommend this for locks at

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.550 
so I can't recommend this for locks at
least<00:05:19.160> for<00:05:19.640> the<00:05:19.730> long<00:05:19.970> haul<00:05:20.300> like<00:05:20.660> in<00:05:20.990> the

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
least for the long haul like in the

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.170 
least for the long haul like in the
beginning<00:05:21.890> it<00:05:22.130> was<00:05:22.250> great<00:05:22.490> so<00:05:22.730> maybe<00:05:22.940> if<00:05:23.090> you

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
beginning it was great so maybe if you

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.580 
beginning it was great so maybe if you
get<00:05:23.360> it<00:05:23.510> and<00:05:23.690> in<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:23.960> beginning<00:05:24.110> of<00:05:24.320> some<00:05:24.470> be

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
get it and in the beginning of some be

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.610 
get it and in the beginning of some be
great<00:05:24.770> for<00:05:24.950> you<00:05:25.240> but<00:05:26.240> so<00:05:26.450> where's<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.810> end<00:05:26.990> it

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
great for you but so where's the end it

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.850 
great for you but so where's the end it
didn't<00:05:28.010> quite<00:05:28.100> work<00:05:28.220> out<00:05:28.520> and<00:05:29.060> I<00:05:30.020> do<00:05:30.320> keep<00:05:30.770> it

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
didn't quite work out and I do keep it

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.830 
didn't quite work out and I do keep it
in<00:05:30.950> my<00:05:31.040> bathroom<00:05:31.610> so<00:05:31.880> I'm<00:05:31.970> not<00:05:32.090> sure<00:05:32.150> if<00:05:32.630> maybe

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840
