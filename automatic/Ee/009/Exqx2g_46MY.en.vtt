yeah I'm not really going underneath
with<00:04:52.199> the<00:04:52.229> color<00:04:52.729> because<00:04:53.729> if<00:04:53.939> you<00:04:54.059> wear

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
with the color because if you wear

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.480 
with the color because if you wear
another<00:04:54.659> shirt<00:04:55.050> it's<00:04:55.259> gonna<00:04:55.439> get<00:04:55.619> all<00:04:55.800> on<00:04:56.339> the

another shirt it's gonna get all on the

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.109 
another shirt it's gonna get all on the
color<00:04:56.759> of<00:04:56.969> that<00:04:57.029> shirt<00:04:57.419> the<00:04:58.169> blue<00:04:58.849> because<00:04:59.849> my

00:05:00.109 --> 00:05:00.119 
color of that shirt the blue because my

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:02.929 
color of that shirt the blue because my
hair<00:05:00.449> is<00:05:00.599> so<00:05:00.959> dark<00:05:01.409> I<00:05:01.619> could<00:05:01.979> not<00:05:02.189> use<00:05:02.429> the<00:05:02.459> blue

00:05:02.929 --> 00:05:02.939 
hair is so dark I could not use the blue

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.299 
hair is so dark I could not use the blue
first<00:05:03.300> because<00:05:04.080> it<00:05:04.259> really<00:05:04.559> didn't<00:05:04.860> show<00:05:04.889> up

00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:05.309 
first because it really didn't show up

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:07.790 
first because it really didn't show up
so<00:05:05.819> that's<00:05:05.939> why<00:05:06.179> I<00:05:06.209> wanted<00:05:06.689> to<00:05:06.929> put<00:05:07.259> the<00:05:07.499> green

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
so that's why I wanted to put the green

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.879 
so that's why I wanted to put the green
on<00:05:08.009> first<00:05:08.429> and<00:05:08.729> then<00:05:08.969> kind<00:05:09.389> of<00:05:09.539> like<00:05:09.749> go<00:05:10.379> over
