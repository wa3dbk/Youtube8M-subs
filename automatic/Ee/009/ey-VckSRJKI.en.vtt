00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
one sort of crota guy so I was kind of

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.240 
one sort of crota guy so I was kind of
disappointed<00:01:30.750> with<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.650> did<00:01:32.009> get<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.189> few

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
disappointed with that I did get a few

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.780 
disappointed with that I did get a few
common<00:01:32.909> n-grams<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:34.049> guy<00:01:34.350> got<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.250> husk

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
common n-grams but this guy got the husk

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.060 
common n-grams but this guy got the husk
of<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.180> pit<00:01:36.360> from<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.869> common<00:01:37.200> Engram<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.740> if

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
of the pit from a common Engram and if

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.249 
of the pit from a common Engram and if
anybody<00:01:38.430> did<00:01:38.610> not<00:01:38.790> know<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.689> common

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
anybody did not know this is a common

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.560 
anybody did not know this is a common
auto<00:01:40.439> rifle<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:41.280> really<00:01:41.579> have<00:01:41.820> no<00:01:42.150> idea<00:01:42.180> how

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
auto rifle so we really have no idea how

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.990 
auto rifle so we really have no idea how
to<00:01:42.600> get<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.200> you're<00:01:43.590> past<00:01:43.799> level<00:01:44.009> 20<00:01:44.460> so

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
to get this if you're past level 20 so

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.819 
to get this if you're past level 20 so
also<00:01:45.210> another<00:01:45.720> speculation<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.649> is

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
also another speculation that I have is

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.300 
also another speculation that I have is
