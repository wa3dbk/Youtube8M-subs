okay guys I'm gonna try and explain you
how<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:05.609> connect<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:07.820> receiver<00:00:08.820> turnigy

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
how to connect a receiver turnigy

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.759 
how to connect a receiver turnigy
receiver<00:00:10.019> control<00:00:10.469> switch<00:00:12.230> that<00:00:13.230> they<00:00:13.469> sell

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
receiver control switch that they sell

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.140 
receiver control switch that they sell
over<00:00:14.040> there<00:00:14.340> well<00:00:16.220> that's<00:00:17.220> quite<00:00:17.400> easy<00:00:17.580> but

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
over there well that's quite easy but

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.349 
over there well that's quite easy but
I've<00:00:19.050> noticed<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.680> some<00:00:20.070> people<00:00:20.100> have<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.910> lot

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
I've noticed that some people have a lot

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.359 
I've noticed that some people have a lot
of<00:00:21.420> trouble<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.230> they<00:00:24.619> well<00:00:25.619> having<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
of trouble and they well having the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.550 
of trouble and they well having the
common<00:00:26.730> ground<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.359> all<00:00:27.810> those<00:00:28.260> issues

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
common ground and all those issues

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.259 
common ground and all those issues
connecting<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.369> contract<00:00:29.880> I'm<00:00:30.029> going<00:00:30.150> to

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
connecting this contract I'm going to

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.200 
connecting this contract I'm going to
try<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.449> explain<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.990> guys<00:00:31.610> an<00:00:32.610> easy<00:00:32.880> way<00:00:33.180> to

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
try to explain you guys an easy way to

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.030 
try to explain you guys an easy way to
do<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.960> with<00:00:34.739> only<00:00:35.010> one<00:00:35.160> battery<00:00:36.920> you<00:00:37.920> know

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
do this with only one battery you know

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.580 
do this with only one battery you know
feeding<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.640> both<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.420> receiver<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:41.149> the

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
feeding the both the receiver and the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.150 
feeding the both the receiver and the
little<00:00:43.590> switch<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:45.230> this<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> good<00:00:46.980> way<00:00:47.100> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
little switch and this is a good way to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.930 
little switch and this is a good way to
make<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.460> remote<00:00:48.200> remote<00:00:49.200> glow<00:00:49.950> plug<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.789> your

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
make a remote remote glow plug for your

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.860 
make a remote remote glow plug for your
low<00:00:51.629> airplanes<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:53.340> here<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.610> goes

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
low airplanes so here it goes

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.020 
low airplanes so here it goes
so<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> simple<00:00:55.620> part<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:57.000> a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
so this is a simple part you have a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.260 
so this is a simple part you have a
battery<00:00:58.129> over<00:00:59.129> here<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.820> have<00:01:02.270> speed

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
battery over here you have speed

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.920 
battery over here you have speed
controllers<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.960> I'm<00:01:04.110> using<00:01:04.350> has<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.710> Dec<00:01:05.930> so

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
controllers that I'm using has a Dec so

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.500 
controllers that I'm using has a Dec so
the<00:01:07.260> energy<00:01:07.560> goes<00:01:07.770> around<00:01:08.040> here<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.939> be<00:01:09.119> this

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the energy goes around here to be this

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.250 
the energy goes around here to be this
these<00:01:09.840> wires<00:01:10.110> now<00:01:10.470> here<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:11.189> was<00:01:11.900> a<00:01:12.900> wide

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
these wires now here this was a wide

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.960 
these wires now here this was a wide
cable<00:01:13.920> then<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:15.479> normally<00:01:16.170> use<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.970> severals

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
cable then you normally use for severals

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.380 
cable then you normally use for severals
so<00:01:18.420> hidden<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.439> secret<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.979> right<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:20.520> this

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
so hidden the secret is right here this

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.789 
so hidden the secret is right here this
way<00:01:21.630> at<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.560> exit<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.400> five<00:01:23.820> bolts<00:01:24.150> here

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
way at the exit of the five bolts here

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.590 
way at the exit of the five bolts here
you're<00:01:25.799> using<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:27.330> same<00:01:27.600> ground<00:01:27.930> both<00:01:29.270> to<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
you're using the same ground both to a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.710 
you're using the same ground both to a
relay<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.530> five<00:01:32.070> volt<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.610> laid<00:01:32.850> that's<00:01:33.420> an

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
relay a five volt we laid that's an

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.830 
relay a five volt we laid that's an
example<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.850> hobbyking

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
example that you have on the hobbyking

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.260 
example that you have on the hobbyking
site<00:01:37.110> explained<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.189> explaining<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.090> how<00:01:39.119> to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
site explained you explaining you how to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300 
site explained you explaining you how to
do<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> remote<00:01:39.990> plug<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.770> 5<00:01:41.040> volt

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
do a remote plug this is a 5 volt

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.289 
do a remote plug this is a 5 volt
wheelie<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.390> 5<00:01:42.720> bolts<00:01:43.200> over<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:45.060> to

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
wheelie so 5 bolts over here and then to

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.569 
wheelie so 5 bolts over here and then to
the<00:01:45.420> other<00:01:45.450> side<00:01:45.720> five<00:01:46.439> bolts<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
the other side five bolts to the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.480 
the other side five bolts to the
receiver<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:49.560> you're<00:01:49.740> feeding<00:01:49.979> both<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
receiver so you're feeding both the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.649 
receiver so you're feeding both the
receiver<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.329> relay<00:01:51.950> with<00:01:52.950> 5<00:01:53.189> volts<00:01:53.659> at

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
receiver and the relay with 5 volts at

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.109 
receiver and the relay with 5 volts at
the<00:01:54.689> same<00:01:54.990> time<00:01:55.259> you're<00:01:55.649> sharing<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.820> ground

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
the same time you're sharing the ground

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.330 
the same time you're sharing the ground
between<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.560> battery<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.040> the<00:02:00.590> switch<00:02:01.590> so

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
between the battery and the switch so

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.490 
between the battery and the switch so
this<00:02:02.520> makes<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.969> work<00:02:03.180> sharing<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> grounds

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
this makes it work sharing the grounds

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.370 
this makes it work sharing the grounds
both<00:02:04.799> grams<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.939> sheet<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.479> black<00:02:07.079> wire

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
both grams the sheet this black wire

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.880 
both grams the sheet this black wire
over<00:02:07.799> here<00:02:08.330> this<00:02:09.330> black<00:02:09.660> wall<00:02:09.899> over<00:02:10.170> here

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
over here this black wall over here

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.380 
over here this black wall over here
is<00:02:12.390> it's<00:02:13.390> going<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.380> same<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:16.330> know

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
is it's going to the same you know

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.370 
is it's going to the same you know
source<00:02:16.810> has<00:02:17.520> this<00:02:18.520> like<00:02:19.240> why<00:02:19.570> over<00:02:19.990> here<00:02:20.200> the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
source has this like why over here the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.030 
source has this like why over here the
close<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.980> receiver<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:23.440> there<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.650> go

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
close to the receiver so there you go

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.620 
close to the receiver so there you go
this<00:02:24.310> makes<00:02:24.550> it<00:02:24.670> work<00:02:24.850> let's<00:02:25.210> see<00:02:25.330> if<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.480> can

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
this makes it work let's see if you can

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.949 
this makes it work let's see if you can
so<00:02:26.290> here's<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.650> radio<00:02:27.010> it's<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.959> conversion

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
so here's the radio it's a conversion

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.150 
so here's the radio it's a conversion
that<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.320> did<00:02:29.560> tape<00:02:30.340> on<00:02:30.520> for<00:02:30.820> so<00:02:31.980> here<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.040> go

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
that I did tape on for so here you go

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.920 
that I did tape on for so here you go
let's<00:02:33.370> see<00:02:33.520> if<00:02:33.580> you<00:02:33.700> can<00:02:33.850> hear<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.570> relay

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
let's see if you can hear the the relay

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
let's see if you can hear the the relay
worked<00:02:39.810> well<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:41.020> don't<00:02:41.320> know<00:02:41.380> if<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.590> can<00:02:41.770> hear

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
worked well I don't know if you can hear

ground connection so this is going to go

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.150 
ground connection so this is going to go
to<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.040> motor<00:03:15.280> these<00:03:15.790> two<00:03:16.890> was<00:03:17.890> set<00:03:18.130> up

2.5<00:03:23.250> mm<00:03:24.250> 500<00:03:24.459> milliamp<00:03:25.150> hour<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:26.650> this<00:03:26.799> is

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
2.5 mm 500 milliamp hour so this is

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.890 
2.5 mm 500 milliamp hour so this is
going<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.340> make<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.640> connection<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:28.600> the<00:03:28.720> glow
