00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.360 

the<00:00:03.180> program<00:00:03.810> mode<00:00:04.080> is<00:00:04.350> something<00:00:04.980> that<00:00:05.160> I

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
the program mode is something that I

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.760 
the program mode is something that I
like<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:06.060> use<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.270> lot<00:00:06.660> it's<00:00:07.110> pretty<00:00:07.440> much<00:00:07.590> what

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
like to use a lot it's pretty much what

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.360 
like to use a lot it's pretty much what
I<00:00:07.799> use<00:00:08.010> for<00:00:08.280> almost<00:00:08.520> every<00:00:09.240> picture<00:00:10.130> you<00:00:11.130> can

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
I use for almost every picture you can

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.900 
I use for almost every picture you can
just<00:00:11.670> turn<00:00:11.940> your<00:00:12.240> mode<00:00:12.540> dial<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:13.170> P<00:00:13.740> P<00:00:14.610> stands

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
just turn your mode dial to P P stands

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.210 
just turn your mode dial to P P stands
for<00:00:15.000> program<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:16.200> reason<00:00:16.529> why<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.680> like<00:00:16.980> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
for program the reason why I like the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.729 
for program the reason why I like the
program<00:00:17.520> mode<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.240> much<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.779> because<00:00:19.079> it<00:00:19.529> gives

00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:19.739 
program mode so much is because it gives

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.010 
program mode so much is because it gives
me<00:00:19.829> more<00:00:19.950> control<00:00:20.310> than<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.939> auto<00:00:21.119> mode<00:00:21.360> but

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
me more control than the auto mode but

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.710 
me more control than the auto mode but
it<00:00:22.259> seems<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.619> be<00:00:22.649> just<00:00:22.770> as<00:00:23.369> easy<00:00:23.579> to<00:00:23.700> use<00:00:23.880> what

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
it seems to be just as easy to use what

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.499 
it seems to be just as easy to use what
I<00:00:24.750> mean<00:00:24.989> by<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.649> I<00:00:26.099> have<00:00:26.610> control<00:00:27.029> over<00:00:27.210> my

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
I mean by that is I have control over my

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.830 
I mean by that is I have control over my
ISO<00:00:28.020> I<00:00:28.259> can<00:00:28.829> set<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.279> however<00:00:29.759> I<00:00:29.880> like<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.390> have

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
ISO I can set this however I like I have

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.049 
ISO I can set this however I like I have
control<00:00:30.960> over<00:00:31.410> my<00:00:31.559> exposure<00:00:32.099> compensation<00:00:32.369> I

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
control over my exposure compensation I

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.509 
control over my exposure compensation I
can<00:00:33.600> set<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.050> how<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.399> have

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
can set that how I like and I have

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.610 
can set that how I like and I have
control<00:00:35.850> over<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.570> white<00:00:36.929> balance<00:00:37.170> which<00:00:37.590> is

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
control over the white balance which is

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.279 
control over the white balance which is
very<00:00:38.010> very<00:00:38.219> important<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.870> getting<00:00:39.870> more

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
very very important to getting more

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.740 
very very important to getting more
accurate<00:00:40.469> colors<00:00:41.039> and<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.850> also<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.269> more

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
accurate colors and I also have more

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.310 
accurate colors and I also have more
control<00:00:42.809> over<00:00:43.410> my<00:00:43.949> flash<00:00:44.670> which<00:00:45.449> is<00:00:45.719> also<00:00:46.109> very

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
control over my flash which is also very

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.739 
control over my flash which is also very
very<00:00:46.710> nice<00:00:46.920> because<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.640> don't<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.329> using

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
very nice because I don't like using

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.259 
very nice because I don't like using
auto<00:00:48.929> flash<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.559> prefer<00:00:50.160> either<00:00:50.489> turning<00:00:51.089> the

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
auto flash I prefer either turning the

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.619 
auto flash I prefer either turning the
flash<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.749> or<00:00:52.140> off<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:53.820> auto<00:00:54.120> mode<00:00:54.420> will

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
flash on or off the auto mode will

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.410 
flash on or off the auto mode will
automate<00:00:55.050> everything<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.879> with<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.089> mode

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
automate everything and with this mode

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.590 
automate everything and with this mode
what<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.929> can<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.699> can<00:00:59.730> see<00:00:59.850> turn<00:01:00.390> my

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
what I can do is as you can see turn my

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.529 
what I can do is as you can see turn my
ISO<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.140> auto<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.519> will<00:01:02.730> automate<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
ISO to auto so this will automate the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.649 
ISO to auto so this will automate the
ISO<00:01:04.019> but<00:01:04.680> still<00:01:04.980> I<00:01:05.190> have<00:01:05.460> control<00:01:05.850> over<00:01:06.030> white

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
ISO but still I have control over white

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.410 
ISO but still I have control over white
balance<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.829> really<00:01:08.100> gives<00:01:08.310> me<00:01:08.579> total

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
balance so it really gives me total

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.080 
balance so it really gives me total
flexibility<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.369> what<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.399> want<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.759> control

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
flexibility of what I want to control

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.389 
flexibility of what I want to control
and<00:01:12.360> what<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.810> don't<00:01:13.079> want<00:01:13.259> to<00:01:13.320> control<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.890> can

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
and what I don't want to control I can

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.880 
and what I don't want to control I can
also<00:01:14.549> set<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.479> white<00:01:15.840> balance<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.380> automatic

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
also set the white balance to automatic

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.459 
also set the white balance to automatic
but<00:01:17.430> then<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.909> be<00:01:18.149> pretty<00:01:18.479> much<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:19.290> like

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:19.469 
but then it be pretty much just like

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.999 
but then it be pretty much just like
using<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.950> auto<00:01:20.250> mode<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:22.229> other<00:01:22.380> thing<00:01:22.649> with

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
using the auto mode the other thing with

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.490 
using the auto mode the other thing with
the<00:01:23.219> program<00:01:23.670> mode<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.869> can<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.320> my

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the program mode is that I can have my

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.260 
the program mode is that I can have my
focusing<00:01:26.009> square<00:01:26.340> right<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.000> center

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
focusing square right in the center

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.190 
focusing square right in the center
which<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:27.899> great<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.549> focus<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
which is great I can focus on the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.350 
which is great I can focus on the
subject<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.770> want<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.280> make<00:01:32.640> sure<00:01:32.700> is

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
subject that I want to make sure is

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.389 
subject that I want to make sure is
going<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.719> my<00:01:33.840> focus<00:01:34.170> point<00:01:34.280> press<00:01:35.280> the

is<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> very<00:01:47.670> very<00:01:47.909> versatile<00:01:48.719> mode<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.289> that's

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
is a very very versatile mode and that's

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.330 
is a very very versatile mode and that's
why<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.759> using<00:01:50.969> it<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.420> much<00:01:51.979> to<00:01:52.979> find<00:01:53.189> out
