so now the bread is going to absorb all
the<00:04:55.479> moisture<00:04:55.510> and<00:04:56.229> the<00:04:56.830> whole<00:04:57.039> mixture<00:04:57.639> is

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
the moisture and the whole mixture is

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.320 
the moisture and the whole mixture is
going<00:04:57.820> to<00:04:58.060> become<00:04:58.270> nice<00:04:58.720> and<00:04:59.110> thick<00:04:59.680> and<00:05:00.330> this

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
going to become nice and thick and this

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.200 
going to become nice and thick and this
point<00:05:01.600> of<00:05:01.660> time<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:02.110> also<00:05:02.470> will<00:05:02.770> add<00:05:02.889> 1/4<00:05:03.789> cup<00:05:03.880> of

powder whoa beautiful keep cooking until
the<00:05:23.740> whole<00:05:23.950> mixture<00:05:24.490> becomes<00:05:25.270> nice<00:05:25.810> and<00:05:25.840> thick

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
the whole mixture becomes nice and thick

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.060 
the whole mixture becomes nice and thick
and<00:05:26.740> the<00:05:27.280> bread<00:05:27.639> is<00:05:27.669> almost<00:05:28.510> masked<00:05:29.080> so<00:05:29.889> that's

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
and the bread is almost masked so that's

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.770 
and the bread is almost masked so that's
what<00:05:30.250> you<00:05:30.400> need<00:05:30.550> to<00:05:30.700> do<00:05:30.820> here<00:05:31.060> keep<00:05:31.450> cooking

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
what you need to do here keep cooking

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.450 
what you need to do here keep cooking
this<00:05:31.930> will<00:05:32.110> again<00:05:32.440> take<00:05:32.680> about<00:05:32.950> 5<00:05:33.430> minutes

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
this will again take about 5 minutes

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.940 
this will again take about 5 minutes
keep<00:05:34.419> stirring<00:05:34.479> at<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.169> same<00:05:35.349> time<00:05:35.620> because

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
keep stirring at the same time because

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.670 
keep stirring at the same time because
so<00:05:36.580> much<00:05:36.729> of<00:05:36.789> richness<00:05:37.360> that<00:05:37.780> was<00:05:37.930> Conan<00:05:38.349> the

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
so much of richness that was Conan the

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.550 
so much of richness that was Conan the
bread<00:05:38.919> will<00:05:39.160> absorb<00:05:40.090> everything<00:05:40.750> and<00:05:41.050> we'll

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
bread will absorb everything and we'll

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.650 
bread will absorb everything and we'll
also<00:05:41.710> get<00:05:42.010> masked<00:05:42.430> so<00:05:43.180> while<00:05:43.360> you<00:05:43.479> keep

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
also get masked so while you keep

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.100 
also get masked so while you keep
staring<00:05:43.990> that's<00:05:44.680> what<00:05:44.889> is<00:05:45.010> going<00:05:45.160> to<00:05:45.250> happen

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
staring that's what is going to happen

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.170 
staring that's what is going to happen
as<00:05:47.110> you<00:05:47.410> keep<00:05:47.680> stirring<00:05:48.010> you'll<00:05:48.700> see<00:05:48.910> that<00:05:49.060> the

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
as you keep stirring you'll see that the

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.260 
as you keep stirring you'll see that the
bread<00:05:49.419> pieces<00:05:49.690> get<00:05:50.530> completely<00:05:51.190> masked<00:05:51.490> some

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
bread pieces get completely masked some

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.629 
bread pieces get completely masked some
of<00:05:52.419> them<00:05:52.599> would<00:05:53.200> remain<00:05:53.410> whole<00:05:53.860> but<00:05:54.340> you<00:05:54.370> need

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 
of them would remain whole but you need

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.969 
of them would remain whole but you need
to<00:05:54.820> keep<00:05:55.000> stirring<00:05:55.330> so<00:05:55.719> that<00:05:56.289> the<00:05:56.740> bread

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
to keep stirring so that the bread

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.120 
to keep stirring so that the bread
absorbs<00:05:57.250> the<00:05:57.940> entire<00:05:58.330> moisture<00:05:58.990> and<00:05:59.200> the

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
absorbs the entire moisture and the

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.339 
absorbs the entire moisture and the
mixture<00:06:00.520> dries<00:06:00.700> up<00:06:01.060> after<00:06:01.810> a<00:06:01.840> point<00:06:02.080> of<00:06:02.169> time

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:02.349 
mixture dries up after a point of time

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:04.890 
mixture dries up after a point of time
you'll<00:06:02.710> see<00:06:02.890> that<00:06:03.490> the<00:06:03.729> whole<00:06:03.760> mixture<00:06:04.300> will

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
you'll see that the whole mixture will

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.290 
you'll see that the whole mixture will
start<00:06:05.289> oozing<00:06:05.680> out<00:06:05.979> oil<00:06:06.250> from<00:06:06.880> the<00:06:07.030> sides

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
start oozing out oil from the sides

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.930 
start oozing out oil from the sides
that's<00:06:08.110> when<00:06:08.320> you<00:06:08.440> know<00:06:08.620> that<00:06:08.830> oh<00:06:09.070> okay<00:06:09.789> the

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
that's when you know that oh okay the

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.180 
that's when you know that oh okay the
thickness<00:06:10.330> is<00:06:10.510> right<00:06:10.750> because<00:06:11.409> this<00:06:11.710> is<00:06:11.890> very

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
thickness is right because this is very

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.490 
thickness is right because this is very
very<00:06:12.460> hot<00:06:12.820> the<00:06:13.330> moment<00:06:13.630> it<00:06:13.750> becomes<00:06:13.990> little

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
very hot the moment it becomes little

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.159 
very hot the moment it becomes little
coal<00:06:14.770> will<00:06:15.640> become<00:06:15.849> nice<00:06:16.360> and<00:06:16.390> thick<00:06:16.990> and

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
coal will become nice and thick and

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.180 
coal will become nice and thick and
beautiful<00:06:18.010> so<00:06:18.880> this<00:06:19.150> is<00:06:19.360> what<00:06:20.289> it<00:06:20.440> is<00:06:20.620> at<00:06:20.860> this

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
beautiful so this is what it is at this

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.520 
beautiful so this is what it is at this
point<00:06:21.370> of<00:06:21.490> time<00:06:21.550> I<00:06:22.000> see<00:06:22.690> a<00:06:22.719> little<00:06:22.900> bit<00:06:23.050> of<00:06:23.110> oil

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
point of time I see a little bit of oil

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.310 
point of time I see a little bit of oil
coming<00:06:24.219> out<00:06:24.430> because<00:06:24.820> the<00:06:25.030> mixture<00:06:25.300> is<00:06:25.510> easily

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
coming out because the mixture is easily

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.380 
coming out because the mixture is easily
rotating<00:06:26.860> you<00:06:27.190> see<00:06:27.370> here<00:06:27.640> that's<00:06:28.090> what<00:06:28.270> you

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
rotating you see here that's what you

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.130 
rotating you see here that's what you
see<00:06:28.599> the<00:06:29.020> oil<00:06:29.370> absolutely<00:06:30.370> out<00:06:30.669> here<00:06:31.090> and<00:06:31.270> the

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
see the oil absolutely out here and the

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.170 
see the oil absolutely out here and the
whole<00:06:32.320> mixture<00:06:32.770> is<00:06:32.950> forming<00:06:33.610> into<00:06:33.760> a<00:06:33.880> lump

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
whole mixture is forming into a lump

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.980 
whole mixture is forming into a lump
before<00:06:34.599> it<00:06:34.750> becomes<00:06:35.050> very<00:06:35.890> very<00:06:36.250> hard<00:06:36.700> I<00:06:36.990> want

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
before it becomes very very hard I want

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.980 
before it becomes very very hard I want
it<00:06:38.200> nice<00:06:38.409> and<00:06:38.469> soft<00:06:38.979> I<00:06:39.190> don't<00:06:39.430> want<00:06:39.640> it<00:06:39.789> hard<00:06:40.030> so

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
it nice and soft I don't want it hard so

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:46.020 
it nice and soft I don't want it hard so
I<00:06:41.260> will<00:06:41.890> kind<00:06:42.159> of<00:06:42.310> close<00:06:42.729> this<00:06:43.030> up<00:06:43.090> and<00:06:44.969> take<00:06:45.969> it

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030 
I will kind of close this up and take it

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.850 
I will kind of close this up and take it
out<00:06:46.500> in<00:06:47.500> a<00:06:47.650> nice<00:06:47.890> bowl<00:06:48.820> that<00:06:49.599> I<00:06:49.659> have<00:06:49.990> no

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
out in a nice bowl that I have no

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.250 
out in a nice bowl that I have no
moisture<00:06:51.370> of<00:06:51.669> course<00:06:52.060> that's<00:06:52.360> important<00:06:52.870> no

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
moisture of course that's important no

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
moisture of course that's important no
moisture<00:06:53.800> in<00:06:53.950> here<00:06:54.120> only<00:06:55.120> bread<00:06:55.870> khalwa<00:06:56.620> there

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
moisture in here only bread khalwa there

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.339 
moisture in here only bread khalwa there
you<00:06:57.370> see<00:06:57.550> the<00:06:57.820> oil<00:06:58.000> starts<00:06:58.510> oozing<00:06:58.780> out<00:06:59.080> and

00:06:59.339 --> 00:06:59.349 
you see the oil starts oozing out and

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:02.730 
you see the oil starts oozing out and
that's<00:07:00.159> when<00:07:00.690> actually<00:07:01.690> it's<00:07:01.840> the<00:07:02.050> key<00:07:02.229> so
