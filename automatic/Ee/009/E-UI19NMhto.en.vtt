00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Come back, I'll put you down 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.790
 another skin of corsa quinn 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.170
 and as always comes to first line must 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.170
 and then I show you the top 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.970
 So that was once the moz and let's start 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.530
 with the donor hits with spreads further 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.280
 Here is the mark of 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:56.070
 the passive crew then we have the 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:56.070
 away the volt and of course the 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.230
 multicultural is crucial on the pda 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.220
 neatly packed as you can see 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.910
 I can show you the forests before unfortunately 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.890
 do not show 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.140
 but I can show the space so 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.970
 once sees the mouse then have too 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.560
 the e and last but not least multi and her 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.210
 Do you see that I'm nothing ? 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.229
 So everything has been done 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.000
 as before 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.060
 and that's because it is 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.619
 this is neither a skin for 750 riot 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.810
 Of course , I am sorry for points 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.190
 that kid is currently on pw like that 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.759
 is a bit packed but that is 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.720
 unfortunately, the pde and which form 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.530
 Of course it will be a bit too 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.400
 have changed but then there would have to 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.660
 just a little bit longer 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.119
 patience as I said it is 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.979
 here also around a 750 pons chin and 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.780
 accordingly, the 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.870
 change here only to the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.190
 outer and not on the space and yes 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.810
 I would say you write to me 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.040
 diligent comments on what you got from the skin 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.700
 just I have you now all skins 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.659
 presented by the pirates and writes 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.220
 Maybe it's my turn which one 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.560
 give you the best I like 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.040
 Personally for favorites with the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.900
 hand 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.330
 I think that's a lot of hopping 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.560
 Knorke and the look at me react 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.780
 I really like both skins 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.770
 personally and had indeed times what a 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.880
 I like you and then I would say 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.960
 I say goodbye to the recall 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.960
 unexpectedly at the service
