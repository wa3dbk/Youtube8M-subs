00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hi there, guys in touch vault boy I 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.819
 I missed you all so much 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.680
 I hope it is mutually first and foremost 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.510
 I would like to share the good news 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.550
 now all further videos will be 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.590
 go out with such a sound quality then 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.280
 have that bastards microphone with headphones 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.109
 steelseries 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.520
 after the interception of which my 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.740
 Ears always wanted to cry bloody 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.020
 tears finally sank into oblivion 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.650
 all he will be no more so hooray 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.600
 comrades 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.580
 finally it happened in this video 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.619
 it's about a few things and the first 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.240
 what i want to say is hardline 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.309
 Let's start with the fact that the game is at least 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.469
 met my best expectations by 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.270
 I'm not serious about her 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.660
 great on almost all fronts 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.610
 This is a very interesting and cool game and 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.070
 me as an infantry player very 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.899
 I liked her to play in more detail about 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.309
 hardline and why am i still his now 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.260
 so praise me absolutely by the way 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.090
 not peculiar i will tell in large 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.309
 review on this game that will do in 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.199
 near future and here as I understand it on 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.329
 faces of my audience froze emotion 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.550
 bewilderment why am I so praised 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.559
 hardline which came out a long time ago 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.930
 and did not make a single video on it 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.880
 The answer is actually very simple all things 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.130
 stupid in technical problems with 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.280
 computer fucking piece of iron to the left of 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.470
 me after 2014 nightmare me 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.049
 blue screens and it used to be 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.869
 generally fucking not clear day blue screen 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.850
 there is day blue screen no day blue 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.619
 screens and a half thousand pieces a day 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.509
 the computer is stable and very 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.369
 even well there were always different mistakes 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.680
 blue screens but one thing united them 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.200
 event log was written kernel 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.270
 power on this error I perelazil the whole 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.189
 I am already an expert on how to 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.259
 solve all sorts of different problems that 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.810
 causes kernel power but unfortunately 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.030
 my problem then I never decided and 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.909
 you know i just put my hands in 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.740
 day 5 6 blue screens is the norm i 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.450
 just with a stone bang 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.549
 after the arrival of the next blue screen 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.020
 Joy stretched to the reset button and 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.820
 I am doing my business further on 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.680
 computer understandably what up 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.600
 the next blue screen that is not 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.149
 very long well and understandably that 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.340
 every tale has an end my not 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.439
 exception I solved my problem but in 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.299
 something had still to sacrifice and 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.700
 since I still solved the problem 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.280
 I updated the version of bios reinstalled 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.260
 windows bought new sata cable and for 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.000
 hard drive terabyte and which 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.980
 By the way, relatively recently bought myself 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.260
 but the most significant than all the same 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.450
 I had to donate 2 gigabytes 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.760
 RAMs are simply gone 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.680
 in no minus thank God I don't burn them all 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.750
 the fact is that I had three slats 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.780
 RAM for two gigabytes 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.610
 one bar from kingston and 2 from where i'm 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.530
 I know yes it is a little foolish toe 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.380
 what the fuck how did it happen that 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.720
 four years this combination worked 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.050
 ok and just a trace as it began 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.819
 fights 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.130
 for all the blue screens succeeded 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.560
 remove only by attention 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.420
 2 gigabyte wai strips from kingston then 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.850
 have now i have four workers 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.130
 gigabyte of ram it is very 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.510
 little just extremely little and let's 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.489
 make a small lyrical digression 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.590
 so I told you one very 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.069
 interesting and instructive story so 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.380
 back in 2011 the young young Anton 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.569
 Dimitrov goes to the store and buys 4 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.650
 gigabytes that is two by two operational 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:15.290
 memory of the manufacturer in the morning with a frequency 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:19.079
 1333 megahertz for 197 hryvnia 4 gigabytes 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.900
 197 hryvnia and now in the yard in 2015 and 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.570
 we look at the prices of ram and 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.670
 see that all the same two gigabytes are all 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.959
 same frame all with the same clock 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.720
 1333 megahertz has a price tag 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.590
 almost five hundred hryvnia 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.269
 sorry sorry sorry what the hell yes 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.000
 my head does not fit to 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.500
 buy 4 gigabytes of the most ordinary 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.660
 RAM and do not need 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.730
 fork over almost a thousand ukrainian 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.380
 papers further I looked at the price tag 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.570
 more expensive component types 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.090
 motherboard video card processors and 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.280
 other iron junk and whit 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.870
 it was not really who you need to be now 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.820
 Ukraine to afford to upgrade 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.570
 computer to less modern 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.680
 states 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:07.769
 drug lord pimp killer deputies 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.930
 why am I the same there 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.359
 we finish about sad Kate 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.489
 No, we do not end what I am 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.320
 to the fact that due to incurred in the fight against 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.000
 blue screen loss completely 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.100
 good 2 gigabyte wai strips 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.350
 ram from kingston to game 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.360
 called battlefield heavy line in 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.729
 This moment I do not play because 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.710
 as it turned out hardline need those same 2 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.810
 gigabyte of ram which 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.539
 took out just like vodyara homeless on sober 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.400
 that is, generally fucked up as tidying up without 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.560
 This treasured plan is very hardline 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.810
 likes to frizz, okay, he would just free 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.880
 zil at random times but no 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.949
 so it would be too easy he freezes 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.840
 exactly at that moment when I meet with 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.940
 opponents enjoy this game 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.789
 well, just fucking and shouting 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.349
 I want neighbors appreciated the word I give and 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.630
 after they started ask me 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.580
 look in elevators I scored on hardline 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.229
 it is natural that for a while exactly 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.720
 the time that i will need in order 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.699
 to buy at least one more bar 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.990
 RAM for 2 gigabytes 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.910
 sooner or later it will happen anyway 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.910
 want with our country 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.530
 rather late okay with this end and 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.240
 Finally I will say that I have plans 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.250
 what videos should you expect in 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.470
 near future well first understandable 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.030
 the case is an opinion on hardline angle 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.710
 I'll tell you why this game is for me 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.840
 enjoyed it and why i recommend i 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.870
 absolutely everyone and not just those who love 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.669
 infantry mode well and the second video i don't 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.130
 I will now advertise what he will 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.260
 I will only say that the video will be atypical 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.659
 for my type of channel it will be by 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.300
 singleplayer games probably all the same 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:38.190
 and gram no game well and the theme is 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.740
 the video is still secret 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.690
 but on this at the moment thats me all 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.669
