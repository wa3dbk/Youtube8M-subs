00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 friends I have something for you here before us 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.210
 are the samsung galaxy a3 and the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.910
 galaxy a5 so the two smartphones the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.429
 new galaxy series with full uni was the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.740
 Housing currently available also so 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.150
 are available we want to continue in 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.970
 a direct benchmark comparison 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.250
 check each other and then look something 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.400
 For results comes out of me yet 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.740
 a very important note absolutely zero 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.660
 meaningfulness is said benchmark says 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.579
 really nothing about the everyday 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.010
 Operation does not say anything about how 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.170
 that's liquid or how great a device is 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.510
 but why do I do this 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.430
 quite simply benchmark many of you 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.180
 Just want to see it and you should 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.309
 to get 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.870
 as I said I think there not been the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.579
 still has to be said because 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.500
 that is also important for the people 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.180
 who have no idea about benchmarks 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.590
 or put a lot of emphasis on it 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.260
 let me tell you 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.719
 that is not so of course i have on 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.550
 both devices the same on both 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.379
 devices installed the same benchmarks 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.260
 also in the same version and that go 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.640
 Let's start through it one by one 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.860
 with the 3 d mark and that with the xtreme 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.040
 test and here we are to the following 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:19.770
 results came in 2678 at the a3 and 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.210
 2677 muffins continue with the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.409
 quadrant that changes and we have 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:31.680
 12,000 82 at the a3 and eleven in 1932 at the a5 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:36.930
 19 1730 in the antut benchmark gives it for 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.860
 the a3 21,000 175 for the a5 and then 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.100
 Of course we have that too 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:47.009
 velmore tested 1870 in the galaxy a3 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.320
 In 1973 it is here at the galaxy monkey 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.420
 you see in most results 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.189
 they are quite similar or in total 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.240
 summed up, we also come virtually 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.700
 on a draw 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.380
 but as I said if this with others 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.380
 Comparing a smartphone does not mean that 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.810
 that the galaxy is faster or slower 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.460
 is that really has nothing to do with it 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.890
 you have to do that in the everyday tests 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.569
 just compare yes that should be synonymous 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.760
 have been already that's my 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.050
 benchmark comparison of the samsung galaxy 3 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.310
 with the seed 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.670
 to the galaxy fit many thanks for your time 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.670
 take care
