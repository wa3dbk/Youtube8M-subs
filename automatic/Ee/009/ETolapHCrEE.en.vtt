00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.409 
this plastic this plastic piece up here
I<00:03:49.590> guess<00:03:49.979> what<00:03:50.159> the<00:03:50.220> guard<00:03:50.459> just<00:03:50.699> concerned

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
I guess what the guard just concerned

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.420 
I guess what the guard just concerned
out<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.599> door<00:03:51.780> but<00:03:52.769> it's<00:03:52.889> got<00:03:52.979> it's<00:03:53.280> got<00:03:53.400> a

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
out the door but it's got it's got a

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.860 
out the door but it's got it's got a
great<00:03:53.549> view<00:03:53.669> I<00:03:53.879> mean<00:03:54.090> this<00:03:54.150> is<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.419> sorting

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
great view I mean this is the sorting

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.699 
great view I mean this is the sorting
all<00:03:54.959> 420hc<00:03:55.819> so<00:03:56.819> it's<00:03:57.629> stainless<00:03:57.870> as<00:03:58.199> well<00:03:58.379> so

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
all 420hc so it's stainless as well so

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.879 
all 420hc so it's stainless as well so
if<00:03:58.949> you<00:03:59.129> wear<00:03:59.310> this<00:03:59.629> coating<00:04:00.629> out<00:04:00.900> overall

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
if you wear this coating out overall

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.860 
if you wear this coating out overall
great<00:04:02.040> night<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.639> know<00:04:02.760> did<00:04:03.060> pretty<00:04:03.209> well<00:04:03.299> the

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
great night you know did pretty well the

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.659 
great night you know did pretty well the
one<00:04:04.049> no<00:04:04.349> one<00:04:04.500> Christmas<00:04:04.889> in<00:04:05.010> my<00:04:05.099> half<00:04:05.280> of<00:04:05.459> it<00:04:05.579> is

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
one no one Christmas in my half of it is

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.520 
one no one Christmas in my half of it is
I'm<00:04:05.819> not<00:04:06.000> really<00:04:06.419> fond<00:04:06.810> of<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.989> serrations

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
I'm not really fond of the serrations

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.319 
I'm not really fond of the serrations
and<00:04:07.769> there's<00:04:08.189> no<00:04:08.370> options<00:04:08.909> at<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.180> give

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
and there's no options at to give

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.530 
and there's no options at to give
registrations<00:04:10.049> so<00:04:10.979> I<00:04:11.280> mean<00:04:11.970> serrations<00:04:12.449> are

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
registrations so I mean serrations are

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.580 
registrations so I mean serrations are
one<00:04:12.629> of<00:04:12.689> those<00:04:12.780> things<00:04:13.049> are<00:04:13.169> dinner<00:04:13.379> once
