00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
probably use for long-range compilations

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.850 
probably use for long-range compilations
if<00:01:17.670> he<00:01:17.759> wanted<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.330> then<00:01:19.020> he's<00:01:19.170> only<00:01:19.320> got<00:01:19.500> 45

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
if he wanted and then he's only got 45

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.710 
if he wanted and then he's only got 45
passing<00:01:20.460> his<00:01:20.729> short<00:01:21.090> passing<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.570> long

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
passing his short passing and long

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.399 
passing his short passing and long
passing<00:01:22.170> about<00:01:22.590> 57<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.580> 30<00:01:24.030> respectively<00:01:24.570> his

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
passing about 57 and 30 respectively his

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.859 
passing about 57 and 30 respectively his
crossing<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.070> only<00:01:26.220> 43<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.570> can't<00:01:27.780> really

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
crossing is only 43 so you can't really

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.920 
crossing is only 43 so you can't really
blame<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:29.220> sudden<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.240> can't<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.600> expect

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
blame a sudden you can't really expect

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.960 
blame a sudden you can't really expect
him<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.380> great<00:01:31.650> passing<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.189> guess<00:01:32.400> but

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
him to have great passing I guess but

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.609 
him to have great passing I guess but
he's<00:01:33.090> not<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.390> really<00:01:33.420> needed<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.259> passing

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
he's not it really needed for passing

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.580 
he's not it really needed for passing
because<00:01:34.920> he<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> striker<00:01:36.229> next<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.320> he's<00:01:37.350> got

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
because he is a striker next up he's got

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.679 
because he is a striker next up he's got
37<00:01:38.250> defending<00:01:38.670> that's<00:01:38.850> not<00:01:39.000> really<00:01:39.240> important

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
37 defending that's not really important

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.899 
37 defending that's not really important
now<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.680> interesting<00:01:40.710> you've<00:01:41.189> got<00:01:41.340> 73

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
now this is interesting you've got 73

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.730 
now this is interesting you've got 73
physical<00:01:42.420> stats<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.960> there's<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.170> very<00:01:43.409> good

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
physical stats and there's a very good

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.160 
physical stats and there's a very good
reason<00:01:44.130> why<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.670> seems<00:01:45.149> low<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.689> because<00:01:45.720> his

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
reason why this seems low is because his

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.310 
reason why this seems low is because his
stamina<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.649> only<00:01:46.890> 58<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:48.270> then<00:01:48.420> he's<00:01:48.869> 6<00:01:49.170> foot

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
stamina is only 58 but then he's 6 foot

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.249 
stamina is only 58 but then he's 6 foot
1<00:01:49.619> or<00:01:49.799> 6<00:01:50.009> foot<00:01:50.159> 2<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.369> think<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.790> if<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.869> list

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
1 or 6 foot 2 I think and if you list

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.990 
1 or 6 foot 2 I think and if you list
the<00:01:52.409> here<00:01:52.619> out<00:01:52.770> now<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.430> his<00:01:53.549> other<00:01:53.759> in

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
the here out now for his other in

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.510 
the here out now for his other in
gamestats<00:01:54.540> you'll<00:01:55.259> realize<00:01:55.680> how<00:01:55.890> incredible

say a new Emenike because

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.819 
say a new Emenike because
you<00:02:13.269> know<00:02:13.420> there's<00:02:13.689> a<00:02:13.750> huge<00:02:14.200> difference<00:02:14.470> in

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
you know there's a huge difference in

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.770 
you know there's a huge difference in
quality<00:02:14.950> between<00:02:15.250> them<00:02:15.760> but<00:02:16.209> he<00:02:16.360> looks<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.689> be

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
quality between them but he looks to be

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.960 
quality between them but he looks to be
a<00:02:16.810> really<00:02:17.200> good<00:02:17.290> player<00:02:17.560> regardless<00:02:17.769> the<00:02:18.670> only

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
a really good player regardless the only

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.789 
a really good player regardless the only
issues<00:02:19.269> I<00:02:19.390> have<00:02:19.569> with<00:02:19.599> him<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.049> his<00:02:20.290> 53

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
issues I have with him I his 53

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.339 
issues I have with him I his 53
positioning<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.579> his<00:02:21.730> 55<00:02:22.209> reactions<00:02:22.780> which

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
positioning and his 55 reactions which

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.869 
positioning and his 55 reactions which
makes<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.739> bit<00:02:23.860> more<00:02:23.980> difficult<00:02:24.159> so<00:02:24.459> I<00:02:24.700> would

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
makes it a bit more difficult so I would

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.190 
makes it a bit more difficult so I would
suggest<00:02:24.970> playing<00:02:25.390> him<00:02:25.569> at<00:02:25.750> centre-forward

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
suggest playing him at centre-forward

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.740 
suggest playing him at centre-forward
perhaps<00:02:27.180> because<00:02:28.180> i<00:02:28.239> think<00:02:28.299> that<00:02:28.450> would<00:02:28.599> walk

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
perhaps because i think that would walk

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.160 
perhaps because i think that would walk
a<00:02:28.780> bit<00:02:28.989> better<00:02:29.519> but<00:02:30.519> nevertheless<00:02:30.909> on<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:32.079> the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
a bit better but nevertheless on to the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.929 
a bit better but nevertheless on to the
most<00:02:32.379> interesting<00:02:33.040> part<00:02:33.310> about<00:02:33.400> this<00:02:33.700> guy

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939

he's got five star skills and that's

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.990 
he's got five star skills and that's
going<00:02:37.959> to<00:02:38.019> make<00:02:38.200> him<00:02:38.439> a<00:02:38.739> really<00:02:39.489> really

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
going to make him a really really

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.199 
going to make him a really really
overused<00:02:40.510> player<00:02:41.049> in<00:02:41.349> FIFA<00:02:41.859> 15<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.519> I<00:02:42.879> can't
