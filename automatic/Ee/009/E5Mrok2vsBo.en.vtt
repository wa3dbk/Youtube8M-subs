with water should be we have done
electronics<00:01:47.880> many<00:01:48.090> sensors<00:01:48.799> and<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.250> this

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
electronics many sensors and that this

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:51.859 
electronics many sensors and that this
is<00:01:50.549> baby<00:01:50.729> they're<00:01:50.969> the<00:01:51.149> biggest<00:01:51.420> difference

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
then of course the power away but the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.080 
then of course the power away but the
biggest<00:01:55.259> difference<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.740> try<00:01:56.429> to<00:01:56.490> understand
