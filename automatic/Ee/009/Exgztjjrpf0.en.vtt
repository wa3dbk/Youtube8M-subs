 Stowasser 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.580
 hammerhart 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.380
 totally different music buzzing exchange rates hairstyle thanks now there is other music 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.740
 from 2 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.150
 i could take authority of media and resume 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:23.650
 a radio on 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.939
 and we have come our way making music like that, and indeed with 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.800
 Plates that's interesting that was 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.239
 Occasion was the choice run though a bit slower under the wet 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.240
 Canal of the military moved with now just very slowly pushed up 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.900
 you can hear it 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.840
 the music fair is taking place and will continue to make a big gesture louder 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.860
 But food is also supposed to make a name for itself 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.860
 but then I seemed the rigorous one 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.280
 who is this 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.289
 which at 107 games now wants the question now but here in the third 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.300
 Winter looks with BW in the middle 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.300
 for the food that is at the mixing desk of Deejay 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.040
 BOM can turn the boxes to the left and right so the audience can 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.040
 is always more optimal 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.930
 So far, in Bamian were considered safe and must generate there 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.830
 can or 3 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.900
 and between the turntables quickly one and Herscheid this 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.500
 can and the music of both plates counters 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.490
 together to the next 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.490
 this one is not the same anymore 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.560
 if you are really right here but the movie will be very very 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.560
 is low 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.640
 So with this chance every single one 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.070
 was completely satisfied 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.040
 you can do that 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.530
 from one turntable to another failed yet wish 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.819
 before they want to have their 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.299
 we tried abroad 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.220
 So Park Joo Ho 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.829
 in the choice of funds at 10 o'clock 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.759
 "If I'm a little longer now 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.089
 shifting to one side for me it was always important for me him on the 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:17.909
 other side 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.609
 if only I have the music from the second record 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.299
 Now he wants the members 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.399
 the two together 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:25.989
 were on this day 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.009
 location 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:28.749
 but now it's your turn 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.889
 because now really something extra for us 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:32.809
 you have to say 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:37.059
 Ramallah visit the one at the turntables especially for us the whole 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:38.539
 special performance 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.939
 now it is wrong 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.939
 Celal Yesil 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.079
 it is true 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.070
 everyone clean so what and what if he is there 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.640
 then I lost was actually just a pretext one in Ireland itself 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.819
 What is the current value of the collected so far 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.599
 GM itself wave 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:00.959
 Germany has one 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:01.959
 8 and 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.379
 Austria leads Melzer 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.399
 if we all 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:12.640
 and now the best made the really good German market 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.870
