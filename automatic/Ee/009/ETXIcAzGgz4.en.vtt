00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 a scenario worthy of the most realistic 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.029
 post apocalyptic novel what it is 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.280
 presents today before the eyes of 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.099
 people passing by 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.080
 parts of the waterfront of siderno the tract 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.519
 coastal until some time ago one of the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.980
 most beautiful and popular and the coast 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.539
 Ionic in the province of Reggio is now 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.580
 reduced to a pile of rubble 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.680
 similar to other areas of the same 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.840
 band destroyed by bad weather e 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.680
 especially from the appalling momentum of the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.840
 waves 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.670
 incredulous citizens stationed of 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.949
 facing their long sea for now 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.260
 disappeared part submerged by water 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.540
 reduced avo rays while conditions 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.610
 of the sea do not hint at improving 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.960
 and to think that just a few days ago 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.610
 in a promoted conference 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.890
 right from the province of reggio 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.930
 Calabria on the theme of coastal erosion 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.200
 the interested entrepreneurs had 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.940
 raised the alarm but the storm surge 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.840
 later occurred just a few 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.910
 now later 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.680
 here they are again dealing with the count 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.510
 of damage while with barriers 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.940
 suffused that we have been waiting for years now 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.140
 have commented bitterly on all this 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.809
 it wouldn't have happened 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.600
 and since 2008 that history repeats itself 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.760
 with the same script but the cna warns 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.320
 the waiting time is over 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.540
 quick decisions are needed 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.979
 concrete we can't wait for 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.009
 new storms make further 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.390
 damage in addition to the structures 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.799
 to the Calabrian economy to workers 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.390
 to families 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.950
 and it was the entrepreneurs of 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.810
 Sider together with their families a 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.530
 spend the night trying to put 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.119
 insecurity 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.430
 what was left of theirs 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.369
 structures while the union is in 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.110
 then occupied with the damage count 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.970
 therefore he again commented on the cna 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.159
 we ask all municipalities aloud 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.320
 coastal the immediate convocation of 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.540
 municipal councils to deliberate the state 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.860
 of natural disaster to send 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.049
 immediately to the Calabria region 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.290
 civil protection sector from the council 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.290
 of ministers 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.720
 yesterday still held good law is fine 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.940
 the whole wall barrier with 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.530
 tonight at half past four and then 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.020
 began to give up all the way 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.300
 where all this stranger is 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.479
 sees around from half past four and then 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.509
 at six already there were already areas that were 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.120
 already deep you as you see them 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.360
 they have huge and the first storm of 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.000
 commissioner with all the technical staff 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:22.590
 they will be activated to ask for it 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.840
 state of calamity with various relationships e 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.390
 even a little bit of counting now is 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.209
 something monstrous all over the waterfront 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.370
 they are the central part of where it is 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.950
 Libyan and the cremino still does not have 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.530
 touched a lot but to the north and south and right 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.209
 as you see it, class has gone 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.640
 we are at 50 percent of the asphalt in 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.519
 we are in touch with certain forms of commissioners 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.370
 every 10 minutes there is the peter commissioner 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.560
 altar with and hack everyone every 10 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.940
 minutes which together with all the managers 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.950
 each in ten minutes 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.170
 what happens we are seeing on sky 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.660
 we are seeing will most likely be 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.510
 they told me that tomorrow will be 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.360
 with scopelliti and raffa to see that 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.730
 who have to do what they can do 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.820
 let's see what we can do for 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.310
 summer was scarce 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.890
 tourists can now that it is the only one 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.990
 what we could offer in the sea like 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.560
 is content that as if the prospect is the 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.560
 situation
