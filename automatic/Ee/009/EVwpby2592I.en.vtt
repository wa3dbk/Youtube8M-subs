but<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> process<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.720> being<00:01:18.900> seeker

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
but in the process of being seeker

but in the process of being seeker
friendly<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:20.070> became<00:01:20.430> sort<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.000> user

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
friendly we became sort of user

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.649 
friendly we became sort of user
unfriendly<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:23.280> ones<00:01:23.520> who<00:01:23.850> are<00:01:24.000> coming<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
ones who needed to grow we never really

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.450 
ones who needed to grow we never really
saw<00:01:27.240> them<00:01:27.479> grow<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.500> depth<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.220> was

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
saw them grow the depth of it was

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.149 
saw them grow the depth of it was
sacrificed<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:31.020> church<00:01:31.320> then<00:01:31.740> sort<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
sacrificed and the church then sort of

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.760 
sacrificed and the church then sort of
became<00:01:32.610> almost<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.240> kind<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.810> rally<00:01:34.079> spot

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
became almost a kind of a rally spot

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.520 
became almost a kind of a rally spot
rather<00:01:35.670> than<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.150> place<00:01:36.390> for<00:01:36.750> people<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.320> grow

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
rather than a place for people to grow

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.929 
rather than a place for people to grow
so<00:01:37.799> those<00:01:38.040> mistakes

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
so those mistakes

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.270 
so those mistakes
I<00:01:38.970> think<00:01:39.780> we've<00:01:39.960> reaped<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.409> consequences<00:01:41.250> of

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
I think we've reaped the consequences of

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.149 
I think we've reaped the consequences of
already<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:42.810> what<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.290> doing<00:01:43.470> right<00:01:43.890> I

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
already but what is it doing right I

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.240 
already but what is it doing right I
think<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> church<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:45.000> resilient<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:46.290> bounces

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
think the church is resilient it bounces

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.899 
think the church is resilient it bounces
back

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
back

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.929 
back
it<00:01:48.210> has<00:01:48.570> new<00:01:48.960> voices<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.860> come<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
it has new voices that come and the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.420 
it has new voices that come and the
young<00:01:51.240> people<00:01:51.689> will<00:01:52.020> ever<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.710> sense

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
young people will ever in that sense

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.719 
young people will ever in that sense
bring<00:01:53.970> vibrancy<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:54.960> life<00:01:55.049> back<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:56.430> give

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
bring vibrancy and life back you give

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.789 
bring vibrancy and life back you give
them<00:01:56.939> something<00:01:57.479> solid<00:01:57.780> for<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.170> mind<00:01:58.469> and

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
them something solid for the mind and

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.649 
them something solid for the mind and
they'll<00:01:59.009> be<00:01:59.219> there<00:01:59.460> if<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.939> don't<00:02:00.270> they<00:02:00.509> will

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
they'll be there if you don't they will

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.719 
they'll be there if you don't they will
call<00:02:00.899> your<00:02:01.079> bluff<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.009> think<00:02:02.490> what's

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729

happened is the use of music the use of

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.089 
happened is the use of music the use of
the<00:02:05.340> visual<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.890> opportunity<00:02:07.890> to

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
the visual and the opportunity to

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.639 
the visual and the opportunity to
communicate<00:02:08.520> with<00:02:08.970> them<00:02:09.239> through<00:02:09.660> the

relationship<00:02:16.830> strength<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.360> West

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
relationship strength so in the West

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.740 
relationship strength so in the West
there's<00:02:19.260> one<00:02:19.440> other<00:02:19.590> thing<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:20.010> would<00:02:20.069> say<00:02:20.750> we

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
there's one other thing I would say we

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.740 
there's one other thing I would say we
have<00:02:21.959> not<00:02:22.200> realized<00:02:22.769> what<00:02:23.670> pluralism<00:02:24.300> means

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
have not realized what pluralism means

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.460
