it line with the handle it will be
probably<00:02:30.480> somewhere<00:02:31.480> around<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.780> finger

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
probably somewhere around the finger

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
as nice as the Spartans but it is a nice

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.209 
as nice as the Spartans but it is a nice
knife<00:03:01.389> I<00:03:01.569> think<00:03:01.840> I<00:03:02.019> don't<00:03:02.799> know<00:03:02.889> let<00:03:03.069> me<00:03:03.099> know

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:03.219 
knife I think I don't know let me know

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.789 
knife I think I don't know let me know
what<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.609> think<00:03:03.849> it's<00:03:04.719> a<00:03:04.840> tiniest<00:03:05.439> little

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
what you think it's a tiniest little

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.740 
what you think it's a tiniest little
drop<00:03:06.069> here<00:03:06.099> just<00:03:06.699> to<00:03:06.849> make<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.209> tip<00:03:07.449> little

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
drop here just to make the tip little

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.449 
drop here just to make the tip little
stronger<00:03:08.169> not<00:03:08.349> so<00:03:08.560> weak<00:03:08.829> because<00:03:09.159> it<00:03:09.310> was

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
stronger not so weak because it was

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.619 
stronger not so weak because it was
going<00:03:09.730> straight<00:03:10.769> but<00:03:11.769> overall<00:03:12.219> nice<00:03:12.639> sleek

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
going straight but overall nice sleek

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.409 
going straight but overall nice sleek
design<00:03:14.049> I<00:03:14.079> think<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:15.819> funny<00:03:16.060> thing<00:03:16.269> is<00:03:16.299> that

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:16.419 
design I think the funny thing is that

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:18.719 
design I think the funny thing is that
this<00:03:16.719> looks<00:03:17.019> like<00:03:17.229> some<00:03:17.530> big<00:03:17.829> big<00:03:18.069> grind<00:03:18.430> mugs

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:18.729 
this looks like some big big grind mugs

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.580 
this looks like some big big grind mugs
but<00:03:19.000> these<00:03:19.180> are<00:03:19.329> actually<00:03:19.629> so<00:03:19.959> fine<00:03:20.319> that<00:03:20.349> you

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
but these are actually so fine that you

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.259 
but these are actually so fine that you
can<00:03:20.769> barely<00:03:20.979> feel<00:03:21.370> them<00:03:21.519> with<00:03:21.699> your<00:03:21.849> with<00:03:22.239> your

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
can barely feel them with your with your

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.929 
can barely feel them with your with your
nail<00:03:22.689> and<00:03:23.439> then<00:03:23.650> why<00:03:23.889> it<00:03:23.949> does<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.459> notice<00:03:24.819> it

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:24.939 
nail and then why it does it I notice it

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:26.789 
nail and then why it does it I notice it
even<00:03:25.209> last<00:03:25.419> time<00:03:25.720> on<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:25.900> first<00:03:26.259> three<00:03:26.620> we

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
even last time on the first three we

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.819 
even last time on the first three we
still<00:03:27.040> knife<00:03:27.310> i<00:03:27.459> made<00:03:27.699> it<00:03:28.419> had<00:03:28.629> these<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.229> they

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
still knife i made it had these and they

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.580 
still knife i made it had these and they
actually<00:03:29.979> like<00:03:30.430> black<00:03:30.939> lines<00:03:31.290> those<00:03:32.290> lines

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
actually like black lines those lines

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.289 
actually like black lines those lines
are<00:03:32.799> black<00:03:33.159> i<00:03:33.340> think<00:03:33.579> it's<00:03:33.699> that<00:03:33.759> oxidation

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
are black i think it's that oxidation

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.009 
are black i think it's that oxidation
patina<00:03:34.959> that<00:03:35.639> form<00:03:36.639> as<00:03:36.909> I<00:03:37.000> was<00:03:37.150> as<00:03:37.359> I<00:03:37.479> grounded

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
patina that form as I was as I grounded

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.979 
patina that form as I was as I grounded
because<00:03:39.009> it's<00:03:39.340> it's<00:03:39.579> not<00:03:39.790> rust<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.509> it's<00:03:40.720> not

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
because it's it's not rust and it's not

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.259 
because it's it's not rust and it's not
it's<00:03:41.319> not<00:03:41.439> actually<00:03:42.040> physical<00:03:42.639> grind<00:03:42.909> marks

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
it's not actually physical grind marks

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.110 
it's not actually physical grind marks
it's<00:03:43.959> just<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.769> guess<00:03:45.069> its<00:03:45.250> patina<00:03:45.609> I<00:03:45.849> don't

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
it's just I guess its patina I don't

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.899 
it's just I guess its patina I don't
know<00:03:46.239> how<00:03:47.139> the<00:03:47.650> camera<00:03:48.159> will<00:03:48.310> pick<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:48.549> up<00:03:48.759> but

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
know how the camera will pick it up but

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.839 
know how the camera will pick it up but
it's<00:03:49.090> actually<00:03:49.209> black<00:03:49.900> lines<00:03:50.669> you<00:03:51.669> know<00:03:51.699> if

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
it's actually black lines you know if

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:53.610 
it's actually black lines you know if
you<00:03:51.970> can<00:03:52.150> see<00:03:52.389> it<00:03:52.419> and<00:03:52.569> if<00:03:52.750> you<00:03:52.900> can<00:03:53.079> make<00:03:53.349> it<00:03:53.379> up

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
you can see it and if you can make it up

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.699 
you can see it and if you can make it up
today<00:03:53.799> it's<00:03:54.009> actually<00:03:54.370> black<00:03:54.639> I<00:03:54.790> think<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.150> can

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
today it's actually black I think it can

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.860 
today it's actually black I think it can
it's<00:03:56.709> very<00:03:56.949> interesting<00:03:57.549> it<00:03:57.849> looks<00:03:58.449> pretty

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:01.689 
cool but at the same time it makes it

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:03.420 
cool but at the same time it makes it
look<00:04:01.840> like<00:04:02.109> that<00:04:02.349> horrible<00:04:02.799> horrible<00:04:03.009> grin
