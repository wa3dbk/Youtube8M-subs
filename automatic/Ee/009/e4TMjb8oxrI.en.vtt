00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.200
 Osaka Gas Industry Co., Ltd. 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.480
 In 1959 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.699
 Tempered glass manufacturing company 

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:13.129
 If you lose, start running as a country 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:15.129
 Hi there 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.939
 As a tempered glass processing plant 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.199
 By unique reinforcement to customer needs 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.539
 We have been manufacturing tempered glass 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.479
 Print again 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:33.739
 We also work on the development of cornea-like technology as a gold-broker 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.790
 To always provide our customers with high quality and reliable products 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.290
 Under the cooperation of employees 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.290
 We are making company-wide efforts 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.100
 The district has turned around recently to meet the diverse needs of our customers 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.130
 We have realized assortment of each state Dallas 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.980
 Use of tempered glass is alive and well 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.330
 Eiji Ebi 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.390
 Child's vision 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.570
 Consumer electronics store 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.140
 Industrial use etc 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.490
 Cross over 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.979
 It is used in our familiar place 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.970
 Tempered glass is heat-treated by ordinary plate glass 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.740
 Approximately three to four times the strength 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.870
 And 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.830
 You can increase the heat resistance and barrier of the yaku song 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.140
 that is 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.220
 We introduce the manufacturing process of tempered glass 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.550
 Cut the glass properly but get a little more attention 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.899
 Will be bentley as 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.669
 After cleaning the glass to determine if there is a defect such as scratches 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.669
 I will inspect 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:25.529
 If new technology is needed, strengthen the glass surface before contributing 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:30.579
 Make calculations, strengthen and contribute to the dangers around you 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:40.480
 In the evaluation process, the glass is heated to nearly 600,700 Â° C. 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.689
 Blow air on the surface 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:48.439
 Heat treatment process that will be generated by relaying in the near future 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:54.739
 Once the 6at is formed on tempered glass, a city is formed and its correlation 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.009
 Amplifies the strength and safety of glass 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:03.209
 The tempered glass produced in this way is 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.680
 Even if an accident occurs every day, it is not evaluated in the glass 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.999
 You can cite the feature of higher safety than that 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.599
 Tempered glass top unrated glass breakage 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.319
 The way of breaking the glass is greatly different since it is strengthened 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.599
 It is called 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.510
 It becomes a circle country person with fragment as it is Kikuki 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.729
 While there is a fear of scale 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:37.479
 Damaged condition of tempered glass is entrance because it is damaged 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:41.429
 Even if it does, the possibility of hurting the human body is reduced 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:50.969
 Osaka Gas Industry Co., Ltd. continues to be a pioneer in the industry 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:52.689
 We have announced 4 products 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.229
 Delivering peace of mind to customers
