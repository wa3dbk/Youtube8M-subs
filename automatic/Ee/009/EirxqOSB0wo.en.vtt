00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.470
 as the first step they want to apply 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:26.680
 this type base and the stand or on 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:29.290
 all long look a little yes 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.520
 dry and apply this polish 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:36.420
 here ps very very nice this red 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.420
 very Christmas 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:18.200
 I also do a second pass of 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:21.050
 this glaze and then I wait for it 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.850
 dry to dry before the 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.830
 I use this essence equation 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.780
 by now you will know them all 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.320
 just a few drops are applied 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.830
 on the nail in a minute the enamel yes 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.830
 dry 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.470
 let it dry well after as a 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.030
 clean cotton fish we go to 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.030
 remove the oily excess 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:02.230
 and here it is of molds vds now I will go 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:05.700
 to use the one there in a bow then here 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.500
 there is the palettina and our tripi 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.570
 sorry stamp I'm going to take this 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.440
 overhang then be done on purpose for 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:17.170
 nail art stam ping but just one 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.530
 any smart that is very dense 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.500
 very covering I go and get it 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.170
 to be applied on the bow with the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.300
 stick very quickly 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:34.420
 I'm going to pull away the excess enamel 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:38.160
 first my stencil and how you can 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.720
 see you move everything on the stamp 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.020
 in this case you have to be a lot 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.770
 fast take the brino team has passed 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.959
 up long and move forward 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.400
 back forward back to 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.470
 apply the product well and behold 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.540
 here our stencil 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.220
 but later it will be a little bit of a top coat 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.340
 it shines on me to merge mine 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.320
 then draw for a long time then 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.239
 really a lot of song though 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.330
 you often have your hands in used water 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.000
 it's a coach point this is the nail air 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.010
 Christmas art with these bows 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.430
 Christmas I hope I enjoyed the 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.430
 world a bar
