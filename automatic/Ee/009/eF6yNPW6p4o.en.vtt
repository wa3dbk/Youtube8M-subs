what's<00:00:12.700> up<00:00:12.820> guys<00:00:13.000> setup<00:00:13.660> and<00:00:13.960> a<00:00:13.990> hot<00:00:14.260> lap<00:00:14.410> time

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.620 
what's up guys setup and a hot lap time

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.440 
what's up guys setup and a hot lap time
again<00:00:14.890> it's<00:00:15.220> the<00:00:15.790> Spanish<00:00:16.059> Grand<00:00:16.270> Prix

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
again it's the Spanish Grand Prix

again it's the Spanish Grand Prix
Catalunya<00:00:17.350> is<00:00:17.470> where<00:00:17.590> we're<00:00:17.710> at<00:00:17.830> today<00:00:17.980> and

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
Catalunya is where we're at today and

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.530 
Catalunya is where we're at today and
we're<00:00:18.640> gonna<00:00:18.730> be<00:00:18.880> looking<00:00:18.970> at<00:00:19.180> this<00:00:19.360> setup

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:19.540 
we're gonna be looking at this setup

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.300 
we're gonna be looking at this setup
first<00:00:19.900> before<00:00:20.080> heading<00:00:20.830> out<00:00:20.920> onto<00:00:21.040> the<00:00:21.190> track

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
first before heading out onto the track

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.250 
first before heading out onto the track
to<00:00:21.520> see<00:00:21.700> what<00:00:21.940> the<00:00:22.090> setup<00:00:22.300> can<00:00:22.720> produce<00:00:23.020> in

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
to see what the setup can produce in

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.350 
to see what the setup can produce in
terms<00:00:23.380> of<00:00:23.529> a<00:00:23.560> lap<00:00:23.680> time<00:00:23.890> so<00:00:24.520> let's<00:00:24.970> get<00:00:25.180> the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
terms of a lap time so let's get the

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.840 
terms of a lap time so let's get the
tablet<00:00:25.720> in<00:00:25.869> our<00:00:26.050> hands<00:00:26.410> Thank<00:00:27.189> You<00:00:27.279> Geoffrey

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
tablet in our hands Thank You Geoffrey

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.720 
tablet in our hands Thank You Geoffrey
and<00:00:28.000> we<00:00:28.480> were<00:00:28.600> all<00:00:28.780> load<00:00:29.020> that<00:00:29.560> setup<00:00:30.010> up<00:00:30.340> so

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
and we were all load that setup up so

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.640 
and we were all load that setup up so
we're<00:00:30.850> looking<00:00:31.060> at<00:00:31.180> Circuit<00:00:31.990> de<00:00:32.169> Barcelona

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
we're looking at Circuit de Barcelona

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.650 
we're looking at Circuit de Barcelona
Catalunya<00:00:33.550> there<00:00:34.239> we<00:00:34.330> go

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
Catalunya there we go

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.180 
Catalunya there we go
loaded<00:00:35.050> in<00:00:35.170> there<00:00:35.410> and<00:00:35.620> this<00:00:35.890> is<00:00:35.950> what<00:00:36.070> we've

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
loaded in there and this is what we've

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.150 
loaded in there and this is what we've
got<00:00:36.400> so<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:37.300> first<00:00:37.540> time<00:00:37.809> in<00:00:38.140> the<00:00:38.320> sorry<00:00:38.949> that

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
got so the first time in the sorry that

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.010 
got so the first time in the sorry that
the<00:00:39.580> hot<00:00:39.730> lap<00:00:39.850> and<00:00:39.970> setup<00:00:40.239> guides<00:00:40.449> we're

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
the hot lap and setup guides we're

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.390 
the hot lap and setup guides we're
looking<00:00:41.199> at<00:00:41.320> different<00:00:41.470> aerodynamics<00:00:42.190> rather

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
looking at different aerodynamics rather

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.160 
looking at different aerodynamics rather
than<00:00:42.520> one<00:00:42.760> one<00:00:42.970> we're<00:00:43.120> going<00:00:43.239> 3-1<00:00:43.600> this<00:00:43.960> time

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
than one one we're going 3-1 this time

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.869 
than one one we're going 3-1 this time
and<00:00:44.530> that's<00:00:44.830> basically<00:00:45.100> it's<00:00:45.280> over<00:00:45.580> you<00:00:45.760> know

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
and that's basically it's over you know

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.189 
and that's basically it's over you know
because<00:00:46.059> there's<00:00:46.210> our<00:00:46.300> more<00:00:46.449> high<00:00:46.870> downforce

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
because there's our more high downforce

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.020 
because there's our more high downforce
tracks<00:00:47.860> or<00:00:48.040> lots<00:00:48.280> of<00:00:48.339> medium<00:00:48.730> to<00:00:48.820> high<00:00:48.970> speed

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
tracks or lots of medium to high speed

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.180 
tracks or lots of medium to high speed
corners<00:00:49.690> we're<00:00:50.379> wanting<00:00:50.739> to<00:00:50.830> make<00:00:50.949> sure<00:00:50.979> that

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
corners we're wanting to make sure that

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.469 
corners we're wanting to make sure that
we<00:00:51.280> carry<00:00:51.519> good<00:00:51.760> speed<00:00:52.059> through<00:00:52.330> those

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.479 
we carry good speed through those

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:54.030 
we carry good speed through those
corners<00:00:52.930> as<00:00:53.140> that's<00:00:53.379> gonna<00:00:53.500> you<00:00:53.650> know<00:00:53.739> help<00:00:53.890> us

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
corners as that's gonna you know help us

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.890 
corners as that's gonna you know help us
help<00:00:54.699> propel<00:00:55.000> us<00:00:55.089> down<00:00:55.269> the<00:00:55.390> next<00:00:55.629> straight

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
help propel us down the next straight

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.660 
help propel us down the next straight
that<00:00:56.409> follows<00:00:56.710> this<00:00:56.860> track<00:00:57.159> does<00:00:57.309> have<00:00:57.460> a<00:00:57.489> lot

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
that follows this track does have a lot

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.860 
that follows this track does have a lot
of<00:00:57.699> a<00:00:57.909> you<00:00:58.180> know<00:00:58.269> sort<00:00:58.420> of<00:00:58.479> media<00:00:58.690> device

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
of a you know sort of media device

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.420 
of a you know sort of media device
because<00:00:59.260> I<00:00:59.290> followed<00:00:59.739> by<00:00:59.860> medium<00:01:00.280> length

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
because I followed by medium length

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.310 
because I followed by medium length
straight<00:01:00.820> so<00:01:01.000> we<00:01:01.059> need<00:01:01.210> to<00:01:01.269> be<00:01:01.360> carrying<00:01:01.750> good

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
straight so we need to be carrying good

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.799 
straight so we need to be carrying good
cornering<00:01:03.250> speed<00:01:03.519> to<00:01:03.640> make<00:01:03.760> sure<00:01:03.970> we're<00:01:04.600> going

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
cornering speed to make sure we're going

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.560 
cornering speed to make sure we're going
super<00:01:05.379> fast<00:01:05.409> down<00:01:05.799> the<00:01:05.920> straight

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
super fast down the straight

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.789 
super fast down the straight

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.209 
half way between the two sayings again
that's<00:01:17.289> going<00:01:17.409> to<00:01:17.469> be<00:01:17.530> full<00:01:17.799> because<00:01:17.890> it's<00:01:18.100> a

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
that's going to be full because it's a

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.580 
that's going to be full because it's a
high<00:01:18.729> speed<00:01:19.090> track<00:01:19.539> as<00:01:19.930> of<00:01:20.140> medium<00:01:20.439> to<00:01:20.530> high

speed<00:01:20.860> corners<00:01:21.250> we're<00:01:21.850> looking<00:01:22.090> at<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.590> sort

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
speed corners we're looking at the sort

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.810 
speed corners we're looking at the sort
of<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:23.740> over<00:01:24.070> students<00:01:24.340> like<00:01:24.520> that<00:01:24.640> aren't

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
of the over students like that aren't

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.219 
of the over students like that aren't
going<00:01:24.909> to<00:01:24.969> be<00:01:25.030> too<00:01:25.210> much<00:01:25.390> for<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.630> problem<00:01:25.869> so

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
going to be too much for a problem so

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.630 
going to be too much for a problem so
that's<00:01:26.409> more<00:01:26.560> of<00:01:26.680> an<00:01:27.009> issue<00:01:27.130> on<00:01:27.399> low<00:01:27.579> speed

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
that's more of an issue on low speed

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.490 
that's more of an issue on low speed
corners<00:01:27.909> so<00:01:28.359> we<00:01:28.479> can<00:01:28.630> try<00:01:29.079> to<00:01:29.140> balance<00:01:29.320> that

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
corners so we can try to balance that

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.219 
corners so we can try to balance that
out<00:01:29.619> by<00:01:30.340> going<00:01:30.490> less<00:01:30.789> on<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.329> adjustment<00:01:32.079> on

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
out by going less on the adjustment on

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.560 
out by going less on the adjustment on
throttle<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:33.070> then<00:01:33.579> so<00:01:33.759> that<00:01:34.000> your<00:01:34.149> throttle

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
throttle and then so that your throttle

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.770 
throttle and then so that your throttle
again<00:01:35.469> we've<00:01:35.950> got<00:01:35.979> a<00:01:36.430> thought<00:01:37.210> of<00:01:37.329> locking<00:01:37.600> can

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
again we've got a thought of locking can

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.450 
again we've got a thought of locking can
induce<00:01:38.109> liftoff<00:01:38.560> oversteer<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:39.280> rear

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
induce liftoff oversteer and rear

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.859 
induce liftoff oversteer and rear
instability<00:01:40.000> however<00:01:40.390> setting<00:01:40.689> the<00:01:40.780> off

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
instability however setting the off

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.109 
instability however setting the off
throttle<00:01:41.049> that<00:01:41.409> value<00:01:41.770> too<00:01:41.950> low<00:01:42.219> or<00:01:42.490> harm

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
throttle that value too low or harm

you to start rotating the car nicely
getting<00:02:54.489> on<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:54.670> power<00:02:54.909> nice<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.329> early<00:02:55.480> so

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
getting on the power nice and early so

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.379 
getting on the power nice and early so
that's<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.829> setup<00:02:57.040> let's<00:02:57.609> head<00:02:57.760> out<00:02:57.849> onto<00:02:58.269> the

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
that's the setup let's head out onto the

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:00.000 
that's the setup let's head out onto the
track<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.870> see<00:02:59.049> what<00:02:59.260> lap<00:02:59.409> time<00:02:59.620> we<00:02:59.769> can

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
track to see what lap time we can

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.149 
track to see what lap time we can
produce<00:03:01.019> so<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.230> start<00:03:02.470> of<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.709> lap<00:03:02.859> is<00:03:03.010> going

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
produce so the start of the lap is going

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.129 
produce so the start of the lap is going
to<00:03:03.220> be<00:03:03.340> flat<00:03:03.879> out<00:03:04.060> through<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.540> final<00:03:04.870> corner
