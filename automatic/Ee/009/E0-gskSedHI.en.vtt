 I wanted a gameplay with the rx and well 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.949
 Well, here was a game that 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.800

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.780
 and well, so that when I arrive 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.299

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.800
 cold metropole wharfe comes out 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.350

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.620
 but shortly the passage of time of the 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.780
 heading after going out to people not 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.900
 I know why he was left alone that I think he 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.100
 the opposite side of me that finally with 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.380
 three more members of the team 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.370
 what a good departure suddenly and it was and 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.460
 it went well 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.440
 although they are followed but we can 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.020
 upload it can become as I said 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.600
 whatever comes out then I'm at 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.600
 Youtube 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.600

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:03.420
 that you like more the 'play boy' ski 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.420
 the gloves more is being harder 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.300
 remember trial dance 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.270

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.680
 people 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:23.480
 300 for what they say while if not 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:31.900
 they can fight later as I want 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.900
 but if you want to be 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.440
 with the account 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.860

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.020

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.580
 lack in the pure load but of menezes and 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.370
 bigger more important than the butt and the 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.770
 body compressed importantly a 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.200
 arms the body silver that came out 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.450

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.250
