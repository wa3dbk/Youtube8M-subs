00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.140
 abound even more and more in knowledge and 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.170
 in all understanding for you to take advantage 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.030
 the best so that you are sincere and 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.390
 irreproachable for the day of Christ 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.090
 full of fruits of justice that are for 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.750
 half of Jesus Christ for glory and 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.570
 praise of God 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.150
 I want you to know brothers that things 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.580
 that have happened to me have contributed more 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.710
 well to the progress of the gospel of such 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.110
 so that throughout the praetorium and between 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.690
 all the others it has become evident that 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.090
 I am imprisoned because of Christ and the 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.550
 Most brothers cheering 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.210
 in the Lord with my prisons dare 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.160
 much more to speak the word without fear 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.860
 some truly preach Christ 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.320
 out of envy and rivalry but others 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.540
 Goodwill make one 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.330
 they announce to Christ by rivalry not 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.720
 sincerely thinking adding affliction to 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.860
 my prisons but the others for love 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.190
 knowing that I am placed for the 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.830
 defense of the gospel that therefore not 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.980
 However, in any case or as a pretext 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.100
 or for truth Christ is announced and in 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.200
 this business and I like it is always 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.730
 because I know that because of your prayer and 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.100
 supply of the spirit of 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.440
 Jesus Christ this will result in me 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.570
 release according to my wish and 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.239
 hope that I will not be anything 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.770
 embarrassed before well with all 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.410
 trust 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.520
 now Christ will also be magnified in 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.850
 my body 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.430
 whether I live or if I die because 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.950
 I live is christ and dying 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.780
 gain but if living in the flesh 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.350
 it is for me for the benefit of the work 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.410
 I do not know then what to choose because of 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.970
 both things I'm narrowed 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.300
 having desire to leave and be with 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.730
 Christ which is much better but 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.060
 being in the flesh is more necessary because 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.670
 cause of you and confident in this I know 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.280
 that I will stay that still remains with all 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.740
 you for your benefit and joy of 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.500
 the faith so that your glory abounds 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.140
 me in Christ Jesus for my presence another 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.630
 time among you I only beg you 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.540
 that you behave as is worthy of the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.330
 gospel of christ so that it is that 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.430
 go to see you or be absent hear from 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.190
 you who are firm in one 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.290
 spirit fighting unanimously for the faith 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.200
 of the gospel and without being intimidated 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.200
 by those who oppose that for it 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.530
 it is certainly a sign of perdition but 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.530
 for you
