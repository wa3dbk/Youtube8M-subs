00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.549
 Good day today would like to 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.500
 share with you your new dress 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:13.650
 obnovochka is from benchmade blue 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:17.970
 young lady that is well let's 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:23.430
 let's see what's up here guys here 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:27.840
 is knife benchmade barrage 581 with 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:33.260
 steel on the blade it 390 that is 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.670
 personally nose intrigued and knife principle 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.219
 at first did not like the pictures 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.750
 all seriously but take such a knife 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.390
 hands and immediately understand everything yes yes 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.340
 great knife and he sits perfectly in your hand 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.820
 first he is well done guys he 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.610
 made to anything nearly prikopalis well 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.730
 how can everything be possible to stick their pillar 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.270
 but actually a knife is made here 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.910
 pretty interesting and pretty 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:10.710
 for acceptable money of such quality I 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:14.160
 have not yet seen the knife with our assistant lock 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.780
 maxi self closed construction to me 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.170
 by the way the closed construction is bigger 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.200
 like a knife and because up can 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.220
 a little harder to wash but guys if 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.760
 need night on your pocket you wear that whole 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.490
 this 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.260
 let's say the dust from the pocket gets clogged up immediately 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.509
 instant closed construction this 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.040
 happens not so fast well let's 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.300
 back to the knife 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.940
 that is , there is a lock of the blade itself 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.130
 there can fix it like in 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.130
 open such closed position 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.490
 he fixes just lock axis lock then 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.410
 have he not let him say close 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.479
 that is, we push it like this 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:02.009
 all and lock we can not close then 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.369
 there is and accordingly it is necessary in order 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:10.819
 because the knife with the assist is necessary for 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:15.920
 so that in the pocket of the legs did not open 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.920
 so then g-10 handle 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.640
 blade steel im 390 pretty 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.620
 a thin rolled down almost from the butt 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.780
 There is not a small FFA with liners 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.720
 3 houses sawed out so big 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.740
 circles that is my knife my knife 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.810
 knife specimen 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.200
 weighs exactly 150 grams I went to 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.630
 jewelry scales 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.680
 exactly 150 grams manufacturer claims 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:50.190
 that's here 143 to 147 where does this difference 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.640
 even the principle I have no idea 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.780
 even guess where more pucks are 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.290
 non-ferrous metal on the same give 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:04.510
 generally speed in the ice blade well, plus 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.510
 more assist ie clip 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:14.030
 It appears only on two sides 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:16.070
 wear the tips up the knife that is honest 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:23.410
 I say a couple of days already on the pocket, he 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:23.410
 I say this is not very successful 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.930
 new thing to share with you immediately was not 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.390
 time but had to ask for a couple of days 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:39.200
 pocket I'll tell you guys say what 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.990
 for such old-timers of our knife 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.930
 communities say you can get rid 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.650
 in general from 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:52.870
 Wishlist compartment knives in one knife that is 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:55.579
 is it possible to be honest by buying 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.730
 I bought this knife I can you 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:03.890
 say one thing most likely near 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:06.109
 Time my Wishlist disappears but sits at 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.599
 everything in my hand is excellent 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:11.209
 grooves that made our action 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.760
 if you can see right here 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.400
 all family finger becomes that is 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.750
 no problem no grip anywhere 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.330
 Opinion Namina does not shrink minimum 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.699
 that is, they are on the side here yes here for 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:37.400
 such a knife grip something to cut 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:40.849
 something under this one that's fine well i don't know 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:45.610
 I do not know for whom or for what was done 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:48.409
 this knife that is but osborne did it 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:53.630
 excellent cutter i.e. knife cuts 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:55.970
 Excellent + steel them 390 keeps factory 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.849
 sharpening I already guys believe me cut 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.070
 a lot of things different and different 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:05.740
 materials that is whether on wooden 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:08.870
 boards and on a plastic board cut and 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:15.740
 flooding now on no I'm not 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:18.349
 noticed that while pepper and no 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:22.150
 questions about something not like 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:26.180
 knife or noticed some flaws 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:29.630
 For two or three days, I have not defied yet 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:33.770
 notes to him no blade is made 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:36.560
 pretty competently that is my most 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.990
 favorite lock axis plus there is still 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.600
 retainer 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.830
 clip 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:46.410
 that is, I will tell you honestly for me 150 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.430
 gram principle is good keeping that is 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.940
 he feels heavy in his hand that is 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:55.620
 they do not seem to see any problems in this 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.650
 weighs have a lanyard hole 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.050
 well this is here i think pointless knife 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.940
 looks very so very elegant 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:08.540
 nice and peppered aluminum semi 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.890
 textolite grip 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.280
 what else would you like to say 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:17.580
 the spring here is pretty powerful i 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.220
 I think my narrow on Ruslan is 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.560
 the video that he is in 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.510
 repaired there showed a spring 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.200
 the spring is pretty powerful yet i mean 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:31.860
 I think to break right away will not break in 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:35.250
 principle after purchase literally 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.880
 a little oil and everything flies even better on 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:42.480
 cheers no backlash 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:46.740
 there is nothing ie a knife is 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:52.190
 pretty rich 91 centimeter 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:55.800
 blade handle completely fills the hand 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:59.430
 even give i will show how in my hand he 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.710
 sits nowhere shakes nothing 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.340
 because of its such a little bit to be nodded 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:07.680
 bundle view of the axis of the handle that is, but 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:12.950
 a little wide to i ie knife in hand 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:15.450
 hold on just tone lay big all 

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:18.860
 great air just made 

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.860
 excellent knife and 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:27.050
 honestly my Wishlist yet so 

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:29.839
 let's say no more than a few 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.699
 months while i'm gonna carry this one 

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:33.139
 pocket 

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:38.949
 So well, I would like to make a small 

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:41.650
 spout that is so many m 390 and 

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:45.020
 school too 

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:51.650
 super steel which is hardened in my opinion before 

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:54.289
 from 60 to 62 on rockwell ideal to put 

00:07:51.650 --> 00:08:01.669
 personal but I would like to still 

00:07:54.289 --> 00:08:05.809
 test it with c 30 from a junction hole in 

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:09.080
 In principle, I think that soon 

00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:12.279
 I will try to conduct tests and you 

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:15.349

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:18.229
