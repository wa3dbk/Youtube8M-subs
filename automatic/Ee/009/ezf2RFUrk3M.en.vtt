health book but on samsung has already

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.190 
health book but on samsung has already
had<00:02:06.159> it<00:02:06.340> for<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.549> while<00:02:06.789> it<00:02:07.419> was<00:02:07.539> a<00:02:07.599> part<00:02:07.990> of<00:02:08.080> the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
had it for a while it was a part of the

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.559 
had it for a while it was a part of the
galaxy<00:02:08.319> s4<00:02:09.009> samsung<00:02:09.729> didn't<00:02:10.179> really<00:02:10.330> make<00:02:10.509> a

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
galaxy s4 samsung didn't really make a

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.089 
galaxy s4 samsung didn't really make a
big<00:02:10.660> deal<00:02:10.959> about<00:02:11.019> it<00:02:11.260> but<00:02:11.590> apparently<00:02:11.650> its

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
big deal about it but apparently its

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.550 
big deal about it but apparently its
users<00:02:12.519> were<00:02:12.700> really<00:02:13.120> into<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:14.409> they've

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
users were really into it and so they've

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.410 
users were really into it and so they've
made<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.129> a<00:02:15.159> higher<00:02:15.370> priority<00:02:15.640> on<00:02:15.909> this

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
made that a higher priority on this

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.080 
made that a higher priority on this
and<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:17.230> heart<00:02:17.470> rate<00:02:17.590> monitor<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:18.220> a<00:02:18.490> big<00:02:18.790> part

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
and the heart rate monitor is a big part

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.790 
and the heart rate monitor is a big part
of<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.240> it's<00:02:19.840> also<00:02:19.990> got<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.200> fingerprint

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
of that it's also got a fingerprint

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.220 
of that it's also got a fingerprint
scanner<00:02:20.920> up<00:02:21.430> here<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:21.970> that's<00:02:22.300> basically<00:02:22.690> like

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
scanner up here so that's basically like

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.940 
scanner up here so that's basically like
Apple<00:02:23.650> right<00:02:23.950> on<00:02:24.599> but<00:02:25.599> uh<00:02:25.630> another<00:02:26.560> really

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
Apple right on but uh another really

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.110 
Apple right on but uh another really
cool<00:02:27.250> thing<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.610> I'll<00:02:27.730> definitely<00:02:27.880> be

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
cool thing that I'll definitely be

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.580 
cool thing that I'll definitely be

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
basic apps that you can turn on like

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.990 
basic apps that you can turn on like
your<00:02:47.290> clock<00:02:47.560> or<00:02:47.769> something<00:02:48.099> but<00:02:48.610> besides<00:02:48.880> that

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
your clock or something but besides that

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.430 
your clock or something but besides that
everything<00:02:49.330> is<00:02:49.600> turned<00:02:49.870> off<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.290> whole

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
everything is turned off the whole

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.070 
everything is turned off the whole
screen<00:02:50.709> is<00:02:50.980> actually<00:02:51.100> uh<00:02:51.569> turned<00:02:52.569> black<00:02:52.870> and

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
screen is actually uh turned black and

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.770 
screen is actually uh turned black and
white<00:02:53.350> which<00:02:53.860> is<00:02:54.010> good<00:02:54.250> because<00:02:54.489> this<00:02:55.450> is<00:02:55.630> an

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
white which is good because this is an

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.600 
white which is good because this is an
oled<00:02:56.230> screen<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:56.799> what<00:02:56.920> you<00:02:56.980> can<00:02:57.130> do<00:02:57.310> there<00:02:57.489> is

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
oled screen so what you can do there is

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.550 
oled screen so what you can do there is
you<00:02:57.640> can<00:02:57.730> turn<00:02:58.090> on<00:02:58.239> each<00:02:58.450> pixel<00:02:58.900> individually

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
you can turn on each pixel individually

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.530 
you can turn on each pixel individually
so<00:02:59.799> if<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.519> bulk<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:00.970> screen<00:03:01.180> is<00:03:01.299> black

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
so if the bulk of the screen is black

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.320 
so if the bulk of the screen is black
only<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:03.069> white<00:03:03.280> pixels<00:03:03.760> are<00:03:03.910> turned<00:03:04.180> on

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
only the the white pixels are turned on

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.750 
only the the white pixels are turned on
and<00:03:04.600> basically<00:03:05.380> samsung<00:03:06.280> says<00:03:06.459> that<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:06.640> can

really prioritize you know making it
like<00:04:09.609> waterproof<00:04:10.299> and<00:04:10.540> dustproof<00:04:10.989> i<00:04:11.500> believe

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
like waterproof and dustproof i believe

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.090 
like waterproof and dustproof i believe
it's<00:04:12.190> like<00:04:12.280> ipf<00:04:13.030> 67<00:04:13.810> or<00:04:13.930> something<00:04:14.200> right<00:04:14.410> so

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
it's like ipf 67 or something right so

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.969 
it's like ipf 67 or something right so
basically<00:04:16.090> it<00:04:16.239> can<00:04:16.359> be<00:04:16.600> like<00:04:16.840> you<00:04:17.560> can<00:04:17.739> drown

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
basically it can be like you can drown

basically it can be like you can drown
it<00:04:18.250> on<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:19.060> it<00:04:19.690> should<00:04:20.289> survive<00:04:20.590> like<00:04:20.769> Samsung

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
it on and it should survive like Samsung

to be like that so on it's it's kind of

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.860 
to be like that so on it's it's kind of
it'll<00:06:00.580> be<00:06:00.669> interesting<00:06:00.910> to<00:06:01.120> see<00:06:01.210> what<00:06:01.390> happens

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
it'll be interesting to see what happens

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.510 
it'll be interesting to see what happens
with<00:06:02.020> this<00:06:02.200> like<00:06:02.410> I<00:06:02.500> think<00:06:02.710> the<00:06:02.830> design<00:06:02.980> at

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
with this like I think the design at

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.250 
with this like I think the design at
least<00:06:03.669> you<00:06:03.820> know<00:06:03.940> right<00:06:04.690> out<00:06:04.720> of<00:06:04.840> the<00:06:04.930> box<00:06:05.080> I

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
least you know right out of the box I

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.070 
least you know right out of the box I
kind<00:06:05.530> of<00:06:05.620> like<00:06:05.800> it<00:06:05.830> on<00:06:06.220> it<00:06:07.180> this<00:06:07.720> one<00:06:07.900> retails

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
kind of like it on it this one retails

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.600 
kind of like it on it this one retails
for<00:06:08.700> 1<00:06:09.700> 99<00:06:09.850> 99<00:06:10.330> I<00:06:10.480> believe<00:06:10.780> um<00:06:10.960> and<00:06:11.919> it'll<00:06:12.430> be

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
for 1 99 99 I believe um and it'll be

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.710 
for 1 99 99 I believe um and it'll be
it'll<00:06:12.790> be<00:06:12.880> interesting<00:06:13.060> to<00:06:13.240> see<00:06:13.330> how<00:06:13.450> the

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
it'll be interesting to see how the

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.590 
it'll be interesting to see how the
market<00:06:14.470> reacts<00:06:14.800> to<00:06:15.070> it<00:06:15.100> and<00:06:15.520> it's<00:06:16.180> it's<00:06:16.360> one

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
market reacts to it and it's it's one

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.909 
market reacts to it and it's it's one
other<00:06:16.750> interesting<00:06:16.960> thing<00:06:17.410> about<00:06:17.440> it<00:06:17.800> is<00:06:17.890> that

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
other interesting thing about it is that

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.920 
other interesting thing about it is that
you<00:06:18.130> know<00:06:18.250> as<00:06:18.669> you<00:06:18.730> can<00:06:19.000> tell<00:06:19.210> like<00:06:19.480> that's<00:06:19.720> a

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
you know as you can tell like that's a

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.640 
you know as you can tell like that's a
curved<00:06:20.850> screen<00:06:21.850> this<00:06:21.970> is<00:06:22.030> a<00:06:22.290> Samsung's<00:06:23.290> first

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
curved screen this is a Samsung's first

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.300 
curved screen this is a Samsung's first
curved<00:06:24.310> screen<00:06:24.790> OLED<00:06:25.620> device<00:06:26.620> released<00:06:27.040> here

curved screen OLED device released here

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.220 
curved screen OLED device released here
in<00:06:27.400> the<00:06:27.490> US<00:06:27.730> they<00:06:27.880> had<00:06:28.120> a<00:06:28.150> curved<00:06:28.570> smartphone

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.230 
in the US they had a curved smartphone

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.490 
in the US they had a curved smartphone
that<00:06:30.160> was<00:06:30.280> in<00:06:30.430> Korea<00:06:30.580> last<00:06:31.150> year<00:06:31.540> but<00:06:32.050> you<00:06:32.380> know

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
that was in Korea last year but you know

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.540 
that was in Korea last year but you know
a<00:06:32.530> lot<00:06:32.650> of<00:06:32.710> times<00:06:32.919> with<00:06:33.070> the<00:06:33.190> curved

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
a lot of times with the curved

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.190 
a lot of times with the curved
smartphones<00:06:34.150> and<00:06:34.270> the<00:06:34.330> curved<00:06:34.540> TVs<00:06:34.810> people

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.200 
smartphones and the curved TVs people

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.420 
smartphones and the curved TVs people
are<00:06:35.290> just<00:06:35.410> like<00:06:35.530> what's<00:06:36.010> the<00:06:36.100> point<00:06:36.160> of<00:06:36.340> the

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
are just like what's the point of the

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.520 
are just like what's the point of the
curve<00:06:36.580> and<00:06:36.850> honestly<00:06:37.419> in<00:06:37.660> my<00:06:37.870> opinion<00:06:38.080> from

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
curve and honestly in my opinion from

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.719 
curve and honestly in my opinion from
what<00:06:38.710> I've<00:06:38.800> seen<00:06:38.830> there's<00:06:39.130> no<00:06:39.310> point<00:06:39.550> to<00:06:39.640> the

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 
what I've seen there's no point to the

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:42.210 
what I've seen there's no point to the
curve<00:06:39.910> in<00:06:40.090> this<00:06:40.690> scenario<00:06:41.039> yeah<00:06:42.039> you<00:06:42.100> know

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
curve in this scenario yeah you know

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.860 
curve in this scenario yeah you know
because<00:06:42.400> it<00:06:42.520> curves<00:06:43.000> to<00:06:43.510> your

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
because it curves to your

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.660 
because it curves to your
wrist<00:06:44.140> right<00:06:44.440> so<00:06:44.740> in<00:06:45.040> this<00:06:45.160> scenario<00:06:45.280> it

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:45.670 
wrist right so in this scenario it

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.970 
wrist right so in this scenario it
actually<00:06:45.940> makes<00:06:46.150> some<00:06:46.450> sense<00:06:46.800> and<00:06:47.800> I'll<00:06:47.860> be

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:47.980 
actually makes some sense and I'll be

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.260 
actually makes some sense and I'll be
testing<00:06:48.160> this<00:06:48.460> device<00:06:48.880> you<00:06:49.030> know<00:06:49.120> I'm<00:06:49.210> going

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
testing this device you know I'm going

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.030 
testing this device you know I'm going
to<00:06:49.360> go<00:06:49.480> running<00:06:49.720> with<00:06:49.900> it<00:06:50.110> and<00:06:50.350> test<00:06:50.740> out<00:06:50.920> the

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.040 
to go running with it and test out the

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.650 
to go running with it and test out the
pedometer<00:06:51.280> test<00:06:52.030> out<00:06:52.180> the<00:06:52.330> heart<00:06:52.570> rate

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660 
pedometer test out the heart rate

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.210 
pedometer test out the heart rate
monitor<00:06:52.720> and<00:06:53.350> all<00:06:53.470> that<00:06:53.590> information<00:06:53.830> is

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
monitor and all that information is

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.240 
monitor and all that information is
relayed<00:06:54.400> to<00:06:55.120> this<00:06:55.330> device<00:06:55.690> so<00:06:56.110> it's<00:06:56.680> it<00:06:57.010> should

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.250 
relayed to this device so it's it should

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.400 
relayed to this device so it's it should
be<00:06:57.370> pretty<00:06:57.550> exciting<00:06:57.670> and<00:06:58.420> how<00:06:58.750> much<00:06:58.900> does<00:06:59.140> the

00:06:59.400 --> 00:06:59.410 
be pretty exciting and how much does the

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.740 
be pretty exciting and how much does the
phone<00:06:59.620> retail<00:07:00.160> for<00:07:00.370> so<00:07:01.000> the<00:07:01.120> phone<00:07:01.330> varies

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.750 
phone retail for so the phone varies

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.710 
phone retail for so the phone varies
from<00:07:01.930> place<00:07:02.170> to<00:07:02.410> place<00:07:02.440> like<00:07:02.860> sprint<00:07:03.280> and<00:07:03.720> AT&amp;T

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 
from place to place like sprint and AT&amp;T
