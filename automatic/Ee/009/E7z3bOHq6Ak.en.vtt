 how people welcome you to another 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.970
 gameplay commentary we now 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.910
 probably already heard that 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.230
 my voice pretty much hacks the people 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.490
 that followed me on facebook came 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.809
 probably already from it 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.529
 I always keep you up there 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.840
 the current one 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.460
 I have a laryngitis and 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.689
 that's why no video came yesterday 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.000
 I actually thought it is still today 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.710
 better that I am a whole today 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.580
 can bring normal video but that is 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.349
 unfortunately not like that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.939
 Actually, I'm even allowed to 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.859
 not talking but I thought so 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.190
 come a short quick commentary 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.600
 you have to knock out just about me too 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.010
 to let the people know me 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.170
 unfortunately not on facebook 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.239
 yes in any case today is yes 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.340
 Tuesday morning on Wednesday will be then 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.559
 finally come the long-awaited video 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.870
 when i meet the abo where on the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.840
 So gamescom is doing as said Friday 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.730
 and on saturday i will definitely do 1 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.379
 only on time and in which hall 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.090
 I would find myself as the will you 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.649
 then see you tomorrow in the comments 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.239
 do not be surprised in the morning my 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.500
 agree just sued because the have there 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.390
 I will also record soon 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.689
 and I just hope that I can wait until the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.580
 So gamescom talk to friday where we are 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.110
 We all see that until then 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.670
 reasonably healthy or 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.140
 or not much for me 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.490
 shit goes because otherwise I can 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.900
 I do not think so, but I come 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.210
 I will give everything I will 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.680
 It's not easy for me all day 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.530
 no longer compete and today 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.960
 this comments and afterwards for 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.329
 how lok what tomorrow comes because when 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.759
 I am where and so what else, too 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.320
 I'm all will of course 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.540
 also because facebook is also on the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.130
 keep running where i am right now what 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.350
 I'm just going to tell you where and where he is from 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.060
 can not come and when I'm in 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.509
 the box is still one of you 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.159
 gamble or something on the gamescom or 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.550
 no affair I post as synonymous again 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.370
 and how much time in which hall 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.260
 fan meeting are definitely mine 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.420
 friends i do not want much now 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.920
 long talk I know how the gameplay in 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.720
 to clap the background 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.420
 probably a very tricky nuclear 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.340
 or somehow everything is talking 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.740
 also extreme because i believe this 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.539
 commentary is also so extreme for me later 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.570
 embarrassing for my voice so ugly 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.320
 But what should you do if you are 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.480
 is ill 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.130
 I really did not want to stop right now 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.170
 no video brings me that's me 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.060
 also in the wiping water at the upload plane 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.700
 not as good as it gets 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.410
 yes in any case friends then I say 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.890
 now oil shimmers and I forget 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.150
 Tomorrow is super important for you 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.620
 turn and write me now 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.330
 ever under it who of you everything up 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.330
 the gamescom is teeming with it
