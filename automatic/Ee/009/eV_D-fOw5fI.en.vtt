00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.610
 the time of exams the patent bac 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.980
 I think it makes you feel 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.110
 still the summer holidays and that's it 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.030

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.370
 we attack 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.770
 I had a regret but I do not have any 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.039
 makeup bag in my bag g20 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.440
 my bag but that's how its vanessa 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.730
 bruno and you see pockets of both 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.100
 sides and there are a lot of them inside 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.170
 so in fact I have some products 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.240
 indispensable which I do not use to 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.890
 each time but who can I use to 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.720
 every time so first of all there is the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.369
 hydroalcoholic solution that is 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.650
 always in full of the bag union I 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.640
 in a page a little mirror like that 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.049
 with a conventional side a little thy 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.780
 magnifying I'm sorry the 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.759
 disgusting and I do not know where from 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.210
 he's coming but you can find some at 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.210
 almost everywhere I have a corrector 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.640
 like that of the brand these photographers 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.860
 there is not much left but in fact 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.650
 Here I use it at all morning 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.939
 so I keep in my dry because 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.740
 even if it's rare that I am 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.130
 alterations on my time it can 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.869
 arrive 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.899
 here I am going in front of a mirror 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.240
 and that I realize that this is my 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.770
 makeup went down or that's good 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.000
 I do not like I have my corrector at mans 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.409
 on me and I can do something 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.789
 he passed by 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.640
 I first have a miniature of 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.859
 flower by flower perfume by kenzo or 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.859
 bottom flowers finally something like that 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:04.740
 and he smells super good I like a lot 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:07.380
 it's not at all my perfume the perfume 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.789
 of play but every day and but good 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.190
 this is miniature gilles like that and I 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.360
 keep in my bag and since you're here 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.480
 when I forget May the perfume is 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.599
 count I feel like it at last I do not know 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.519
 it can always be useful 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.920
 I could black like that with the pencil 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.480
 on one side and the foam tip on the other 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.670
 of the brand sephora russia and this is the 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.299
 01 he's black and that's it's a plan 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.349
 that I like a lot 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:36.480
 he is he is very good and I will put 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.370
 made black clients but alike so 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.230
 I never need a makeup re or 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.200
 to make up myself who have blackened 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.329
 I think it's done here I can do 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.280
 a lot of things with so that's for 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.920
 that I have in my bag and finally 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.109
 in fact I really like putting on makeup 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.019
 lips so do put a red to 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.549
 lips and his mighty we'll say and 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.010
 not necessarily a lot of makeup 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.950
 eyes in this case so every time 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.810
 that I put lipstick on these 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.400
 flash mob is it not very discreet I 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.090
 put the lipstick in my bag and 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.829
 in the end I always forget to 2 in 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.419
 lipsticks and you have but where 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:19.829
 I preferred are dry 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:20.849
 so before we have my lip balm 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.579
 I bought last year at the 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:28.169
 pikes and I loved lipstick that 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:30.750
 massed flashy dark enough here 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.560
 I'm afraid I preferred that 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.690
 I have to remove everything 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.099

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.230

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.519
 lip after loaf kind but 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.370
 a little bit if I go to the toilet 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.290
 but it's not it's not something 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.630
 that I really do a shaker I write 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.760

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.930
