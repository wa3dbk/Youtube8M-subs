and<00:00:39.480> also<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.530> game<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.280> for<00:00:41.730> v<00:00:42.000> sets

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290

three sets of dogs and three swarms so

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.900 
three sets of dogs and three swarms so
my<00:00:46.620> killstreaks<00:00:46.890> would<00:00:47.219> definitely<00:00:47.579> put<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.789> a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
my killstreaks would definitely put in a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.690 
my killstreaks would definitely put in a
lot<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.120> work<00:00:48.390> I'm<00:00:48.809> sure<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:50.340> didn't

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
lot of work I'm sure that if I didn't

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.810 
lot of work I'm sure that if I didn't
die<00:00:51.170> after<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.199> got<00:00:52.350> my<00:00:52.500> Blackbird<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.460> comes<00:00:53.640> up

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
die after I got my Blackbird it comes up

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.130 
die after I got my Blackbird it comes up
later<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> game<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.510> probably<00:00:54.780> would<00:00:55.079> have

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
later on the game I probably would have

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.540 
later on the game I probably would have
definitely<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.469> 100-plus<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.129> kill<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> firm

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
definitely I 100-plus and kill the firm

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.819 
definitely I 100-plus and kill the firm
which<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.910> amazing<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:58.079> mean<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.440> did<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.710> before

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
which is amazing I mean I did it before

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.279 
which is amazing I mean I did it before
one<00:00:59.250> hundred<00:00:59.489> percent<00:00:59.520> confirm<00:01:00.199> but<00:01:01.199> it's

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
one hundred percent confirm but it's

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.959 
one hundred percent confirm but it's
pretty<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:01.710> more<00:01:02.070> tougher<00:01:02.370> than<00:01:02.489> nomination

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
pretty it's more tougher than nomination

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.609 
pretty it's more tougher than nomination
since<00:01:03.239> especially<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:04.080> teammates<00:01:04.379> that

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
since especially we have teammates that

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.320 
since especially we have teammates that
like<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.830> pick<00:01:04.949> up<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> tags<00:01:05.369> even<00:01:06.180> though<00:01:06.299> I

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
like to pick up the tags even though I
