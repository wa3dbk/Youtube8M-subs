00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
want something to chew and I just have

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.880 
want something to chew and I just have
another<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:44.329> laying<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.510> there<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.960> said<00:00:46.770> I'm

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
another one laying in there I said I'm

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.119 
another one laying in there I said I'm
like<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.039> Bob<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.050> his<00:00:49.260> thing<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.950> take

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
like a Bob and this is his thing I take

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.700 
like a Bob and this is his thing I take
them<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.489> bed<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.059> plastic<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.289> it

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
them to the bed it's like plastic and it

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.750 
them to the bed it's like plastic and it
is<00:00:52.890> just<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:56.059> basic<00:00:57.469> critter<00:00:58.469> keeper<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.399> think

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
is just a basic critter keeper I think

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.840 
is just a basic critter keeper I think
and<00:01:00.079> so<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.440> what<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.680> looks<00:01:01.859> like

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
and so this is what it looks like

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.649 
and so this is what it looks like
so<00:01:03.809> yes<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.409> high-standing<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.000> think

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
so yes it's high-standing and it I think

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.350 
so yes it's high-standing and it I think
would<00:01:06.780> work<00:01:06.930> perfect<00:01:07.530> because<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.460> high

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
would work perfect because it is high

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.670 
would work perfect because it is high
enough<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.689> take<00:01:09.930> them<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.500> big
