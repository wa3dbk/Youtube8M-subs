 The world's largest Uyuni salt lake, which boasts about five times the area of ​​Tokyo. Although the lake in the sky above 3,700m above sea level has a good shape in the dry season, it usually shows the particularly beautiful figure in the rainy season which lasts from December to April. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Rain in the rainy season stretches over the surface of the lake, and in fine weather the sky is reflected in the surface of the lake. A scene that can only be described as a superb view spreads all around. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Uyuni is still unexplored. There are few tourists who visit, and they do not know the boundary between the sky and the horizon. Enjoy as much as you like the scenery you like. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 The word "mirror in the sky" is appropriate. No matter how long you have time. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 It is a place that depends on the weather, so I want to stay slowly at Uyuni Salt Lake. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 By the way, while the sun shines, it is warm, but when the sun gets cold, the temperature drops suddenly. Because the sun is strong, outerwear and hats are essentials. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 As the sky begins to turn red, the surface of the lake will change again. In front of a fantastic sight, words may not be necessary.
