00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
better top so let's see how long this is

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.370 
better top so let's see how long this is
going<00:01:50.299> to<00:01:50.390> take<00:01:50.569> us<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.810> cook

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.039 

okay<00:01:56.219> it's<00:01:56.490> been<00:01:56.729> cooking<00:01:57.180> now<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.780> for

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
okay it's been cooking now just for

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.319 
okay it's been cooking now just for
about<00:01:58.490> five<00:01:59.490> minutes<00:02:00.829> we<00:02:01.829> got<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.159> right<00:02:02.329> lid

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
about five minutes we got the right lid

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.859 
about five minutes we got the right lid
on<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.630> cookpot<00:02:03.840> now<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:06.420> I'm<00:02:06.630> going<00:02:06.810> to

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
on the cookpot now and I'm going to

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.330 
on the cookpot now and I'm going to
guess<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.649> probably<00:02:07.799> going<00:02:08.220> to

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
guess that this is probably going to

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.390 
guess that this is probably going to
take<00:02:08.929> probably<00:02:09.929> about<00:02:10.080> 45<00:02:10.560> minutes<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.220> cook

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
take probably about 45 minutes to cook

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.850 
take probably about 45 minutes to cook
and<00:02:12.330> we'll<00:02:12.630> just<00:02:12.780> see<00:02:12.959> how<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.140> goes<00:02:13.380> so<00:02:13.739> i'll

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
and we'll just see how it goes so i'll

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.770 
and we'll just see how it goes so i'll
give<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> various<00:02:14.670> reports<00:02:15.269> on<00:02:15.450> how<00:02:15.599> it's
