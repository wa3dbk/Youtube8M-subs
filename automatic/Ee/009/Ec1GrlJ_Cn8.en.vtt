00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.949 
else knows that I mean the awesomeness
ohio<00:02:55.409> state<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:56.069> not<00:02:56.639> you<00:02:57.420> know<00:02:57.450> some<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.810> your

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
ohio state is not you know some of your

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.770 
ohio state is not you know some of your
usual<00:02:58.379> you<00:02:59.010> know<00:02:59.040> proprietary<00:03:00.030> insights<00:03:00.629> I

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
usual you know proprietary insights I

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.569 
usual you know proprietary insights I
mean<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.049> is<00:03:01.109> everyone<00:03:02.069> knows<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.459> so

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
mean this is everyone knows that so

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:03.979 
mean this is everyone knows that so
isn't<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.909> already<00:03:03.120> factored<00:03:03.540> into<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.780> line

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
isn't it already factored into the line

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.110 
isn't it already factored into the line
it's<00:03:04.590> probably<00:03:05.040> as<00:03:05.220> factored<00:03:05.670> into<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:05.879> line

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
it's probably as factored into the line

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.430 
it's probably as factored into the line
but<00:03:06.329> at<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.569> same<00:03:06.750> time<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:07.019> think<00:03:07.170> you're

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
but at the same time I think you're

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.930 
but at the same time I think you're
talking<00:03:07.799> about<00:03:07.980> Virginia<00:03:08.430> Tech<00:03:08.609> getting<00:03:08.879> a

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
talking about Virginia Tech getting a

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.520 
talking about Virginia Tech getting a
lot<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.150> credit<00:03:09.540> for<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.750> fact<00:03:09.780> that<00:03:10.109> they<00:03:10.290> did

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
lot of credit for the fact that they did

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.410 
lot of credit for the fact that they did
beat<00:03:10.739> him<00:03:10.889> last<00:03:11.069> year<00:03:11.310> but<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:11.849> also<00:03:12.060> think<00:03:12.299> that

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
beat him last year but I also think that

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.210 
beat him last year but I also think that
plays<00:03:12.750> against<00:03:13.200> them<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.409> revenge<00:03:13.739> factor

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
plays against them that revenge factor

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.189 
plays against them that revenge factor
will<00:03:14.430> be<00:03:14.670> sitting<00:03:14.909> in<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.599> back<00:03:15.780> of<00:03:15.930> Ohio

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:16.199 
will be sitting in the back of Ohio

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:17.900 
will be sitting in the back of Ohio
State's<00:03:16.500> mind<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.829> fact<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.220> was<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.730> last

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
State's mind the fact this was the last

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.089 
State's mind the fact this was the last
team<00:03:18.239> that<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.930> did<00:03:19.079> indeed<00:03:19.590> beat<00:03:19.799> him<00:03:19.949> and

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
team that and did indeed beat him and

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.259 
team that and did indeed beat him and
not<00:03:20.190> only<00:03:20.280> did<00:03:20.459> they<00:03:20.579> beat<00:03:20.730> him<00:03:20.819> they<00:03:20.970> beat<00:03:21.150> him

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
not only did they beat him they beat him

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.390 
not only did they beat him they beat him
on<00:03:21.449> their<00:03:21.870> home<00:03:22.019> turf<00:03:22.049> in<00:03:22.440> Columbus<00:03:23.010> so<00:03:23.190> I

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
on their home turf in Columbus so I

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.920 
on their home turf in Columbus so I
think<00:03:23.669> Ohio<00:03:24.120> State<00:03:24.389> that's<00:03:24.599> going<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.810> play

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
think Ohio State that's going to play

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.659 
think Ohio State that's going to play
even<00:03:25.109> more<00:03:25.290> factor<00:03:25.829> it's<00:03:25.980> their<00:03:26.129> opportunity

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
even more factor it's their opportunity

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.699 
even more factor it's their opportunity
to<00:03:26.790> go<00:03:26.940> into<00:03:26.970> Blacksburg<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:27.930> not<00:03:28.290> only<00:03:28.530> be

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
to go into Blacksburg and not only be

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.289 
to go into Blacksburg and not only be
for<00:03:28.919> jenya<00:03:29.190> tech<00:03:29.400> but<00:03:29.609> beat<00:03:29.760> him<00:03:29.879> down<00:03:30.000> good

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
for jenya tech but beat him down good

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.900 
for jenya tech but beat him down good
right<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.019> also<00:03:31.169> like<00:03:31.889> we<00:03:32.040> said<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.609> know<00:03:32.730> the

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
right and also like we said you know the

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.789 
right and also like we said you know the
game<00:03:33.269> is<00:03:33.419> still<00:03:33.510> more<00:03:34.109> than<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.319> month<00:03:34.470> away<00:03:34.650> so

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
game is still more than a month away so

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.349 
game is still more than a month away so
this<00:03:35.129> line<00:03:35.340> could<00:03:35.549> easily<00:03:35.910> move<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.180> could

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
this line could easily move it could

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.210 
this line could easily move it could
move<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.690> lot<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.139> know<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.889> public<00:03:38.160> is

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
move a lot you know that the public is

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.099 
move a lot you know that the public is
going<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.489> be<00:03:38.609> all<00:03:38.819> over<00:03:39.150> Ohio<00:03:39.389> State<00:03:39.750> the

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
going to be all over Ohio State the

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.780 
going to be all over Ohio State the
Sharps<00:03:40.410> could<00:03:40.620> be<00:03:40.739> two<00:03:40.980> or<00:03:41.280> they<00:03:41.430> might<00:03:41.549> stay

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
Sharps could be two or they might stay

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.189 
Sharps could be two or they might stay
up<00:03:41.879> Virginia<00:03:42.269> Tech<00:03:42.419> and<00:03:42.569> if<00:03:42.660> that's<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.049> case

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
up Virginia Tech and if that's the case

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.470 
up Virginia Tech and if that's the case
we<00:03:43.739> might<00:03:43.919> see<00:03:44.069> this<00:03:44.190> light<00:03:44.400> clothes<00:03:44.639> at<00:03:44.819> 17<00:03:44.849> or

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
we might see this light clothes at 17 or

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.420 
we might see this light clothes at 17 or
even<00:03:45.660> closer<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:46.019> 20<00:03:46.319> right<00:03:46.470> Troy<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.829> agree

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
even closer to 20 right Troy I agree

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.530 
even closer to 20 right Troy I agree
that's<00:03:47.669> kind<00:03:47.879> of<00:03:47.940> where<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.090> thought<00:03:48.389> it

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
that's kind of where I thought it

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.180 
that's kind of where I thought it
potentially<00:03:48.870> could<00:03:49.079> open<00:03:49.590> up<00:03:49.680> that<00:03:49.919> and<00:03:50.129> it

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
potentially could open up that and it

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.800 
potentially could open up that and it
did<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:50.699> that's<00:03:50.910> kind<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.180> why<00:03:51.329> we're<00:03:51.540> getting

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
did so that's kind of why we're getting

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.990
