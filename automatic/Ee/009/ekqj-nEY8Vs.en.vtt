freezing<00:00:11.130> rain<00:00:11.340> engines<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:12.030> have<00:00:12.210> the

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
freezing rain engines I have the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.629 
freezing rain engines I have the

and<00:00:15.590> one<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.770> color<00:00:17.039> engines<00:00:17.609> too<00:00:19.220> as<00:00:20.220> you

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
and one of the color engines too as you

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.099 
and one of the color engines too as you
can<00:00:20.490> see<00:00:20.670> down<00:00:20.820> here<00:00:20.880> rain-x<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.570> oil<00:00:21.840> filter

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
can see down here rain-x the oil filter

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.750 
can see down here rain-x the oil filter
there's<00:00:22.500> an<00:00:22.590> output<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.220> there<00:00:25.160> it<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.430> usually

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
there's an output on there it is usually

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.460 
there's an output on there it is usually
not<00:00:27.029> there<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:28.019> motor<00:00:30.470> that's

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
not there like on this motor that's

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.400 
not there like on this motor that's
usually<00:00:31.859> used<00:00:32.040> for<00:00:32.219> testing<00:00:32.759> purposes<00:00:33.600> but

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
usually used for testing purposes but

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.630 
usually used for testing purposes but
you<00:00:34.590> could<00:00:34.739> just<00:00:34.890> hook<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> regular<00:00:35.399> oil

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
you could just hook a regular oil

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.370 
you could just hook a regular oil
pressure<00:00:35.969> gauge<00:00:36.149> up<00:00:36.570> there<00:00:36.750> like<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.140> one

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
pressure gauge up there like this one

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.100 
pressure gauge up there like this one
that<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.649> got<00:00:37.829> from<00:00:38.300> autozone<00:00:39.300> things<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:39.809> 20

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
that I got from autozone things like 20

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:48.560 
that I got from autozone things like 20
or<00:00:40.230> 25<00:00:40.710> bucks<00:00:46.160> but<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:48.090> will<00:00:48.270> work<00:00:48.360> in

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
or 25 bucks but this this will work in

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.250 
or 25 bucks but this this will work in
just<00:00:48.690> about<00:00:48.870> any<00:00:49.050> briggs<00:00:49.350> um<00:00:50.449> the<00:00:51.449> single

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
just about any briggs um the single

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
a lot of the Vanguard's do if you want

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.330 
a lot of the Vanguard's do if you want
to<00:00:57.660> put<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.050> color<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.739> don't<00:00:59.190> know

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
to put this on a color I don't know

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.340 
to put this on a color I don't know
about<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.640> singles<00:01:00.180> but<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.510> know<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.809> v-twins

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
about the singles but I know the v-twins

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.529 
about the singles but I know the v-twins
have<00:01:01.649> right<00:01:02.010> back<00:01:02.250> behind<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.670> carburetor<00:01:03.239> is

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
have right back behind the carburetor is

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.810 
have right back behind the carburetor is
a<00:01:03.899> plate<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> plug<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.280> could<00:01:05.460> put<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.700> in

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
a plate with a plug you could put it in

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.520 
a plate with a plug you could put it in
there<00:01:06.000> too<00:01:08.360> now<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.420> tricky<00:01:09.840> part<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:10.290> some

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
there too now the tricky part with some

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.140 
there too now the tricky part with some
engines<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.100> one's<00:01:11.340> not<00:01:11.490> really<00:01:11.760> too<00:01:11.939> bad

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
engines this one's not really too bad

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.060 
engines this one's not really too bad
it's<00:01:12.450> routing<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:12.930> plastic<00:01:13.439> tubing<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.010> it

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
it's routing this plastic tubing so it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.359 
it's routing this plastic tubing so it
doesn't<00:01:14.340> melt<00:01:15.290> so<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.380> got<00:01:16.530> lucky<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.070> had<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
doesn't melt so I got lucky and had a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.160 
doesn't melt so I got lucky and had a
clip<00:01:18.060> already<00:01:18.299> right<00:01:18.659> there

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
clip already right there

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.050 
clip already right there
so<00:01:19.530> I'm<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.890> going<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.189> fish<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.670> up<00:01:20.820> around

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
so I'm just going to fish it up around

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.620 
so I'm just going to fish it up around
there

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.520 

through<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:26.430> hole<00:01:26.640> here<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.990> right<00:01:28.290> up<00:01:28.409> into

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
through the hole here and right up into

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.600 
through the hole here and right up into
the<00:01:28.710> -<00:01:28.950> which<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.580> actually<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.390> regular

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
the - which I actually have to regular

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
the - which I actually have to regular
picture<00:01:32.610> two<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.940> half<00:01:33.119> or<00:01:33.240> three<00:01:33.270> inch

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
picture two and a half or three inch

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.950 
picture two and a half or three inch
gauges<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:35.670> being<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.360> engine<00:01:36.600> just

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
gauges and being that this engine just

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.760 
gauges and being that this engine just
rebuilt<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:39.090> our<00:01:39.330> gauge<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.930> completely<00:01:40.560> off

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
rebuilt the our gauge is completely off

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.230 
rebuilt the our gauge is completely off
now<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.399> I'm<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.520> going<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.820> pull<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.180> out

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
now so I'm just going to pull that out

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.940 
now so I'm just going to pull that out
replace<00:01:42.690> it<00:01:42.960> with<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.140> oil<00:01:43.290> gauge<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.770> this

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
replace it with the oil gauge and this

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.320 
replace it with the oil gauge and this
is<00:01:47.130> much<00:01:47.310> easier<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.759> do<00:01:47.940> if<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.149> have<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
is much easier to do if you have the

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.120 
is much easier to do if you have the
engine<00:01:48.659> off<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> tractor<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.799> did

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
engine off the tractor like I did

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.170 
engine off the tractor like I did
because<00:01:50.520> almost<00:01:51.299> knowing<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> work<00:01:52.049> here<00:01:52.380> but

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
because almost knowing the work here but

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.149 
because almost knowing the work here but
you<00:01:54.180> can<00:01:54.450> do<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.170> believe<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.740> got<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.920> take

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
you can do it I believe you got to take

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.029 
you can do it I believe you got to take
all<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.520> metal<00:01:56.909> off<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.420> get<00:01:57.600> there<00:01:57.920> give<00:01:58.920> you

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
all this metal off to get there give you

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.290 
all this metal off to get there give you
a<00:01:59.069> little<00:01:59.250> more<00:01:59.369> space<00:01:59.670> or<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.000> might<00:02:00.119> feel

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
a little more space or you might feel

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.510 
a little more space or you might feel
just<00:02:00.330> Jam<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> socket<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.710> square<00:02:02.310> head

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
just Jam a socket on the square head

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.199 
just Jam a socket on the square head
that's<00:02:02.700> usually<00:02:03.119> there<00:02:05.479> well<00:02:06.479> pop<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:08.209> gauge

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
that's usually there well pop this gauge

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.830 
that's usually there well pop this gauge
