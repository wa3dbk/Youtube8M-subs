00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.100 

so<00:00:41.010> if<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.550> lose<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.000> crown<00:00:42.329> somebody<00:00:42.960> else

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
can figure it out that is interesting to

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:56.120 
can figure it out that is interesting to
say<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:45.989> least

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:25.730 

Oh<00:01:02.960> mr.<00:01:03.960> Popkin<00:01:11.360> hey<00:01:21.380> I<00:01:23.780> guess<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.810> did<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.530> you

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
Oh mr. Popkin hey I guess I did if you

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.000 
Oh mr. Popkin hey I guess I did if you
get<00:01:26.190> too<00:01:26.970> far<00:01:27.150> behind<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:30.680> so<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
get too far behind it so a

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.520 
get too far behind it so a
recommendation<00:01:32.550> it's<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.630> little<00:01:33.810> bit<00:01:34.050> easier

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
recommendation it's a little bit easier

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.440 
recommendation it's a little bit easier
to<00:01:34.619> play<00:01:34.979> with<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.280> gamepad<00:01:35.820> than<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.300> with

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
to play with the gamepad than it is with

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.719 
to play with the gamepad than it is with
the<00:01:36.630> new<00:01:36.810> limo<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.860> window<00:01:38.250> you're<00:01:38.520> using

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
the new limo the the window you're using

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.050 
the new limo the the window you're using
a<00:01:38.910> d-pad<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.660> control<00:01:40.080> step<00:01:40.410> the<00:01:41.220> Nintendo<00:01:41.880> game

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
a d-pad I control step the Nintendo game

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.850 
a d-pad I control step the Nintendo game
pad<00:01:42.300> you<00:01:42.420> actually<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.900> you<00:01:43.170> know<00:01:43.259> joystick

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
pad you actually get a you know joystick

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.050 
pad you actually get a you know joystick
so<00:01:44.130> you'd<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.550> little<00:01:44.729> bit<00:01:44.910> more<00:01:45.030> control

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
so you'd have a little bit more control

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.450 
so you'd have a little bit more control
just<00:01:48.060> my<00:01:48.360> humble<00:01:49.020> observation<00:01:49.950> oh<00:01:52.280> you<00:01:53.280> mean

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
just my humble observation oh you mean

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.690 
just my humble observation oh you mean
look<00:01:53.910> at<00:01:53.940> the<00:01:54.570> screen<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.050> views<00:01:55.259> yes<00:01:55.800> you

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830
