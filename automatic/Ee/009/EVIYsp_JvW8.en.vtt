00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
basically I always liked taking this

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.770 
basically I always liked taking this
route<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.590> underpass<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.059> check<00:00:39.600> up

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
route on underpass just so you check up

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.470 
route on underpass just so you check up
in<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.320> little<00:00:40.500> building<00:00:40.980> right<00:00:41.280> here

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
in this little building right here

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.090 
in this little building right here
usually<00:00:42.480> there's<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:43.050> or<00:00:43.170> two<00:00:43.200> snipers<00:00:43.559> just

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
usually there's one or two snipers just

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.250 
usually there's one or two snipers just
aim<00:00:44.309> down<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> sights<00:00:44.809> snipe<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.989> through<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
aim down the sights snipe in through the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.350 
aim down the sights snipe in through the
middle<00:00:46.500> but<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.219> guess<00:00:47.399> there's<00:00:47.820> none<00:00:48.210> over

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
middle but I guess there's none over

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.450 
middle but I guess there's none over
here<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.260> i<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:49.590> passed<00:00:50.010> through<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> right

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
here so i just passed through the right

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.860 
here so i just passed through the right
side<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.760> map<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.180> I'll<00:00:51.239> flank<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.690> from

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
side of the map and I'll flank it from

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.900 
side of the map and I'll flank it from
behind<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.530> know<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.730> this

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
behind and I know to have to be on this

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.380 
behind and I know to have to be on this
side<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.590> I<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:56.399> went<00:00:56.579> through<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.879> right

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
side as I just went through the right

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.310 
side as I just went through the right

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.410 
bullets to the chest and you have to
have<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.810> pretty<00:01:24.960> fast<00:01:25.259> trigger<00:01:25.470> finger<00:01:25.890> I

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.140 
couple people from long range and down
there<00:02:38.519> we<00:02:38.610> go<00:02:38.730> on<00:02:39.599> my<00:02:39.810> last<00:02:40.050> bullet<00:02:40.410> so<00:02:41.310> calling

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
there we go on my last bullet so calling

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.820 
there we go on my last bullet so calling
the<00:02:42.209> Harrier<00:02:42.530> obviously<00:02:43.530> where<00:02:43.709> they're

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
the Harrier obviously where they're

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.380 
the Harrier obviously where they're
going<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.040> spawn<00:02:44.310> look<00:02:44.670> around<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:44.970> red<00:02:45.150> dots

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
going to spawn look around the red dots

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.059 
going to spawn look around the red dots
and<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:46.319> level<00:02:47.160> up

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
and I level up

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.920 
and I level up
I<00:02:48.129> think<00:02:48.730> it's<00:02:48.819> level<00:02:48.999> 61<00:02:50.400> basically<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
I think it's level 61 basically the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.589 
I think it's level 61 basically the
Harrier<00:02:53.349> does<00:02:54.010> quite<00:02:54.219> a<00:02:54.280> bit<00:02:54.459> actually<00:02:54.609> but<00:02:55.329> in

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
Harrier does quite a bit actually but in

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.520 
Harrier does quite a bit actually but in
this<00:02:56.230> game<00:02:56.379> I<00:02:56.889> finding<00:02:57.840> more<00:02:58.840> recent<00:02:59.319> games

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
this game I finding more recent games

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.300 
this game I finding more recent games
the<00:02:59.769> Harrier<00:03:00.099> hasn't<00:03:00.430> been<00:03:00.519> doing<00:03:00.670> much<00:03:00.909> and

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
the Harrier hasn't been doing much and

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.390 
the Harrier hasn't been doing much and
the<00:03:03.310> air<00:03:03.459> strike<00:03:03.790> might<00:03:04.180> get<00:03:04.389> one<00:03:05.049> kill<00:03:05.400> then

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
the air strike might get one kill then

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.110 
the air strike might get one kill then
the<00:03:06.670> shooting<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:07.719> hair<00:03:07.950> might<00:03:08.950> get<00:03:09.219> to<00:03:10.829> so

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
the shooting of the hair might get to so

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.349 
the shooting of the hair might get to so
I'm<00:03:13.120> kind<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:13.900> slowly<00:03:14.889> and<00:03:15.189> slowly<00:03:15.370> migrating

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
I'm kind of slowly and slowly migrating

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.379 
I'm kind of slowly and slowly migrating
away<00:03:16.480> from<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.900> Harrier<00:03:17.459> but<00:03:18.459> it's<00:03:19.150> pretty

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
away from the Harrier but it's pretty

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.800 
away from the Harrier but it's pretty
solid<00:03:19.799> seven<00:03:20.799> kills<00:03:20.980> for<00:03:21.099> you<00:03:21.159> have<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.519> admit

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
solid seven kills for you have to admit

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.479 
solid seven kills for you have to admit
especially<00:03:22.810> if<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.139> power<00:03:23.859> of<00:03:24.219> it<00:03:24.340> has

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
especially if the power of it has

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.229 
especially if the power of it has
sometimes<00:03:25.349> not<00:03:26.349> all<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.560> time<00:03:27.239> especially

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
sometimes not all the time especially

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.599 
sometimes not all the time especially
because<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.079> can't<00:03:29.290> move<00:03:29.469> around<00:03:29.620> which<00:03:30.310> is

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
because it can't move around which is

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.080 
because it can't move around which is
one<00:03:30.969> of<00:03:31.000> its<00:03:31.209> flaws<00:03:31.629> but<00:03:32.079> then<00:03:32.769> again<00:03:33.090> it's

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
one of its flaws but then again it's

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.720 
one of its flaws but then again it's
pretty<00:03:34.389> much<00:03:34.599> be<00:03:34.989> attack<00:03:35.349> helicopter<00:03:36.010> with

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
pretty much be attack helicopter with

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.770 
pretty much be attack helicopter with
the<00:03:37.000> air<00:03:37.689> strike<00:03:37.959> if<00:03:38.319> it<00:03:38.530> didn't<00:03:39.069> stay<00:03:39.310> still

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
the air strike if it didn't stay still

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.929 
the air strike if it didn't stay still
so<00:03:40.859> basically<00:03:41.859> I'm<00:03:42.189> just<00:03:42.219> trying<00:03:42.639> to<00:03:42.699> stay

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:42.939 
so basically I'm just trying to stay

here<00:04:18.009> and<00:04:19.079> I<00:04:20.370> don't<00:04:21.370> go<00:04:21.729> amazing<00:04:22.330> with<00:04:22.449> the

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:22.509 
here and I don't go amazing with the

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:24.120 
here and I don't go amazing with the
chopper<00:04:22.840> gunner<00:04:23.020> but<00:04:23.229> I<00:04:23.289> get<00:04:23.470> maybe<00:04:23.770> around

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
chopper gunner but I get maybe around

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.180 
chopper gunner but I get maybe around
eight<00:04:24.690> kills<00:04:25.690> which<00:04:26.080> is<00:04:26.259> which<00:04:26.860> is<00:04:26.889> decent

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
eight kills which is which is decent

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.800 
eight kills which is which is decent
probably<00:04:27.789> around<00:04:27.849> the<00:04:28.000> average

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
probably around the average

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.680 
probably around the average
and<00:04:31.300> yeah<00:04:32.300> as<00:04:32.600> you<00:04:32.720> can<00:04:32.870> see<00:04:33.050> here<00:04:33.320> it's<00:04:34.190> just

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
and yeah as you can see here it's just

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.060 
and yeah as you can see here it's just
they're<00:04:35.690> just<00:04:35.720> staying<00:04:36.020> inside<00:04:36.290> and<00:04:36.830> this

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
they're just staying inside and this

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.970 
they're just staying inside and this
bridge<00:04:37.460> on<00:04:37.940> underpass<00:04:38.590> prevents<00:04:39.590> you<00:04:39.710> from<00:04:39.740> a

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
bridge on underpass prevents you from a

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.640 
bridge on underpass prevents you from a
lot<00:04:40.160> of<00:04:40.280> kills<00:04:40.750> sometimes<00:04:41.750> especially<00:04:42.200> at<00:04:42.530> the

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
lot of kills sometimes especially at the

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.810 
lot of kills sometimes especially at the
route<00:04:42.830> that<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:43.100> chopper<00:04:43.370> gunner<00:04:43.550> always

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
route that the chopper gunner always

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.790 
route that the chopper gunner always
takes<00:04:44.060> on<00:04:44.240> this<00:04:44.300> map<00:04:44.540> it's<00:04:45.080> not<00:04:45.200> the<00:04:45.350> best<00:04:45.530> as

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
takes on this map it's not the best as

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.040 
takes on this map it's not the best as
it<00:04:46.220> flies<00:04:46.580> around<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:47.030> map<00:04:47.270> couple<00:04:47.840> times

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
it flies around the map couple times

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.730 
it flies around the map couple times
I've<00:04:48.770> actually<00:04:48.980> fast<00:04:49.370> and<00:04:50.139> the<00:04:51.139> angles<00:04:51.560> that

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
I've actually fast and the angles that

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.780 
I've actually fast and the angles that
it<00:04:51.980> comes<00:04:52.310> over<00:04:52.639> aren't<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.090> best<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:54.580> I'm<00:04:55.580> not

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
it comes over aren't the best so I'm not

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.000 
it comes over aren't the best so I'm not
sure<00:04:56.000> if<00:04:56.090> an<00:04:56.180> ac-130<00:04:56.840> would<00:04:57.020> be<00:04:57.169> better<00:04:57.590> on

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
sure if an ac-130 would be better on

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.270 
sure if an ac-130 would be better on
this<00:04:58.370> map<00:04:58.610> as<00:04:59.139> the<00:05:00.139> buildings<00:05:00.620> and<00:05:00.830> stuff<00:05:00.980> I

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
this map as the buildings and stuff I

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.070 
this map as the buildings and stuff I
would<00:05:01.550> rather<00:05:01.639> have<00:05:01.940> a<00:05:02.210> chopper<00:05:02.510> gunner<00:05:02.540> as<00:05:02.930> it

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
would rather have a chopper gunner as it

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.870 
would rather have a chopper gunner as it
stays<00:05:03.290> out<00:05:03.440> longer<00:05:03.650> especially<00:05:04.400> if<00:05:04.700> you<00:05:04.760> can

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
stays out longer especially if you can

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.430 
stays out longer especially if you can
get<00:05:04.970> a<00:05:05.000> spawn<00:05:05.270> trap<00:05:05.510> going<00:05:05.810> right<00:05:05.990> here<00:05:06.260> where

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
get a spawn trap going right here where

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.100 
get a spawn trap going right here where
I'm<00:05:06.530> looking<00:05:06.650> right<00:05:06.889> now<00:05:07.270> that<00:05:08.270> can<00:05:08.660> be<00:05:08.840> some

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
I'm looking right now that can be some

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.250 
I'm looking right now that can be some
brutal<00:05:09.650> work<00:05:10.479> that's<00:05:11.479> the<00:05:11.660> one<00:05:11.840> time<00:05:12.020> where<00:05:12.169> I

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
brutal work that's the one time where I

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.560 
brutal work that's the one time where I
got<00:05:12.410> a<00:05:12.440> tactical<00:05:12.979> nuke<00:05:13.010> on<00:05:13.310> this<00:05:13.490> map<00:05:13.700> I<00:05:13.910> end<00:05:14.540> up

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
got a tactical nuke on this map I end up

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.090 
got a tactical nuke on this map I end up
getting<00:05:15.729> spawn<00:05:16.729> trap<00:05:16.970> right<00:05:17.150> there<00:05:17.210> on

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
getting spawn trap right there on

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.490 
getting spawn trap right there on
domination<00:05:19.100> I<00:05:19.250> think<00:05:19.550> we<00:05:19.610> see<00:05:19.820> and<00:05:20.290> that's<00:05:21.290> how

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
domination I think we see and that's how

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.570 
domination I think we see and that's how
it<00:05:21.680> turned<00:05:21.889> out<00:05:22.150> so<00:05:23.150> basically<00:05:23.570> i<00:05:24.580> just

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
it turned out so basically i just

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.400 
it turned out so basically i just
finished<00:05:26.300> off<00:05:26.450> my<00:05:26.479> chopper<00:05:26.930> gunner<00:05:27.169> i'm

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
I don't know to deepen their spawn as I

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.260 
I don't know to deepen their spawn as I
know<00:05:31.100> they're<00:05:31.430> all<00:05:31.520> spawning<00:05:31.820> back<00:05:32.060> here

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
know they're all spawning back here
