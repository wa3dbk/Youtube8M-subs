00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 and so we continue the complex 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.639
 maintenance work before starting 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.540
 active cycling season today we will analyze 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.639
 brush grease and adjust the sleeve 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.980
 rear wheel and ratchet 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.160
 for this we remove the wheel from the bicycle and 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:28.920
 we start dismantling it first thing 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:38.520
 We remove their son clique clamp and at the same time 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:40.050
 do not lose the springs further unscrew 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.899
 lock nut 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.899
 for this we need a key for 17 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.170
 remove the lock-nut further so that we do not 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.950
 interfered with shooting a cassette of stars for this 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.979
 we need this one or this one 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:27.369
 pullers 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:29.909
 dress puller fix cassette 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.909
 whip 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:53.549
 and unscrew the nut 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:57.590
 which fixes the tape further we 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:04.039
 take shaybochku and we get to 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.810
 cassettes remove the tape here we see 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:09.390
 cone nut 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.470
 at the removed cone nut kontra Raika 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.470
 unscrewed 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.180
 with 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:47.959
 remove the flare nut and gently 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:53.180
 We take out the axis further we remove 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:58.459
 seal and and gently take out 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:00.890
 bulk bearings pulled bulk 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.709
 bearings we get to the very 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.500
 ratchet 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.319
 inside we see a flare nut which 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.140
 fixes the ratchet itself to her 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.069
 disable you need to hook something here 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.280
 side apiary 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:23.360
 for this we use the old Soviet 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:25.840
 family key and 1 by its side we catch these 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.840
 tongs 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:51.299
 unscrewing the nut remove the drum itself 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.939
 ratchets here as we see two rows 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:57.930
 bulk bearings 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:04:02.549
 1 and inside 2 also preferably not 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.260
 lose these bearings and so here's how 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.569
 it all looks disassembled un 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.409
 purified state 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:12.439
 axle clamps eccentrics carrying axle with 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:16.049
 bulk bearings 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:18.720
 stubs on bar bearings drum 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.930
 ratchet bulk balls 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:26.310
 bearing ratchet nut which 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.830
 clamps the ratchet cassette of stars 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.320
 high court clamping and fixing 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.860
 a cassette of stars and herself 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.930
 ratchet with petals 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.930
 spring loaded it is all cleaned 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:44.159
 lubricated by new grease and going to 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:46.610
 reverse order when assembling pay 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:50.550
 attention that the balls need to stick 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:54.830
 the wheel itself they are to the drum otherwise 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.830
 will put on these removable petals 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.620
 brushing off having assembled the rear hub 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.960
 as well as ratchet check tightening 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.660
 taper nuts for this we need 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.560
 tighten the nuts so that the axle does not 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:22.050
 gave a backlash 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:24.930
 but at the same time the wheel rotated easily after 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.440
 this tighten the lock-nut and you can 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.000
 set the wheel on the bike 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.120
