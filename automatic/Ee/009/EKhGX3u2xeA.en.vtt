00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.920 
get shots we didn't have time to get but
doing<00:04:55.280> 24<00:04:55.729> episodes<00:04:56.180> was<00:04:56.449> extraordinarily

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
doing 24 episodes was extraordinarily

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.960 
doing 24 episodes was extraordinarily
difficult<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:58.130> actually<00:04:58.550> what<00:04:58.669> was<00:04:58.820> even

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
difficult and actually what was even

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.659 
difficult and actually what was even
more<00:04:59.000> difficult<00:04:59.419> was<00:04:59.930> we<00:05:00.500> had<00:05:00.680> only<00:05:00.979> six<00:05:01.490> weeks

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
more difficult was we had only six weeks

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.909 
more difficult was we had only six weeks
in<00:05:01.910> between<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:03.110> end<00:05:03.289> of<00:05:03.380> production<00:05:03.560> and<00:05:03.830> the

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
in between the end of production and the

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.400 
in between the end of production and the
starter<00:05:04.250> production<00:05:04.610> on<00:05:04.699> season<00:05:05.600> four<00:05:06.020> so<00:05:06.350> it

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
starter production on season four so it

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.290 
starter production on season four so it
was<00:05:06.500> actually<00:05:06.740> it<00:05:07.340> actually<00:05:07.699> felt<00:05:07.910> like<00:05:08.060> doing

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
was actually it actually felt like doing

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.800 
was actually it actually felt like doing

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
the first season because she didn't want

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.270 
the first season because she didn't want
to<00:05:59.630> know<00:05:59.750> what<00:06:00.050> else<00:06:00.230> was<00:06:00.380> going<00:06:00.410> on<00:06:00.740> because

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
going on I think I was really smart

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.710 
going on I think I was really smart
although<00:06:04.490> I<00:06:04.520> prefer<00:06:04.730> Siri<00:06:05.120> call<00:06:05.270> script<00:06:05.600> now

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
although I prefer Siri call script now

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.620 
although I prefer Siri call script now
cause<00:06:06.710> she's<00:06:06.860> supposed<00:06:07.070> to<00:06:07.130> know<00:06:07.340> but<00:06:07.970> if<00:06:08.390> they

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
cause she's supposed to know but if they

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.190 
cause she's supposed to know but if they
know<00:06:08.870> too<00:06:08.930> much<00:06:09.410> they're<00:06:10.250> acting<00:06:11.020> with<00:06:12.020> the

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 
know too much they're acting with the

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.020 
know too much they're acting with the
knowledge<00:06:12.380> of<00:06:12.830> what's<00:06:13.100> going<00:06:13.280> to<00:06:13.460> happen<00:06:13.820> or

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
knowledge of what's going to happen or

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.970 
knowledge of what's going to happen or
not<00:06:14.060> acting<00:06:14.480> in<00:06:14.630> the<00:06:14.810> moment<00:06:15.140> so<00:06:15.620> I<00:06:15.650> think<00:06:15.800> you

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
not acting in the moment so I think you

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.530 
not acting in the moment so I think you
actually<00:06:16.100> get<00:06:16.370> it<00:06:16.430> for<00:06:16.580> a<00:06:16.610> better<00:06:16.940> performance

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
actually get it for a better performance

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.279 
actually get it for a better performance
when<00:06:17.750> they<00:06:17.840> don't<00:06:18.020> know

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.249
