00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:34.220 
thinking so I think her superpower would
be<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.599> ability<00:00:28.990> to<00:00:29.230> read<00:00:29.529> minds<00:00:33.150> my

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
be the ability to read minds my

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.330 
be the ability to read minds my
superpower<00:00:35.230> would<00:00:35.530> probably<00:00:35.950> have<00:00:36.040> to<00:00:36.070> be<00:00:36.190> to

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
superpower would probably have to be to

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.400 
superpower would probably have to be to
teleport<00:00:36.820> because<00:00:37.450> like<00:00:37.630> you<00:00:38.110> don't<00:00:38.260> have

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
teleport because like you don't have

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.200 
teleport because like you don't have
like<00:00:38.559> that<00:00:38.770> one<00:00:39.010> day<00:00:39.190> off<00:00:39.370> in<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:39.670> week<00:00:39.760> where

was<00:03:06.000> hard<00:03:06.270> because<00:03:06.660> like<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:09.030> said<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.600> town<00:03:10.200> God

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
was hard because like I said a town God

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.120 
was hard because like I said a town God
is<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.430> same<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:13.170> for<00:03:13.380> her<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.500> go<00:03:13.739> back<00:03:13.950> to

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
is the same and so for her to go back to

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.170 
is the same and so for her to go back to
her<00:03:14.250> home<00:03:14.430> state<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.120> kind<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:16.020> you<00:03:16.320> know

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180

compete<00:03:18.180> in<00:03:18.360> front<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:18.750> those<00:03:18.900> for<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.470> coach

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
compete in front of those for the coach

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.340 
compete in front of those for the coach
that<00:03:19.800> she<00:03:20.010> just<00:03:20.190> loves<00:03:20.520> you<00:03:20.880> know<00:03:21.060> um<00:03:21.420> would<00:03:22.170> be

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
that she just loves you know um would be

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.220 
that she just loves you know um would be
at<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.680> University<00:03:23.100> of<00:03:23.130> Georgia<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:24.200> so<00:03:25.200> I

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
at the University of Georgia and so I

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.370 
at the University of Georgia and so I
think<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.890> was<00:03:26.040> more<00:03:26.340> for<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:27.080> atmosphere<00:03:28.080> and

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
think it was more for the atmosphere and

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.380 
think it was more for the atmosphere and
for<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.770> environment<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.459> then<00:03:29.670> necessarily

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
for the environment and then necessarily

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.710 
for the environment and then necessarily
there<00:03:30.600> June<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:31.650> okay<00:03:32.550> I<00:03:32.850> know<00:03:33.150> this<00:03:33.330> is<00:03:33.630> like

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360
