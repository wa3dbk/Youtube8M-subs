00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
to look pretty cool Tom the servo

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.759 
to look pretty cool Tom the servo
actually<00:04:04.790> seems<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.150> do<00:04:05.360> pretty<00:04:05.660> well<00:04:05.769> keep

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
actually seems to do pretty well keep

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.670 
actually seems to do pretty well keep
turning<00:04:07.099> it<00:04:07.190> turn<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.430> other<00:04:07.640> way

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
turning it turn the other way

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.240 
turning it turn the other way
you<00:04:09.680> know<00:04:09.799> we're<00:04:09.980> dry<00:04:10.450> on<00:04:11.450> ground<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:12.250> it's

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
you know we're dry on ground and it's

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.750 
you know we're dry on ground and it's
able<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.549> go<00:04:13.640> almost<00:04:13.849> full<00:04:14.239> lock<00:04:15.519> full<00:04:16.519> lock

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
able to go almost full lock full lock

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.479 
able to go almost full lock full lock
there<00:04:17.380> dry<00:04:18.380> on<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.650> ground<00:04:18.859> so<00:04:19.039> we'll<00:04:19.160> see<00:04:19.340> how

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
there dry on the ground so we'll see how

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.250 
there dry on the ground so we'll see how
it<00:04:19.519> holds<00:04:19.880> up<00:04:20.000> a<00:04:20.209> lot<00:04:20.539> of<00:04:20.660> people<00:04:20.900> complained

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
it holds up a lot of people complained

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.710 
it holds up a lot of people complained
about<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.530> servo<00:04:21.829> being<00:04:22.039> weak<00:04:22.310> so<00:04:23.300> far<00:04:23.479> I<00:04:23.510> like

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
about the servo being weak so far I like

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.260 
about the servo being weak so far I like
the<00:04:23.840> feel<00:04:24.050> of<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:24.410> it<00:04:25.130> has<00:04:25.280> decent<00:04:25.639> speed<00:04:25.910> for

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
the feel of it it has decent speed for

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.480 
the feel of it it has decent speed for
what<00:04:26.840> it<00:04:26.960> is<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.380> what<00:04:27.590> it's<00:04:27.770> doing<00:04:27.830> which<00:04:28.340> is

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
what it is and what it's doing which is

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.730 
what it is and what it's doing which is
on<00:04:28.789> the<00:04:28.910> crawler<00:04:29.210> so<00:04:29.570> it<00:04:30.169> doesn't<00:04:30.470> nothing

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
on the crawler so it doesn't nothing

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.370 
on the crawler so it doesn't nothing
needs<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.160> be<00:04:31.280> fast<00:04:31.550> I<00:04:31.789> guess<00:04:31.970> that's<00:04:32.870> a<00:04:33.050> it

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
needs to be fast I guess that's a it
