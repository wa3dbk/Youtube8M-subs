start<00:00:19.859> with<00:00:20.359> question<00:00:21.359> which<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.320> the

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
start with question which of the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.590 
start with question which of the
following<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.980> not<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.609> result<00:00:24.300> of

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
following is not a result of

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.460 
following is not a result of
nondisjunction<00:00:26.210> of<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.480> sex<00:00:27.779> chromosomes

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.800 
nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes
and<00:00:28.800> he<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> five<00:00:29.699> answer<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.630> may

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
and he is a five answer that you may

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.220 
and he is a five answer that you may
choose<00:00:31.019> from<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:32.340> will<00:00:32.640> start<00:00:33.059> from<00:00:33.690> answer

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
choose from and I will start from answer

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.250 
choose from and I will start from answer
D<00:00:34.440> planning<00:00:35.340> filter<00:00:35.760> syndrome<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.989> going

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
D planning filter syndrome this is going

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.119 
D planning filter syndrome this is going
to<00:00:37.469> be<00:00:37.680> due<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.790> non<00:00:39.000> disjunction<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.829> sex

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
to be due to non disjunction of the sex

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.250 
to be due to non disjunction of the sex
chromosome<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.090> phenotypically<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.110> is

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
chromosome and phenotypically this is

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.940 
chromosome and phenotypically this is
going<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.890> well<00:00:44.610> with<00:00:45.149> two<00:00:45.750> X<00:00:46.110> chromosome

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
going to be well with two X chromosome

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.540 
going to be well with two X chromosome
so<00:00:48.230> this<00:00:49.230> would<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.620> X<00:00:49.920> X<00:00:50.660> Y<00:00:51.770> so<00:00:52.770> phenotypically

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
so this would be X X Y so phenotypically

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.450 
so this would be X X Y so phenotypically
this<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.390> be<00:00:54.539> male<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:55.649> would<00:00:56.129> have

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
this is going to be male but would have

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.729 
this is going to be male but would have
one<00:00:56.910> extra<00:00:57.570> X<00:00:58.050> chromosome<00:00:58.620> so<00:01:00.079> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.260> due<00:01:01.680> to

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
one extra X chromosome so this is due to

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.160 
one extra X chromosome so this is due to
non<00:01:02.340> disjunction<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.449> sex<00:01:03.719> chromosome<00:01:04.350> so

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
non disjunction of the sex chromosome so

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.140 
non disjunction of the sex chromosome so
we<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.950> search<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:10.430> answer<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.610> is

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
we have to search for the answer that is

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.730 
we have to search for the answer that is
not<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:13.310> result<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.610> nondisjunction<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:16.140> this

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
not a result of nondisjunction and this

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.160 
not a result of nondisjunction and this
is<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.100> result<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.790> nondisjunction<00:01:18.360> this

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
is a result of nondisjunction this

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.999 
is a result of nondisjunction this
answer<00:01:19.590> D<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.729> let's<00:01:21.119> move<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.200> answer<00:01:22.770> C

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
answer D so let's move to the answer C

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.230 
answer D so let's move to the answer C
Turner<00:01:23.850> syndrome<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:25.580> also<00:01:26.580> due<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.880> non

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
Turner syndrome is also due to non

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.990 
Turner syndrome is also due to non
disjunction<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.380> sex<00:01:28.650> chromosome<00:01:29.369> this

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
disjunction of the sex chromosome this

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.289 
disjunction of the sex chromosome this
is<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> condition<00:01:30.869> when<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.530> have<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:32.009> female<00:01:32.299> but

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
is a condition when we have a female but

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.100 
is a condition when we have a female but
instead<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.320> having<00:01:34.979> two<00:01:35.490> X<00:01:35.820> chromosome<00:01:36.450> such

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
instead of having two X chromosome such

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.789 
instead of having two X chromosome such
female<00:01:37.560> would<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:38.130> only<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.850> x<00:01:39.150> chromosome

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
female would have only one x chromosome

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.800 
female would have only one x chromosome
so<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.130> will<00:01:41.369> be<00:01:41.640> X<00:01:41.939> or<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:44.810> phenotypically

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
so this will be X or and phenotypically

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.380 
so this will be X or and phenotypically
as<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.439> said<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.040> going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.490> be<00:01:47.670> female<00:01:48.659> and

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
as I said this is going to be female and

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.190 
as I said this is going to be female and
answer<00:01:51.390> B<00:01:51.600> bar<00:01:52.140> body<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.799> bar<00:01:53.369> body<00:01:53.810> is<00:01:55.880> just

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
answer B bar body and bar body is just

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.530 
answer B bar body and bar body is just
inactive<00:01:58.200> one<00:01:58.560> X<00:01:58.890> chromosome<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.390> is

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
inactive one X chromosome and this is

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.639 
inactive one X chromosome and this is
normal<00:02:00.960> condition<00:02:01.619> all<00:02:01.850> females<00:02:02.850> has<00:02:03.149> two<00:02:04.020> X

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
normal condition all females has two X

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.249 
normal condition all females has two X
chromosome<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.719> in<00:02:06.719> each<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:08.149> one<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.569> X

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
chromosome and in each so one of the X

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.449 
chromosome and in each so one of the X
chromosomes<00:02:10.739> would<00:02:11.280> be

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
chromosomes would be

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.330 
chromosomes would be
turn<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:12.819> off<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.420> would<00:02:14.230> form<00:02:14.560> a<00:02:14.769> bar<00:02:15.069> body

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
turn it off and would form a bar body

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.030 
turn it off and would form a bar body
and<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:16.209> is<00:02:16.269> normal<00:02:16.840> process<00:02:17.349> and<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:17.859> is

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
and this is normal process and this is

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.959 
and this is normal process and this is
has<00:02:18.310> nothing<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.819> do<00:02:19.060> with<00:02:19.950> nondisjunction<00:02:20.969> of

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:21.969 
has nothing to do with nondisjunction of

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:26.780 
has nothing to do with nondisjunction of
the<00:02:22.390> sex<00:02:22.659> chromosomes<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:25.510> would<00:02:25.750> be<00:02:25.989> our

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
the sex chromosomes so this would be our

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.050 
the sex chromosomes so this would be our
answer<00:02:27.900> here<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:31.439> the<00:02:32.439> last<00:02:32.730> choice<00:02:33.730> would<00:02:34.030> be

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
answer here and the last choice would be

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.229 
answer here and the last choice would be
Down<00:02:34.689> syndrome<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.439> Down<00:02:35.950> syndrome<00:02:36.489> is<00:02:36.700> due

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
Down syndrome and Down syndrome is due

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.940 
Down syndrome and Down syndrome is due
to<00:02:37.510> unknown<00:02:38.409> disjunction<00:02:39.189> of<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:40.329> chromosome

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
to unknown disjunction of the chromosome

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.179 
to unknown disjunction of the chromosome
/<00:02:42.629> 21<00:02:43.629> so<00:02:44.459> there<00:02:45.459> would<00:02:45.669> be<00:02:45.700> three<00:02:47.189> chromosomes

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189 
/ 21 so there would be three chromosomes

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.369 
/ 21 so there would be three chromosomes
present<00:02:48.790> in<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.780> pair<00:02:50.019> 21<00:02:50.799> and<00:02:51.069> we<00:02:51.579> call<00:02:51.819> it

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
present in the pair 21 and we call it

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.580 
present in the pair 21 and we call it
such<00:02:53.379> condition<00:02:53.980> Down<00:02:54.189> syndrome<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.590> this

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
such condition Down syndrome and this

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.209 
such condition Down syndrome and this
also<00:02:57.099> would<00:02:57.250> be<00:02:57.280> correct<00:02:57.760> answer<00:02:58.329> because<00:02:59.219> sex

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:00.219 
also would be correct answer because sex

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:05.220 
also would be correct answer because sex
chromosome<00:03:00.909> /<00:03:01.239> is<00:03:01.569> number<00:03:02.319> 23<00:03:03.359> so<00:03:04.359> we<00:03:04.510> have<00:03:04.780> two

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
chromosome / is number 23 so we have two

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.909 
chromosome / is number 23 so we have two
correct<00:03:05.829> answers<00:03:06.010> here<00:03:06.879> so<00:03:07.629> the<00:03:08.590> correct

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:08.919 
correct answers here so the correct

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:13.890 
correct answers here so the correct
answer<00:03:09.459> would<00:03:09.790> be<00:03:10.090> both<00:03:10.419> a<00:03:10.689> and<00:03:11.019> B<00:03:11.439> so<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:13.750> is

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
answer would be both a and B so this is

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.289 
answer would be both a and B so this is
going<00:03:14.139> to<00:03:14.290> be<00:03:14.560> our<00:03:14.950> correct<00:03:15.489> answer

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
going to be our correct answer

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.080 
going to be our correct answer
and<00:03:17.760> let's<00:03:18.760> move<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.959> statement<00:03:20.859> a<00:03:21.129> trait

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
and let's move to statement a trait

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.960 
and let's move to statement a trait

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
situation when two parents wouldn't be

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.379 
situation when two parents wouldn't be

phenotypically affected for for example
let's<00:03:44.319> take<00:03:44.620> on<00:03:45.009> this<00:03:45.280> side<00:03:46.349> we<00:03:47.349> would<00:03:47.530> put<00:03:48.519> a

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
let's take on this side we would put a

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.539 
let's take on this side we would put a
genotype<00:03:49.509> of<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:50.109> father<00:03:50.379> that<00:03:50.919> is<00:03:50.979> going<00:03:51.370> to

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
genotype of the father that is going to

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.280 
genotype of the father that is going to
be<00:03:51.750> heterozygous<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:53.879> wouldn't<00:03:54.879> express<00:03:55.479> any

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
be heterozygous and wouldn't express any

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.780 
be heterozygous and wouldn't express any
disease<00:03:57.040> because<00:03:57.759> he<00:03:58.150> would<00:03:58.359> have<00:03:58.659> one<00:03:59.790> normal

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
disease because he would have one normal

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.979 
disease because he would have one normal
allele<00:04:01.750> that<00:04:02.049> we<00:04:02.590> would<00:04:02.919> designate<00:04:03.159> with

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
allele that we would designate with

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.429 
allele that we would designate with
capital<00:04:04.989> A<00:04:05.109> and<00:04:05.530> one<00:04:06.400> would<00:04:06.639> be<00:04:07.199> small<00:04:08.199> a

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:08.439 
capital A and one would be small a

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:14.789 
capital A and one would be small a
recessive<00:04:09.099> allele<00:04:09.459> and<00:04:11.250> he<00:04:12.250> is<00:04:12.519> a<00:04:13.019> well<00:04:14.019> and<00:04:14.290> on

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
recessive allele and he is a well and on

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.629 
recessive allele and he is a well and on
this<00:04:15.099> site<00:04:15.310> would<00:04:15.609> be<00:04:15.669> female<00:04:16.409> also<00:04:17.579> who<00:04:18.579> is

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
this site would be female also who is

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.140 
this site would be female also who is
going<00:04:18.849> to<00:04:19.060> be<00:04:19.209> heterozygous<00:04:19.829> so<00:04:20.829> one<00:04:21.430> allele

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
going to be heterozygous so one allele

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.090 
going to be heterozygous so one allele
would<00:04:22.419> be<00:04:22.690> normal<00:04:23.650> capital<00:04:24.219> A<00:04:24.400> and

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
would be normal capital A and

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.480 
would be normal capital A and
one<00:04:25.220> would<00:04:25.460> be<00:04:25.490> recessive<00:04:26.420> and<00:04:27.250> let's<00:04:28.250> see

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
one would be recessive and let's see

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.640 
one would be recessive and let's see
what<00:04:28.790> kind<00:04:29.690> of<00:04:29.900> progeny<00:04:30.470> they<00:04:30.770> might<00:04:31.040> have<00:04:31.340> and

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
what kind of progeny they might have and

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.150 
what kind of progeny they might have and
here<00:04:33.650> would<00:04:33.920> be<00:04:34.810> one<00:04:35.810> normal<00:04:36.320> phenotype<00:04:36.560> was

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
here would be one normal phenotype was

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.780 
here would be one normal phenotype was
alleles<00:04:37.760> would<00:04:38.030> be<00:04:38.240> capital<00:04:38.750> a<00:04:39.250> here<00:04:40.250> would<00:04:40.520> be

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
alleles would be capital a here would be

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.710 
alleles would be capital a here would be
once<00:04:41.720> again<00:04:41.870> normal<00:04:42.800> phenotype<00:04:43.270> because<00:04:44.270> at

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
once again normal phenotype because at

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.640 
once again normal phenotype because at
least<00:04:44.960> one<00:04:45.380> allele<00:04:46.310> that<00:04:46.580> is<00:04:47.650> dominant

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
least one allele that is dominant

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.020 
least one allele that is dominant
present<00:04:49.310> here<00:04:49.670> and<00:04:50.260> here<00:04:51.260> would<00:04:52.070> be<00:04:52.370> once

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
present here and here would be once

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.290 
present here and here would be once
again<00:04:53.830> normal<00:04:54.830> phenotype<00:04:55.130> because<00:04:55.850> one

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
again normal phenotype because one

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.620 
again normal phenotype because one
dominant<00:04:56.900> a<00:04:57.110> little<00:04:57.440> present<00:04:57.950> and<00:04:58.240> here<00:04:59.240> we

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
dominant a little present and here we

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.210 
dominant a little present and here we
would<00:04:59.780> see<00:05:01.930> homozygous<00:05:02.930> recessive<00:05:03.740> phenotype

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
would see homozygous recessive phenotype

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.150 
would see homozygous recessive phenotype
so<00:05:05.230> as<00:05:06.230> you<00:05:06.500> see<00:05:06.740> we<00:05:07.460> have<00:05:07.490> here<00:05:08.150> two

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
so as you see we have here two

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.300 
so as you see we have here two
phonetically<00:05:10.160> normal<00:05:11.020> parents<00:05:12.020> but<00:05:12.860> they

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
phonetically normal parents but they

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.890 
phonetically normal parents but they
would<00:05:13.490> have<00:05:13.760> one<00:05:14.950> out<00:05:15.950> of<00:05:16.010> four<00:05:16.550> chances<00:05:17.150> to

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
would have one out of four chances to

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.560 
would have one out of four chances to
have<00:05:19.150> affected<00:05:20.150> child<00:05:21.020> and<00:05:21.760> this<00:05:22.760> contradict

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
have affected child and this contradict

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.370 
have affected child and this contradict
with<00:05:23.960> this<00:05:24.230> statement<00:05:25.090> where<00:05:26.090> at<00:05:26.690> least<00:05:27.020> one

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
with this statement where at least one

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.530 
with this statement where at least one
in<00:05:27.800> the<00:05:28.220> will<00:05:28.400> one<00:05:28.820> parent<00:05:29.750> should<00:05:30.230> be

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
in the will one parent should be

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.660 
in the will one parent should be
affected<00:05:32.540> in<00:05:32.720> order<00:05:33.350> to<00:05:33.500> have<00:05:33.710> affected<00:05:34.370> child

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
affected in order to have affected child

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:42.190 
affected in order to have affected child
so<00:05:35.600> this<00:05:36.080> statement<00:05:37.040> is<00:05:37.520> false<00:05:38.890> so<00:05:39.890> we<00:05:41.200> choose
