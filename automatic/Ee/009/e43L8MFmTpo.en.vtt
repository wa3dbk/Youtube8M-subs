didn't want to completely try hard to
refrain<00:01:23.700> from<00:01:23.729> decorating<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:24.630> sitting

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
refrain from decorating because sitting

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.630 
refrain from decorating because sitting
in<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.350> white<00:01:25.500> walls<00:01:25.799> was<00:01:26.040> becoming<00:01:26.369> very

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
in the white walls was becoming very

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.170 
in the white walls was becoming very
uninspiring<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:28.170> black<00:01:28.970> because<00:01:29.970> those

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
uninspiring and just black because those

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.999 
uninspiring and just black because those
are<00:01:30.329> descriptive<00:01:30.720> words<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> went<00:01:31.920> ahead

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
are descriptive words but I went ahead

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.800

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
and allowed myself to go ahead and worry

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.450 
and allowed myself to go ahead and worry
about<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.380> instead<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.100> worrying<00:01:35.369> about

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
about this instead of worrying about

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.890 
about this instead of worrying about
