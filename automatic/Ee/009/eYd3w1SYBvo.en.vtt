okay<00:00:00.539> here's<00:00:00.840> an<00:00:01.110> example<00:00:01.469> of<00:00:01.829> the

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:02.300 
okay here's an example of the

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.900 
okay here's an example of the
resolutions<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:03.480> framerates<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:04.910> differences

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
resolutions and framerates a differences

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.550 
resolutions and framerates a differences
in<00:00:06.089> slowmotion<00:00:06.330> ability<00:00:07.020> that<00:00:07.200> you<00:00:07.290> get<00:00:07.410> the

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
in slowmotion ability that you get the

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.770 
in slowmotion ability that you get the
gopro<00:00:07.919> hero3<00:00:08.300> currently<00:00:09.300> this<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.510> just

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
gopro hero3 currently this is just

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.680 
gopro hero3 currently this is just
shooting<00:00:10.080> at<00:00:10.200> 1080p<00:00:11.099> at<00:00:11.309> 30<00:00:11.670> frames<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:12.300> second

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
shooting at 1080p at 30 frames a second

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.669 
shooting at 1080p at 30 frames a second
and<00:00:12.780> with<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.049> I'm<00:00:13.200> going<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.380> do<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.530> little

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
and with this I'm going to do a little

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.440 
and with this I'm going to do a little
bit<00:00:13.830> juggling<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.820> can<00:00:14.940> see<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.360> how

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
bit juggling so you can see that how

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:26.359 
bit juggling so you can see that how
much<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.750> can<00:00:15.870> slow<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.260> down<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:16.650> if<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.800> go<00:00:25.369> and

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
much I can slow it down so if I go and

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.620 
much I can slow it down so if I go and
now<00:00:26.550> we're<00:00:26.699> going<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.849> change<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.240> its

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
now we're going to change you to its

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.839 
now we're going to change you to its
fastest<00:00:28.140> frames<00:00:28.470> at<00:00:28.650> 1080p<00:00:29.070> which<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.460> 60

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
fastest frames at 1080p which is 60

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.939 
fastest frames at 1080p which is 60
frames<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.179> second<00:00:30.510> okay<00:00:31.230> that's<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.590> set<00:00:31.800> to

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
frames a second okay that's you set to

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:52.180 
frames a second okay that's you set to
60<00:00:32.520> frames<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.790> second<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.390> same<00:00:33.780> thing<00:00:33.809> again

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.600 

okay<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.250> now<00:00:53.490> we're<00:00:53.700> at<00:00:54.110> 1440<00:00:55.110> resolution<00:00:55.610> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
okay so now we're at 1440 resolution and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.310 
okay so now we're at 1440 resolution and
this<00:00:56.790> is<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.060> fastest<00:00:57.360> frame<00:00:57.510> rate<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.750> 48

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
this is the fastest frame rate is 48

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.560 
this is the fastest frame rate is 48
frames<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.010> second<00:00:59.400> so<00:00:59.970> a<00:01:00.000> little<00:01:00.150> bit<00:01:00.300> slower

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
frames a second so a little bit slower

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.070 
frames a second so a little bit slower
but<00:01:00.930> kind<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.560> higher<00:01:02.190> image<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:03.030> well<00:01:03.210> all

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
but kind of higher image as well all

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:12.540 
but kind of higher image as well all
right<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.410> here<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.620> go

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:21.130 

you

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.540 

right<00:01:22.700> 2.7<00:01:23.700> K<00:01:24.090> resident<00:01:24.800> so<00:01:25.800> a<00:01:26.040> much<00:01:26.340> higher

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
right 2.7 K resident so a much higher

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.460 
right 2.7 K resident so a much higher
resolution<00:01:26.760> than<00:01:27.150> what<00:01:27.720> corporals<00:01:28.230> have<00:01:28.320> done

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
resolution than what corporals have done

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.060 
resolution than what corporals have done
in<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> past<00:01:28.830> and<00:01:29.570> a<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:31.080> only<00:01:31.290> 30<00:01:31.680> frames<00:01:31.980> a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
in the past and a but only 30 frames a

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:46.200 
in the past and a but only 30 frames a
second<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.640> here's<00:01:32.970> what<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.240> looks<00:01:33.300> like

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.209

okay<00:01:50.219> so<00:01:50.549> here's<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.850> fun<00:01:51.030> one<00:01:51.180> here<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.659> 4k

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
okay so here's the fun one here is 4k

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.100 
okay so here's the fun one here is 4k
resolution<00:01:53.820> at<00:01:53.969> its<00:01:54.299> fastest<00:01:54.840> frame<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
resolution at its fastest frame the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.590 
resolution at its fastest frame the
second<00:01:55.380> which<00:01:55.469> is<00:01:55.500> only<00:01:55.680> 15<00:01:56.340> frames<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.240> second

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
second which is only 15 frames a second

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.480 
second which is only 15 frames a second
but<00:01:58.170> if<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:58.350> look<00:01:58.530> at<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.799> actual<00:01:59.189> amount<00:01:59.460> that

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
but if we look at the actual amount that

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.630 
but if we look at the actual amount that
I<00:01:59.640> can<00:01:59.880> be<00:01:59.969> expanded<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.810> 1080p<00:02:01.350> video<00:02:02.189> in

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
I can be expanded on a 1080p video in

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.270 
I can be expanded on a 1080p video in
comparison<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.600> huge<00:02:04.079> amount<00:02:04.409> but<00:02:04.590> let's

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
comparison it is a huge amount but let's

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.490 
comparison it is a huge amount but let's
see<00:02:05.399> how<00:02:05.460> bad<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.030> for<00:02:06.299> like<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:07.020> in

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
see how bad it is for like just in

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.440 
see how bad it is for like just in
talking<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:08.069> like<00:02:08.280> chatter<00:02:08.789> wait<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.209> don't

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
talking just like chatter wait I don't

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.969 
talking just like chatter wait I don't
think<00:02:09.630> it's<00:02:09.810> too<00:02:09.869> much<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.019> problem<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:10.739> in

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
think it's too much a problem but in

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.070 
think it's too much a problem but in
software<00:02:11.459> it's<00:02:11.670> fast<00:02:11.910> motion<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.870> this

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
software it's fast motion like this

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:27.220 
software it's fast motion like this
probably<00:02:13.500> not<00:02:13.739> so<00:02:13.860> good

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.710 

right<00:02:28.260> Wever<00:02:28.620> there<00:02:28.940> okay<00:02:29.940> here's<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.510> the

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
right Wever there okay here's the the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.800 
right Wever there okay here's the the
funner<00:02:31.110> slow-mo<00:02:31.830> stuff<00:02:32.160> this<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.550> at<00:02:32.640> 720p<00:02:33.630> so

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
funner slow-mo stuff this is at 720p so

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.920 
funner slow-mo stuff this is at 720p so
at<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:33.990> moment<00:02:34.110> I'm<00:02:34.530> expanded<00:02:35.310> up<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.930> 1080p

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
at the moment I'm expanded up to 1080p

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.290 
at the moment I'm expanded up to 1080p
but<00:02:37.319> we<00:02:37.500> see<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.860> car<00:02:38.040> size<00:02:38.280> difference<00:02:38.850> in

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
but we see the car size difference in

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.270 
but we see the car size difference in
1080<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:39.930> not<00:02:40.080> huge<00:02:40.500> difference<00:02:40.890> but<00:02:41.040> let's

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
1080 it's not huge difference but let's

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.040 
1080 it's not huge difference but let's
see<00:02:41.459> how<00:02:41.880> much<00:02:42.120> better<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.540> where<00:02:42.810> we<00:02:42.870> bring

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
see how much better it is where we bring

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.560 
see how much better it is where we bring
this<00:02:43.170> down<00:02:43.230> into<00:02:43.560> 24<00:02:44.340> frames<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.240> second

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570
