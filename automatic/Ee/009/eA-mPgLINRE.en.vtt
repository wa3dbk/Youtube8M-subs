just be careful not to fall off it is

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.469 
just be careful not to fall off it is
very<00:01:29.890> easy<00:01:30.009> to<00:01:30.369> do<00:01:30.520> so<00:01:30.759> but<00:01:31.090> if<00:01:31.180> you<00:01:31.270> stay

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
very easy to do so but if you stay

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.770 
very easy to do so but if you stay
fairly<00:01:31.810> still<00:01:32.170> you'll<00:01:32.860> be<00:01:33.009> fine<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:37.450> spot<00:01:37.750> is

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
fairly still you'll be fine this spot is

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.570 
fairly still you'll be fine this spot is
slightly<00:01:38.289> more<00:01:38.560> difficult<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:38.950> pull<00:01:39.130> off<00:01:39.160> and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
slightly more difficult to pull off and

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.340 
slightly more difficult to pull off and
it's<00:01:39.970> more<00:01:40.210> open<00:01:40.570> than<00:01:40.660> the<00:01:40.750> previous<00:01:41.110> spot

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
it's more open than the previous spot

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.950 
it's more open than the previous spot
but<00:01:42.039> it's<00:01:42.220> still<00:01:42.460> a<00:01:42.520> good<00:01:42.700> one<00:01:42.910> you<00:01:43.750> will<00:01:43.869> need

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
but it's still a good one you will need

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.300
