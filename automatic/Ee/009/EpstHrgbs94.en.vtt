00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
shouldn't have too much trouble now this

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.890 
shouldn't have too much trouble now this
is<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.210> epc<00:01:06.210> that's<00:01:06.420> when<00:01:06.510> two<00:01:06.600> gigabyte

version<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.470> put<00:01:08.310> windows<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.689> was

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
version I put windows on it so that was

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.240 
version I put windows on it so that was
pretty<00:01:10.020> easy<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.439> get<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.619> once<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.010> get<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
pretty easy to get on once you get the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.100 
pretty easy to get on once you get the
hang<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.850> used<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.420> program<00:01:12.570> called<00:01:12.840> n

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
hang of it I used a program called n

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.960 
hang of it I used a program called n
light<00:01:13.409> now<00:01:13.830> what<00:01:14.010> n<00:01:14.130> line<00:01:14.369> does<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.820> actually

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
light now what n line does is actually

what it would do is on Anna analyze your
disk<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.850> will<00:01:26.939> take<00:01:27.150> out<00:01:27.360> elements<00:01:27.869> that

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.520 
least amendments that the epc probably
wouldn't<00:01:32.790> use<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.840> would<00:01:33.990> actually<00:01:34.079> remove

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
wouldn't use so it would actually remove

but<00:02:59.239> I<00:02:59.299> mean<00:02:59.510> it<00:03:00.290> is<00:03:00.409> a<00:03:00.440> bit<00:03:00.709> awkward<00:03:00.859> when<00:03:01.159> you

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
but I mean it is a bit awkward when you

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.479 
but I mean it is a bit awkward when you
first<00:03:01.519> start<00:03:01.849> off<00:03:02.230> over<00:03:03.230> old<00:03:03.409> pcs<00:03:03.889> pretty<00:03:04.159> fast

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489

problem as you can see here we'll get a

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
load of space coming up which is quite

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.160 
load of space coming up which is quite
annoying<00:04:38.650> but<00:04:39.400> I<00:04:40.120> might<00:04:40.690> have<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:40.870> have<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.050> look

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
annoying but I might have to have a look

as i said before the the mouse pads are
quite<00:04:46.420> a<00:04:46.450> nice<00:04:46.630> size<00:04:46.930> but<00:04:47.200> you<00:04:47.290> find<00:04:47.560> that

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
quite a nice size but you find that

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.800 
quite a nice size but you find that
