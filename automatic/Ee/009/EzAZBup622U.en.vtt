of different bones once you arrive at
this<00:01:30.540> position<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.350> still<00:01:31.619> rotate<00:01:32.070> it

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
this position you can still rotate it

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.810 
this position you can still rotate it
around<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.780> look<00:01:34.290> at<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.590> individually<00:01:37.820> so

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
all the muscles of mastication and you

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.220 
all the muscles of mastication and you
can<00:03:08.720> rotate<00:03:08.989> this<00:03:09.440> around<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:11.300> view<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.110> from

can rotate this around and view it from

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.040 
can rotate this around and view it from
any<00:03:12.440> angle<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.070> you'd<00:03:13.370> like<00:03:13.610> again<00:03:14.120> we<00:03:14.720> have

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
any angle that you'd like again we have

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.039 
any angle that you'd like again we have
predefined<00:03:16.040> some<00:03:16.400> of<00:03:16.519> these<00:03:16.640> views<00:03:17.090> because

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
predefined some of these views because

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.390 
predefined some of these views because
those<00:03:18.260> are<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.410> ones<00:03:18.560> that<00:03:18.709> we<00:03:18.860> find<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.250> most

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
those are the ones that we find the most

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.039 
those are the ones that we find the most
useful<00:03:19.670> so<00:03:20.060> for<00:03:20.239> instance<00:03:20.570> if<00:03:20.720> you're<00:03:20.840> after

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
useful so for instance if you're after

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.800 
useful so for instance if you're after
the<00:03:21.260> temporalis<00:03:22.060> it'll<00:03:23.060> rotate<00:03:23.239> around<00:03:23.570> a

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
the temporalis it'll rotate around a

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.810 
the temporalis it'll rotate around a
temporalis<00:03:24.590> if<00:03:24.769> you're<00:03:24.920> after<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.489> medial

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
temporalis if you're after the medial

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.780 
temporalis if you're after the medial
pterygoid<00:03:26.090> it'll<00:03:26.690> rotate<00:03:26.870> it<00:03:27.170> around<00:03:27.260> their

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
pterygoid it'll rotate it around their

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.100 
pterygoid it'll rotate it around their
lateral<00:03:28.790> pterygoid<00:03:29.060> that'll<00:03:29.660> show<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:29.900> where

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
lateral pterygoid that'll show you where

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.220 
lateral pterygoid that'll show you where
those<00:03:30.320> are<00:03:30.530> upper<00:03:30.980> body<00:03:31.190> lower<00:03:31.519> body<00:03:32.110> etc<00:03:33.110> the

those are upper body lower body etc the

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.970 
those are upper body lower body etc the
disc<00:03:33.500> posterior<00:03:34.489> attachment<00:03:35.350> etc<00:03:36.350> so<00:03:36.769> these

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
disc posterior attachment etc so these

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.729 
disc posterior attachment etc so these
are<00:03:37.190> very<00:03:37.519> very<00:03:37.820> useful<00:03:38.030> models<00:03:38.750> in<00:03:38.959> figuring

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
are very very useful models in figuring

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.060 
are very very useful models in figuring
out<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:39.920> anatomy<00:03:40.400> of<00:03:40.730> these<00:03:40.880> structures<00:03:42.070> go

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
out the anatomy of these structures go

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.030 
out the anatomy of these structures go
back<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:43.820> section<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:46.269> this<00:03:47.269> is<00:03:47.329> the

this<00:03:51.769> is<00:03:52.010> what<00:03:52.549> kind<00:03:52.910> of<00:03:53.030> movements<00:03:53.540> are

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
this is what kind of movements are

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.990 
this is what kind of movements are
produced<00:03:54.290> with<00:03:54.829> certain<00:03:55.400> muscle<00:03:56.299> actions<00:03:58.000> so

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
produced with certain muscle actions so

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
skull or you can go down and look at the

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.010 
skull or you can go down and look at the
nerves<00:06:45.550> individual<00:06:46.210> in<00:06:46.330> this<00:06:46.450> case<00:06:46.720> let's

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.020 
nerves individual in this case let's

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.290 
nerves individual in this case let's
look<00:06:47.110> at<00:06:47.410> the<00:06:47.560> mandibular<00:06:48.550> branch<00:06:48.910> the

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
look at the mandibular branch the

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.500 
look at the mandibular branch the
trigeminal<00:06:49.540> nerve<00:06:50.550> and<00:06:51.550> you<00:06:51.700> can<00:06:51.880> see<00:06:52.150> we've

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510 
trigeminal nerve and you can see we've

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.420 
trigeminal nerve and you can see we've
thrown<00:06:52.870> away<00:06:52.960> the<00:06:53.170> rest<00:06:53.500> of<00:06:53.680> them<00:06:53.830> and<00:06:54.070> that's

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
thrown away the rest of them and that's

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.480 
thrown away the rest of them and that's
the<00:06:54.550> only<00:06:54.970> one<00:06:55.180> we've<00:06:55.360> got<00:06:56.010> you<00:06:57.010> can<00:06:57.160> look<00:06:57.340> at

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
the only one we've got you can look at

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.000 
the only one we've got you can look at
it<00:06:57.640> as<00:06:57.850> an<00:06:58.030> individual<00:06:58.690> nerve<00:06:59.020> with<00:06:59.470> no<00:06:59.650> skull

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010 
it as an individual nerve with no skull

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.340 
it as an individual nerve with no skull
around<00:07:00.130> it<00:07:00.550> or<00:07:00.730> has<00:07:01.270> a<00:07:01.360> nerve<00:07:01.720> with<00:07:01.930> the<00:07:02.080> skull

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.350 
around it or has a nerve with the skull

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.930 
around it or has a nerve with the skull
around<00:07:02.710> it<00:07:02.920> so<00:07:03.370> look<00:07:03.550> at<00:07:03.640> the<00:07:03.700> trigeminal

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940 
around it so look at the trigeminal

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.450 
around it so look at the trigeminal
nerve<00:07:04.540> all<00:07:05.170> these<00:07:05.470> can<00:07:05.680> be<00:07:05.890> viewed<00:07:06.130> as<00:07:06.430> a

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.460 
nerve all these can be viewed as a

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.640 
nerve all these can be viewed as a
cross-section<00:07:07.450> so<00:07:08.200> if<00:07:08.260> you're<00:07:08.380> just<00:07:08.410> looking

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:08.650 
cross-section so if you're just looking

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.530 
cross-section so if you're just looking
at<00:07:08.890> the<00:07:08.980> half<00:07:09.190> of<00:07:09.430> the<00:07:09.520> skull<00:07:09.850> again<00:07:10.210> you<00:07:10.360> can

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:10.540 
at the half of the skull again you can

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.860 
at the half of the skull again you can
zoom<00:07:10.810> in<00:07:11.110> you<00:07:11.950> can<00:07:11.980> rotate<00:07:12.370> it<00:07:12.610> round<00:07:12.910> see<00:07:13.690> what

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870 
zoom in you can rotate it round see what

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:14.790 
zoom in you can rotate it round see what
for<00:07:14.140> a<00:07:14.230> minute

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800

for a minute
the<00:07:15.460> nerves<00:07:15.700> go<00:07:16.000> through<00:07:16.390> and<00:07:16.720> so<00:07:17.020> this<00:07:17.200> is<00:07:17.320> a

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:17.350 
the nerves go through and so this is a

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.850 
the nerves go through and so this is a
very<00:07:17.680> very<00:07:17.890> excellent<00:07:18.430> way<00:07:18.640> of<00:07:19.770> studying<00:07:20.770> the

very very excellent way of studying the

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.860 
very very excellent way of studying the

described in detail the functions

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.420 
described in detail the functions
described<00:07:29.590> in<00:07:29.770> detail<00:07:31.080> and<00:07:32.080> we<00:07:32.830> go<00:07:32.980> through
