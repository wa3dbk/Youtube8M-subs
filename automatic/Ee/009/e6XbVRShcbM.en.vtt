because<00:02:31.959> it's<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.319> little<00:02:32.620> lower<00:02:32.890> range<00:02:33.519> but<00:02:33.760> I

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
because it's a little lower range but I

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.640 
because it's a little lower range but I
do<00:02:33.909> want<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:34.689> to<00:02:34.870> know<00:02:34.989> that<00:02:35.019> if<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.290> buy<00:02:35.470> and

kind of weird blah blah blah like yeah I
mean<00:04:27.159> when<00:04:27.430> I<00:04:27.610> set<00:04:28.000> comes<00:04:28.300> out<00:04:28.479> and<00:04:28.690> it's

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
mean when I set comes out and it's

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.019 
mean when I set comes out and it's
that's<00:04:29.320> good<00:04:29.770> like<00:04:30.159> content<00:04:30.610> are<00:04:30.700> carry<00:04:30.880> my

00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:31.029 
that's good like content are carry my

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.770 
that's good like content are carry my
opinion<00:04:31.360> sir

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
opinion sir

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.650 
opinion sir
a good<00:04:31.960> set<00:04:32.200> like<00:04:32.410> if<00:04:32.650> you<00:04:33.550> open<00:04:34.000> enough<00:04:34.330> of<00:04:34.510> it

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
a good set like if you open enough of it

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.310 
a good set like if you open enough of it
so<00:04:34.900> variance<00:04:35.380> is<00:04:35.620> not<00:04:35.940> a<00:04:36.940> factor<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:37.780> meaning

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
so variance is not a factor I meaning

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.820 
so variance is not a factor I meaning
when<00:04:38.590> I'm<00:04:38.800> when<00:04:39.280> you<00:04:39.370> open<00:04:39.639> one<00:04:39.820> box<00:04:40.090> it's

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
when I'm when you open one box it's

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.129 
when I'm when you open one box it's
probably<00:04:41.830> you<00:04:42.790> buy<00:04:43.000> a<00:04:43.030> higher<00:04:43.480> price<00:04:43.810> a<00:04:43.840> much

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
probably you buy a higher price a much

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.500 
probably you buy a higher price a much
higher<00:04:44.320> price<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:44.919> secondly<00:04:45.880> if<00:04:46.210> there's

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
higher price and secondly if there's

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.940 
higher price and secondly if there's
more<00:04:46.690> variance<00:04:47.139> you<00:04:47.260> can<00:04:47.380> pull<00:04:47.560> here<00:04:47.740> that<00:04:47.889> you

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
more variance you can pull here that you

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.220 
more variance you can pull here that you
can<00:04:48.040> pull<00:04:48.220> bad<00:04:48.430> if<00:04:48.940> you<00:04:49.060> open<00:04:49.180> a<00:04:49.389> case<00:04:49.720> the

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
can pull bad if you open a case the

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.110 
can pull bad if you open a case the
variance<00:04:50.620> ghost<00:04:50.830> significantly<00:04:51.580> down<00:04:51.850> and

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
variance ghost significantly down and

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.909 
variance ghost significantly down and
the<00:04:52.570> price<00:04:52.840> of<00:04:52.990> each<00:04:53.080> box<00:04:53.440> go<00:04:53.710> significantly

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
the price of each box go significantly

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.180 
the price of each box go significantly
down<00:04:54.490> and<00:04:54.730> my<00:04:54.910> experience<00:04:55.389> at<00:04:55.510> least<00:04:56.160> so<00:04:57.160> I

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
down and my experience at least so I

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.180 
down and my experience at least so I
would<00:04:57.490> definitely<00:04:57.520> say<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:59.050> battle<00:05:00.040> for

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
would definitely say I battle for

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.960 
would definitely say I battle for

zendikar is not war if I mean it is

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.050
