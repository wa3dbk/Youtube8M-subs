 but because he is an idol because he brings the 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:23.329
 American whiskey transfer and like that the 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:28.489

 from how to avoid half in 2010 starts 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.579
 his life of gameplay but without commenting and 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.680
 without like that by experiments not 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.500
 to see them with my friends with the 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.870
 ahead and we play and all that and then more 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.179

 in the first 10 years 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:18.080
 I always say good, I want to dedicate myself to 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:20.560
 this when the snail worked in the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.560
 work 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:40.399
 at the beginning and the prestige because I 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.200
 I did not know damage was not very involved 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.200
 nanny for the campaigns and games 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:58.720
 to the American youtubers the way 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.720
 he told us more goals 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.640
 and life in one more comment 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.789

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.259
 punishments of winning with video games and already 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.259
 It would be good if he did it in Spanish 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:24.010
 in many parts here monterrey 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.010
 guadalupe san nicolÃ¡s 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.010
 al Capone 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:45.030
 the truth is that he is never used to 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.030
 because the people of the people on TV 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.780
 people to see it differently and can not 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.610
 be to consummate it on the back of a keyboard 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.380
 to leave the comments and that 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.370

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.409
 we have for example the east 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.510
 mild in all coexistence and so on 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.879
 this is a whole new world here but 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.860
 is getting used to but if this is a 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:17.629
 show that feels feels very father 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.629
 not live with all the others 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:29.599
