00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.840 

there<00:01:23.550> it<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.590> also<00:01:25.710> feels<00:01:26.250> there's

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.640 

whenever<00:01:36.180> dips<00:01:37.910> so<00:01:38.910> it's<00:01:39.119> 800<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.960> dips<00:01:40.229> down<00:01:40.410> a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
whenever dips so it's 800 it dips down a

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:49.520 
whenever dips so it's 800 it dips down a
bit<00:01:41.160> and<00:01:41.369> then<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.090> goes<00:01:42.270> back<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.840> 800<00:01:48.530> there

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
bit and then it goes back to 800 there

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.999 
bit and then it goes back to 800 there
it<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.710> again

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:04.090 

there<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.700> again

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.540 

check<00:02:04.730> the<00:02:04.880> oil<00:02:05.090> on<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.650> dipstick<00:02:06.650> oil<00:02:07.100> levels

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
check the oil on the dipstick oil levels

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:17.940 
check the oil on the dipstick oil levels
are<00:02:07.670> fine<00:02:10.720> cars<00:02:11.720> not<00:02:11.990> overheating<00:02:16.060> gas<00:02:17.060> is<00:02:17.360> a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
are fine cars not overheating gas is a

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.870 
are fine cars not overheating gas is a
halfway

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.570 

so<00:02:25.480> whenever<00:02:25.720> I'm<00:02:26.050> at<00:02:26.230> idle<00:02:26.970> whether<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:28.180> park

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
so whenever I'm at idle whether in park

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:37.980 
so whenever I'm at idle whether in park
even<00:02:30.580> in<00:02:31.000> in<00:02:31.480> drive<00:02:32.160> if<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.280> break<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.180> car<00:02:36.990> come

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
even in in drive if I break the car come

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.940 
even in in drive if I break the car come
to<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.140> complete<00:02:38.500> stop<00:02:38.740> there<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.070> is<00:02:39.160> again

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
to a complete stop there it is again

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.620 
to a complete stop there it is again
this<00:02:41.950> will<00:02:42.160> happen

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.690
