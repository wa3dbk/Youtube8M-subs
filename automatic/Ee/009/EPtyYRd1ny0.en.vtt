those and I've made a conscious effort

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.590 
those and I've made a conscious effort
in<00:01:06.630> when<00:01:07.500> playing<00:01:07.680> live<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:09.030> try<00:01:09.570> to

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
in when playing live like this to try to

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.320 
in when playing live like this to try to
zoom<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.070> some<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> stuff<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.180> all

to<00:01:12.540> see<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.619> hard<00:01:13.710> because<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
to see it's just hard because this is a

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.170 
to see it's just hard because this is a
very<00:01:15.450> micro<00:01:16.020> intensive<00:01:16.560> game<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.180> it's

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
very micro intensive game and it's

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.570 
very micro intensive game and it's
important<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.280> looking<00:01:20.280> over<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
important to be looking over the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.270 
important to be looking over the
battlefield<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.390> stuff<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.280> whenever

there's an artillery shot or something

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.190 
there's an artillery shot or something
you<00:01:25.710> know<00:01:25.970> when<00:01:26.970> there's<00:01:27.210> not<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> lot<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:27.810> on

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.990 
you know when there's not a lot going on
sometimes<00:01:28.829> I'll<00:01:29.040> zoom<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.670> stuff<00:01:29.850> for

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
sometimes I'll zoom in and stuff for

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.660 
sometimes I'll zoom in and stuff for
that<00:01:30.180> or<00:01:30.450> if<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.720> an<00:01:31.320> opening<00:01:31.829> fire<00:01:32.130> stuff

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
mean it really does a lot of damage and

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.900 
mean it really does a lot of damage and
most<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.990> time<00:02:07.759> you<00:02:08.759> can<00:02:08.789> see

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
most of the time you can see

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.330 
most of the time you can see
you<00:02:10.270> know<00:02:10.420> they<00:02:10.840> will<00:02:11.050> keep<00:02:11.260> firing<00:02:11.800> at<00:02:11.980> your

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340

on<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.460> katana<00:02:15.820> samurai<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.510> if<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.810> do<00:02:16.960> it

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
on the katana samurai so if you do it

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.470 
on the katana samurai so if you do it
right<00:02:17.320> you<00:02:18.040> know<00:02:18.490> it<00:02:18.700> really<00:02:18.850> can<00:02:19.150> mess<00:02:19.300> them

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
right you know it really can mess them

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.270 
right you know it really can mess them
up<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.930> also<00:02:20.110> can<00:02:20.500> make<00:02:20.530> them<00:02:20.860> do<00:02:21.040> some

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
up and it also can make them do some

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.650 
up and it also can make them do some
things<00:02:21.490> when<00:02:21.730> they<00:02:21.820> have<00:02:21.940> an<00:02:22.030> army<00:02:22.300> like<00:02:22.450> this

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
things when they have an army like this

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.590 
things when they have an army like this

superior to mine and I know that I'm not
going<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.900> beat<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:32.860> just<00:02:33.370> went<00:02:33.520> for<00:02:33.640> a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
going to beat it so I just went for a

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.880 
going to beat it so I just went for a
charge<00:02:34.090> on<00:02:34.300> his<00:02:34.480> infantry<00:02:34.960> trying<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.530> gain<00:02:35.710> an

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
charge on his infantry trying to gain an

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.530 
charge on his infantry trying to gain an
advantage<00:02:36.070> there<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:36.850> then<00:02:36.940> tried<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.330> push

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
advantage there and then tried to push

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.460 
advantage there and then tried to push
through<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:38.020> his<00:02:38.230> artillery<00:02:38.880> but<00:02:40.470> that's

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
through to his artillery but that's

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.230 
through to his artillery but that's
pretty<00:02:41.680> much<00:02:41.830> that<00:02:42.160> I'm<00:02:42.340> flanking<00:02:42.790> around<00:02:43.060> him

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
pretty much that I'm flanking around him

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.820 
pretty much that I'm flanking around him
I<00:02:43.270> do<00:02:43.390> have<00:02:43.630> more<00:02:43.810> infantry<00:02:44.290> than<00:02:44.500> him<00:02:44.680> and

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
losing it but due to my Spears almost

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.490 
losing it but due to my Spears almost
being<00:03:06.130> there<00:03:06.540> being<00:03:07.540> in<00:03:07.750> melee<00:03:08.140> with<00:03:08.320> my

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
being there being in melee with my

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.910 
being there being in melee with my
spears<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.970> fire<00:03:10.930> coming<00:03:11.320> in<00:03:11.530> on<00:03:11.680> him

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
spears and the fire coming in on him

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.760 
spears and the fire coming in on him
that<00:03:12.220> combination<00:03:12.780> would<00:03:13.780> be<00:03:14.110> very<00:03:14.320> bad<00:03:14.709> for

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
that combination would be very bad for

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.090 
that combination would be very bad for
him<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.490> so<00:03:16.480> he<00:03:16.510> as<00:03:17.020> you<00:03:17.320> can<00:03:17.470> see<00:03:17.650> on<00:03:17.770> the<00:03:17.890> left

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
which I can capture although at this

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.080

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.720 
know he has to pull back and fire at the
Spears<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:40.360> he's<00:03:40.600> wasting<00:03:41.080> ammo<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:41.830> just

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
so I'm going to leave one unit here to

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.729 
so I'm going to leave one unit here to
capture<00:03:53.770> this<00:03:53.950> shrine<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:55.110> just<00:03:56.110> keep<00:03:56.320> moving

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
capture this shrine and just keep moving

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.880 
capture this shrine and just keep moving
forward<00:03:56.950> everything<00:03:57.520> else<00:03:58.230> here<00:03:59.230> I<00:03:59.260> decide<00:03:59.709> to

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
forward everything else here I decide to

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.590 
forward everything else here I decide to
go<00:04:00.010> ahead<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.430> go<00:04:00.580> after<00:04:00.880> his<00:04:01.000> artillery<00:04:01.360> I

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
go ahead and go after his artillery I

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.180 
go ahead and go after his artillery I
could<00:04:01.810> have<00:04:01.900> went<00:04:02.020> after<00:04:02.290> his<00:04:02.410> infantry<00:04:02.920> but<00:04:03.160> I

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
could have went after his infantry but I

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.310 
could have went after his infantry but I
pretty<00:04:04.000> confident<00:04:04.630> I<00:04:04.720> can<00:04:04.780> outshoot<00:04:05.260> them

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
pretty confident I can outshoot them

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.610 
pretty confident I can outshoot them
there's<00:04:05.770> way<00:04:06.670> more<00:04:06.700> of<00:04:07.330> my<00:04:07.600> men<00:04:07.840> at<00:04:08.110> this<00:04:08.380> point

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
there's way more of my men at this point

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.430 
there's way more of my men at this point
so<00:04:09.400> time<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.150> shut<00:04:10.360> up<00:04:10.480> those<00:04:10.660> artillery<00:04:11.170> so

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
so time to shut up those artillery so

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.170 
so time to shut up those artillery so
that<00:04:11.590> they<00:04:11.739> can't<00:04:12.010> balance<00:04:12.310> this<00:04:12.730> thing<00:04:13.000> out

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
that they can't balance this thing out

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.320 
that they can't balance this thing out
because<00:04:13.989> one<00:04:14.890> lucky<00:04:15.280> hit<00:04:15.459> on<00:04:15.580> my<00:04:15.760> general<00:04:16.209> and

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
because one lucky hit on my general and

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.289 
because one lucky hit on my general and
stuff<00:04:16.540> could<00:04:16.900> actually<00:04:17.169> change<00:04:17.680> this<00:04:18.039> I<00:04:18.340> have

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
stuff could actually change this I have

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.340 
stuff could actually change this I have
done<00:04:19.479> it<00:04:19.690> and

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
done it and

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.160 
done it and
it<00:04:20.620> happen<00:04:21.100> and<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:22.390> know<00:04:22.540> just<00:04:22.900> never

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
it happen and so you know just never

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.940 
it happen and so you know just never
never<00:04:23.910> underestimate<00:04:24.910> units<00:04:25.420> but<00:04:25.990> here<00:04:26.440> some

yeah grassy flatlands map by the way if

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.870 
yeah grassy flatlands map by the way if
you<00:04:55.060> guys<00:04:55.240> couldn't<00:04:55.600> figure<00:04:55.870> out<00:04:55.990> because

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
you guys couldn't figure out because

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.640 
you guys couldn't figure out because
that<00:04:57.880> word<00:04:58.090> no<00:04:58.420> that's<00:04:58.630> called<00:04:58.870> rice<00:04:59.170> fields

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
that word no that's called rice fields

war<00:05:02.410> games<00:05:02.650> my<00:05:03.580> bad<00:05:03.790> but<00:05:04.030> it's<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.330> same

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
war games my bad but it's the same

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.640 
war games my bad but it's the same
things<00:05:04.900> so<00:05:05.830> you<00:05:06.730> know<00:05:06.850> just<00:05:07.120> a<00:05:07.240> flat<00:05:07.600> map<00:05:08.260> which

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
things so you know just a flat map which

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.130 
things so you know just a flat map which
actually<00:05:09.460> for<00:05:10.090> this<00:05:10.270> kind<00:05:10.480> of<00:05:10.570> combat<00:05:10.930> is

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
actually for this kind of combat is

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.600 
actually for this kind of combat is
ideal<00:05:11.590> because<00:05:11.920> there<00:05:12.880> are<00:05:13.030> several<00:05:13.300> times

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
ideal because there are several times

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.350 
ideal because there are several times
those<00:05:15.610> really<00:05:16.030> terrain<00:05:16.420> II<00:05:16.450> maps<00:05:16.810> get<00:05:17.680> it<00:05:18.360> or

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
those really terrain II maps get it or

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.690 
those really terrain II maps get it or
make<00:05:19.660> it<00:05:19.690> really<00:05:20.140> hard<00:05:20.170> to<00:05:20.470> maneuver<00:05:21.010> with<00:05:21.490> the

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
make it really hard to maneuver with the

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.780 
make it really hard to maneuver with the
gun<00:05:22.150> units<00:05:22.570> and<00:05:23.070> sometimes<00:05:24.070> a<00:05:24.220> more<00:05:24.430> male<00:05:24.640> a

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
gun units and sometimes a more male a

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.990 
gun units and sometimes a more male a
heavy<00:05:25.000> army<00:05:25.540> can<00:05:26.200> actually<00:05:26.920> dominate<00:05:27.850> in

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
heavy army can actually dominate in

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.850 
heavy army can actually dominate in
those<00:05:28.150> situations<00:05:28.810> because<00:05:29.170> they<00:05:29.380> can't<00:05:29.620> ever

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
those situations because they can't ever

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.590 
those situations because they can't ever
bring<00:05:30.160> all<00:05:30.340> their<00:05:30.520> guns<00:05:30.760> to<00:05:30.970> bear<00:05:31.120> on<00:05:31.330> you<00:05:31.450> at

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
bring all their guns to bear on you at

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.420 
bring all their guns to bear on you at
once<00:05:31.840> due<00:05:32.080> to<00:05:32.260> Hills<00:05:32.500> being<00:05:32.890> in<00:05:33.040> the<00:05:33.130> way<00:05:33.250> and

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
once due to Hills being in the way and

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.570 
once due to Hills being in the way and
stuff<00:05:33.730> so<00:05:34.690> I<00:05:34.720> usually<00:05:35.620> bring<00:05:35.740> or<00:05:36.100> I've<00:05:36.310> started

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
stuff so I usually bring or I've started

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.220 
stuff so I usually bring or I've started
bringing<00:05:36.850> more<00:05:37.150> melee<00:05:37.600> units<00:05:37.780> in<00:05:38.080> those

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
bringing more melee units in those

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.670 
bringing more melee units in those
situations<00:05:39.300> right<00:05:40.300> here<00:05:40.360> I<00:05:40.930> skip<00:05:41.410> through<00:05:41.560> the

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
situations right here I skip through the

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.520 
situations right here I skip through the
stats<00:05:41.980> because<00:05:42.220> they<00:05:42.460> go<00:05:42.700> forever<00:05:43.200> slowly<00:05:44.200> and

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
stats because they go forever slowly and

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.070 
stats because they go forever slowly and
I<00:05:45.280> don't<00:05:45.490> even<00:05:45.730> remember<00:05:46.030> if<00:05:46.270> I<00:05:46.420> accepted<00:05:46.930> this

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
I don't even remember if I accepted this

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.560 
I don't even remember if I accepted this
veteran<00:05:47.590> or<00:05:47.710> not<00:05:47.890> but<00:05:48.580> we'll<00:05:48.730> take<00:05:48.940> a<00:05:48.970> look<00:05:49.300> at

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
veteran or not but we'll take a look at

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.590
