00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 these are the vga connectors of the 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.070
 video card the signal that has this 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.530
 cpu and this would be the hdmi output signal 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.509
 as you see there this one that is here would be the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.580
 vga I'm going to take it out so they can see the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.960
 connector as it is sad to realize that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.190
 blue 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.690
 this one here 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:30.310
 is the digital tv video image look how 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:36.120
 it's not if you realize the connector is 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:39.840
 a different connector to this one is this one 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.840
 look at the two together 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:48.960
 the dvd and the normal vga 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.520
 it is not the would be if you look here in this 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.970
 team we have 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.790
 the hdmi and the vga these are the cards 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.940
 video video cards can 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:04.480
 bring the normal vga connector or they can 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:08.800
 bring the vga connector would be the blue and the 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.700
 white the way digital video and more them 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.700
 I would go here 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.860
 there would be 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.729
 30 is an account and the blue one we are seeing 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:25.500
 here would we're going to disconnect the of 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:29.170
 hubei and we will connect from whatever 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.320
 let's connect it here you see it would be 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.400
 this 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.400
 if you notice here 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.930
 there would be what is 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.890
 these are the connectors remember 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.020
 hubei and vga we have the hdmi in the 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.510
 modern but we also have this 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.470
 connector that vga the cards to ropes 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.740
 of the ancient vga 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.780
 and this connector 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.770
 we have them also in the cards 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.759
 new and this jointly you gave 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.259
 normal vga account the white dv connector 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.370
 and that would be what you see the two sunsets 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.049
 together 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.840
 it would be this and this does not come down here 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:22.830
 only the vga comes in this and in 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:27.659
 some cards comes this the way and the 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.280
 vga dvi and vga are these cables not 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.959
 we have lost because they come blue 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.959
 to connect it here 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.030
 from there it would be what we connect there you see it 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.660
 this we are not going to have loss either 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.530
 because it is connected 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.250
 here in this here you see it from this 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.440
 way 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.990
 what are these babies 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.330
 and in the new equipment come the 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.780
 this connector that we are seeing here 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.270
 more the hdmi if you realize it is a 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.750
 cable so flattened and behind you 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.780
 says hdmi or hdmi output on high 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.090
 definition and ready and there are no more laps 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.880
 what to give I hope this video has you 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.740
