00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.350
 hello dear friends i want you 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.179
 Show me the ps3 today 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.450
 Outsmart can work for 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.460
 at least with me if you do not have a blu ray 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.710
 disc mai reads so I'll show you now 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.109
 times how it could work is 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:26.970
 rather unconventional but in need 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:30.289
 I discovered that and had to 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:35.480
 I complete the drive of my ps3 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:39.300
 disassemble the export function is 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.170
 expanded and is in the closet 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.590
 it's all so my ps3 games 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.629
 no longer reads me on normal way 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:55.649
 will the game a magnetic lock 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:58.910
 press the eject button on the ps3 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.910
 trying to read the game 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:12.250
 what you but how you see, unfortunately 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:17.410
 I do not succeed and then I am on it 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:20.130
 come why still others 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:25.680
 busy trying out 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.680
 take out worsened cd 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:39.150
 Now I go take the cd with the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:47.520
 edge over the reader unit back up 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:52.130
 button over it quickly went the part 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.130
 on the edge of it 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.890
 that does not start to run that is 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:11.540
 Of course I only acts still needs 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:17.740
 Once I know that it goes again 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.740
 try the cd running 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.799
 he knows the game on the top left you see 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.799
 the cdu 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.150
 I can do that 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.439
 normally start 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.569
 something to look at 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.569
 See you
