00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
to test it to make sure the joint that's

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:43.210 
to test it to make sure the joint that's
good

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:01:01.570 

see<00:00:44.220> if<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.370> can

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
right now I'm going to have to rinky and

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.390 
right now I'm going to have to rinky and
expand<00:01:29.170> that<00:01:29.410> area<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:31.360> probably<00:01:31.780> he<00:01:32.310> wants<00:01:33.310> to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400

the<00:01:45.610> smaller<00:01:46.030> Internet<00:01:46.570> and<00:01:46.840> see<00:01:47.110> if<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:47.290> can

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
the smaller Internet and see if I can

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.540 
the smaller Internet and see if I can
pull<00:01:47.800> this<00:01:48.040> off<00:01:49.470> just<00:01:50.470> a<00:01:50.620> little<00:01:50.650> bit<00:01:51.010> to<00:01:51.340> give

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
pull this off just a little bit to give

and then if you've made the joint too

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.250 
and then if you've made the joint too
big<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:08.170> redo<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:08.710> you<00:02:08.770> seize<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.250> paddle

closer to the female joint on the piece

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.570 
closer to the female joint on the piece
you<00:03:53.370> can<00:03:53.580> use<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:53.910> like<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:56.340> want<00:03:56.519> to
