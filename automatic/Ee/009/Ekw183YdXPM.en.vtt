00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 We're back, I want to give a 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.740
 important information last week 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.719
 we spread the presence of marisa 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.219
 Magellan she who every sixth participates 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.219
 here in the woman's art corner together 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.640
 with exceptionally today she could not 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.730
 participate because he is grounded 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.850
 she abused the crafts and there 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.890
 the doctor my friend bandaged everything 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.710
 susa mazão participated today with us 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.260
 It's okay, Susan, and it's mandatory 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.090
 had to succeed because he did not have the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.250
 It's the first time, I thought. 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.500
 He enjoys it and will go to will 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.239
 to amend one work in the other truth but 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.030
 have to look after people 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.329
 and next Saturday I will be in crisis 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.270
 site along with marisa magalhães 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.219
 teaching more a 3d art steal cool 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.860
 today in the program there is class too 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.739
 including beautiful roles we go 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.370
 ride our suggestion people look at you 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:03.210
 set of cups look that late love 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.790
 are six new models of 3d art that are 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.310
 that with only one blade 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.150
 You build your work, I thank you. 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.770
 for you 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.900
 we provide for people who have been drawn 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.189
 page you what angular reality goes 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.299
 to compete for the draw 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.820
 so come on, I'll show you how to do it 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.850
 3d art is totally different from art 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.350
 these papers were 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.030
 developed for this art 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.640
 then it already shows the base and all that 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.860
 you will crop and the numbering of the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.430
 overlap is not that great easy 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.229
 very easy and you will be able to do 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.320
 all these works 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.399
 well then I'll show you I got it right 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.340
 I cut this one from the base so I 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.220
 I always do part I develop 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.409
 then choose what I want to do and 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.570
 I 'm lap with silicone 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.479
 so it's an idea for the tray can 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.060
 be a comic for the kitchen then stay 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.020
 comfortable for you then choose the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.259
 decoration 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.899
 Good, so let's go there as indicated in 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.099
 paper you have to cut out the figure of 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.410
 number 1 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.340
 then it is 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.920
 and to the engraving of number 1 toinha cut out 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.210
 so what we'll do 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.570
 lifting 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:27.640
 so I do as in French art the 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.640
 record in some parts of e-learning 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.580
 So we can do this survey. 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.210
 here we go then 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:42.160
 Let's paste here so put a 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:47.680
 thin layer of silicone grip 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.900
 Let's put this one here and also 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:56.660
 silicone 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:59.690
 Let's put a little piece to 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.300
 it's important to remember that 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.240
 these parts touch the weight of the paper 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.210
 it is not necessary to put hevea 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.560
 so it gets a pretty good job free 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.020
 behind right 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.500
 good to do overlap now 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:20.600
 you will pass the silicone throughout and 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:27.040
 see the one posted and we are going to do the 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:31.160
 first lift just not tight 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.540
 there we go for the cut of the engraving of 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.360
 number two then she's here I 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.270
 I took the picture right 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.690
 and we go to the same procedure 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:48.320
 as it looks here I observe that the bulli 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.020
 there will be no overlap and he has to 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.950
 round shape so I can already here 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:58.700
 give a stir in the pot 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.620
 it is round and the kettle will 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.580
 more overlap so I'll leave 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.140
 she straight 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:09.530
 I'll get a bit of curb 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.100
 place here so always be careful to 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.920
 not appear and here for me to keep this 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:20.710
 Rounded rounding is just a 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:24.440
 send in the middle we cut a comic strip 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:26.430
 because when you put this motion on it 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.360
 do not undo 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.430
 this is where we go and I'm putting 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.200
 all wearing is black but not wearing 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.180
 necessarily not 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.620
 can be any color because it will not 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.940
 appear 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:46.120
 so come on, look over the 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.250
 and here with this procedure 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.880
 and travel only in the civil 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:57.160
 accommodated the way I checked and let's 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:59.430
 for the picture number 3 and I took it off 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.830
 China 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.830
 so I now notice that the kettle 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:09.610
 there will be no overlap then I 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:12.490
 I can move the kettle to 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:17.500
 chiquinha there will still be then let's do 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:20.860
 so we put a little piece like 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:26.560
 few to a little one here to put 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:29.530
 in the cup and here touch the same 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:37.440
 Let's paste it into the procedure. 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:40.980
 to keep my silicone sales 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.220
 silicone and we will overlap 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:48.970
 so look here in the center then 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:51.490
 and remained quietly but gets 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.440
 too beautiful is not super delicate 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.900
 to take advantage of the uses continues with the 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.300
 people today not clear the block has more than 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.730
 3d art consultation amazon a 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.750
 people will see this closely all these 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.280
 beautiful works to serve as 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.910
 inspiration to make a lot of people stay 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.910
 here is good
