00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:16.289
 how to adjust a suspension for your 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:18.449
 weight is not as complicated as this 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.070
 for this there is sag a form of 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.619
 measure if the suspension is shrinking 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.660
 too much or too little for your weight 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.810
 if your suspension is hydraulic as 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.109
 this or suspension with springs but with 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.989
 preload setting where you can 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.730
 compress the new ones you can do the sag 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.590
 most suspensions well with this 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.329
 ring for this reading and the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.030
 process is quite simple just move 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.460
 down to abut retainer Aquino 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.649
 and when you ride a bike 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.710
 it will rise indicating how much 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.660
 suspension is shrinking if your 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.610
 front or rear suspension does not 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.070
 have this ring to read the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.039
 sag you can install a brace this 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.079
 nylon elze father who will do the same 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:15.000
 function will be able to measure how much the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:17.790
 suspension is shrinking the suspension 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.200
 rear the mall has the same system 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.580
 of measurement 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.960
 after compression the ring will mark up to 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.750
 Where is she going when she is? 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.520
 shrinking the site reader can be 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.530
 made in any suspension but not 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.750
 nothing you do if the suspension 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.670
 do not have regulation do not have with you 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.829
 manage this information 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.560
 so remembering only works on 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.100
 hydraulic suspensions with 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.470
 calibration or spring loaded 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.920
 possibility of compressing the famous spring 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.770
 fraud in practice this is how it works 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:58.259
 esloc the ring to bottom mounts on 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.960
 normal riding position 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.729
 sitting and also standing I like to do 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.290
 this measurement also stand up because 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.540
 it is not just sitting that one walks 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.979
 bike 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.030
 get down carefully to not work 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.790
 plus the suspension 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.280
 and here he tagged 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.430
 approximately 3 centimeters ie me 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.500
 I'm three centimeters less than course 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.120
 if I take a hole a regularity to 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.819
 Suspension A chat from this guy is already 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.250
 partially shrunk and this ends up 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.590
 making her missing to cushion can 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.730
 give up it may be very demanding 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.940
 need to place the calibration rule 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.410
 It's very simple every pound put a ps 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.530
 in its suspension 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.620
 then the whole equipment pilot gave 70 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.239
 pounds 70 ps and as mine shrank 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.790
 about three centimeters being that the 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:03:04.900
 ideal is to choose only 5 millimeters 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:03:07.090
 I'll put calibrated'll do now 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.580
 new sag reading and see how much it will 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.580
 mark or how much it will shrink 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.040
 practically half an inch 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.640
 before I had a little free course 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.950
 now almost doubled this area and 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.480
 so I can use suspension 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.709
 taking advantage of everything she has to 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.079
 to offer 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.720
 Of course, do not forget to do the review. 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.880
 in the network authorized every six months 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.390
 so your suspension will last for 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.010
 ever 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:44.799
 It's okay, people, we'll see each other in the next 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:47.820
 videos such is not so complicated anymore or 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.820
 a little less 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:57.359
 how about doing it knows that the possibility 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.359
 of compressing the famous spring for download 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:08.049
 the serve is the service is the sac service 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:11.519
 car service to a website or 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.519
 water refrigerator support 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:32.669
 the site of the Calibration Secretariat of 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.669
