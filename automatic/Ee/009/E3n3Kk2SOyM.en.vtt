00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.929
 going nickel gold today we end up 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.580
 for a new video on gta 5 online 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.020
 first of all i thank sow king's for 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.580
 his comment so thank you to you my 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.960
 buddy if you too want to pass in the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.100
 next video does not hesitate to let go 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.780
 little bit of blue and dropped a 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.190
 comment it would make me super fun 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.390
 so as you could see in the title 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.980
 today I was still talking to you a 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.390
 times a few rules that youtube has 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.129
 set up so a few days ago 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.079
 I talked about it with Chaouki 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.550
 descriptions and so on respect because 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.199
 otherwise youtube could delete your 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.359
 videos and so there I had news 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.309
 information by my divy partnership 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.960
 move so I thank them enormously he 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.519
 must know that youtube is radical there 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.230
 delete videos without sending 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.030
 warning and so the youtuber 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.620
 lose their avi videos so I'm going 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.999
 you read some general rules to 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.170
 respect but there are others whose 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.879
 I will talk to you later 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.319
 firstly the descriptions the tags 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.149
 thumbnails and misleading titles 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:59.550
 intended to increase the number of views 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.170
 are not allowed the etac must 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.909
 only to be added in the section 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.379
 corresponding date and not in the 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.400
 description as some do with 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.140
 extra tags 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.119
 then we do not have the right to publish 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.759
 large amounts of non-material 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.229
 targeted undesirable or repetitive such 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.909
 as comments or messages 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.350
 private so that's for spam by 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.210
 example those who ask to subscribe 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.500
 etc or who are advertising for their 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.250
 video in the comments or in 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.200
 private message 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.240
 the first line of the description no 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.850
 really all water should be used to 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.049
 describe the content of the video do not copy 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.270
 not just the title 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.979
 try to rephrase a minimum by 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.930
 example if the title of this video is 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.039
 your chains in danger well I have to 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.320
 put in the description 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.820
 youtube has put several rules your 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.229
 chains may be in danger if you 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.969
 do not respect them something like 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.799
 that a descriptive sentence simply 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.570
 important keywords in the video 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.950
 have to end up in the title in 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.880
 the first line of destruction and 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.259
 in the tags 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.939
 you do not have the right to put the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.770
 words that have nothing to do with video 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.360
 in the title for example and we have to 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.130
 limit as much as possible 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.690
 of links in the description for example 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.280
 on metro of social networks youtube 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.720
 can consider them as spam and 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.460
 could therefore deleted the video 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.630
 so if you ever want to put 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.880
 social networks but this is in 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.740
 annotations or cards in your videos 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.420
 directly and then there are some 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.340
 rumors that you do not have the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.990
 right to put titles of more than 20 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.640
 characters for that I can not the 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.720
 confirm I saw him nowhere in all 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.490
 case it's true that if it's the truth 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.140
 down is a little hot anyway because 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.270
 that youtube still allows 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.680
 write long ty and yet this 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.190
 would not be allowed so it's a bit 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.480
 weird 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.860
 in any case I recap the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.420
 main rules in the description 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.680
 of the video do not hesitate to go 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.209
 see I do not want your channels 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.590
 be deleted that's all for this 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.030
 video do not hesitate to share it a 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.840
 maximum and I tell you to the 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.840
 next go ciao
