00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.380
 there is everyone it's coco boys so 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.000
 we find ourselves for a little gameplay 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.099
 so I 'm in league league 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.040
 so we made a team with friends 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.490
 So there we said internally four 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.000
 out of four 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.730
 so suddenly we play against 3 masters 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.490
 so every venom his master and loti 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.430
 the turntables so here I want for this 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.289
 match to find out if we were platinum 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.260
 what's good it's true we're 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.210
 really a good team so I 'm coming 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.360
 this spot has it to the limit so played 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.180
 eight with b 23 hours so fault in you 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.739
 to say that this is a huge round 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.800
 even though bangs really make a sleeve 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.140
 huge so you'll see so there already 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.370
 we find ourselves in 2003 a guy who 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.579
 actually kill station so I take the bike 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.579
 here so here is but for the triangle 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.510
 see the limit one again I had 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.149
 a good connection 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:04.320
 so here we are here again a little bit of 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.750
 luck so here are the respects 30 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.850
 seconds so I'm in a situation of 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.549
 one against one so it must be done quickly 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.200
 recover the mud is asked robin ne 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.860
 not count on the bombing seemed to me a 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.150
 little weird so here it is 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.560
 and so there I put him huge internal 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.420
 so I see there so I wanted to film 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.820
 slowed down after you will see on his sight 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.560
 so here I was looking there that would be 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.930
 that there were two there actually was 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.840
 not there so here I start to shoot myself 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.640
 on it so I'm doing a job I'm turning 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.410
 I say limit randomly when in fact 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.570
 since towards real speed like you 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:50.770
 see I do not even see what 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:53.800
 so that's it so that's for sure 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.890
 feeding it up is up but look at the 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.759
 shock that he really crappy but 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.860
 as you see it's really 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.300
 impressing on his life so that's it 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.160
 I hope you liked this little turn and 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.160
 then a little young ciao
