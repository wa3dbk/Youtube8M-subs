hey guys this is Peter again let's look

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.930 
hey guys this is Peter again let's look
today<00:00:05.040> on<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.520> situation<00:00:06.359> when<00:00:06.899> your

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:07.940 
today on the situation when your

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.459 
today on the situation when your
emergency<00:00:09.530> slash<00:00:10.670> parking<00:00:11.670> brake<00:00:12.200> needs<00:00:13.200> to

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
emergency slash parking brake needs to

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.599 
emergency slash parking brake needs to
be<00:00:13.650> adjusted<00:00:15.109> sometimes<00:00:16.109> what<00:00:16.680> happens<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.430> us

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
be adjusted sometimes what happens to us

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.630 
be adjusted sometimes what happens to us
that<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.779> have<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:19.230> vehicle<00:00:19.560> where<00:00:20.160> emergency

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
that you have a vehicle where emergency

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.519 
that you have a vehicle where emergency
brake<00:00:21.359> goes<00:00:21.869> all<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.320> way<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.160> floor<00:00:23.460> and

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
brake goes all the way to the floor and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.439 
brake goes all the way to the floor and
it's<00:00:25.529> not<00:00:25.859> enough<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.369> braking<00:00:26.849> like<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.269> this

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
it's not enough of braking like in this

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.859 
it's not enough of braking like in this
case<00:00:28.310> ends<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.609> goes<00:00:29.670> all<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.119> way<00:00:30.240> down<00:00:30.390> but<00:00:30.840> I

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
case ends it goes all the way down but I

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.799 
case ends it goes all the way down but I
know<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.380> car<00:00:31.650> doesn't<00:00:32.279> really<00:00:32.700> break<00:00:33.239> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
know the car doesn't really break the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.760 
know the car doesn't really break the
brake<00:00:34.020> doesn't<00:00:34.260> work<00:00:34.559> correctly<00:00:35.270> so<00:00:36.270> if<00:00:37.079> this

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
brake doesn't work correctly so if this

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.700 
brake doesn't work correctly so if this
is<00:00:38.010> your<00:00:38.250> case<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:39.059> will<00:00:39.660> show<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:39.989> how<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.410> can

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
is your case I will show you how you can

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.520 
is your case I will show you how you can
adjust<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.670> whole<00:00:41.820> system<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.780> will<00:00:42.960> break

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
adjust the whole system so it will break

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.010 
adjust the whole system so it will break
correctly<00:00:44.309> again<00:00:44.870> now<00:00:46.100> about<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:48.020> adjusting

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
correctly again now about that adjusting

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.090 
correctly again now about that adjusting
I<00:00:49.430> speak<00:00:50.430> about<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.940> older<00:00:51.480> vehicles<00:00:52.140> older

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
I speak about the older vehicles older

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.000 
I speak about the older vehicles older
pickup<00:00:53.460> trucks<00:00:54.260> which<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.739> very

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
pickup trucks which have that very

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.250 
pickup trucks which have that very
simple<00:00:56.610> adjusting<00:00:57.270> system<00:00:57.750> which<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.079> can

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
simple adjusting system which you can

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.330 
simple adjusting system which you can
see<00:00:58.559> right<00:00:58.590> now<00:00:59.149> these<00:01:00.149> are<00:01:00.480> two<00:01:00.510> lines<00:01:01.190> to<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
see right now these are two lines to the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.880 
see right now these are two lines to the
rear<00:01:02.550> brakes<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> spring

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
rear brakes this is just the spring

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.600 
rear brakes this is just the spring
which<00:01:06.229> puts<00:01:07.229> some<00:01:07.500> kind<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.890> tension<00:01:08.220> on

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
which puts some kind of tension on

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.080 
which puts some kind of tension on
everything<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.990> goes<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.770> cabin<00:01:11.549> that's

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
everything this goes in the cabin that's

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.630 
everything this goes in the cabin that's
the<00:01:12.420> cable<00:01:13.409> which<00:01:13.530> goes<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.070> cabin<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
the cable which goes in the cabin to the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.410 
the cable which goes in the cabin to the
brake<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.229> adjusting<00:01:16.920> nut<00:01:17.420> so

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
brake and this is the adjusting nut so

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.880 
brake and this is the adjusting nut so
if<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.780> was<00:01:18.960> all<00:01:19.259> loose<00:01:19.909> by<00:01:20.909> basically<00:01:21.890> moving

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
if it was all loose by basically moving

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.600 
if it was all loose by basically moving
that<00:01:23.520> non<00:01:24.020> nut<00:01:25.250> clockwise

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
that non nut clockwise

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.899 
that non nut clockwise
that<00:01:27.360> means<00:01:27.689> I'm<00:01:28.049> putting<00:01:28.770> tension<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.640> this

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
that means I'm putting tension on this

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.289 
that means I'm putting tension on this
cable<00:01:30.560> however<00:01:31.560> what<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.009> really<00:01:32.610> important

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
cable however what is really important

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.060 
cable however what is really important
to<00:01:33.479> mention<00:01:33.829> there<00:01:34.829> really<00:01:35.159> needs<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:35.970> very

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
to mention there really needs to be very

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.700 
to mention there really needs to be very
clear<00:01:38.070> slack<00:01:38.820> because<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:40.170> don't<00:01:40.350> want<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.560> be

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
clear slack because you don't want to be

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.850 
clear slack because you don't want to be
pulling<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.280> these<00:01:41.520> two<00:01:41.759> cables<00:01:41.970> too<00:01:42.450> much

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
pulling on these two cables too much

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.590 
pulling on these two cables too much
that<00:01:43.860> means<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.430> will<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.909> brakes<00:01:45.180> will<00:01:45.420> be

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that means you will the brakes will be

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.179 
that means you will the brakes will be
breaking<00:01:46.049> all<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.409> time<00:01:46.619> when<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.040> are

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
breaking all the time when you are

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.190 
breaking all the time when you are
driving<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.909> definitely<00:01:48.720> don't<00:01:48.899> want

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
driving and you definitely don't want

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.300 
driving and you definitely don't want
have<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.520> look<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.270> still

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
have that so look that is still

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.670 
have that so look that is still
definitely<00:01:53.310> space<00:01:54.090> between<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.780> nut<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
definitely space between the nut and the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.920 
definitely space between the nut and the
table<00:01:56.100> which<00:01:56.250> goes<00:01:56.520> towards<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.360> cabin

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
table which goes towards to the cabin

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.870 
table which goes towards to the cabin
it's<00:01:58.530> very<00:01:58.799> loose<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.399> I<00:02:00.270> will<00:02:00.509> show<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.899> how

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
it's very loose and I will show you how

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.760 
it's very loose and I will show you how
the<00:02:02.880> whole<00:02:03.030> braking<00:02:03.509> system<00:02:03.960> improved<00:02:04.530> it's

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
the whole braking system improved it's

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.340 
the whole braking system improved it's
perfect<00:02:05.310> already<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.600> still<00:02:06.930> can<00:02:07.140> be

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
perfect already and it still can be

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.369 
perfect already and it still can be
loosed<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.740> little<00:02:07.770> bit<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.720> here<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:10.170> will

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
loosed a little bit and here you will

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.140 
loosed a little bit and here you will
see<00:02:10.679> how<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.099> changed

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
see how it changed

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.110 
see how it changed
here<00:02:12.750> in<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.079> cabin<00:02:14.010> how<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.340> pedal<00:02:14.909> will

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
here in the cabin how the pedal will

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.990 
here in the cabin how the pedal will
work<00:02:17.420> see<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:18.810> like<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.250> half<00:02:20.250> way<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.670> the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
work see it's like a half way to the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.140 
work see it's like a half way to the
floor<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.659> already<00:02:21.930> works<00:02:23.150> without

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
floor and it already works without

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.080 
floor and it already works without
putting<00:02:24.689> any<00:02:25.049> extra<00:02:25.349> tension<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:26.280> these<00:02:26.489> lines

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
putting any extra tension on these lines

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.649 
putting any extra tension on these lines
to<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.720> brakes<00:02:27.989> so<00:02:28.829> once<00:02:29.010> again<00:02:29.599> this<00:02:30.599> is

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
to the brakes so once again this is

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.640 
to the brakes so once again this is
perfect<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.480> wish<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:33.989> good<00:02:34.290> luck<00:02:34.470> before
