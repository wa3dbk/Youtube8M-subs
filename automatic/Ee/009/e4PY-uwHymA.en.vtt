with a spade I've cleared the area which
has<00:00:37.150> excess<00:00:37.660> terms<00:00:38.019> so<00:00:38.739> now<00:00:38.949> we're<00:00:39.160> ready<00:00:39.400> to

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
has excess terms so now we're ready to

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:47.130 
has excess terms so now we're ready to
store<00:00:40.360> the<00:00:40.750> average<00:00:45.239> I've<00:00:46.239> already<00:00:46.600> laid<00:00:46.809> two

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
store the average I've already laid two

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.530 
store the average I've already laid two
pieces<00:00:47.620> here<00:00:47.890> I'm<00:00:48.640> now<00:00:48.910> going<00:00:49.059> to<00:00:49.149> shape<00:00:49.360> how

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
pieces here I'm now going to shape how

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.900 
pieces here I'm now going to shape how
you<00:00:49.570> connect<00:00:50.110> one<00:00:50.440> piece<00:00:50.710> of<00:00:50.890> average<00:00:51.280> to<00:00:51.789> the

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
you connect one piece of average to the

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.060 
you connect one piece of average to the
next<00:00:52.360> it's<00:00:53.140> always<00:00:53.440> good<00:00:53.710> to<00:00:53.739> have<00:00:54.010> a

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
next it's always good to have a

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.250 
next it's always good to have a
screwdriver<00:00:54.460> with<00:00:54.969> you<00:00:55.120> in<00:00:55.719> case<00:00:55.899> you<00:00:56.110> run

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
screwdriver with you in case you run

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.840 
screwdriver with you in case you run
into<00:00:56.320> any<00:00:56.620> of<00:00:56.710> these<00:00:56.800> things<00:00:57.100> they'll<00:00:57.579> Bend

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
into any of these things they'll Bend

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.330 
into any of these things they'll Bend
the<00:00:57.969> teeth<00:00:58.260> via<00:00:59.260> nightmare<00:00:59.739> to<00:00:59.829> get<00:00:59.949> sorted

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
the teeth via nightmare to get sorted

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.799 
the teeth via nightmare to get sorted
out<00:01:00.460> afterwards<00:01:01.059> so<00:01:01.239> have<00:01:01.420> a<00:01:01.449> screwdriver

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
out afterwards so have a screwdriver

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.529 
out afterwards so have a screwdriver
ready<00:01:02.320> if<00:01:02.949> you<00:01:03.039> find<00:01:03.340> any<00:01:03.550> blocks<00:01:03.789> you<00:01:04.509> can

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:04.539 
ready if you find any blocks you can

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:05.850 
ready if you find any blocks you can
prise<00:01:04.989> them<00:01:05.199> out<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.410> way<00:01:05.560> with<00:01:05.830> a

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
prise them out the way with a

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.330 
prise them out the way with a
screwdriver<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.420> what<00:01:07.570> we<00:01:07.660> do<00:01:07.810> now<00:01:08.020> is<00:01:09.009> we<00:01:09.160> get

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
screwdriver so what we do now is we get

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.940 
screwdriver so what we do now is we get
our<00:01:09.460> over<00:01:09.700> edge

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
our over edge

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.630 
our over edge
you<00:01:11.520> line<00:01:11.789> it<00:01:11.939> up<00:01:12.060> with<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.899> next<00:01:13.229> piece<00:01:13.469> here

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
you line it up with the next piece here

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.670 
you line it up with the next piece here
the<00:01:14.640> male<00:01:14.850> kind<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.360> female<00:01:15.630> always<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.500> way

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680

MANET<00:01:20.390> you<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.539> probably<00:01:22.020> knock<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.469> in<00:01:24.289> to

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
MANET you just probably knock it in to

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.679 
MANET you just probably knock it in to
the<00:01:25.350> next<00:01:25.530> piece<00:01:25.799> like<00:01:26.039> this<00:01:26.250> do<00:01:27.060> not<00:01:27.090> push<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.140 

I've<00:01:58.690> now<00:01:58.900> installed<00:01:59.290> all<00:01:59.530> my<00:01:59.710> average<00:02:00.150> you

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
I've now installed all my average you

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.240 
I've now installed all my average you
can<00:02:01.270> see<00:02:01.510> now<00:02:01.690> is<00:02:01.870> a<00:02:01.900> nice<00:02:02.170> clean<00:02:02.620> straight

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
can see now is a nice clean straight

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.540 
can see now is a nice clean straight

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
screwdriver that lower tongue just tap

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.230 
screwdriver that lower tongue just tap
it<00:02:12.700> in<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:13.780> about<00:02:13.930> 45<00:02:14.650> degrees<00:02:15.100> and<00:02:15.790> that<00:02:15.940> locks

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
it in to about 45 degrees and that locks

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:26.460 
it in to about 45 degrees and that locks
it<00:02:16.480> all<00:02:16.600> together<00:02:16.930> good<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.500> strong<00:02:25.410> one<00:02:26.410> of

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
it all together good and strong one of

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.680 
it all together good and strong one of
the<00:02:26.560> joys<00:02:26.800> I<00:02:26.830> don't<00:02:27.220> read<00:02:27.459> physics<00:02:28.390> is

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
the joys I don't read physics is

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.800 
the joys I don't read physics is
extremely<00:02:29.350> flexible<00:02:29.560> as<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:30.700> can<00:02:30.880> see<00:02:31.120> it's

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
extremely flexible as you can see it's

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.810 
extremely flexible as you can see it's
very<00:02:31.870> easy<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.320> bend<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:33.160> make<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.520> sort<00:02:33.790> of

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
very easy to bend to make the sort of

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.780 
very easy to bend to make the sort of
shape<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.330> need<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.780> in<00:02:35.080> your<00:02:35.230> garden<00:02:35.790> well

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
shape you need to in your garden well

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.430 
shape you need to in your garden well
I'm<00:02:36.910> gonna<00:02:37.030> show<00:02:37.209> you<00:02:37.270> now<00:02:37.480> is<00:02:37.660> how<00:02:37.690> we<00:02:37.900> bend<00:02:38.230> it

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
I'm gonna show you now is how we bend it

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.060 
I'm gonna show you now is how we bend it
to<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.920> right<00:02:39.190> angle<00:02:40.230> I'm<00:02:41.230> actually<00:02:41.410> using<00:02:41.739> two

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
to a right angle I'm actually using two

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.740 
to a right angle I'm actually using two
different<00:02:42.250> these<00:02:42.610> here<00:02:42.940> I've<00:02:43.060> got<00:02:43.239> three<00:02:43.270> in

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
different these here I've got three in

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.850 
different these here I've got three in
temperature<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.860> forage<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:47.500> make<00:02:47.709> your
