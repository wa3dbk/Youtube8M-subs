00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.840 
that's some fun with my huge 80s hair
before<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.590> styled<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.220> didn't<00:02:45.520> want<00:02:45.550> to<00:02:45.730> get

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
before I styled it I didn't want to get

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.300 
before I styled it I didn't want to get
rid<00:02:45.910> of<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.450> curl<00:02:46.750> completely<00:02:47.410> just<00:02:47.800> taming<00:02:48.220> a

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
rid of the curl completely just taming a

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.310 
rid of the curl completely just taming a
little<00:02:48.550> bit<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:49.180> used<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.600> misting<00:02:50.020> spray

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
little bit so I used a misting spray

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.500 
little bit so I used a misting spray
bottle<00:02:50.710> to<00:02:50.890> dampen<00:02:51.310> my<00:02:51.430> hair<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:52.030> sprayer<00:02:52.330> is

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
bottle to dampen my hair this sprayer is

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.360 
bottle to dampen my hair this sprayer is
everything<00:02:53.050> it's<00:02:53.200> one<00:02:53.380> continuous<00:02:53.950> mist

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
everything it's one continuous mist

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.160 
everything it's one continuous mist
and<00:02:54.490> then<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:54.760> used<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.210> apricot<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.780> castor

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
and then I used the apricot and castor

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.870 
and then I used the apricot and castor
oil<00:02:56.200> just<00:02:56.650> soften<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.310> hair<00:02:57.490> a<00:02:57.520> little<00:02:57.670> bit

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
oil just soften the hair a little bit

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.050 
oil just soften the hair a little bit
and<00:02:58.090> give<00:02:58.240> me<00:02:58.390> more<00:02:58.750> control<00:02:59.700> as<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:00.850> said

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
and give me more control as I said

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.730 
and give me more control as I said
before<00:03:01.240> I<00:03:01.480> didn't<00:03:01.810> want<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:02.020> change<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.500> curl

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
before I didn't want to change the curl

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.170 
before I didn't want to change the curl
pattern<00:03:03.160> I<00:03:03.280> just<00:03:03.490> wanted<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.850> crease<00:03:04.150> the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
pattern I just wanted to crease the

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.600 
pattern I just wanted to crease the
volume<00:03:04.840> of<00:03:05.020> it<00:03:05.170> so<00:03:05.380> what<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:05.590> did<00:03:05.710> was<00:03:06.190> three

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
volume of it so what I did was three

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.630 
volume of it so what I did was three
strand<00:03:07.000> twist<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.830> secured<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:08.950> ends<00:03:09.370> with<00:03:09.520> the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
strand twist I secured the ends with the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.570 
strand twist I secured the ends with the
perm<00:03:09.910> rod<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.660> then<00:03:11.350> continued<00:03:11.890> that<00:03:12.070> process

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
perm rod and then continued that process

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.600 
perm rod and then continued that process
over<00:03:12.790> my<00:03:13.300> entire<00:03:13.870> head<00:03:14.290> so<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.220> hair<00:03:15.370> that<00:03:15.550> I

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
over my entire head so the hair that I

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.790 
over my entire head so the hair that I
use<00:03:15.850> is<00:03:16.120> synthetic<00:03:16.570> it's<00:03:16.930> not<00:03:17.140> gonna<00:03:17.320> set<00:03:17.590> like

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
use is synthetic it's not gonna set like

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.410 
use is synthetic it's not gonna set like
this<00:03:18.010> because<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.520> isn't<00:03:18.640> human<00:03:18.880> hair<00:03:19.210> so<00:03:19.390> I

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
this because it isn't human hair so I

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.030 
this because it isn't human hair so I
boiled<00:03:19.810> some<00:03:19.900> hot<00:03:20.110> water<00:03:20.260> in<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.590> microwave
