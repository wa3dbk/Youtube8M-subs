 Mayan gold to make macaroons

 chocolate 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.349

 a teaspoon of cinnamon and a 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.880
 Nutmeg plot for you public 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.610
 today I will embark on a 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.770
 recipe that must admit it does not 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.000
 a little bit scared 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.020
 yet I reassure you it's not the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.600
 first time I make macaroons 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.860
 but I do not know why at every 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.219
 once I get into the macaroons 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.329
 I'm a little tense and more good if you 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.920
 know what kind of women and where she has 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.079
 been created otherwise people including a 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.640
 big fan of macaroons that's okay 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.320
 christophe is that he succeeds super 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.160
 well all the time so here I have a 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.260
 little pressure 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.850
 I hope he'll like them but macaron 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.229
 the good chocolate will I take my 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.309
 courage with both hands and you're there 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.130
 to support me 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.850
 we're going to have fun almond powder and 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.070
 icing sugar 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.869
 this important to tag sugar well 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.729
 ice cream and almond powder all 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.670
 simply that it will eventually have to be 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.020
 the desired texture of macarons iden he 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.360
 is important to respect the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.009
 white weight of 200 g equals it 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.240
 at around 5.6 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.170
 if you put a little more or a little less 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.479
 of egg whites it's not very serious 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.320
 you just have to readjust all 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.430
 the other proportions 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.390
 it's around the cocoa to be sifted and 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.390
 we mix French well 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.490
 we will now take care of the whites 2 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.009
 that we will go up in snow not too much 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.420
 closed 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.429
 once the water is mounted 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.579
 add sugar and whip in 30 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.579
 seconds 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.630
 we will now have to add the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.400
 blend check or white 2 the simplest 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.940
 it's still sifting to invite 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.940
 very gradually 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.520
 m 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.260
 and here is the dough is ready we will be able 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.300
 put it in a piping bag and 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.349
 laid her down on a simplest paper 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.640
 to replace her again to put the 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:24.370
 piping bag in a container at 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:26.019
 like that or hop we drop that we go 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.120
 cut here and that will allow us to 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.260
 put that on our tables under fire 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.120
 fighting prepare right now 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.250
 it is very important to well spaced 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.660
 macaroons on the baking tray 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.000
 so we already made pumpkins 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.459
 about 2 cm in diameter and one 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.450
 centimeter and a half thick and 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.220
 then they are arranged in staggered rows so 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:50.380
 to be able to spaces well and liliane 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.750
 to have 5 7 cm between each level they 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.370
 are all laid on paper we take the 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.840
 plate and pat it on the plane of 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.849
 work so that the sick can 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.530
 take their final form it 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.299
 flatten a little bit and now we're going 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.790
 let them wait for 15 minutes 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.470
 as the council holds to the army and two 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.540
 hours as the counsel the person who 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.940
 created this recipe to make them this 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.069
 we call cost the idea knows 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.170
 that a small collar is formed at the 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.970
 base of the macaron it is true that it is 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.100
 very very pretty but that depends also 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.590
 of the moisture of the heat so 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.060
 watch out when its macaroons 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.700
 macaroons are ready to be baked on 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.230
 heats the oven to 120 degrees and after 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.870
 the ideal is to already have a plate 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.940
 hot in the way for that shock 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.250
 thermal help the macaroon to cook so 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.600
 we put a plate in the oven and we 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.600
 ask the macaroon paste above 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.790
 to take off not say well that they 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.100
 are three options available to you 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.800
 firstly you put the plate on a 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.270
 very cold surface 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.350
 yes, you must have it at home 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.270
 for example in this kitchen 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.480
 there is no surface when it does 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.570
 hot if you can also put a net 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.980
 cold water below but well there are 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.140
 still a little risk of getting wet 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.240
 his stores and third option and me 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.680
 you simply a bib a dish towel 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.040
 fresh water 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.620
 you put it on a surface and you asked 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.620
 your parchment paper on it and then 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.660
 waiting for parchment paper up some 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.630
 and drooling with water and you'll see in 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.360
 regularly testing stores whose 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.910
 take off alone we go now 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.010
 make the fragrant chocolate ganache 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.780
 orange and spices for master 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.270
 alain of a macaron so for that we take 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.410
 a good organic orange go one recovers 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.210
 orange peel 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:38.460
 we will now recover the juice 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:41.730
 of orange I put to heat the juice 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.630
 of orange with milk and spices it 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.520
 now I have more than just shots 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.650
 break the chocolate very finely so 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.240
 for that I take a knife and I'm going 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.990
 good game can also use nuggets 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.990
 of chocolate directly 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.770
 we put chocolate in its allies and 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.810
 then we will pour over the liquid 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.229
 boiling and now we're patient 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.229
 for a minute a minute it can be 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.070
 appear very short or too long at the same 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.500
 Time is the time it takes to 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.090
 christophe to make a recipe 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.030
 incredible train against us sometimes 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.110
 it puts two minutes at the end of the minute 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.090
 we receive until we get a mixture 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.009
 very smooth for the ganache we forget 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.930
 not his 100 g of chocolate for 10 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.370
 centilitres of liquid so much better 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.490
 be careful because sometimes the range 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.320
 she has a lot of juice and then not 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.940
 as soon as you have a smooth texture and 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.430
 well homogeneous we will put it to 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.789
 cool both sides waiting for 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.680
 to be able to garnish our macaroons is the 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:41.139
 time to garnish I put a walnut 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.430
 ganache on my macaroon and then to 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.300
 help from the second coop 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.300
 I'm going to spread it 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.550
 macaroons was funded for 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.620
 which takes time and you go away 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.400
 want a low money foul plus the 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.400
 millionaire shortbread 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.320
 the chocolate macaron is too good 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.170
 but I admit it's not my favorite 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.300
 my favorite is the lemon and you 10 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.440
