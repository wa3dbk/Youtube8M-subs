00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.950 
particular we were regular visitors to
the<00:00:53.070> dog<00:00:53.250> pound<00:00:53.550> where<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.359> quickly<00:00:54.600> realized

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
the dog pound where we quickly realized

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.840 
the dog pound where we quickly realized
that<00:00:55.289> no<00:00:55.500> matter<00:00:55.649> how<00:00:55.980> many<00:00:56.219> dogs<00:00:56.519> you<00:00:56.670> would

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
that no matter how many dogs you would

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.060 
that no matter how many dogs you would
take<00:00:57.000> out<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.480> was<00:00:57.870> always<00:00:58.109> full<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.649> next<00:00:58.920> day

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
take out it was always full the next day

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.400 
take out it was always full the next day
and<00:00:59.280> we<00:00:59.850> realized<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> reason<00:01:01.289> behind

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
and we realized that the reason behind

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.410 
and we realized that the reason behind
this<00:01:01.800> was<00:01:02.070> because<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.579> owners<00:01:03.089> of<00:01:03.300> those

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
this was because the owners of those

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.390 
this was because the owners of those
dogs<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:04.110> didn't<00:01:04.440> have<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.589> support<00:01:04.890> there

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
dogs just didn't have the support there

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.850 
dogs just didn't have the support there
in<00:01:05.580> terms<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.970> training<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.480> behavior<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.710> we

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
in terms of training and behavior so we

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.170 
in terms of training and behavior so we
went<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.370> we<00:01:08.810> became<00:01:09.810> qualified<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.850> AZ<00:01:11.850> dog

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
went and we became qualified in AZ dog

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.880 
went and we became qualified in AZ dog
trainers<00:01:12.660> so<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.260> could<00:01:13.410> provide<00:01:13.650> that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890
