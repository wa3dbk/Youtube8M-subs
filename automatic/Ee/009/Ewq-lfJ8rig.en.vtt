00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.820
 hello how about you guys how are you 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.889
 say hello john and today I'm going to 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.180
 be teaching how to download and 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:18.099
 install my non-premium my craft and 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.890
 updatable so therefore we're going to 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:24.160
 direct us to our browser and 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.290
 we are going to place the following link that 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.230
 of course I will be leaving them 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.630
 in the description of this video once 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.360
 being already in this site we will wait 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.430
 the five seconds of advertising and then 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.020
 Let's give click the button is removed 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.540
 or jump advertising and automatically 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.910
 I would start the download I also want 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.450
 mention that we will need it 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.630
 already installed on our computer and 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.239
 that under this platform works 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:58.050
 our game of course also them 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.790
 I will be leaving the download link 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.760
 saying this we are going to continue now with 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.159
 the installation of our minecraft by 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.020
 here on my desk I already have the 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.719
 file in 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.140
 I'm going to decompress it by giving electric 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:17.439
 right and extract is generated this 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.929
 new folder where our 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.659
 minecraft as we can see here next to 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:26.319
 a notebook with certain 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:29.270
 additional indications I will execute 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:32.390
 the game right click to open with key 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.869
 and as we can see here is our 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.370
 launcher that is requesting us now 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:45.470
 a jucio name that I'm going to place 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.960
 is going to be this and now I'm going to give the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.229
 kings 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.900
 now this process is going to take some time 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.000
 minutes more than anything depending on your 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.690
 internet connection since it's going to 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.890
 download the necessary files to 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.810
 that our minecraft can be executed 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.500
 so I'm going to pause the video by 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.200
 here and I will go back when they have already 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.630
 downloaded those files we're from 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.420
 back and as we can see it is already very 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.080
 little so that the download of 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.560
 the final folders as we can see already 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.320
 just finished and we're in already 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.630
 on the side of cher itself being able to 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.230
 edit the profile in which we 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:37.150
 we found changing to some version 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:42.310
 that we said or maybe create a 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.890
 new profile and have more than one version 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.880
 our minecraft as well as 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:52.480
 change the resolution change the space 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:56.440
 on disk of our minecraft and others 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.580
 things that can be done I will give you 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:03.190
 in cancel and now I'm going to give play 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.610
 so they can notice that they will be able to 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.610
 play obviously have to end 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.640
 to download some folders with 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.580
 compared to just version 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.780
 choose to be able to enter already once 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.930
 to the game 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.630
 Downloading the remaining files 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.590
 just finished and it automatically 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.360
 execute our game in which 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.000
 we will be able to make all the changes 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.620
 necessary such as changing the 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.069
 language in which you are 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:41.090
 currently we can a Spanish 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.400
 have to give here to ready and of course already 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.000
 be at liberty to create a new 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.030
 world maybe how are we going to do it in 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.370
 these moments we are going to change here the 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.209
 game mode let's create a new 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.230
 world being in the current version that 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.230
 we selected 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.880
 we are already finally inside the game in 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:11.570
 yes let's see let's change a little and 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.420
 here we have of course all the 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:18.320
 material objects tools that 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.049
 minecraft exist so far we're going 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.090
 let's see we are going to rise a little to 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.720
 know a little more about the terrain that we 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.720
 surrounds 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.610
 as you could see everything is in order and 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.120
 is our monitor 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.729
 and without problem some guys there 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.009
 we are there 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.710
 breaking some trees and good guys 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:43.259
 they can realize the sound of the game 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.889
 and everything else is totally in order 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:51.300
 so I'm going to proceed to close the game 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:54.210
 I'm going to leave the game now and now something 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.120
 important that you should know for 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.240
 can do the installation of mods or 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.779
 textures is the route on which 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.659
 find our minecraft folder 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:10.370
 for this I will pass the following 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:14.490
 indication we go to our disk it 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:17.219
 we go now to users then we 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.289
 we go to the user in which we are 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:22.319
 located in these moments that in my 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.779
 case is this here and inside him 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:28.649
 we will find our folder of 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:30.839
 minecraft of course here and this is 

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:33.419
 known to us we're going to 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:36.360
 version here we could create a copy 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:39.599
 of this and install a mod maybe 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.439
 or install force and everything else that already 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:45.150
