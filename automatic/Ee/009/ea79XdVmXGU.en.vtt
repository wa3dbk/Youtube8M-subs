project like this one was very important

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.569 
project like this one was very important
when<00:01:00.020> discussing<00:01:00.230> this<00:01:00.530> project<00:01:00.920> also<00:01:01.790> the

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
what exactly it was that was necessary

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.170 
what exactly it was that was necessary
to<00:01:08.960> realize<00:01:09.350> in<00:01:09.530> this<00:01:09.649> town<00:01:09.829> really<00:01:10.729> talking

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
to realize in this town really talking

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.990 
to realize in this town really talking
with<00:01:11.329> the<00:01:11.840> people<00:01:12.140> in<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.350> town<00:01:13.000> basically

with the people in the town basically
the<00:01:14.390> project<00:01:14.750> is<00:01:14.899> a<00:01:15.079> library<00:01:15.380> that's<00:01:15.799> open<00:01:16.159> 24

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
the project is a library that's open 24

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.730 
the project is a library that's open 24
hours<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.970> day<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.570> books<00:01:17.780> that<00:01:18.020> are

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
hours a day and the books that are

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.800 
hours a day and the books that are
offered<00:01:19.010> in<00:01:19.340> that<00:01:19.610> library<00:01:19.820> have<00:01:20.600> been

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
offered in that library have been

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.680 
offered in that library have been
donated<00:01:21.290> by<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.590> people<00:01:22.070> themselves

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
donated by the people themselves

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.030 
donated by the people themselves
ultimately<00:01:23.690> 20,000<00:01:24.440> books<00:01:24.530> were<00:01:24.710> offered

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
ultimately 20,000 books were offered

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.730 
ultimately 20,000 books were offered
which<00:01:25.220> is<00:01:25.370> which<00:01:25.670> is<00:01:25.790> very<00:01:26.090> impressive<00:01:26.740> and

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
which is which is very impressive and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.789 
which is which is very impressive and
also<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.729> process<00:01:29.119> itself<00:01:29.960> was<00:01:30.229> really<00:01:30.560> with

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
also the process itself was really with

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.219 
also the process itself was really with
the<00:01:30.830> participants<00:01:31.460> of<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.850> town<00:01:32.060> for<00:01:32.900> example

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
the participants of the town for example

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.020 
the participants of the town for example
here<00:01:33.500> you<00:01:33.680> see<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:34.220> before<00:01:34.549> they<00:01:34.670> realized

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
here you see that before they realized

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.870 
here you see that before they realized
the<00:01:35.180> library<00:01:35.600> as<00:01:36.290> its<00:01:36.619> completion<00:01:36.979> they<00:01:37.700> did<00:01:37.850> a

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
the library as its completion they did a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.750 
the library as its completion they did a
test<00:01:38.150> with<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:39.320> library<00:01:39.770> with<00:01:40.250> beer<00:01:40.460> crates

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
test with the library with beer crates

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.760 
test with the library with beer crates
to<00:01:40.970> really<00:01:41.390> get<00:01:41.479> a<00:01:41.540> feel<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:41.840> how<00:01:42.020> big<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.530> site

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
to really get a feel of how big the site

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.890 
to really get a feel of how big the site
really<00:01:43.369> was<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:43.880> also<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.420> get<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:44.630> feel<00:01:44.869> of

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
really was and also to get a feel of

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.620 
really was and also to get a feel of
what<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:45.950> value<00:01:46.520> would<00:01:46.549> be<00:01:46.729> in<00:01:47.090> realising

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
what the value would be in realising

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.570 
what the value would be in realising
such<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:47.810> project<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:48.439> ultimately<00:01:48.799> ending<00:01:49.430> up

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
such a project and ultimately ending up

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.670 
such a project and ultimately ending up
with<00:01:50.090> with<00:01:50.720> with<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.110> product<00:01:51.470> here

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
with with with the product here

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.679 
with with with the product here
interesting<00:01:52.580> to<00:01:52.670> mention<00:01:52.970> also<00:01:53.119> is<00:01:53.510> that

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
interesting to mention also is that

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.140 
interesting to mention also is that
there<00:01:53.900> is<00:01:54.020> a<00:01:54.250> certain<00:01:55.250> element<00:01:55.430> of<00:01:55.580> recycling

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
there is a certain element of recycling

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.170 
there is a certain element of recycling
because<00:01:56.689> these<00:01:57.350> tiles<00:01:57.950> are<00:01:58.250> actually<00:01:58.939> from<00:01:59.060> a

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
because these tiles are actually from a

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.020 
because these tiles are actually from a
former<00:01:59.540> shopping<00:02:00.200> warehouse<00:02:00.409> in<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.729> city<00:02:01.970> of

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
former shopping warehouse in the city of

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.899 
former shopping warehouse in the city of
hump<00:02:02.390> which<00:02:02.930> is<00:02:03.110> close<00:02:03.560> by<00:02:03.799> so<00:02:04.490> this<00:02:04.729> is

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
hump which is close by so this is

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.589 
hump which is close by so this is
recycling<00:02:05.810> this<00:02:06.320> open<00:02:06.740> social<00:02:06.920> nature<00:02:07.599> this

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
recycling this open social nature this

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.100 
recycling this open social nature this
community<00:02:09.409> based<00:02:09.970> project<00:02:10.970> is<00:02:11.150> is<00:02:11.810> really

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
community based project is is really

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.750 
community based project is is really
what<00:02:12.409> made<00:02:12.620> this<00:02:12.879> project

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
what made this project

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.000 
what made this project
as<00:02:14.849> far<00:02:15.060> as<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.480> jury<00:02:15.689> was<00:02:15.900> concerned<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.500> great
