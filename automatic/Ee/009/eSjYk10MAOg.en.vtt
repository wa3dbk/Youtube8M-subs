00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
really isn't like I get into that

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.219 
really isn't like I get into that
anyways<00:01:33.259> talking<00:01:33.920> about<00:01:34.039> this<00:01:35.049> pretty<00:01:36.049> much

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
anyways talking about this pretty much

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.569 
anyways talking about this pretty much
all<00:01:36.439> you<00:01:36.530> need<00:01:36.590> is<00:01:37.159> to<00:01:37.640> download<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.200> ISO<00:01:39.200> game

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
all you need is to download the ISO game

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.679 
all you need is to download the ISO game
the<00:01:40.579> ISO<00:01:40.789> is<00:01:41.210> a<00:01:41.390> rom<00:01:41.630> game<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.819> you<00:01:43.819> use<00:01:44.030> this

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
the ISO is a rom game and you use this

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.200 
the ISO is a rom game and you use this
program<00:01:45.170> I've<00:01:46.039> called<00:01:46.340> momento<00:01:47.500> dispatcher

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
program I've called momento dispatcher

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.469 
program I've called momento dispatcher
you<00:01:50.210> open<00:01:50.479> this<00:01:50.600> up<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:52.520> what<00:01:52.759> this<00:01:52.970> does<00:01:53.210> is

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
you open this up and what this does is

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.850 
you open this up and what this does is
pretty<00:01:53.720> much<00:01:53.929> matches<00:01:54.679> the<00:01:55.069> ISO<00:01:55.990> so<00:01:56.990> when<00:01:57.740> you

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
pretty much matches the ISO so when you

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.020 
pretty much matches the ISO so when you
boot<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.159> burn<00:01:58.549> game<00:01:59.000> onto<00:01:59.929> your<00:02:00.799> modded<00:02:01.459> soft

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
body whatever you want to call it memory

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.669 
body whatever you want to call it memory
card<00:02:04.069> they'll<00:02:04.909> read<00:02:05.179> your<00:02:05.209> burn<00:02:05.509> games<00:02:05.869> I<00:02:06.289> get

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.109 
card they'll read your burn games I get
to<00:02:06.799> play<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:07.819> game

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
to play the game

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.749 
to play the game
boom<00:02:08.750> get<00:02:09.110> into<00:02:09.319> one<00:02:09.500> no<00:02:10.130> I'm<00:02:10.340> just<00:02:10.429> kidding

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
boom get into one no I'm just kidding

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.640 
boom get into one no I'm just kidding
but<00:02:10.970> yeah<00:02:11.500> pretty<00:02:12.500> much<00:02:12.680> what<00:02:12.830> it<00:02:12.920> does<00:02:14.650> that's

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
but yeah pretty much what it does that's

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.630 
but yeah pretty much what it does that's
just<00:02:15.890> part<00:02:16.130> of<00:02:16.250> it

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
just part of it

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.059 
just part of it
part<00:02:17.120> one<00:02:17.390> is<00:02:17.420> basically<00:02:18.019> installing<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.920> mod

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
part one is basically installing the mod

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.289 
part one is basically installing the mod
onto<00:02:19.700> your<00:02:19.819> memory<00:02:20.480> card<00:02:20.780> which<00:02:21.739> uses<00:02:22.190> a

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
onto your memory card which uses a

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.630 
onto your memory card which uses a
standard<00:02:23.299> USB<00:02:24.430> thumb<00:02:25.430> drive<00:02:25.790> or<00:02:26.180> flash<00:02:26.660> drive

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
standard USB thumb drive or flash drive

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.569 
standard USB thumb drive or flash drive
and<00:02:28.900> this<00:02:29.900> swapping<00:02:30.410> method<00:02:30.799> with<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:31.850> game

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
and this swapping method with the game

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.660 
and this swapping method with the game
double<00:02:34.579> seven<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.390> got<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.930> boot<00:02:36.140> disc<00:02:36.670> will

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
double seven I got the boot disc will

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.610 
double seven I got the boot disc will
probably<00:02:38.060> stop<00:02:38.329> on<00:02:38.510> YouTube

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
probably stop on YouTube

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.550 
probably stop on YouTube
we<00:02:39.830> have<00:02:39.980> swapped<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.580> game<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:42.290> then<00:02:42.470> the

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
we have swapped the game so then the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.309 
we have swapped the game so then the
game<00:02:42.770> reads<00:02:43.069> this<00:02:43.400> boot-up<00:02:43.880> file<00:02:44.569> that<00:02:45.200> you

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
game reads this boot-up file that you

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.280 
game reads this boot-up file that you
want<00:02:45.530> on<00:02:45.800> your<00:02:45.830> PC<00:02:46.900> what<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.020> put<00:02:48.170> on<00:02:48.260> your
