00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
but basically take it inside you can

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.480 
but basically take it inside you can
zoom<00:00:13.530> in<00:00:13.710> on<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.980> little<00:00:14.040> bit<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.340> come

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
zoom in on that a little bit and come

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.490 
zoom in on that a little bit and come
little<00:00:14.610> closer<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.330> can<00:00:15.929> see<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.289> area

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
little closer you can see that the area

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500 
little closer you can see that the area
that<00:00:16.650> wasn't<00:00:16.949> being<00:00:17.279> taken<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:17.910> cleaned<00:00:18.210> by

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
that wasn't being taken and cleaned by

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.720 
that wasn't being taken and cleaned by
the<00:00:18.570> pressure<00:00:18.900> washer<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.980> now<00:00:20.220> being<00:00:20.490> cleaned

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
the pressure washer is now being cleaned

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.330 
the pressure washer is now being cleaned
off<00:00:20.880> by<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.119> acrylic<00:00:21.539> box<00:00:21.689> polish<00:00:22.340> and

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
off by the acrylic box polish and

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.710 
off by the acrylic box polish and
there's<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.820> lot<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.210> brake<00:00:24.359> dust<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.660> is

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
there's a lot of brake dust this is

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.790 
there's a lot of brake dust this is
seven<00:00:25.080> years<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.380> brake<00:00:25.529> dust<00:00:26.960> but<00:00:27.960> again<00:00:28.230> even

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
seven years of brake dust but again even

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.080 
seven years of brake dust but again even
with<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.099> we're<00:00:29.279> not<00:00:29.369> even<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.699> sunlight

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
with that we're not even in sunlight

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.759 
with that we're not even in sunlight
which<00:00:30.840> would<00:00:31.019> make<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.230> even<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.500> little<00:00:31.590> bit

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
which would make this even a little bit

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.490 
which would make this even a little bit
easier<00:00:32.099> as<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.239> see<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.630> takes<00:00:33.870> off

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.610

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
pretty quickly and easily the built-up

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.069 
pretty quickly and easily the built-up
brake<00:00:40.860> dust<00:00:41.570> that<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.660> pressure<00:00:42.899> washer

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
brake dust that the pressure washer

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.860 
brake dust that the pressure washer
could<00:00:43.559> not<00:00:43.739> bring<00:00:43.950> up<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:45.360> I'll<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.629> put<00:00:45.840> a

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.240 

we<00:01:43.670> now<00:01:43.880> have<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.090> tire<00:01:44.390> that's<00:01:45.010> much<00:01:46.010> much

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
we now have a tire that's much much

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.970 
we now have a tire that's much much
cleaner<00:01:46.960> brake<00:01:47.960> dust<00:01:48.170> will<00:01:48.320> not<00:01:48.530> stay<00:01:48.710> on<00:01:48.860> in

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
cleaner brake dust will not stay on in

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.410 
cleaner brake dust will not stay on in
this<00:01:49.040> long<00:01:49.810> and<00:01:51.850> I'll<00:01:52.850> never<00:01:53.060> have<00:01:53.150> to<00:01:53.240> do<00:01:53.330> this

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
this long and I'll never have to do this

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.480 
this long and I'll never have to do this
again<00:01:53.540> hopefully<00:01:53.890> but<00:01:54.890> that's<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.190> acrylic

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
again hopefully but that's the acrylic

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.430 
again hopefully but that's the acrylic
works<00:01:55.610> polish<00:01:55.970> now<00:01:56.180> just<00:01:56.600> take<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.810> wet<00:01:57.170> cloth

works polish now just take a wet cloth
as<00:01:57.860> we<00:01:58.040> normally<00:01:58.370> do<00:01:58.520> in<00:01:58.670> any<00:01:58.820> of<00:01:58.910> these

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
as we normally do in any of these

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.940 
as we normally do in any of these
demonstrations<00:01:59.600> put<00:02:00.560> a<00:02:00.590> wet<00:02:00.800> sheen<00:02:01.100> on<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:05.950> and

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
demonstrations put a wet sheen on it and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.350 
demonstrations put a wet sheen on it and
again<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:07.280> could<00:02:07.400> work<00:02:07.550> on<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.850> inside<00:02:08.119> but

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
again I could work on the inside but

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.880 
again I could work on the inside but
nobody<00:02:08.630> sees<00:02:08.810> that<00:02:08.990> so<00:02:09.200> much<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.410> mess<00:02:09.619> with<00:02:09.770> it

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
nobody sees that so much a mess with it

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.420 
nobody sees that so much a mess with it
and<00:02:10.729> then<00:02:11.000> take<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:11.240> buffing<00:02:11.600> towel<00:02:12.280> as<00:02:13.280> we

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
and then take a buffing towel as we

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.070 
and then take a buffing towel as we
normally<00:02:13.730> do<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:15.620> buff<00:02:15.800> it<00:02:15.920> out<00:02:16.070> a<00:02:16.900> little<00:02:17.900> bit

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
normally do and buff it out a little bit

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.960 
normally do and buff it out a little bit
shiny<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.800> certainly<00:02:18.950> got<00:02:19.220> less<00:02:19.610> much

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
shiny to it it certainly got less much

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.699 
shiny to it it certainly got less much
less<00:02:20.000> brake<00:02:20.360> dust<00:02:20.540> on<00:02:20.720> it

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.549 

and<00:02:25.189> we're<00:02:25.430> done
