00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.229 

run<00:01:01.570> support<00:01:02.430> they'll<00:01:03.430> have<00:01:03.610> good<00:01:03.640> tackling

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
so maybe we should stick with this a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.609 
so maybe we should stick with this a
prototype<00:01:14.039> a<00:01:14.689> playmaker<00:01:15.689> or<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.380> prototype<00:01:18.619> I'm

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
expectations but a superstar development

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.039

these<00:01:36.689> are<00:01:36.869> kind<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.140> similar<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:38.700> will

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
these are kind of similar but this will

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
want to be you know good right away you

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.510 
want to be you know good right away you
get<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.049> do<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.380> early<00:01:43.590> traffic<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.340> guess

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
get to do the early traffic but guess

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.100 
get to do the early traffic but guess
what<00:01:44.700> we're<00:01:44.789> gonna<00:01:44.909> be<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> underdogs<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.929> go

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
what we're gonna be the underdogs and go

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.949

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
safety and I didn't really see a team

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.539 
safety and I didn't really see a team
that<00:01:54.630> was<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.959> desperate<00:01:55.259> need<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:56.009> mean<00:01:56.280> I

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
that was in desperate need I mean I

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.330 
that was in desperate need I mean I
looked<00:01:56.939> at<00:01:57.090> Buffalo<00:01:57.630> since<00:01:58.409> they<00:01:58.590> lost<00:01:58.830> area's

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
looked at Buffalo since they lost area's

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.370 
looked at Buffalo since they lost area's
bird<00:01:59.580> but<00:02:00.179> then<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.390> also<00:02:00.569> know<00:02:00.990> what<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:01.229> the
