00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.910 
ability to remix certain people's
memories<00:03:22.540> so<00:03:22.720> what<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:22.930> do<00:03:23.080> is<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.379> watch

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
memories so what you do is you watch

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.860 
memories so what you do is you watch
their<00:03:24.250> memory<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.790> then<00:03:24.970> kind<00:03:25.209> of<00:03:25.299> rewind

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
their memory and then kind of rewind

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.330 
their memory and then kind of rewind
back<00:03:26.080> through<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.769> there's<00:03:27.069> certain

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
back through it and there's certain

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.500 
back through it and there's certain
things<00:03:27.370> in<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.790> memory<00:03:28.030> that<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.299> could

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
things in the memory that you could

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.330 
things in the memory that you could
click<00:03:28.660> on<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:29.260> change<00:03:29.500> how<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.769> memory<00:03:30.069> turns

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
click on to change how the memory turns

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.410 
click on to change how the memory turns
out<00:03:30.519> and<00:03:30.730> then<00:03:30.849> they'll<00:03:31.000> remember<00:03:31.209> it

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
out and then they'll remember it

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.949 
out and then they'll remember it
differently

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
differently

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.569 
differently
it's<00:03:32.319> kind<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.739> cool<00:03:32.890> gimmick<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.310> first

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
it's kind of a cool gimmick the first

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.130 
it's kind of a cool gimmick the first
time<00:03:33.819> you<00:03:33.970> do<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.150> but<00:03:34.630> it<00:03:34.720> doesn't<00:03:34.959> really<00:03:35.049> add

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
time you do it but it doesn't really add

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.259 
time you do it but it doesn't really add
that<00:03:35.739> much<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.400> game<00:03:36.579> it's<00:03:36.880> just<00:03:37.030> kind<00:03:37.239> of

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
that much to the game it's just kind of

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.720 
that much to the game it's just kind of
an<00:03:37.390> interactive<00:03:37.810> cutscene<00:03:38.440> let's<00:03:39.310> talk<00:03:39.579> about

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
an interactive cutscene let's talk about

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.400 
an interactive cutscene let's talk about
this<00:03:39.940> story<00:03:40.180> it's<00:03:40.660> an<00:03:40.780> interesting<00:03:41.019> premise

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
this story it's an interesting premise

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.960 
this story it's an interesting premise
but<00:03:41.769> I<00:03:41.799> can't<00:03:42.069> help<00:03:42.220> but<00:03:42.310> feel<00:03:42.610> like<00:03:42.640> it's<00:03:42.910> a

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
but I can't help but feel like it's a

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.490 
but I can't help but feel like it's a
bit<00:03:43.150> rush<00:03:43.390> there's<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:44.019> lot<00:03:44.200> they<00:03:44.380> don't

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
bit rush there's a lot they don't

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.559 
bit rush there's a lot they don't
explain<00:03:44.950> for<00:03:45.370> example<00:03:45.940> there<00:03:46.360> are<00:03:46.390> these

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
explain for example there are these

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:47.759 
explain for example there are these
things<00:03:46.720> called<00:03:46.959> leapers<00:03:47.440> which<00:03:47.620> are

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
things called leapers which are

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.410 
things called leapers which are
basically<00:03:48.099> mutants<00:03:48.640> that<00:03:48.790> feed<00:03:48.970> on<00:03:49.090> people's

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
basically mutants that feed on people's

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.390 
basically mutants that feed on people's
memories<00:03:49.750> but<00:03:50.319> the<00:03:50.349> game<00:03:50.590> never<00:03:50.620> explains<00:03:51.220> how

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
memories but the game never explains how

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.860 
memories but the game never explains how
consuming<00:03:51.849> memories<00:03:52.180> can<00:03:52.360> actually<00:03:52.690> alter

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
consuming memories can actually alter

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.569 
consuming memories can actually alter
their<00:03:53.140> physical<00:03:53.500> appearance<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.040> give<00:03:54.430> them

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
their physical appearance and give them

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.610 
their physical appearance and give them
the<00:03:54.670> power<00:03:54.819> to<00:03:54.970> turn<00:03:55.180> invisible<00:03:55.360> as<00:03:56.230> far<00:03:56.530> as

the power to turn invisible as far as

forgettable for the most part which is

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.690 
forgettable for the most part which is
ironic<00:04:14.709> considering<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.250> game's<00:04:15.459> name

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700

experience which was disappointing

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.750

scattered around the city but sadly the

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.170 
scattered around the city but sadly the

music<00:04:34.510> in<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:34.720> game<00:04:34.750> is<00:04:34.870> fairly<00:04:35.289> enjoyable<00:04:35.530> I

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
music in the game is fairly enjoyable I

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.740 
music in the game is fairly enjoyable I
felt<00:04:36.130> like<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.370> helped<00:04:36.550> get<00:04:36.729> me<00:04:36.880> pumped<00:04:37.479> up<00:04:37.570> for

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
felt like it helped get me pumped up for

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.060 
felt like it helped get me pumped up for
the<00:04:37.840> next<00:04:38.080> flight<00:04:38.229> even<00:04:38.500> though<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.740> knew<00:04:38.950> that

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
the next flight even though I knew that

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.320 
the next flight even though I knew that
it<00:04:39.160> was<00:04:39.250> probably<00:04:39.490> going<00:04:39.669> to<00:04:39.789> be<00:04:39.910> like<00:04:40.090> all<00:04:40.210> the

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
it was probably going to be like all the

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.150 
it was probably going to be like all the

the<00:04:54.669> combat<00:04:55.120> isn't<00:04:55.389> very<00:04:55.570> deep<00:04:55.720> the<00:04:55.900> story

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169

feels rushed and the game is just

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.610 
feels rushed and the game is just
overall<00:04:58.090> not<00:04:58.300> that<00:04:58.479> challenging<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:59.440> game

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
but I do feel like the developers

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.089 
but I do feel like the developers
overreached<00:05:08.110> a<00:05:08.289> bit<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:08.590> wound<00:05:08.800> up<00:05:08.950> with<00:05:09.070> a

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
overreached a bit and wound up with a

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:11.070 
overreached a bit and wound up with a
repetitive<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:09.909> somewhat<00:05:10.300> shallow<00:05:10.599> game

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
repetitive and somewhat shallow game

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.710 
repetitive and somewhat shallow game
final<00:05:11.890> score<00:05:12.099> is<00:05:12.219> 7<00:05:12.640> robot<00:05:12.969> prostitute
