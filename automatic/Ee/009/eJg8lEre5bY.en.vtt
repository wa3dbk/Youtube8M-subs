guys<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.149> have<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.869> computer<00:01:52.320> and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
guys that have like the computer and

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.300 
guys that have like the computer and
whatnot<00:01:54.259> capturing<00:01:55.259> their<00:01:55.350> screen<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.920> think

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
whatnot capturing their screen I think

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.990 
whatnot capturing their screen I think
for<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.909> guys<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.780> know<00:01:57.899> mmm<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.670> best<00:01:59.850> way

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
for you guys you know mmm the best way

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.980 
for you guys you know mmm the best way
to<00:02:00.060> go<00:02:00.210> at<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.420> now<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.530> probably<00:02:01.860> get<00:02:02.130> a

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
to go at it now is to probably get a

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.530 
to go at it now is to probably get a
pinochle<00:02:03.990> or<00:02:04.700> something<00:02:05.700> on<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.030> end<00:02:06.299> I

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
pinochle or something on that end I

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.320 
pinochle or something on that end I
think<00:02:06.840> that's<00:02:06.990> what<00:02:07.140> they're<00:02:07.290> called

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
think that's what they're called

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.600 
think that's what they're called
something<00:02:09.330> SD<00:02:09.840> or<00:02:10.050> HD<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.250> an<00:02:11.400> actual

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
something SD or HD that is an actual

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.630 
something SD or HD that is an actual
capture<00:02:12.000> card<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.450> don't<00:02:12.569> want<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.840> see

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
capture card I don't want to see

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.309 
capture card I don't want to see
one's<00:02:13.730> taking<00:02:14.120> pictures<00:02:14.480> on<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.690> screen<00:02:14.840> and

one's taking pictures on the screen and

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.400 
one's taking pictures on the screen and

cool and this is what's going to be

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.660 
cool and this is what's going to be
awesome<00:02:21.200> about<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.680> if<00:02:22.010> it's<00:02:22.190> cool<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.550> you

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
send it in it can be a blooper it could

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.780 
send it in it can be a blooper it could
be<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.590> great<00:02:24.890> play<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:25.340> could<00:02:25.459> be<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.580> great

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
be a great play it could be a great

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.540 
be a great play it could be a great
catch<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.720> could<00:02:26.930> be<00:02:27.050> a<00:02:27.080> hit<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.590> BPI<00:02:28.010> no<00:02:28.220> Crash

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
catch it could be a hit and BPI no Crash

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.520 
catch it could be a hit and BPI no Crash
Davis<00:02:28.580> ask<00:02:29.150> could<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.420> be<00:02:29.540> BP<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:30.050> said<00:02:30.350> yeah

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
Davis ask could it be BP I said yeah

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.199 
Davis ask could it be BP I said yeah
because<00:02:30.770> some<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.430> balls<00:02:31.580> I've<00:02:31.820> hit<00:02:32.030> and

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
because some of the balls I've hit and

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.000 
because some of the balls I've hit and
BP<00:02:32.540> where<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.840> furthest<00:02:33.470> balls<00:02:33.650> ever<00:02:33.800> seen

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
BP where the furthest balls ever seen

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.270 
BP where the furthest balls ever seen
hit<00:02:34.160> so<00:02:34.970> um<00:02:35.660> it<00:02:36.350> could<00:02:36.470> be<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.620> computer<00:02:37.100> making

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
hit so um it could be a computer making

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.100 
hit so um it could be a computer making
a<00:02:37.459> play<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:37.670> know<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:38.030> bunch<00:02:38.300> of<00:02:38.420> times<00:02:38.660> the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
a play I know a bunch of times the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.080 
a play I know a bunch of times the
computer<00:02:39.500> has<00:02:39.530> made<00:02:39.830> great<00:02:40.040> plays<00:02:40.340> on<00:02:40.550> me<00:02:40.730> so

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
computer has made great plays on me so

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.479 
computer has made great plays on me so
it<00:02:41.660> could<00:02:41.900> be<00:02:41.989> anything<00:02:42.410> from<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:43.040> game<00:02:43.250> it

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
it could be anything from the game it

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.920 
it could be anything from the game it
could<00:02:43.670> be<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.819> blooper<00:02:44.330> it<00:02:44.480> could<00:02:44.630> be<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.750> great

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
could be a blooper it could be a great

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.930 
could be a blooper it could be a great
play<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:45.800> can<00:02:45.950> be<00:02:46.070> something<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.489> computer

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
play it can be something the computer

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.910 
play it can be something the computer
makes<00:02:47.150> but<00:02:47.570> all<00:02:47.720> I'm<00:02:47.840> asking<00:02:48.200> is<00:02:48.260> is<00:02:48.470> that<00:02:48.770> it's

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
makes but all I'm asking is is that it's

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.759 
makes but all I'm asking is is that it's
under<00:02:49.400> 30<00:02:49.940> seconds<00:02:50.540> long<00:02:50.810> now<00:02:51.470> if<00:02:51.620> it's

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
under 30 seconds long now if it's

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.440 
under 30 seconds long now if it's
something<00:02:51.980> like<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:52.430> go<00:02:52.580> four<00:02:52.910> for<00:02:53.150> four<00:02:53.390> with

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
something like you go four for four with

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.540 
something like you go four for four with
four<00:02:53.959> home<00:02:54.170> runs<00:02:54.200> now<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:55.160> could<00:02:55.370> probably

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
four home runs now that could probably

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.650 
four home runs now that could probably
be<00:02:55.760> over<00:02:56.090> 30<00:02:56.510> seconds<00:02:57.760> yep<00:02:58.760> just<00:02:59.269> try<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.510> edit

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
be over 30 seconds yep just try to edit

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.479 
be over 30 seconds yep just try to edit
it<00:02:59.840> down<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.290> then<00:03:00.350> maybe<00:03:00.590> all<00:03:00.830> edit<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.430> a

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
it down and then maybe all edit it a

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.400 
it down and then maybe all edit it a
little<00:03:01.670> bit<00:03:01.880> as<00:03:02.000> well<00:03:02.450> but<00:03:02.989> maybe<00:03:03.170> if<00:03:03.380> you

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
little bit as well but maybe if you

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.540 
little bit as well but maybe if you
throw<00:03:03.709> a<00:03:03.739> perfect<00:03:04.040> game<00:03:04.280> again<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:07.310> is

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
throw a perfect game again that is

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.250 
throw a perfect game again that is
probably<00:03:07.940> going<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.120> be<00:03:08.180> over<00:03:08.480> 30<00:03:08.720> seconds<00:03:09.200> and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
probably going to be over 30 seconds and

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.620 
probably going to be over 30 seconds and
if<00:03:09.350> it<00:03:09.470> is<00:03:09.560> something<00:03:09.800> like<00:03:10.040> that<00:03:10.280> then<00:03:10.850> those

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
if it is something like that then those

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.090 
if it is something like that then those
are<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.870> two<00:03:12.019> things<00:03:12.050> I'm<00:03:12.410> going<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.769> allow

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
are the two things I'm going to allow

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.080 
are the two things I'm going to allow
but<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:15.230> know<00:03:15.350> if<00:03:16.160> I<00:03:16.310> do<00:03:16.370> start<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.760> get<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:16.940> lot

you<00:04:36.469> see<00:04:36.879> sports<00:04:37.879> ones<00:04:38.210> but<00:04:38.509> they<00:04:38.689> are<00:04:38.870> filled

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
you see sports ones but they are filled

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.820 
you see sports ones but they are filled
with<00:04:40.629> other<00:04:41.629> sports<00:04:42.050> besides<00:04:42.139> baseball<00:04:42.590> I

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
with other sports besides baseball I

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.379 
with other sports besides baseball I
think<00:04:43.039> a<00:04:43.099> lot<00:04:43.219> of<00:04:43.249> times<00:04:43.460> baseball<00:04:43.909> gets

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
think a lot of times baseball gets

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.260 
think a lot of times baseball gets
overshadowed<00:04:44.749> in<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:46.430> sport<00:04:46.969> gaming

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
overshadowed in the sport gaming

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.839 
overshadowed in the sport gaming
community<00:04:47.659> but<00:04:47.990> that's<00:04:48.439> another<00:04:48.650> topic<00:04:48.979> in

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 
community but that's another topic in

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.300 
community but that's another topic in
itself<00:04:50.289> like<00:04:51.289> I<00:04:51.409> said<00:04:51.469> it<00:04:51.710> could<00:04:51.860> be<00:04:51.979> anything

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
itself like I said it could be anything

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.730 
itself like I said it could be anything
batting<00:04:53.300> practice<00:04:53.330> home<00:04:53.749> run<00:04:53.810> a<00:04:54.110> diving<00:04:54.379> catch

by<00:04:55.069> the<00:04:55.099> computer<00:04:55.639> I've<00:04:55.939> had<00:04:56.210> so<00:04:56.419> many<00:04:56.449> home

00:04:56.739 --> 00:04:56.749 
by the computer I've had so many home

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:59.080 
by the computer I've had so many home
runs<00:04:56.779> robbed<00:04:57.289> by<00:04:57.590> the<00:04:57.620> computer<00:04:58.189> it's

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
runs robbed by the computer it's

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.510 
runs robbed by the computer it's
ridiculous<00:04:59.330> so<00:04:59.930> I<00:05:00.229> think<00:05:00.889> that<00:05:01.099> would<00:05:01.189> be<00:05:01.310> cool

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
ridiculous so I think that would be cool

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.580 
ridiculous so I think that would be cool
it<00:05:01.969> can<00:05:02.120> be<00:05:02.210> even<00:05:02.389> a<00:05:02.569> home<00:05:02.779> run<00:05:03.110> in<00:05:03.229> a<00:05:03.289> home<00:05:03.439> run

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
it can be even a home run in a home run

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.920 
it can be even a home run in a home run
