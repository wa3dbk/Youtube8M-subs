 unpredictable 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.290
 The first truth is the motto is a

 to help in the battle 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.700
 this stone works in combination with the 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.649
 other skills doing nothing for 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.290
 if they only last two minutes and can 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.500
 be lifted at most six times they 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.850
 are invulnerable and have no collision 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.740
 moves cakes makes it hits one 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.320
 ally or enemy or stone in 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.450
 pushing away from him giving in 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.130
 any enemy that the target passes this

 ability to be used on a stone. 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.640
 stone go further than any 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.640
 another album takes the most of this 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.009

 bowler do what he turns a ball of 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.330
 stone and be thrown in the direction 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.190
 It is turned on and citizen units 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.070
 it will stop but it will stop when 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.110
 hit the enemy or fortunate if he

 Dilma guinÃ© strike, which means that 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.460
 it creates a magnetic charge by pulling a 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.960
 ally or stone for him

 close to stones make them 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.349
 become magnetized and then exploded 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.269
 causing or renewing the effects of 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.459
 magnetizing act on the enemies that 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.610
 are near the stones are destroyed 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.099

 feel the effects of bubble smash and go 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.110
 though 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.960
 if magnetized enemies take a 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.450
 of these abilities she does not get the maximum 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.140
 of semid damage per second then causing
