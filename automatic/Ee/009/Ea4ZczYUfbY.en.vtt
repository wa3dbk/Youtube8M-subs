00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
defibrillator so they're all the trips

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.360 
defibrillator so they're all the trips
and<00:04:56.650> then<00:04:56.919> I've<00:04:57.190> put<00:04:57.340> just<00:04:57.910> there<00:04:58.560> my<00:04:59.560> split

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
and then I've put just there my split

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.250 
and then I've put just there my split
charge<00:05:00.669> relay<00:05:01.440> ambert<00:05:02.440> valley<00:05:02.890> that<00:05:03.400> is<00:05:04.260> 200

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
charge relay ambert valley that is 200

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.820 
charge relay ambert valley that is 200
amps<00:05:05.560> so<00:05:05.770> that's<00:05:06.100> plenty<00:05:06.850> of<00:05:07.030> them<00:05:07.740> plenty<00:05:08.740> of

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.710 
amps so that's plenty of them plenty of
power<00:05:09.040> now<00:05:09.820> as<00:05:09.970> you<00:05:10.090> can<00:05:10.210> see<00:05:10.270> on<00:05:10.510> there

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
power now as you can see on there

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.960 
power now as you can see on there
there's<00:05:10.990> four<00:05:11.350> wires<00:05:12.450> now<00:05:14.280> the<00:05:15.280> red<00:05:15.520> one<00:05:15.760> on

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
there's four wires now the red one on

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.210 
there's four wires now the red one on
the<00:05:16.540> right<00:05:16.950> goes<00:05:17.950> to<00:05:18.090> my<00:05:19.740> cranking<00:05:20.740> battery

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
the right goes to my cranking battery

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.420 
the right goes to my cranking battery
starter<00:05:21.940> battery<00:05:22.120> for<00:05:22.660> the<00:05:22.720> van<00:05:23.010> it's<00:05:24.010> got<00:05:24.250> a

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
starter battery for the van it's got a

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.210 
starter battery for the van it's got a
big<00:05:25.090> fuse<00:05:25.419> in<00:05:25.630> it<00:05:25.780> I<00:05:25.960> think<00:05:26.380> that's<00:05:26.680> a<00:05:26.860> hundred

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
big fuse in it I think that's a hundred

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.490 
big fuse in it I think that's a hundred
amp<00:05:27.400> fuse<00:05:28.390> of<00:05:28.600> the<00:05:28.690> minute<00:05:28.960> but<00:05:29.140> it<00:05:29.229> doesn't

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
amp fuse of the minute but it doesn't

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.920 
amp fuse of the minute but it doesn't
need<00:05:29.650> to<00:05:29.800> be<00:05:29.830> that<00:05:29.950> big<00:05:30.150> so<00:05:31.150> we've<00:05:31.570> got<00:05:31.750> that<00:05:31.870> in

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
need to be that big so we've got that in

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.750 
need to be that big so we've got that in
there<00:05:32.229> then<00:05:32.979> the<00:05:33.250> big<00:05:33.880> red<00:05:34.150> wire<00:05:34.419> on<00:05:34.720> the<00:05:35.110> left

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
there then the big red wire on the left

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.940 
there then the big red wire on the left
that<00:05:36.760> goes<00:05:37.060> all<00:05:37.479> the<00:05:37.540> way<00:05:37.690> back<00:05:38.020> to<00:05:38.320> the<00:05:38.680> laser

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
that goes all the way back to the laser

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.450 
that goes all the way back to the laser
battery<00:05:39.520> now<00:05:40.270> the<00:05:40.330> laser<00:05:40.660> battery<00:05:41.229> is<00:05:41.530> in<00:05:42.130> the

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
battery now the laser battery is in the

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.860 
battery now the laser battery is in the
back<00:05:42.669> on<00:05:42.940> my<00:05:43.660> bed<00:05:43.900> so<00:05:44.800> that<00:05:45.270> runs<00:05:46.270> back<00:05:46.510> to<00:05:46.720> that

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
back on my bed so that runs back to that

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.590 
back on my bed so that runs back to that
and<00:05:47.350> then<00:05:47.590> we<00:05:47.770> have<00:05:47.800> two<00:05:48.580> little<00:05:48.850> wires<00:05:49.180> on<00:05:49.479> the

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
and then we have two little wires on the

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.830 
and then we have two little wires on the
back<00:05:50.070> with<00:05:51.070> the<00:05:51.280> blue<00:05:51.640> connectors<00:05:52.270> in<00:05:52.479> between

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
back with the blue connectors in between

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.490 
back with the blue connectors in between
those<00:05:53.080> two<00:05:53.440> red<00:05:54.130> ones<00:05:54.310> the<00:05:55.180> black<00:05:55.450> one<00:05:55.750> goes<00:05:56.470> to

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
those two red ones the black one goes to

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.850 
those two red ones the black one goes to
the<00:05:57.370> earth<00:05:57.700> on<00:05:58.450> the<00:05:59.229> cranking<00:05:59.770> battery<00:06:00.390> and

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
the earth on the cranking battery and

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.650 
the earth on the cranking battery and
the<00:06:02.860> brown<00:06:03.190> one<00:06:03.900> goes<00:06:04.900> all<00:06:05.320> the<00:06:05.380> way<00:06:05.710> round<00:06:06.660> all

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
the brown one goes all the way round all

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.529 
the brown one goes all the way round all
the<00:06:07.690> way<00:06:07.960> around<00:06:08.289> and<00:06:08.979> it<00:06:09.099> joins<00:06:09.370> to<00:06:10.180> the<00:06:10.210> wire

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
the way around and it joins to the wire

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:12.010 
the way around and it joins to the wire
on<00:06:10.810> the<00:06:11.020> alternator

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
on the alternator

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.700 
on the alternator
on<00:06:12.350> the<00:06:12.560> alternator<00:06:12.980> there's<00:06:13.760> a<00:06:14.330> big<00:06:15.080> fat<00:06:15.380> red

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
on the alternator there's a big fat red

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.360 
on the alternator there's a big fat red
one<00:06:15.920> you<00:06:16.910> can't<00:06:17.150> see<00:06:17.240> that<00:06:17.510> very<00:06:17.570> well<00:06:17.960> because

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
one you can't see that very well because

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.730 
one you can't see that very well because
color<00:06:19.370> isn't<00:06:19.730> very<00:06:19.940> good<00:06:20.000> but<00:06:20.870> that's<00:06:21.290> the<00:06:21.560> red

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
color isn't very good but that's the red

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.430 
color isn't very good but that's the red
one<00:06:21.770> on<00:06:22.190> the<00:06:22.460> alternator<00:06:22.970> and<00:06:23.450> then<00:06:24.080> the<00:06:24.230> blue

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
one on the alternator and then the blue

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.040 
one on the alternator and then the blue
one<00:06:24.740> which<00:06:25.340> is<00:06:25.520> that<00:06:25.730> one<00:06:26.080> is<00:06:27.080> for<00:06:27.920> the<00:06:29.050> brown

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
one which is that one is for the brown

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:37.570 
one which is that one is for the brown
wire<00:06:30.380> is<00:06:30.680> connected<00:06:30.890> into<00:06:31.520> that<00:06:31.670> blue<00:06:36.310> yeah<00:06:37.310> I

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
wire is connected into that blue yeah I

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:50.940 
wire is connected into that blue yeah I
put<00:06:38.450> two<00:06:38.870> new<00:06:39.140> terminals<00:06:39.500> on<00:06:49.030> it's<00:06:50.030> all<00:06:50.270> good

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:50.950 
put two new terminals on it's all good

00:06:50.950 --> 00:07:03.100 
put two new terminals on it's all good
so<00:06:51.950> yeah<00:07:00.100> two
