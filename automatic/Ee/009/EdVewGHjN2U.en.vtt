that spot so we're gonna base a line

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.330 
that spot so we're gonna base a line
crash<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.210> defensive<00:02:30.720> line<00:02:30.930> down<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.590> then

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.220

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
opponent hikes the ball then you can

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.759 
opponent hikes the ball then you can
move<00:03:30.209> with<00:03:30.390> him<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:30.780> either<00:03:31.230> play<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.590> left

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
middle the left seems rundown or maybe a

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.370 
middle the left seems rundown or maybe a
drag<00:03:34.590> route<00:03:34.799> or<00:03:35.010> watch<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.970> flats<00:03:36.239> one<00:03:37.019> final

adjustment<00:03:37.470> we<00:03:37.950> like<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.250> make<00:03:38.400> which<00:03:38.760> is<00:03:38.910> not

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
adjustment we like to make which is not

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.750 
adjustment we like to make which is not
necessary<00:03:39.989> at<00:03:40.170> all<00:03:40.200> is<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:41.340> pinch<00:03:41.580> the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
necessary at all is to pinch the

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.850 
necessary at all is to pinch the
linebackers<00:03:42.330> down<00:03:42.600> we<00:03:43.170> feel<00:03:43.350> like<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.620> stop

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
linebackers down we feel like that stop

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.470 
linebackers down we feel like that stop
so<00:03:44.040> run<00:03:44.190> better<00:03:44.400> it<00:03:44.610> also<00:03:44.730> makes<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:45.180> blitz<00:03:45.390> a

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
so run better it also makes this blitz a

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.090 
so run better it also makes this blitz a
little<00:03:45.660> bit<00:03:45.750> more<00:03:45.870> consistent<00:03:46.440> but<00:03:46.799> it's<00:03:46.950> not

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
little bit more consistent but it's not

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.280 
little bit more consistent but it's not
something<00:03:47.459> you<00:03:47.580> need<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.850> do<00:03:48.000> so<00:03:48.510> if<00:03:48.870> your

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
something you need to do so if your

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.380 
something you need to do so if your
opponent<00:03:49.680> doesn't<00:03:49.890> have<00:03:50.190> three<00:03:50.850> receivers<00:03:51.299> on

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
the right side all you have to do is

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.860 
the right side all you have to do is
crash<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.190> defensive<00:03:53.610> line<00:03:53.760> down<00:03:54.030> but<00:03:54.660> if

crash the defensive line down but if

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.660 
crash the defensive line down but if

crash the defensive line down and then

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.699 
crash the defensive line down and then

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
so I protect the offensive line to the

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.800 
so I protect the offensive line to the
left<00:04:28.980> in<00:04:29.250> this<00:04:29.639> case<00:04:29.850> it's<00:04:30.060> pretty<00:04:30.180> random<00:04:30.510> on

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
left in this case it's pretty random on

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.900

we're gonna shift the offensive line to
the<00:04:45.600> right<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.710> we<00:04:46.800> got<00:04:46.919> B<00:04:47.100> gap<00:04:47.340> to<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.639> right

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
the right and we got B gap to the right

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.460 
the right and we got B gap to the right
of<00:04:47.940> screen<00:04:48.030> defensive<00:04:48.600> end<00:04:48.750> if<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:49.020> right<00:04:49.380> of

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
of screen defensive end if the right of

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.629 
of screen defensive end if the right of
screen<00:04:49.530> defensive<00:04:50.010> end<00:04:50.130> doesn't<00:04:50.400> come<00:04:50.520> in

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
screen defensive end doesn't come in

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.490 
screen defensive end doesn't come in
then<00:04:51.000> someone<00:04:51.360> on<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.510> left<00:04:51.690> side<00:04:51.840> we'll<00:04:52.050> all

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
then someone on the left side we'll all

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.890 
then someone on the left side we'll all
we<00:04:52.800> have<00:04:52.950> left<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.310> do<00:04:53.490> is<00:04:53.730> aggressive<00:04:54.660> block

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
we have left to do is aggressive block

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.330 
we have left to do is aggressive block
so<00:04:55.080> we're<00:04:55.169> gonna<00:04:55.290> aggressive<00:04:55.740> block<00:04:55.980> when<00:04:56.220> you

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
so we're gonna aggressive block when you

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.900 
so we're gonna aggressive block when you
do<00:04:56.490> that

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
do that

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.790 
do that
the<00:04:57.120> tight<00:04:57.360> end<00:04:57.389> and<00:04:57.660> running<00:04:57.870> back<00:04:58.020> blocks<00:04:58.320> of

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
the tight end and running back blocks of

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.170 
the tight end and running back blocks of
course<00:04:59.100> that's<00:04:59.280> gonna<00:04:59.400> block<00:04:59.669> this<00:04:59.850> blitz

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
course that's gonna block this blitz

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.790 
course that's gonna block this blitz
so<00:05:00.300> we<00:05:00.450> aggressive<00:05:00.900> block<00:05:01.140> and<00:05:01.380> then<00:05:01.470> put<00:05:01.650> them

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
so we aggressive block and then put them

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.710 
so we aggressive block and then put them
bolt<00:05:01.980> in<00:05:02.130> coverage<00:05:02.430> and<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:03.090> Blitz<00:05:03.300> came<00:05:03.510> in

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
bolt in coverage and the Blitz came in

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.480 
bolt in coverage and the Blitz came in
if<00:05:04.110> you<00:05:04.290> think<00:05:04.500> your<00:05:04.620> opponent's<00:05:05.010> gonna<00:05:05.070> run<00:05:05.340> a

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
if you think your opponent's gonna run a

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.820 
if you think your opponent's gonna run a
play-action<00:05:06.000> play<00:05:06.390> all<00:05:07.080> we<00:05:07.320> have<00:05:07.410> to<00:05:07.530> do<00:05:07.680> is

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
play-action play all we have to do is

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.040 
play-action play all we have to do is
the<00:05:07.950> same<00:05:08.190> setup<00:05:08.520> but<00:05:08.880> now<00:05:09.030> pass<00:05:09.390> commit<00:05:09.900> your

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
the same setup but now pass commit your

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.170 
the same setup but now pass commit your
defense<00:05:10.470> that<00:05:11.160> way<00:05:11.430> when<00:05:11.669> your<00:05:11.790> opponent<00:05:12.060> runs

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
defense that way when your opponent runs

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.030 
defense that way when your opponent runs
a<00:05:12.300> play-action<00:05:12.720> they<00:05:13.320> don't<00:05:13.590> fall<00:05:13.830> for<00:05:13.980> the

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
a play-action they don't fall for the

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.409 
a play-action they don't fall for the
running<00:05:14.310> back<00:05:14.400> they<00:05:14.610> go<00:05:14.730> directly<00:05:15.210> at<00:05:15.300> the

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
running back they go directly at the

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.360 
running back they go directly at the
quarterback<00:05:15.720> the<00:05:16.260> left<00:05:16.590> Nickelback<00:05:17.100> should

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
quarterback the left Nickelback should

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.920 
quarterback the left Nickelback should
come<00:05:17.580> in<00:05:17.790> free<00:05:18.120> because<00:05:18.419> the<00:05:18.540> left<00:05:18.750> tackle

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
come in free because the left tackle

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.320 
come in free because the left tackle
blocks<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.650> left<00:05:19.860> outside<00:05:20.070> linebacker<00:05:20.330> but

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
blocks the left outside linebacker but

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.770 
blocks the left outside linebacker but
now<00:05:21.510> what<00:05:21.960> about<00:05:22.110> when<00:05:22.650> your<00:05:22.770> opponent<00:05:23.130> blocks

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
now what about when your opponent blocks

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.990 
now what about when your opponent blocks
here<00:05:24.780> we're<00:05:25.229> in<00:05:25.260> a<00:05:25.560> shotgun<00:05:25.919> why<00:05:26.220> trips<00:05:26.700> we're

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
here we're in a shotgun why trips we're

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.570 
here we're in a shotgun why trips we're
blocking<00:05:27.510> the<00:05:27.630> running<00:05:27.900> back<00:05:28.020> left<00:05:28.440> and<00:05:28.770> the

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
blocking the running back left and the

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.280 
blocking the running back left and the
Blitz<00:05:29.850> is<00:05:29.970> actually<00:05:30.419> going<00:05:30.630> to<00:05:30.870> come<00:05:31.080> in

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
Blitz is actually going to come in

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.530 
Blitz is actually going to come in
because<00:05:31.950> the<00:05:32.340> running<00:05:32.850> back<00:05:32.970> in<00:05:33.120> this<00:05:33.240> case

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
because the running back in this case

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.890 
because the running back in this case
when<00:05:34.320> to<00:05:34.470> go<00:05:34.620> block<00:05:34.919> the<00:05:35.100> a<00:05:35.130> gap<00:05:35.520> now<00:05:35.790> will<00:05:36.750> that

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
when to go block the a gap now will that

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.090 
when to go block the a gap now will that
happen<00:05:37.020> every<00:05:37.320> time<00:05:37.440> of<00:05:37.500> course<00:05:37.860> not

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
happen every time of course not

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.100 
happen every time of course not
sometimes<00:05:38.610> he<00:05:38.760> will<00:05:38.940> block<00:05:39.210> him<00:05:39.450> but<00:05:39.870> I'm<00:05:39.960> just

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
sometimes he will block him but I'm just

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.409 
sometimes he will block him but I'm just
showing<00:05:40.229> you<00:05:40.560> that<00:05:41.250> this<00:05:41.520> blitz<00:05:41.820> can<00:05:42.090> still

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
showing you that this blitz can still

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.390 
showing you that this blitz can still
come<00:05:42.630> in<00:05:42.810> if<00:05:42.960> your<00:05:43.169> opponent<00:05:43.560> blocks<00:05:43.800> it<00:05:44.160> won't

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
come in if your opponent blocks it won't

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.219 
come in if your opponent blocks it won't
happen<00:05:44.520> every<00:05:44.880> time<00:05:45.120> but<00:05:45.510> it<00:05:45.630> does<00:05:45.810> happen<00:05:46.020> a

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
happen every time but it does happen a

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:47.570 
happen every time but it does happen a
good<00:05:46.410> majority<00:05:46.650> of<00:05:46.830> the<00:05:46.979> time<00:05:47.190> so<00:05:47.340> that<00:05:47.370> was

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
good majority of the time so that was

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.890 
good majority of the time so that was
the<00:05:47.700> running<00:05:47.970> back<00:05:48.090> blocking<00:05:48.479> to<00:05:48.600> the<00:05:48.690> left

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
the running back blocking to the left

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.900 
the running back blocking to the left
this<00:05:49.500> is<00:05:49.680> the<00:05:49.800> running<00:05:49.979> back<00:05:50.070> blocking<00:05:50.610> to<00:05:50.760> the

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
this is the running back blocking to the

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.510 
this is the running back blocking to the
right<00:05:51.210> and<00:05:51.570> now<00:05:52.380> this<00:05:52.830> blitz<00:05:53.010> is<00:05:53.130> even<00:05:53.370> better

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
right and now this blitz is even better

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.770 
right and now this blitz is even better
when<00:05:53.760> the<00:05:53.850> running<00:05:54.060> backs<00:05:54.210> blocking<00:05:54.600> right

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
when the running backs blocking right

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.990 
when the running backs blocking right
because<00:05:55.590> if<00:05:55.860> he<00:05:56.160> blocks<00:05:56.430> to<00:05:56.580> the<00:05:56.669> right<00:05:56.700> side

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
because if he blocks to the right side

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.420 
because if he blocks to the right side
we<00:05:57.300> have<00:05:57.510> an<00:05:57.630> overload<00:05:58.020> left<00:05:58.380> so<00:05:58.979> someone

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
we have an overload left so someone

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.890 
we have an overload left so someone
should<00:05:59.700> come<00:05:59.910> in<00:06:00.090> free<00:06:00.300> from<00:06:00.419> the<00:06:00.539> left<00:06:00.720> side

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
should come in free from the left side

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.600 
should come in free from the left side
will<00:06:01.080> it<00:06:01.200> happen<00:06:01.289> every<00:06:01.500> time<00:06:01.740> no<00:06:02.039> in<00:06:02.250> this

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
will it happen every time no in this

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.610 
will it happen every time no in this
case<00:06:02.669> we<00:06:03.150> got<00:06:03.330> our<00:06:03.539> left<00:06:03.810> D<00:06:03.990> T<00:06:04.169> to<00:06:04.289> come<00:06:04.410> up<00:06:04.530> the

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
case we got our left D T to come up the

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.560 
case we got our left D T to come up the
a<00:06:04.650> gap<00:06:04.890> that<00:06:05.100> usually<00:06:05.789> doesn't<00:06:06.000> happen<00:06:06.180> I

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
a gap that usually doesn't happen I

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.510 
a gap that usually doesn't happen I
would<00:06:06.780> say<00:06:06.960> in<00:06:07.110> most<00:06:07.260> cases<00:06:07.620> the<00:06:08.250> left

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
would say in most cases the left

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.670 
would say in most cases the left
Nickelback<00:06:09.090> will<00:06:09.630> slowly<00:06:10.020> look<00:06:10.440> to<00:06:10.590> the

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
Nickelback will slowly look to the

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.409 
Nickelback will slowly look to the
outside<00:06:10.740> and<00:06:11.280> coming<00:06:11.460> free<00:06:11.789> against<00:06:12.210> a

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
outside and coming free against a

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.840 
outside and coming free against a
