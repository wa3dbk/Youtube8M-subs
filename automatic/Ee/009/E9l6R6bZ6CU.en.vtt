00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 Demyan Lovegrove is very easy shooting in 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.629
 boudoir style 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.470
 Now I will take a portrait 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.999
 models here on this ladder I will 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.579
 use one light source 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.749
 which I put here in that corner I 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.030
 I use a very powerful source 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.610
 lighting so i expose it now 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.989
 at minimum power in this way 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.740
 we will only get a small 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:44.110
 artificial lights now like you 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.240
 see on the source is included modeling 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.980
 or pilot as it is also called light 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:56.350
 so we will see how 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:58.750
 cut-off pattern is formed on 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.110
 the source itself we wear a standard 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.449
 a reflector with a diameter of 18 centimeters and on 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.970
 he is wearing a lattice 100 if we are now 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.909
 remove the nozzle you see inside itself 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.700
 source lamp and modeling lamp 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.009
 light i use a honeycomb with an angle 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.929
 20 degrees which will give me quite 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.390
 directional narrow beam of light 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:21.100
 I don't need to light everything around me 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.799
 need to direct the light only strictly on 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.499
 model now raise the rack to the desired 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.700
 level and due to the fact that we use 

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:30.460
 modeling light is very easy to see 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.289
 where will the light be directed i think that 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.969
 while we leave the light at this height 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:38.590
 and further if necessary I will correct 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.810
 I think that I still need to tilt 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.539
 the head of light itself is slightly lower 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.969
 I want the light to fall from above and 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.799
 slightly angled and I'm right now 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.079
 I scroll myself in my head where it will be 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.799
 be the model where we put her 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.859
 I guess, that 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.139
 you need to direct the light like that 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:58.119
 I’ll stop by this now I’ll ask 

00:01:56.139 --> 00:02:01.420
 our model come down and take your 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.159
 place i will shoot at lens 50 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.619
 millimeters and we have quite a lot here 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.250
 natural light attacks which goes 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.050
 from above behind I will start with what I will do 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.660
 photo without additional lighting 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.280
 and also now turn off the extra light 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.010
 which I don't need we won't him 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.379
 use and make the first test 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.220
 frame without flash use 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.220
 what will we do 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.330
 quite a bit without flash 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.910
 the light hits the model you're here on 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.370
 railing and on the wall and i like how 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.040
 the light from the window illuminates the edges of the steps 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.660
 and everything except the model so we need 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.390
 add some light to the model for 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.400
 order to separate it from the background 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.690
 I tested the flash it works 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.490
 she act on very small 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.320
 power and it seems to me that it will be 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.360
 correct power because we have 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.620
 here and so very little light and we do not 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.210
 need to interrupt him 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.830
 and that's what we did with 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.670
 using flash let's compare 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.310
 frames without flash and with flash and now 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.890
 it's time to work with the kate model 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.920
 I want you to lean on your 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.070
 knees so that the arms and legs are shaped 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.630
 one line is diagonal yes here so very 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:19.000
 okay very nice lie so on 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.620
 the second is very good I really like 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.810
 what happens now I'm perry 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.090
 I frame a little and you could not 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.180
 move back to the wall lean on 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:32.770
 wall and take the same position yes 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.420
 great everything is just great and now 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:39.640
 i ska drill so to grab the part 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.760
 this is a beautiful railing racks and made 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.960
 duplicate frames in order to 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.040
 make sure that I have the right point 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:50.980
 sharpness now i will try to remove from 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.920
 another point going around here and try 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.680
 You can make a frame through the railing now 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.200
 look at me i even like him 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.610
 as it looks good now you can 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:06.090
 look aside 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.090
 dreamy very well done well 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:15.000
 now put your hands and lean on 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.000
 they are very good 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.340
 just wonderful most likely I these 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.840
 I will translate the photos into black and white 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.979
 option 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.759
 thank you very much we have succeeded 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.759
 great photos
