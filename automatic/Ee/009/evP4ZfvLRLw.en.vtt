Australia<00:01:54.299> anything<00:01:55.049> America<00:01:55.409> does<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.860> not

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
Australia anything America does is not

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.039

Australia's population is sitting in
California<00:02:02.909> basically<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.689> they<00:02:04.170> do

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
California basically so they do

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.249

market<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.310> well<00:02:17.550> but<00:02:18.239> as<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.540> say<00:02:18.810> when<00:02:18.959> you've

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
market it well but as I say when you've

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.479 
market it well but as I say when you've

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
got to schedule that busy and you're

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.300 
got to schedule that busy and you're
crisscrossing<00:02:21.270> across<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.989> country<00:02:22.470> when

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
crisscrossing across the country when

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.010 
crisscrossing across the country when
the<00:02:23.400> guys<00:02:23.550> set<00:02:23.880> up<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.239> map<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.780> schedule

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
the guys set up the map and the schedule

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.960 
the guys set up the map and the schedule
he<00:02:25.980> obviously<00:02:26.220> wasn't<00:02:26.459> very<00:02:26.700> good<00:02:26.760> at

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
he obviously wasn't very good at

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.640 
he obviously wasn't very good at
geography<00:02:27.209> because<00:02:27.750> sometimes<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.410> create

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
geography because sometimes you create

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.320 
geography because sometimes you create
driving<00:02:29.069> from<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.370> east<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.790> west<00:02:29.880> coast
