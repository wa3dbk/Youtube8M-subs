00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
so this is just a video test of the

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.220 
so this is just a video test of the
camera<00:00:06.060> quality<00:00:06.240> on<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.839> asha<00:00:07.140> 302<00:00:09.230> it's

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
camera quality on the asha 302 it's

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.320 
camera quality on the asha 302 it's
currently<00:00:10.500> filming<00:00:10.769> in<00:00:11.070> 480p<00:00:11.790> which<00:00:12.150> is

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
currently filming in 480p which is

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.780 
currently filming in 480p which is
supposed<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.929> be<00:00:12.990> 40<00:00:13.259> p<00:00:13.410> which<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.429> maximum

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
supposed to be 40 p which is the maximum

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.670 
supposed to be 40 p which is the maximum
it<00:00:14.849> can<00:00:14.910> push<00:00:15.089> out<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.990> can<00:00:16.170> change<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
it can push out you can change the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.000 
it can push out you can change the
settings<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.220> put<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.490> for<00:00:18.500> 240<00:00:19.500> as<00:00:19.590> well<00:00:19.770> and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
settings to put it for 240 as well and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.990 
settings to put it for 240 as well and
something<00:00:20.910> like<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.270> think<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.510> was<00:00:21.600> 120<00:00:21.990> or

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
something like I think it was 120 or

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.040 
something like I think it was 120 or
basically<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.119> lowest<00:00:24.449> camera<00:00:24.779> setting

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
basically on the lowest camera setting

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.509 
basically on the lowest camera setting
you<00:00:25.109> can<00:00:25.140> see<00:00:25.439> four<00:00:25.859> pixels<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.430> screen

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
you can see four pixels on the screen

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.939 
you can see four pixels on the screen
and<00:00:26.820> that's<00:00:26.970> about<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.260> so<00:00:28.260> anyways<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:28.710> um

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
and that's about it so anyways but um

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.150 
and that's about it so anyways but um
what<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.550> can<00:00:29.760> see<00:00:29.970> from<00:00:30.269> phone's<00:00:31.050> display<00:00:31.320> it

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
what I can see from phone's display it

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.950 
what I can see from phone's display it
actually<00:00:32.460> doesn't<00:00:32.579> look<00:00:32.820> too<00:00:33.000> bad<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.450> 480<00:00:33.870> I

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
actually doesn't look too bad and 480 I

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.299 
actually doesn't look too bad and 480 I
mean<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.739> camera<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.340> tiny<00:00:35.969> 3.2<00:00:36.750> megapixel

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
mean the camera is a tiny 3.2 megapixel

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.549 
mean the camera is a tiny 3.2 megapixel
sensor<00:00:38.360> but<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.629> actually<00:00:39.960> looks<00:00:40.320> quite

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
sensor but it actually looks quite

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.470 
sensor but it actually looks quite
decent<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.430> what<00:00:41.820> I'm<00:00:41.910> saying<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.270> mean<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
decent on what I'm saying I mean the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.860 
decent on what I'm saying I mean the
colors<00:00:42.750> look<00:00:42.870> nice<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:44.570> you<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.719> actually

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
colors look nice and you can actually

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.200 
colors look nice and you can actually
zoom<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.440> while<00:00:46.680> filming<00:00:47.039> unlike<00:00:47.850> some<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
zoom in while filming unlike some of the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.500 
zoom in while filming unlike some of the
newer<00:00:48.390> phones<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.940> even<00:00:50.940> while<00:00:51.090> zooming<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
newer phones and even while zooming the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.959 
newer phones and even while zooming the
quality<00:00:51.989> isn't<00:00:52.140> too<00:00:52.379> bad<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.640> at<00:00:53.760> full

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
quality isn't too bad this is at full

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.819 
quality isn't too bad this is at full
zoom<00:00:54.030> right<00:00:54.390> now<00:00:55.399> um<00:00:56.960> under<00:00:57.960> settings<00:00:58.530> there's

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
zoom right now um under settings there's

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.939 
zoom right now um under settings there's
options<00:00:59.129> change<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> white<00:01:00.030> balance<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
options change the white balance and

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.640 
options change the white balance and
some<00:01:01.949> sepia<00:01:02.670> negative<00:01:03.600> white<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.559> black

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
some sepia negative white and black

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.380 
some sepia negative white and black
effects<00:01:05.010> or<00:01:05.189> whatever<00:01:05.400> but<00:01:06.000> there<00:01:06.270> doesn't

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
effects or whatever but there doesn't

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.630 
effects or whatever but there doesn't
seem<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.750> an<00:01:06.869> option<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.530> change<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.490> auto

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
seem to be an option to change for auto

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.090 
seem to be an option to change for auto
focus<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.510> don't<00:01:10.080> think<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.470> has<00:01:10.680> autofocus

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
focus so I don't think it has autofocus

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.660 
focus so I don't think it has autofocus
in<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:12.619> but<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.680> guess<00:01:13.979> that's<00:01:14.010> fine<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
in it but I guess that's fine this is a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.420 
in it but I guess that's fine this is a
feature<00:01:15.000> phone<00:01:15.299> with<00:01:16.009> it's<00:01:17.009> good<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.310> even

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
feature phone with it's good that even

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.600 
feature phone with it's good that even
has<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> camera<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:19.250> hopefully<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.400> not<00:01:20.549> too

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
has a camera and hopefully it's not too

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.120 
has a camera and hopefully it's not too
bad<00:01:20.909> i<00:01:20.970> mean<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.720> i<00:01:21.930> said<00:01:22.140> before<00:01:22.229> from<00:01:22.979> what<00:01:23.100> i

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
bad i mean as i said before from what i

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.249 
bad i mean as i said before from what i
can<00:01:23.220> see<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.790> screen<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.869> doesn't<00:01:25.200> look

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
can see on the screen it doesn't look

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.800 
can see on the screen it doesn't look
too<00:01:25.439> bad<00:01:25.470> i<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.040> color<00:01:26.310> reproduction

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.130 

so<00:01:33.810> yeah<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.960> mean<00:01:34.909> with<00:01:35.909> full<00:01:36.180> zoom<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.659> we'll

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
so yeah I mean with full zoom on we'll

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.880 
so yeah I mean with full zoom on we'll
just<00:01:37.170> zoom<00:01:37.380> out<00:01:37.590> again<00:01:39.619> that's<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.710> pretty

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
just zoom out again that's a pretty

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.210 
just zoom out again that's a pretty
powerful<00:01:41.009> zoom<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.530> street<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.039> you

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
powerful zoom and I the street that you

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.499 
powerful zoom and I the street that you
can<00:01:44.399> see<00:01:44.549> down<00:01:44.670> there<00:01:44.789> the<00:01:44.939> main<00:01:45.090> street<00:01:45.390> is

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
can see down there the main street is

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.070 
can see down there the main street is
actually<00:01:45.899> pretty<00:01:46.259> far<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:46.770> about<00:01:46.830> a<00:01:48.080> five

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
actually pretty far it's about a five

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.279 
actually pretty far it's about a five
hundred<00:01:49.229> meters<00:01:49.590> away<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.360> are<00:01:51.360> even<00:01:52.200> more

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
hundred meters away so are even more

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.200 
hundred meters away so are even more
maybe<00:01:52.500> maybe<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.920> six<00:01:53.189> seven<00:01:53.460> hundred<00:01:53.729> so

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
maybe maybe like six seven hundred so

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.389 
maybe maybe like six seven hundred so
being<00:01:54.420> able<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.689> see<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.860> quite<00:01:56.310> an

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
being able to see it the is quite an

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.020 
being able to see it the is quite an
accomplishment<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.149> future<00:01:57.869> phone<00:01:59.000> well<00:02:00.000> I

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
accomplishment for future phone well I

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.499 
accomplishment for future phone well I
guess<00:02:00.240> that's<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.539> um<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:02.119> think<00:02:03.119> it's<00:02:03.390> actually

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
guess that's it um I think it's actually

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.600 
guess that's it um I think it's actually
quite<00:02:03.899> decent<00:02:04.409> camera<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.950> overall<00:02:05.399> through

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
quite decent camera and overall through

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.609 
quite decent camera and overall through
the<00:02:05.700> past<00:02:05.880> week<00:02:06.060> I've<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.690> come<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.929> like

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
the past week I've really come to like

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.420 
the past week I've really come to like
