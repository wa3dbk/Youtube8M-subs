00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:20.270
 hi cheesy courageous self-propelled 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:23.150
 checks this alliance 88 this is a harp bend over and 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.250
 we continue the battle against 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.250
 fbi against deer and any other 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.310
 unclean map we have a fishing bay and we 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.380
 Consider 1 start and evaluate the combat 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.000
 We look at the situation where someone is discharged 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.560
 see more tanks go into town 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.780
 so choose the left flank 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.370
 although the city is safer for us 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.540
 but the enemy has only one place 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.540
 artillery therefore can act 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.460
 more active and usually choosing 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.739
 urban direction we follow tactics 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.360
 punching and choosing the left flank we 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.149
 defend from the data. 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.020
 very convenient to keep the center of the map at all 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.880
 big checks 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.460
 from here we control the left flank 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.340
 control center pass base there already 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.690
 we ourselves will stay in the bushes and does not see us 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.309
 but of course with such tactics we 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.789
 need allies to act on their 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.670
 light 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:09.799
 in more detail all points of attack defense a 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.289
 also the direction I will place in the guide 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.850
 Koenig duction of NATO for those who are in the subject 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.249
 and who is not in the subject under this video will be 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.070
 reference to this most and gavotte more precisely on 

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:20.010
 first part 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.090
 Well, back to our combat situation 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.620
 there were few enemies here so 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.810
 one can act actively begin 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.840
 push the direction we shoot at 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.190
 t-44 he is a layer of kidney then he knows where 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.450
 firing and shooting again 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.100
 impenetrable and he decides to run away again 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.660
 you can't get it but at the same time 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.780
 we catch the rebound most likely from super 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:44.050
 Pershing and what's interesting here are two 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.740
 his rare with that enemy are our two 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.480
 ttn 2 st and self-propelled while the fire and 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.730
 there is no ambush 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.830
 serious enemy guns notice 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.320
 super pershing we boil down and pay 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.390
 attention we converge the very edge of the roof 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.580
 so that the projectile will fall 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.350
 on account of the distance the shell went a little 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.600
 right but stayed on the same line as 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.040
 Provided us a ruler and for everyone 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.930
 case of sending another projectile and 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.960
 keep going right to 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.490
 surround and specials left on the board why 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.320
 just because there are bushes here 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.780
 which on hides and because in front 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.270
 have enemies go out in the open to us not 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.770
 very big everything we shoot super 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.880
 pershing and now you can 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.600
 to tank 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.580
 t-44 right a year and meanwhile our three 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.150
 heavy tank and the quality of a pebble 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.330
 afraid of a piercer for 450 meters 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.820
 and half-dead t-44 and here this 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.770
 procrastination costs us the loss of the city than 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.270
 more rapidly develops about pressure 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.910
 one direction the greater the chance 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.020
 surround the seller 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.970
 well, in the meantime, we turn to 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:51.790
 active tank as wider throat 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:54.459
 44 still it we hurt him by 200 and get 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.930
 superpershing knocks down a caterpillar 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.950
 do not interfere with kindness 44 and continue to tanks 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.659
 are there any such actives possible 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.340
 only if you know exactly what is here 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.069
 no in this opponent as they can 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.930
 strongly annoy and here while we are here all 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.599
 our flesh or right flank we already 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.010
 take away and notice four 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.459
 our tanks still stand behind 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.310
 pebble 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.859
 and I actively carry forward in it all 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.450
 problem of lesions then one flank of 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.879
 last forces hold on and the other just 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.409
 It stands still and prices despite the fact that 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.170
 no resistance can be said and 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:28.689
 No, now I think everyone has proved that baima 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.400
 in the end, I merge about this, too, I guessed 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.970
 to go back too long therefore 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.470
 we tank further although it is possible if all 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.159
 the remaining tanks in this direction 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.709
 pulled back immediately and right now we 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:43.569
 could stand 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.840
 because in this situation 88 is quite 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.400
 can cover up the waste of his cult and here 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.680
 he is our super pershing and here 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.260
 classic situation is always when 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.819
 Opponent to lean out for this house 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.209
 go down like this to be 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.260
 smaller syk rags and put on a harp 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.449
 this reception works seventy 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.590
 percent of cases do consider their own 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.389
 long roll out of the corner and 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.090
 shoot though some weapons even 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:09.310
 does not fall superpershing enough 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.380
 vertical guidance but it is not him 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.060
 helps 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.220
 and usually when you take off 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.260
 opponents tusil he in retaliation to you too 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.440
 like the arrow and only damage it 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.420
 goes on no no keep crushing that 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.700
 called of the last forces see two 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.850
 enemies but we go immediately to the left hollow 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.280
 go down here to the enemy butt 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.010
 felt it manifest what it means for 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.850
 for us it means that the class is good 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.130
 and we need to look for artillery you me 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.620
 becomes now the priority goal in 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.840
 the cancer on the right they are important to us 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.610
 find him roving we are trying to be viewed 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.370
 all sorts of pits where usually stands from 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.470
 least the light itself worked 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.160
 move need nimble right even 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.230
 see su-100 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.770
 but she below danger not represents 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.250
 here the cumi move discovered itself thanks 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.730
 enlightenment ki focus on it 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.470
 gets a bun 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.390
 you see who is starting to run away 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.250
 second flash drive why second shot 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.880
 knocks him out but we don't see him 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.010
 we switch to drying we take away drying and 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.450
 here he is our refugee neatly 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:17.850
 we reduce and neutralize it is dangerous 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.520
 goal juggling if it is competent 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.290
 apply as funny as the leaves give 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.660
 game moment does not always happen 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.150
 but this situation needs to lie head 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.670
 whether prioritize and methodically 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.650
 one at a time typing the data of whom 3 was 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.420
 when we were still at the house but we are at it 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.820
 not warmed the whole sweep plan and 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.680
 now we get it 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.480
 so you always need to think about such 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.870
 fold purpose is more convenient for some purpose 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.370
 shoot are important not to destroy then il 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.230
 it helps keep your skin on 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.810
 also do not go to the cross chamber 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.860
 meanwhile, we have a total drain 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.270
 the enemy is already taking the base, which is a pity 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.139
 so I just break directly to 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.639
 in the end 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.139
 it is a pity that they did not decide to finish us then 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.629
 could act neatly and 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.999
 maybe finish a couple more immediately go to 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:08.439
 the center of the most meat grinder in spartan 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:12.889
 business itself but nonetheless we drive and 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:14.599
 We meet not 34 enemy extremely unpleasant 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.059
 and in such a combat situation in general 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:18.799
 undesirable but then we all lose 

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:22.639
 equals nothing of the last all 

00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:23.659
 fight we miss it hit use 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.069
 all our maximum possibilities 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:30.519
 reflection shields to the full as they say 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:33.259
 always keep romka losing a little bit 

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:34.239
 this time reflect the hits now 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:36.679
 nearly 

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:39.409
 it was necessary to immediately power the club you and 

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:40.039
 pH defects and seeks and truth as you can see 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:41.839
 these shields 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:44.839
 requires a lot of energy from hits 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:46.819
 I already have the problems of the projectile whistling 

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:49.669
 head and here's another reflection from 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:50.059
 now for 4 but seriously and I just 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:52.039
 I hurry 

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:53.779
 not so easy to control 4 series 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:56.059
 catch hits from them also shoot 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:59.329
 most though very useful for practice 

00:06:56.059 --> 00:07:02.329
 by the way such batches very quickly teach 

00:06:59.329 --> 00:07:04.189
 put you right despite the fact that 

00:07:02.329 --> 00:07:06.139
 I tried to squeeze the maximum opponent all 

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:09.289
 still takes the base true me so they 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:10.550
 sang you will find but this is all in 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:12.469
 principle 2 nd was nothing like that 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.759
 supernatural but some aspects 

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:19.719
 I think it would be interesting it was an alliance 

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:19.719
 88th dagu suite bend
