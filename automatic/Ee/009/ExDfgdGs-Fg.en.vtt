00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
spearmen surrounding the steam tanks and

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.290 
spearmen surrounding the steam tanks and

tanks<00:02:30.569> which<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.780> believe<00:02:30.989> each<00:02:31.200> have<00:02:31.380> 10<00:02:31.590> hit

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770

tanks which I believe each have 10 hit
points<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.250> ridiculous<00:02:32.850> melee<00:02:33.120> stats<00:02:33.360> they

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
points and ridiculous melee stats they

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.510 
points and ridiculous melee stats they

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
army just tossing everything up so I put

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.110 
army just tossing everything up so I put
it<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.709> fast<00:02:37.890> forward<00:02:38.220> just<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.790> see<00:02:38.970> how

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
it in a fast forward just to see how

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.970 
it in a fast forward just to see how
many<00:02:39.270> kills<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.600> could<00:02:39.720> get<00:02:39.900> in<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.650> limited

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
many kills I could get in the limited

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.590 
many kills I could get in the limited
amount<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.250> time<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.610> had<00:02:41.880> remember<00:02:42.450> that

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
amount of time that I had remember that

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.750 
amount of time that I had remember that
it's<00:02:42.720> three<00:02:42.959> steam<00:02:43.200> tanks<00:02:43.470> against<00:02:43.760> 5000

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760

like the steam takes literally run

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.190 
like the steam takes literally run
through<00:02:50.790> every<00:02:51.540> single<00:02:51.810> one<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.930> them<00:02:52.080> they

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
through every single one of them they

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.750 
through every single one of them they
just<00:02:52.230> get<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.830> goblins<00:02:53.160> get<00:02:53.280> thrown<00:02:53.489> up<00:02:53.640> in

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
just get the goblins get thrown up in

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.460 
just get the goblins get thrown up in
waves<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.360> they're<00:02:54.780> telling<00:02:54.930> all<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.260> can<00:02:55.380> do

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
waves and they're telling all you can do

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.490 
waves and they're telling all you can do
about<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:56.390> well<00:02:57.390> you're<00:02:57.570> realized<00:02:58.260> very

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
about it so well you're realized very

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.199 
about it so well you're realized very
quickly<00:02:59.030> that<00:03:00.440> they<00:03:01.440> do<00:03:01.970> so<00:03:02.970> much<00:03:03.150> damage

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
quickly that they do so much damage

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.059 
quickly that they do so much damage
they're<00:03:03.660> actually<00:03:04.050> probably<00:03:04.319> worth<00:03:04.830> their

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
they're actually probably worth their

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.400 
they're actually probably worth their
cost<00:03:05.100> now<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:06.239> problem<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.989> in<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.170> real

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
cost now the problem is that in a real
