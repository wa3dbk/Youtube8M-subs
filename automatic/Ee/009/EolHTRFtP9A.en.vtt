and loads of mascara on it where do you
see<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:35.600> what<00:01:36.600> do<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.750> think<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> that

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
see this what do you think of that

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.760 
see this what do you think of that
little<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:38.490> brush<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.960> guess<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.530> don't<00:01:40.560> know

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
little we brush so I guess I don't know

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.710 
little we brush so I guess I don't know
anything<00:01:41.310> maybe<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.640> don't<00:01:41.939> know<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.509> think

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
anything maybe I don't know but I think

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.499 
anything maybe I don't know but I think
then<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.990> can't<00:01:43.259> be<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.409> volumizing<00:01:44.280> mascara

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
then that can't be a volumizing mascara

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.899 
then that can't be a volumizing mascara
