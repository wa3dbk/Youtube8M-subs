00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.910
 to make our mashed potatoes that the 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.330
 People need potatoes that I already like 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.230
 let her cut here in the water're one 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:27.430
 little milk nutmeg butter and 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:32.529
 parmesan water that is servant I 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:36.010
 I'll pick up the potatoes and dino. 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.620
 does with little water is not much water goes 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.079
 for the now stripped gardener goes 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.350
 to find k will not find k was not enough 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:48.429
 water she goes cooking drying you go 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.399
 administering this here that cut 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:56.459
 the kitchen quickly goes 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:59.589
 administering this point and 

00:00:56.459 --> 00:01:01.959
 We cover and this is going to cook there by 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.859
 about ten minutes after the potato 

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:08.680
 time cooked very well cooked breed comes 

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:10.869
 here and tighten spoon spoon 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.310
 it breaks easily to break 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.929
 very easily I 'm not here to 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.780
 to do because I'm going to do it here is 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:21.369
 so I'm here even I support myself 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.869
 I have the floor that allows me to do 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:33.159
 This is a risk. 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:41.159
 The pot I'm going to make will threaten the 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:41.159
 battle as she is very well cooked 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.610
 I met Kneader here. This is a good one. 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.509
 launcher you have that threatening that 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.140
 resolve 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.930
 My question here is when the potato 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.530
 It gets harder and you have to suffer there. 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:09.340
 in another way but well cooked one 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:13.120
 little the water dried super well but I know 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:24.110
 move here better get a color is more 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:29.290
 suitable for this type of tragedy and right 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.290
 people go for now and butter 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:45.560
 forget that it is already butter with salt and walnut 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:46.130
 Nutmeg Nutmeg we will fine for 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.190
 he 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.519
 white sauces for a little while 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.519
 Parmesan 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.930
 I like to propose the above review. 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.590
 but here in the middle a little parmesan 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.590
 goes well too 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:15.579
 then I'll be back there for a little softly 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:19.810
 will good to travel with her was off 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:22.870
 I bring it here and I'll add law 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.950
 slowly until it reaches the puree point 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.870
 I like 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.639
 then you solve that mashed point 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.180
 Do you want it to be firmer or is it more 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.180
 liquid 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:52.420
 Such a cool point, I like it. 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:55.690
 In this case, I'm going to make a mash here today. 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.690
 very creamy 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.100
 so for another little milk 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:25.430
 so cool, turning off here 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:28.730
 that's what a beautiful mashed 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.270
 accompanying potatoes for more miscellaneous 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.980
 plates 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.050
