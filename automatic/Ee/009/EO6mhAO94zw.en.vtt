 welcome to the curly movement 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.360
 we already talked when we discussed percent 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.960
 how to set up the balance there are videos on the network that would explain 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.850
 masters how it configures how to open n the ports of our complete agreement 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.650
 this will serve us 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.030
 for this application and it will be useful for any other application that 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.679
 require opening of ports 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.020
 with this we get access 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.740
 from and internet from anywhere to our team to a certain service 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.789
 we shut up 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:36.799
 the configurator and in this one to 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.410
 in this video we are going to see the combo we configure for example a route of 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.480
 telephone 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.070
 be it the smoke 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.350
 or image we have two options 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.090
 let's focus on telephone that is the most widespread but open a gate 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.410
 q3 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.260
 practically the same for any company 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.060
 the screenshots that you're going to see here are so wrong made only one router 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.130
 telephone so elements those users put loqueven vouchers find 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.320
 when speaking and your 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.369
 by surprise 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.369
 based on a similar to what the Pope is saying 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.060
 If we have to 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.850
 stolen image and opponent to moscow an internet connection had presents 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.660
 portraits route network because he does not want 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.570
 ace 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.939
 the image option 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.160
 we have different possibilities to configure 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.770
 users images and touches the routes we can have as simple 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.590
 We report Alejandra 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.650
 that day I am happy here 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.479
 agreement 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.479
 you can search in buga the prefect mind about the result 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.310
 we would enter the phone number 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.440
 I think the adsl line is hired 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.490
 in this frame 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.120
 we will click on accept 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.120
 and we would have certain route options that we can 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.320
 between them 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.440
 to open shorts as simple as choosing 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.930
 port 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.409
 and is that and write 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.620
 I do not know 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.289
 how do we get promoted 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:08.569
 very easy 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.569
 we go to system preferences 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.059
 let's go to the network motion 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:19.789
 will serve the two cases we agreed to start behaving Alejandra 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:21.790
 we 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.009
 we indicate that we connect through the internet 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:27.159
 and the address I tried 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.109
 the relevant work 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:31.959
 in the field and weigh base 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.959
 what is the team that I want it to be through outside 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:36.749
 if 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.209
 what taxes of lokarri, the Portuguese, the numbering of the hostel 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.049
 Program 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:41.989
 if 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.629
 hence, I 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.809
 let's go to the preferences 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:52.789
 and we will observe the one that we have the port that is to say I had to put port 45 6 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:53.900
 3 1 is 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.379
 in this case emilio in other applications are other ports 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.679
 lilian I want you to listen to your Portuguese 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:06.919
 the 192 points 168 point 1 point one hundred 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.719
 It is recommended when using the ports used 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:13.880
 all of this 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.769
 l these these possibilities when it comes to mapping ports is recommended 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.309
 configure the option 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:23.909
 network like marijuana 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.669
 that is to say 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.909
 I have if I go to the expo 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:29.379
 I have the possibility 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.650
 to carry by bhp that is the router path automatically these data 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.789
 or you can set it up manually as the candle had 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.569
 we have bellavista dhcp and we have some values 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:43.869
 we click 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:45.669
 the manual 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.579
 the combat values ​​are kept that do not change 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.929
 and we just have to introduce 

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:52.369
 palm people here 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:53.829
 in us let's see 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.320
 if we had the rent and if we can use the same, that is 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.520
 192 168 1 36 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.349
 we accept and let's let you integrate your team forever 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.009
 He will Call 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.729
 to Brazil 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.729
 in agreement 

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:15.919
 we already have clarke 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:20.269
 numbering and where are we going to find it then we would have the port 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:24.419
 the other option that we have is 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.300
 through the normal router access hard rock 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.319
 if we have a connection I doubt we accelerate in this way if we have any other 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.669
 company as surely as we can also access in the same way 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.559
 the works will also be developed by the company 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:40.120
 in telephone a two three four 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.819
 and passwords and we have not altered the same agreement 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.699
 in our case it is customized 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.180
 cocoa 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.999
 we click on login 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.330
 were needed 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.860
 the web page of our router 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.370
 we have communication with showed 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.520
 what we have to look for we consider 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.850
 different options in a sidebar 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.850
 a main page we are going to look for is the option to give 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.020
 agreement 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.129
 in no time 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:12.979
 we will see that we have the possibility to equip details 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:18.080
 in the case of the philis the typical open routes that hands out telephone 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.780
 báez against efe 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.180
 these options 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.460
 we click on 'edit details and as you can see here we already have a series of 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.020
 open ports of agreement 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.059
 it would be as simple as 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:33.059
 enter the port number 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:36.939
 in final port the chicken 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:40.000
 we will put the same number or we could even April 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.900
 about 100 homes that is I can open from 53 54 to 53 56 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.789
 agreement 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:48.590
 oppose 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.949
 so as not to get involved 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.699
 the same number of ports you are 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:57.270
 in the case of video as we have seen as easy as consulting 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.960
 45 was expressed 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.800
 how do you see 45 6 3 1 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.409
 45 6 3 1 and we will ask you against 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:09.270
 with this we have our server 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.499
 working 

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:13.680
 the agreement marte andor its doors so you can 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.700
 being heard through 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.700
 from Internet 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.949
 in this is one of the parts that you have to take into account mapping the ports 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:28.569
 someone knows how we can call our team what the numbering 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:31.949
 for it to communicate from anywhere with my team 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:36.449
 in a second appendix we explain the simplest way to achieve this 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:39.349
 thanks to services how not inter 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:41.860
 eye your homework well 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.779
