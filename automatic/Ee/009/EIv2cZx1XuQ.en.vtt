00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.119
 Businessman, 

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:09.909
 family man, 

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:15.139
 a man who I am very fortunate to say to my mentor and father. 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:16.650
 All the things in the world are for these ... 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.409
 ... 5 things X-P-H-M-A! 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:21.230
 Why sell the company? 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:28.230
 - We have a lot of profits. - How much money do we need? Do we want to be the richest in the cemetery? 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.650
 - Jim, I am. - You will tell me what happened; 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.750
 - Do not ask. - The car overturned. Multiple blows. 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.260
 She was here and her legs were down. 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.490
 Who then kicked the door? 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.900
 The situation is manslaughter. 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.610
 And what would you advise someone to do in this case? 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.720
 There are about 50 things that one would not think. 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.760
 Imprints, DNA, call records. 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.010
 If this person is close to closing ... 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.970
 a deal with a big bank ... 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.600
 any threat could derail the transaction. 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.450
 Half of our assets are missing. 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.270
 - There's a $ 400 million hole here! - That's ridiculous. 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.590
 - You are close to a prison term of many years. - And what should I do? 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.650
 She's a detective here who wants to see you. 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.340
 We have not yet found the driver. 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.790
 - The driver; - Yes, it was someone else who was driving. 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.030
 What's Your Head? 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.430
 I hit it in the box of first aid. 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.619
 I hate it when this happens. 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.110
 - Detective Briere, it's about your husband. - Okay, make an appointment! 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.520
 - Tell me what's going on. - He is my father... 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.040
 ... I have to trust him. - It's a homicide. 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.330
 ... I know you went and took him. 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.619
 The longer the time goes, the more lies are said. 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.979
 - Do you want to let our investors go bankrupt? - You were lying. 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.380
 Let's go bankrupt. 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.490
 Police want to talk to me .. 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.740
 and I will not lie about you. 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.660
 The one who did it .. 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.779
 will not escape! 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:13.659
 - I'm your partner. - You are not my partner, you work for me! 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:17.649
 - You brought it to us. - That's what I do for us, for this family. 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:19.269
 Now do you tell me how to work? 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.619
 It's not your job, it's our life.
