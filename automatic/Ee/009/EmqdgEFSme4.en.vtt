00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.260 
a little bit closer to that shit see
okay<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.740> um<00:01:14.010> basically<00:01:14.460> what<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.880> gotta<00:01:15.060> do

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
okay so um basically what you gotta do

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.520 
okay so um basically what you gotta do
is<00:01:15.540> place<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.350> down<00:01:16.880> okay<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:17.939> place<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.530> pick

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
is place one down okay so place it pick

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.300 
is place one down okay so place it pick
it<00:01:19.680> up<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.130> then<00:01:20.540> threat<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.750> clit<00:01:22.590> right<00:01:22.830> onto

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
it up and then threat a clit right onto

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.609 
it up and then threat a clit right onto
it<00:01:23.340> but<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.450> not<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.659> big<00:01:24.960> rate<00:01:25.200> right<00:01:25.590> now

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
it but it's not that big rate right now

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.280 
it but it's not that big rate right now
but<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.369> could<00:01:26.549> make<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.030> like<00:01:27.060> little<00:01:27.720> inch<00:01:28.020> k

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
but you could make it like little inch k

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.109 
but you could make it like little inch k
so<00:01:28.350> basically<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.369> doesn't<00:01:29.640> let<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.820> go<00:01:29.970> like

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
so basically it doesn't let you go like

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.660 
so basically it doesn't let you go like
that<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:31.020> put<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.320> back<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.530> again<00:01:31.950> so

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
that like put it back on again so

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.580 
that like put it back on again so
basically<00:01:33.000> what<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.299> got<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.540> do<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:34.530> a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
basically what you got to do this it's a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.130 
basically what you got to do this it's a
little<00:01:34.799> bit<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.070> bitch<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.579> when<00:01:35.970> as<00:01:36.840> soon
