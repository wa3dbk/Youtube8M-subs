at<00:00:05.170> upm<00:00:05.710> prophetic<00:00:06.250> we<00:00:06.910> go<00:00:07.150> on<00:00:07.210> a<00:00:07.480> lot<00:00:07.870> about

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
at upm prophetic we go on a lot about

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.530 
at upm prophetic we go on a lot about
our<00:00:09.040> clothes<00:00:09.370> surface<00:00:09.910> and<00:00:10.120> the<00:00:10.360> high

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.540 
our clothes surface and the high

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.049 
our clothes surface and the high
friction<00:00:10.809> surface<00:00:11.110> and<00:00:11.799> there's<00:00:12.219> one<00:00:12.400> reason

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
friction surface and there's one reason

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.690 
friction surface and there's one reason
we<00:00:13.389> do<00:00:13.570> this<00:00:13.809> because<00:00:14.709> when<00:00:14.950> you<00:00:15.129> have<00:00:15.400> a

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
we do this because when you have a

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.939 
we do this because when you have a
barbecue<00:00:16.119> or<00:00:16.660> if<00:00:17.260> you're<00:00:17.440> running<00:00:17.650> a

part of our rail step system designed

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.780 
part of our rail step system designed
for<00:00:38.140> the<00:00:38.350> edging<00:00:38.710> of<00:00:38.860> a<00:00:38.950> deck<00:00:39.130> or<00:00:39.340> for<00:00:39.640> making

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.480 
for the edging of a deck or for making
stairs<00:00:40.240> and<00:00:41.140> if<00:00:41.260> I<00:00:41.350> just<00:00:41.380> take<00:00:41.800> some<00:00:41.860> normal

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.490 
stairs and if I just take some normal

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.400 
stairs and if I just take some normal
olive<00:00:42.880> oil<00:00:43.060> it<00:00:43.420> could<00:00:43.750> be<00:00:43.900> that<00:00:44.050> you<00:00:44.200> have<00:00:44.230> a

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
olive oil it could be that you have a

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.710 
olive oil it could be that you have a
barbecue<00:00:45.070> or<00:00:45.130> or<00:00:45.700> you<00:00:46.060> might<00:00:46.240> spill<00:00:46.510> some

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
barbecue or or you might spill some

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.780 
barbecue or or you might spill some
ketchup<00:00:46.990> or<00:00:47.350> something<00:00:47.680> and<00:00:47.830> I<00:00:48.280> just<00:00:48.550> pour

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
ketchup or something and I just pour

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.120 
ketchup or something and I just pour
some<00:00:48.970> olive<00:00:49.090> oil<00:00:49.360> on<00:00:49.600> that<00:00:49.840> and<00:00:50.170> then<00:00:50.770> I<00:00:50.800> have<00:00:51.100> a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
some olive oil on that and then I have a

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.670 
some olive oil on that and then I have a
competing<00:00:51.610> product<00:00:52.120> and<00:00:52.330> the<00:00:53.170> competing

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
competing product and the competing

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.650 
competing product and the competing
product<00:00:54.070> has<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.460> typical<00:00:54.700> wire-brushed

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
product has the typical wire-brushed

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.950 
product has the typical wire-brushed
surface<00:00:56.620> so<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.520> wood<00:00:57.730> fibers<00:00:58.030> are<00:00:58.360> open<00:00:58.750> and

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
surface so the wood fibers are open and

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.320 
surface so the wood fibers are open and
if<00:00:59.440> I<00:00:59.560> pour<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.130> oil<00:01:00.370> also<00:01:00.970> on<00:01:01.450> to<00:01:01.630> this<00:01:03.330> then

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
if I pour the oil also on to this then

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.020 
if I pour the oil also on to this then
what<00:01:04.600> happens<00:01:05.110> over<00:01:05.530> a<00:01:05.860> short<00:01:06.189> time<00:01:06.280> is<00:01:06.790> the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
what happens over a short time is the

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.510 
what happens over a short time is the
oil<00:01:07.270> will<00:01:07.570> soak<00:01:07.930> up<00:01:08.200> inside<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.040> wood<00:01:09.250> fibers

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
oil will soak up inside the wood fibers

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.880 
oil will soak up inside the wood fibers
and<00:01:09.940> it'll<00:01:10.690> be<00:01:10.810> difficult<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.440> clean<00:01:11.560> you'll

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
and it'll be difficult to clean you'll

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.130 
and it'll be difficult to clean you'll
have<00:01:12.070> to<00:01:12.220> sand<00:01:12.460> it<00:01:12.640> whereas<00:01:13.000> with<00:01:13.210> UPM<00:01:13.720> prophy

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
have to sand it whereas with UPM prophy

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.200 
have to sand it whereas with UPM prophy
deck<00:01:14.350> we<00:01:14.770> have<00:01:14.800> a<00:01:15.010> closed<00:01:15.310> surface<00:01:15.610> and<00:01:16.000> the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
deck we have a closed surface and the

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.470 
deck we have a closed surface and the
oil<00:01:16.360> doesn't<00:01:16.720> soak<00:01:17.080> up<00:01:17.320> so<00:01:18.010> we'll<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:19.240> leave

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
oil doesn't soak up so we'll just leave

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.360 
oil doesn't soak up so we'll just leave
this<00:01:19.659> for<00:01:19.870> a<00:01:19.900> couple<00:01:20.050> of<00:01:20.260> minutes<00:01:20.500> and<00:01:20.710> then

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
this for a couple of minutes and then

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.040 
this for a couple of minutes and then
I'll<00:01:21.490> wipe<00:01:21.790> off<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.150> oil<00:01:22.180> and<00:01:22.570> you'll<00:01:22.780> see

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
I'll wipe off the oil and you'll see

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.820 
I'll wipe off the oil and you'll see
what<00:01:23.260> I<00:01:23.290> mean<00:01:23.530> about<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:24.070> difference

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.960 

okay<00:01:27.830> we've<00:01:28.130> now<00:01:28.159> waited<00:01:28.580> a<00:01:28.670> couple<00:01:28.909> of

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
okay we've now waited a couple of

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.030 
okay we've now waited a couple of
minutes<00:01:29.270> since<00:01:29.420> I<00:01:29.540> put<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:30.020> olive<00:01:30.290> oil<00:01:30.710> on<00:01:30.860> and

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
minutes since I put the olive oil on and

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.890 
minutes since I put the olive oil on and
you<00:01:31.700> can<00:01:31.880> see<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.210> difference<00:01:32.630> already

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
you can see the difference already

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.039 
you can see the difference already
happening<00:01:33.650> if<00:01:33.830> I<00:01:34.040> take<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.280> cloth<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:34.750> this<00:01:35.750> if

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
happening if I take a cloth and this if

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.420 
happening if I take a cloth and this if
you<00:01:36.170> remember<00:01:36.290> what's<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.860> competitor

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
you remember what's the competitor

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.270

ketchup<00:01:56.479> or<00:01:56.810> red<00:01:57.020> wine<00:01:57.259> or<00:01:57.649> other<00:01:58.130> things

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
ketchup or red wine or other things

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.419 
ketchup or red wine or other things
whereas<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.479> Profi<00:01:59.929> deck<00:02:00.140> with<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.100> closed

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
whereas the Profi deck with the closed

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.969 
whereas the Profi deck with the closed
surface<00:02:01.840> then<00:02:02.840> you<00:02:02.960> can<00:02:03.140> see<00:02:03.320> it's<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:03.590> bit<00:02:03.770> more

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
surface then you can see it's a bit more

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.880 
surface then you can see it's a bit more
like<00:02:04.190> a<00:02:04.220> kitchen<00:02:04.820> floor<00:02:05.229> you<00:02:06.229> can<00:02:06.409> see<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.619> put<00:02:06.710> a

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
like a kitchen floor you can see I put a

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.560 
like a kitchen floor you can see I put a
lot<00:02:07.070> of<00:02:07.159> oil<00:02:07.280> on<00:02:07.520> this<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.030> can<00:02:08.300> see<00:02:08.479> I'm

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
lot of oil on this so you can see I'm

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.559 
lot of oil on this so you can see I'm
not<00:02:08.690> cheating<00:02:09.110> but<00:02:09.800> here<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.820> oil<00:02:10.850> has<00:02:11.300> not

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
not cheating but here the oil has not

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.070 
not cheating but here the oil has not
soaked<00:02:11.989> in<00:02:12.200> at<00:02:12.350> all<00:02:12.500> so<00:02:13.459> you<00:02:13.519> have<00:02:13.970> an<00:02:14.330> easy<00:02:14.780> to

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
soaked in at all so you have an easy to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.070 
soaked in at all so you have an easy to
clean<00:02:15.350> low-maintenance<00:02:16.100> deck<00:02:16.900> compared<00:02:17.900> to

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
clean low-maintenance deck compared to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.800 
clean low-maintenance deck compared to
the<00:02:18.200> competing<00:02:18.590> product<00:02:19.330> there<00:02:20.330> are<00:02:20.510> some

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
the competing product there are some

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.360 
the competing product there are some
competing<00:02:21.350> products<00:02:21.769> that<00:02:21.890> have<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.069> thin

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
competing products that have a thin

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.820 
competing products that have a thin
plastic<00:02:22.670> layer<00:02:23.150> around<00:02:23.510> them<00:02:23.810> which<00:02:24.290> also

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
plastic layer around them which also

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.830 
plastic layer around them which also
resists<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.400> oil<00:02:25.580> but<00:02:26.120> then<00:02:26.330> they<00:02:26.540> don't<00:02:26.690> have

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
resists the oil but then they don't have

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.380 
resists the oil but then they don't have
the<00:02:27.080> same<00:02:27.260> friction<00:02:27.620> surface<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:28.790> prophy<00:02:29.209> deck

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
the same friction surface so prophy deck

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.509 
the same friction surface so prophy deck
is<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.720> only<00:02:30.019> one<00:02:30.230> which<00:02:30.829> will<00:02:31.040> resist<00:02:31.370> the

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
is the only one which will resist the

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.210 
is the only one which will resist the
oil<00:02:31.820> has<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.150> good<00:02:32.600> moisture<00:02:33.230> resistance<00:02:33.829> but

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
oil has a good moisture resistance but

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.100 
oil has a good moisture resistance but
at<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.400> same<00:02:34.610> time<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:35.060> good<00:02:35.299> friction<00:02:35.720> surface

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
at the same time a good friction surface

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.440 
at the same time a good friction surface
as<00:02:36.260> well
