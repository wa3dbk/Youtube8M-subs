00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 uttar because we know that this woman is going to 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.509
 be gold yes or yes 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.550
 deborah co is an institution like 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.820
 we said before is a different swimmer 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.000
 as we see with a very powerful physicist 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.029
 very strong muscle that makes you have 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.090
 much energy in the water that has a 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.119
 great height that is pulled out a lot 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.000
 you get a lot of body out of a big 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.820
 push the dolphin is a swimmer 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.520
 wonderful triple world champion 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.520
 European champion and search 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.519
 triplet at the moment takes a gold 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:15.900
 well very nice obviously a great 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:18.510
 co Ã©vora exercise is closing 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.530
 already his junior stage has 18 years as 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:26.819
 he said he's going to close it with the crown of 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:30.090
 Junior world champion was in poznan 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:34.409
 triple European champion here in Baquba 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.030
 way of winning three golds also and going to 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.450
 having it very complicated is like this giving the 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.300
 step as a soloist at the sr level 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.330
 and that is very complicated in Russia now 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.000
 same with romashina with the return to 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.069
 return of natalia ischenko is a 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.560
 natura as it said very very different to 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:58.329
 what we have traditionally seen in 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.120
 russia maybe it physically prevents you from giving that 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:05.319
 jump 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.069
 but this bet is very good for a 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.930
 ripe 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:15.349
 as dÃ©bora co 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.349
 and time will tell will be one of the great 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.049
 as anastasia davydova who is 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.810
 present here in baquba as secretary 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:27.010
 general of the Russian Olympic Committee we are going to 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:31.950
 see if it reaches 90 points for 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:39.310
 preliminary had 86 600 reaches 90 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:42.400
 30 33 170 sensational points the gold 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.440
 very clear for her we only have one 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.390
 Once there have been ironworks that is 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.270
 waiting for the swimmer in the pool 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.180
 of the kallÃ­polis swimming club 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.210
 all the pressure for her because it 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.250
 play the silver medal play the 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.060
 silver medal I think the medal 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.060
 he has it true
