and 2k which is what you currently seen

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
the IV texture on trees the reason this

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.900 
the IV texture on trees the reason this
mod<00:00:40.649> was<00:00:40.800> created<00:00:41.190> was<00:00:41.340> due<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> lack<00:00:41.879> of

mod was created was due to the lack of

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.360

you can see the model has made it look

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:46.880 
you can see the model has made it look
as<00:00:45.960> good<00:00:46.020> as<00:00:46.260> possible

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890

proud owner of all of the dragon priests
masks<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.740> decide<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.189> give<00:01:35.400> them<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.610> more

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
masks I decide to give them a more

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.789 
masks I decide to give them a more
interesting<00:01:36.329> look<00:01:36.560> since<00:01:37.560> they<00:01:37.650> were<00:01:37.710> on

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
interesting look since they were on

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.350 
interesting look since they were on
display<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.220> my<00:01:38.250> house<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.909> definitely

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
display in my house and I definitely

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.219 
display in my house and I definitely
wasn't<00:01:39.509> let<00:01:39.720> down

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
wasn't let down

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.260 
wasn't let down
I<00:01:40.259> think<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.159> masks<00:01:41.520> each<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.909> truly

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
I think the masks each have a truly

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.060 
I think the masks each have a truly
unique<00:01:42.540> look<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.350> makes<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.530> lot<00:01:43.710> more<00:01:43.740> fun

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
unique look and it makes a lot more fun

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.310 
unique look and it makes a lot more fun
to<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.310> them<00:01:44.430> around<00:01:44.689> it<00:01:45.689> also<00:01:45.840> makes<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
to have them around it also makes the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.050 
to have them around it also makes the
dragon<00:01:46.590> priests<00:01:46.799> themselves<00:01:47.399> more<00:01:47.579> exciting

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
dragon priests themselves more exciting

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.880 
dragon priests themselves more exciting
to<00:01:48.149> fight<00:01:48.360> each<00:01:48.960> having<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.380> very<00:01:49.560> unique<00:01:49.860> look

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
to fight each having a very unique look

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.410 
to fight each having a very unique look
and<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.340> adds<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.579> bit<00:01:50.729> more<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.030> game<00:01:51.270> I

at the moment I think my favorite out of

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.029 
at the moment I think my favorite out of
all<00:02:09.390> these<00:02:09.629> mods<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.229> rustic<00:02:10.530> alchemy<00:02:10.920> and

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
all these mods is the rustic alchemy and

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.300 
all these mods is the rustic alchemy and

enchanting tables

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.619 
enchanting tables
and<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.700> like<00:02:12.849> the<00:02:12.939> way<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.150> motto<00:02:13.330> in<00:02:13.540> the

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
and I like the way the motto in the

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.000 
and I like the way the motto in the
description<00:02:14.140> mentions<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.769> they<00:02:14.860> don't

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
description mentions that they don't

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.890 
description mentions that they don't
grow<00:02:15.159> on<00:02:15.189> trees<00:02:15.310> aren't<00:02:15.970> crafted<00:02:16.450> by<00:02:16.569> local

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
grow on trees aren't crafted by local

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.509 
grow on trees aren't crafted by local
craftsmen<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:18.040> they<00:02:18.129> sort<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.370> like

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
craftsmen and that they sort of like

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.039 
craftsmen and that they sort of like
ancient<00:02:18.700> artifacts<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.629> that's<00:02:19.780> what<00:02:19.900> this

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
ancient artifacts and that's what this

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.229 
ancient artifacts and that's what this
mod<00:02:20.230> really<00:02:20.590> brings<00:02:20.799> across<00:02:21.010> nicely<00:02:21.519> and

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
mod really brings across nicely and

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.429 
mod really brings across nicely and
another<00:02:22.480> model<00:02:22.780> which<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:22.959> almost<00:02:23.140> forgot

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:23.439 
another model which I almost forgot

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:24.869 
another model which I almost forgot
about<00:02:23.500> because<00:02:23.980> it's<00:02:24.099> been<00:02:24.250> so<00:02:24.430> long<00:02:24.640> though

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
about because it's been so long though

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.910 
about because it's been so long though
since<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:25.239> used<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.629> was<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.019> unique<00:02:26.530> dragon

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
since I used it was the unique dragon

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.839 
since I used it was the unique dragon
priest<00:02:27.099> mascot

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
priest mascot

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.520 
priest mascot
I<00:02:27.879> used<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.659> the<00:02:28.780> whole<00:02:28.930> time<00:02:29.170> when<00:02:29.319> I<00:02:29.349> was

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
I used that the whole time when I was

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.020 
I used that the whole time when I was
trying<00:02:29.739> to<00:02:29.769> kill<00:02:29.980> all<00:02:30.159> these<00:02:30.280> dragon<00:02:30.670> priests

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
trying to kill all these dragon priests

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.660

and<00:02:31.299> trekking<00:02:31.840> across<00:02:31.930> Skyrim<00:02:32.500> it's<00:02:33.489> very

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
and trekking across Skyrim it's very

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.399 
and trekking across Skyrim it's very
difficult<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.599> mask<00:02:34.840> just<00:02:34.989> made<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.379> a

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
difficult and the mask just made it a

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:36.990 
difficult and the mask just made it a
lot<00:02:35.530> more<00:02:35.590> fun<00:02:35.920> because<00:02:36.159> they<00:02:36.370> every<00:02:36.819> time<00:02:36.970> I

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
lot more fun because they every time I

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.369 
lot more fun because they every time I
found<00:02:37.209> a<00:02:37.360> dragon<00:02:37.629> priest<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.930> was<00:02:38.019> wondering

found a dragon priest I was wondering

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.470 
found a dragon priest I was wondering
what<00:02:38.500> they'd<00:02:38.620> look<00:02:38.799> like<00:02:38.829> and<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.579> didn't<00:02:40.000> know

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
what they'd look like and I didn't know

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.970 
what they'd look like and I didn't know
what<00:02:40.629> to<00:02:40.750> expect<00:02:40.780> which<00:02:41.379> was<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.560> lot<00:02:41.739> of<00:02:41.769> fun

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
what to expect which was a lot of fun

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.679 
what to expect which was a lot of fun
there's<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.849> much<00:02:43.060> bigger<00:02:43.239> sense<00:02:43.569> of

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
there's a much bigger sense of

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:45.119 
there's a much bigger sense of
achievement<00:02:43.780> when<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.319> find<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.680> mask<00:02:44.890> that

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
achievement when you find a mask that

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.589 
achievement when you find a mask that
looks<00:02:45.190> completely<00:02:45.790> different<00:02:46.209> from<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.450> last

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
looks completely different from the last

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.849 
looks completely different from the last
one<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:46.870> found<00:02:47.079> rather<00:02:47.319> than<00:02:47.500> just<00:02:47.680> a

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
one you found rather than just a

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.800 
one you found rather than just a
slightly<00:02:48.250> different<00:02:48.340> color<00:02:48.760> so<00:02:49.510> yeah<00:02:49.599> that's

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
slightly different color so yeah that's

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.059
