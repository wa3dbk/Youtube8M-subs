00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:23.410
While dental veneers can instantly give you
the perfect smile, that are a number of disadvantages

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.410
with them.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.280
The disadvantages of dental veneers include:

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.070
The process is not reversible.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.530
The most serious disadvantage of porcelain
veneers is that the procedure is irreversible.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:45.990
Before putting them on your teeth, your dentist
will remove a considerable amount of tooth

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.580
enamel on the front of your teeth.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.910
Your teeth will no longer have their natural
shape after this is done.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.920
This will be extremely noticeable if you ever
have to remove the veneers for any reason.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.920
One of the biggest disadvantages of dental
veneers is the price.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.920
Dental veneers are more costly than composite
resin bonding.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.920
Dental veneers are usually not repairable
should they chip or crack.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.920
Dental veneers are brittle you will no longer
be able to crush ice with your teeth, bite

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.920
your fingernails, or put any sort of heavy
pressure on your teeth.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.791
Doing so may cause the veneers to chip or
crack, if the dental veneers become dislodged,

00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:04.791
cracked, or chipped, you will have to have
it replaced.

00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:05.791
Because enamel has been removed, your tooth
may become more sensitive to hot and cold

00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:06.791
foods and beverages.

00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:07.791
Veneers may not exactly match the color of
your other teeth.

00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:08.791
Also, the veneer's color cannot be altered
once in place.

00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:09.791
If you plan on whitening your teeth, you need
to do so before getting veneers.

00:01:09.791 --> 00:01:10.791
Though not likely, veneers can dislodge and
fall off.

00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:11.791
To minimize the chance of this occurring,
do not bite your nails; chew on pencils, ice,

00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:12.791
or other hard objects; or otherwise put excessive
pressure on your teeth.

00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:13.791
Teeth with veneers can still experience decay,
possibly necessitating full coverage of the

00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:14.791
tooth with a crown.

00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:15.791
Veneers are not a good choice for individuals
with unhealthy teeth (for example, those with

00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:16.791
decay or active gum disease), weakened teeth
(as a result of decay, fracture, large dental

00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:17.791
fillings), or for those who have an inadequate
amount of existing enamel on the tooth surface.

00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:18.791
Individuals who clench and grind their teeth
are poor candidates for porcelain veneers,

00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:19.791
as these activities can cause the veneers
to crack or chip.

00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:25.490
Another disadvantage of porcelain veneers
is the fact that they are strong, but they

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.530
are also very brittle.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.460
After having them put on your teeth, you will
no longer be able to crush ice with your teeth,

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.830
bite your fingernails, or put any sort of
heavy pressure on your teeth.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.420
Doing so may cause the veneers to chip or
crack.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.540
People who regularly grind their teeth can
easily cause this to happen.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:47.960
If you want a perfect smile, then dental veneers
may be just what you are looking for.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.960
But before you get dental veneers, make sure
you understand all of the disadvantages.
