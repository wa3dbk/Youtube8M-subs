00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.850
 It is Gundam cancer that has posted the Gundam production videos 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:13.350
 Weapons of policy of this time Sotheby's 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:13.350
 I think that I want to do the production of streams Tomahawk and beam saber 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:24.530
 So here are the beam saber and beam tomahawk parts 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:28.340
 It is floor to sell I think this is awesome 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.760
 It 's part of Beam Tomahawk's beam 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.800
 There are 12 types of this 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.770
 Pocky pattern and absolute pattern 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:42.490
 That is kelp 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:47.680
 It is a part of the league saber This is also the same part 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:50.760
 If it's in the play, this saberby's beam weapon saber etc 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:59.149
 Most of the focus is yellow 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.149
 This kit has become the color of something like this It is a fluorescent green to like this 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:08.510
 Looking at this color will remind you of that slime I often bought in elementary school 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.510
 And because it was such a color 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:17.159
 As we always begin with incorporation in radio as work, it is this 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.899
 It is quantity when we see ground fault and later 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.079
 Well in this corner, I think that I would like to add ink to parts of the handle part in this area 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.079
 I will 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.310
 Hmm 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.830
 Hmm 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.720
 As violet is completed, it is part of this possession this part 2 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.720
 I would like to spray é®­ 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.440
 I think that I want to color with this weathering master because the frosted spray has dried 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.440
 I will 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.709
 Coloring with Weathering Master is complete, so I would like to assemble 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:16.689
 Beam Tomahawk Completed Let's make both short and long parts there 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.689
 Hmm 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.180
 Se fishing wants to meet the beam saber 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.050
 Beam saber also completed in Japan 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:13.800
 Fluorescent green is also pretty cool this red 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:17.370
 And I felt that this has also really suits the part and feel of the color of 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:23.160
 I think what or warning people really cool 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:24.920
 So buying or entered This is one of the two but I'm beam of Tomahawk was this complete 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.250
 can 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.250
 here 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.160
 Eat a portion of mochi 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.330
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.330
 United into one 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:47.350
 So this part 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:52.580
 For example to go back to this big guy 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:55.560
 Hey it will be quite large powerful weapon 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.310
 It's cool this or will 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:02.220
 And after that, it's so tiny 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:06.320
 This but I have a joint of parts 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.320
 When attached to the back part 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:22.970
 It becomes one continuation in such a feeling 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:26.620
 Can attack on both sides brought here it is this place that has now 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.620
 I can do this kind of weapon 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.310
 So I hope to loudly cool 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.960
 Like this 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:40.470
 Because both the beam saber and the beam tomahawk were completed 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.580
 It is the part of the hand was the last of the parts after the next time here 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.580
 I want to produce
