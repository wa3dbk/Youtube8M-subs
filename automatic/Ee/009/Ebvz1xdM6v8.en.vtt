00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
actually tastes really good especially

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.539 
actually tastes really good especially
if<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:51.899> coconut<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.890> what<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.100> did<00:01:53.220> was<00:01:53.520> I

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
if you like coconut so what I did was I

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.940 
if you like coconut so what I did was I
measured<00:01:53.970> out<00:01:54.090> one<00:01:54.570> tablespoon<00:01:55.229> already<00:01:55.680> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
measured out one tablespoon already and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.539 
measured out one tablespoon already and
that<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.700> 14<00:01:57.479> grams<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.710> guys<00:01:58.920> see<00:01:59.189> when

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
that is 14 grams and you guys see when

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.490 
that is 14 grams and you guys see when
you<00:01:59.700> get<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> coconut<00:02:00.119> oil<00:02:00.540> out<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:01.200> not

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
you get the coconut oil out it's not

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.620 
you get the coconut oil out it's not
really<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> liquid<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.790> what<00:02:03.000> I'm<00:02:03.090> going<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.420> do

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
really a liquid so what I'm going to do

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.660 
really a liquid so what I'm going to do
is<00:02:03.899> microwave<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.710> until<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.189> turns<00:02:05.399> into<00:02:05.520> a

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
is microwave it until it turns into a

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.750 
is microwave it until it turns into a
liquid<00:02:05.930> probably<00:02:06.930> 20<00:02:07.469> seconds<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.220> my<00:02:08.399> guess

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.440 

and<00:02:12.659> 20<00:02:13.530> seconds<00:02:14.099> in<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.459> microwave<00:02:14.610> was

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
and 20 seconds in the microwave was

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.930 
and 20 seconds in the microwave was
perfect<00:02:15.959> it's<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.290> liquid<00:02:16.530> now<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.370> we're<00:02:17.819> going

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
perfect it's a liquid now so we're going

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.570 
perfect it's a liquid now so we're going
to<00:02:18.000> pour<00:02:18.299> half<00:02:18.720> on<00:02:19.019> one<00:02:19.319> side<00:02:19.590> in<00:02:19.860> half<00:02:20.099> on<00:02:20.370> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
to pour half on one side in half on the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.750 
to pour half on one side in half on the
other<00:02:22.220> there<00:02:23.220> we<00:02:23.370> go

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
other there we go

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.570
