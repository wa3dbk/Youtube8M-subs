00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.480
 hello today we are going to learn how to make chicken 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:12.120
 to garlic for it we are going to need 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.980
 chicken broken into pieces my advice is 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.080
 that you remove the skin to prevent 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.539
 be a heavy plate or have a lot 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.900
 fat then we're going to need 100 grams 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.449
 of almonds salt pepper oil 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.869
 olive a glass of white wine an onion 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.570
 whole julienned and 8 teeth of 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.360
 games garlic and a little Band - Aids 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.910
 laurel the first thing to do this chicken 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.850
 the garlic is going to be put a saucepan 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.590
 fire a fairly high fire if by 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.260
 example I have from 0 to 9 then about a 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.420
 7 18 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.129
 so that the chicken is cold we are going to throw 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.469
 a lot of olive oil and we're going to take 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.030
 Salt and pepper is very important 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.320
 of course let the chicken for a long time 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.320
 is very very golden 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.590
 when the chicken is already very very golden 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.590
 let's remove it from the fire 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.110
 to process oil that is already 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.770
 hot let's add 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.909
 all 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.909
 the onion 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.240
 and a happy girl in our 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.340
 work we will book now 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.340
 they damaged a little bit and the laurel 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.650
 love 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.180
 and you see that the game is very strong 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.890
 go down a bit because we did not either 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.890
 it interests that onions gums 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.720
 ah 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.030
 while the onion is supporting 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.770
 we're going to do the dunking for 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.689
 wet we're going to need the almonds 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.790
 in raw that as we have said before 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.590
 all that remains of garlic that 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.170
 approximately since we have thrown 8 garlic 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.630
 would be 2 for the fire and another six for 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.630
 the crushed and a little white wine 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.320
 and now we put it in the mortar and 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.200
 only thing that we are going to have to do is go 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.940
 Crushing the way you can see the onion 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.930
 is already poached once we have the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.359
 poached onion let's add the chicken 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.819
 and we'll let a little cook 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:20.280
 with the onion once we have left 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.129
 let the onion with the 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.519
 chicken and the next thing is going to be throwing the 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.519
 White wine 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:34.050
 and the majado I remember the majado of had 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.960
 almonds garlic and a little wine 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.060
 white we throw everything and we will leave 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.190
 to cook until all the broth is 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.300
 consume normally about 15 minutes 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.400
 simmering so that all 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.940
 the flavors integrate well here 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.370
 we have our chicken with garlic 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.650
