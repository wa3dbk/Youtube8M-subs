 where there is greater affectation 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.650

 they go from facts totally detached 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.560
 by air and also with losses 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.930

 practically everything says that water does not 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.840
 both the air and the water 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.140
 practically spoiled beds 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.140
 beat losing refrigerators washing machines
