my team the time to move up and take
over<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.959> now<00:02:43.410> I'm<00:02:43.560> going<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.799> really<00:02:44.010> forge

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
over and now I'm going to really forge

over and now I'm going to really forge
forward<00:02:44.549> because<00:02:44.760> as<00:02:44.880> soon<00:02:45.030> as<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.299> counter

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
forward because as soon as that counter

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.330 
forward because as soon as that counter
starts<00:02:46.049> to<00:02:46.170> get<00:02:46.260> down<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.680> let<00:02:46.799> the<00:02:46.890> last<00:02:47.099> 30

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
starts to get down to let the last 30

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.059 
starts to get down to let the last 30
seconds<00:02:47.700> or<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.260> forreal<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.410> can<00:02:49.590> go<00:02:49.739> forward

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
seconds or so forreal you can go forward

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.350 
seconds or so forreal you can go forward
and<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.310> more<00:02:50.489> ink<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.790> can<00:02:50.970> cover<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
and the more ink you can cover the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.449

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.380 
said it's time to launch my special I
think<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.680> let's<00:02:56.430> get<00:02:56.700> launching<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.209> ink

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
think it is let's get launching the ink

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.789 
think it is let's get launching the ink

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
doing a better job as you'll see here

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.970 
doing a better job as you'll see here
from<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.910> end<00:03:15.120> scores<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:16.140> don't<00:03:16.709> actually

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
from the end scores I don't actually

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.500 
from the end scores I don't actually
score<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.519> highest<00:03:17.640> despite<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.269> fact<00:03:18.420> that

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
score the highest despite the fact that

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.039 
score the highest despite the fact that
I<00:03:18.630> get<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:19.109> most<00:03:19.290> splats<00:03:19.709> by<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.010> large<00:03:20.370> margin

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
I get the most splats by a large margin

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.410 
I get the most splats by a large margin
but<00:03:22.049> we<00:03:22.200> covered<00:03:22.560> 67.5<00:03:23.549> percent<00:03:23.970> which<00:03:24.150> means

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
but we covered 67.5 percent which means

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.300 
but we covered 67.5 percent which means
that<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.840> good<00:03:25.049> guys<00:03:25.079> get<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.859> victory<00:03:26.160> of

team you're on that's for sure 821
splats<00:03:31.260> there<00:03:31.560> but<00:03:31.739> as<00:03:31.829> you<00:03:31.950> can<00:03:32.010> see<00:03:32.190> someone

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
splats there but as you can see someone

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.729 
splats there but as you can see someone
you<00:03:32.519> only<00:03:32.670> got<00:03:32.850> two<00:03:32.880> got<00:03:33.690> way<00:03:34.049> more<00:03:34.079> points<00:03:34.709> for

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
you only got two got way more points for

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.559 
you only got two got way more points for
me<00:03:34.950> because<00:03:35.130> they<00:03:35.280> cover<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.609> lot<00:03:36.000> more<00:03:36.030> ground

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
me because they cover a lot more ground

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.300 
me because they cover a lot more ground

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
so you're never ranked on your splatting

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.819 
so you're never ranked on your splatting
ability<00:03:38.760> it's<00:03:39.239> not<00:03:39.510> about<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:40.049> about<00:03:40.350> your

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829
