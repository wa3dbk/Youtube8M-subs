00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
 4 Studying in Classics In this classic 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.750
 The most important thing is to find a teacher and make an iron call. 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:18.750
 But this is really good when you see it in fact . 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:21.240
 So we know that something like that line jjimhan York muhyeopji fact is geombeop 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:27.570
 You're learning . 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:29.010
 Though it can be done through this, it is a kind of exposure 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.660
 Join 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:40.650
 It 's really hard to beat the world. 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:42.840
 By the way, this sleep has some more questions and some value through it 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.160
 The resumption of this spirit 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.270
 It's a lot more than two worlds of guards . 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:56.730
 So, there, the teacher is absolutely important. 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:00.239
 So this is why in China and also in our country 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:06.510
 Before the modern era , it starts to study. 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:09.300
 So I decided to decide what kind of culture I would go into. 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.600
 Then it becomes a Gangwon. 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.310
 So now the mentor also knows how one's life is worth one's life 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:22.020
 I have to pass it on to someone. 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:26.890
 So I wait and wait again. 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.950
 So in order to meet with the student to work immediately spark 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.909
 You and your teacher 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:40.300
 It is not in such a paper to recognize each other . 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:46.030
 It is the breaking of the truth of this world and the combination of its truth and its being. 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:52.390
 So much more profound, so I can see this at a glance . 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:56.979
 As the hot line of Sutakuago Falbong's teacher is forming now 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:02.710
 I've been asking this triangle back in the drama. 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:08.320
 So now the actress who came out as an e girlfriend was very absurd. 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:10.509
 Geureohande market and put into self dwaeseo taste just a character in a love triangle film 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.150
 I just have to do this. 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:20.860
 In the drama, this is just going to be almost just a bell pension. 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:26.230
 So, here is the new shop of Bai Bong Bong and two of the three stages 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:30.129
 So it 's shaping up now and I 'm going to do this 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:35.349
 This process of spreading is spreading. 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:41.920
 Now here 's what's in essence in the study of the second classics 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:43.690
 Uh I want to learn how to bake so worried haneunge mandeulkka good bread 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.420
 I'm studying 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.480
 But how does Kumazun 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:54.760
 I worry what happens to me is one factor 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.019
 This is fundamentally different, but now the study of our time is right. 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.150
 You are. 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:07.989
 We've now as knowledge and information thumb 2 Net Play 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:12.010
 I think this is study. In the meantime, my grades are the most important thing in my school. 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:15.980
 I do a lot of study. 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:20.930
 Why I was so desperate for sexuality 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:25.730
 So it's not getting any more. 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:31.879
 What kind of qualifications will I earn? 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.690
 The process is something I would g2 contained in those specifications equip missing 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:40.010
 That's it. 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:44.360
 These people are really getting closer and closer to the peak , 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:48.410
 I can not win 'cause I 've lost my whole life already 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:52.250
 But we do not think this person is a loser. 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:57.590
 This is a misguided prejudice. 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:02.870
 It's not this, but it's not. 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.560
 Now that I've mentioned more and more of this knowledge information, 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.299
 It is. 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:12.890
 We have to live with this emptiness . 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:18.859
 I mean Kumamoto who is not a once a smiley face 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:20.090
 Do not know the line of thunder Because once I feel my presence is full 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:26.570
 I do not have it. 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.890
 The study tried to look good to my father this also true self is my question 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.570
 No 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:37.100
 To show my love to my father and now to become a few four. 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:44.300
 To fill your mother's desires and me. 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:50.600
 Only the challenges that need to be overcome are left over. 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:53.120
 If the server does not yet feel the euphoria felt there learned so much 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.030
 Poor being. 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.180
 But we do not do all of our studies 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:05.820
 2 4 No Framing Whimsical Ideas 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:10.410
 That's why I'm bouncing more than anyone else is motivation remains geonya hagetdan What If 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.250
 We are now calling the house a scandal to win without a course 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:16.260
 Are you 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:19.180
 Yeah, but this is not my office, and I can not have charisma here. 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:24.520
 Because you can love these people. 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:31.210
 I do not like it, but why do I want to raise children so much ? 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:32.650
 Why go out and spend right specification pack and process control do just way too preoccupied 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.890
 This was too much Oh. 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:39.130
 It boasted a 50% audience rating. 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:42.130
 Then Perforation wants this. 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:49.420
 You want young people like gimtakgu 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:50.650
 But why is the reality that this kind of game that mass-produced this 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.710
 And doing on 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:59.230
 This is now very interesting to me . 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:04.720
 So I have a desire for studying something like this unconsciously . 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:06.430
 It 's covered up by something . When you look at your original face. 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.280
 The fact that I'm not 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:14.740
 So I have to stop studying this. 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:17.440
 That did not say when decorate it, now that the introduction of these gimtakgu 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.590
 Maybe it's a date 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:27.160
 It's like being honest. 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:30.010
 So now that Falbong is going to give him his skills. 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:35.229
 I can not even live around 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:40.810
 The first thing you do is to make a brilliant shim product after that , 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:42.310
 Affection can teach him who does not have love for the people who eat this bread 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:48.310
 There is not 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:49.180
 So how do you keep creating new products and people 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.949
 do not have 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:07:00.009
 This is the stuff in our room right now . 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:07:00.969
 I really do not think this product will go to someone and happily match. 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.569
 I do not. 

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:07.810
 So it's a success . 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:14.590
 Great images for people 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:21.010
 So I sold a lot because I advertised it as an advertisement. 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:26.650
 People bought the goods, and of course, people are not happy . 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:33.790
 Something am saying is that I'm not happy mandan distance but more importantly the wilderness 

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:36.310
 People are not happy with the products they have developed because I am very 

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:42.400
 With some great promotional strategies 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:47.800
 I sold this product as much spacing as this lasts Rani stick in my presence 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:52.720
 Now the yireongeo the dynamics of the Orient to the gap that older ladies 

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:59.139
 Then this is what happens next when you put it on your body. 

00:07:52.720 --> 00:08:03.750
 I can hear you in the afternoon. Now listen to me. 

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:03.750
 The residence is gorgeous.
