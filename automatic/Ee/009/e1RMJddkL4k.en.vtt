00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.690 
which i think is a nice little touch so
you<00:01:34.470> got<00:01:34.590> them<00:01:34.799> up<00:01:34.950> here<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.250> at<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> Super

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you got them up here you at the Super

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.179 
you got them up here you at the Super
Sentai<00:01:36.119> V<00:01:36.540> which<00:01:37.140> they've<00:01:37.530> pretty<00:01:37.860> much<00:01:37.950> been

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
Sentai V which they've pretty much been

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.450 
Sentai V which they've pretty much been
using<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.579> forever<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.810> um<00:01:40.159> pretty<00:01:41.159> cool

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
using like forever but um pretty cool

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.730 
using like forever but um pretty cool
design<00:01:41.759> overall<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.200> function<00:01:43.470> as<00:01:43.710> both

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
design overall this can function as both

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.920 
design overall this can function as both
a<00:01:44.100> transformation<00:01:44.790> ring<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.360> magic<00:01:45.750> ring

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930

a transformation ring and a magic ring
not<00:01:46.799> sure<00:01:46.950> what<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.159> transformation<00:01:47.520> ring

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
not sure what the transformation ring

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.219 
not sure what the transformation ring
would<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.270> guess<00:01:48.479> tournament<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.930> kill<00:01:49.110> you

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
would do I guess tournament to kill you

00:01:49.229 --> 00:02:04.020 
would do I guess tournament to kill you
read<00:01:49.409> or<00:01:49.560> something<00:01:49.890> but

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:14.790 

and<00:02:05.030> we<00:02:05.150> have<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.510> same<00:02:05.780> sound<00:02:06.110> over<00:02:06.500> here

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.300 

there<00:02:15.800> we<00:02:15.950> go

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
there we go

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:24.130 
there we go
there<00:02:17.210> is<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.390> LED<00:02:18.140> in<00:02:18.440> this<00:02:22.690> can<00:02:23.690> see<00:02:23.930> right

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
there is a LED in this can see right

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.070 
there is a LED in this can see right
there<00:02:27.850> it's<00:02:28.850> just<00:02:29.000> right<00:02:29.330> where<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.630> silver

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
there it's just right where that silver

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.320 
there it's just right where that silver
is<00:02:30.110> so<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.710> gets<00:02:30.860> very<00:02:31.060> obscured

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
is so it gets very obscured

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.940 
is so it gets very obscured
I<00:02:32.360> really<00:02:33.140> wish<00:02:33.260> they<00:02:33.410> could<00:02:33.530> have<00:02:33.650> moved<00:02:33.770> it

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
I really wish they could have moved it

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.260 
I really wish they could have moved it
down<00:02:34.010> or<00:02:34.400> something<00:02:34.610> but<00:02:34.940> that's

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
down or something but that's

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.500 
down or something but that's
understandable<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:37.340> next<00:02:37.820> up<00:02:37.940> we<00:02:38.090> have<00:02:38.300> the

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
take a look at that when it gets here

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.520 
take a look at that when it gets here
but<00:04:21.949> for<00:04:22.430> now<00:04:22.580> this<00:04:22.910> is<00:04:23.060> where<00:04:23.240> we're<00:04:23.389> at<00:04:23.530> this

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
but for now this is where we're at this

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.250 
but for now this is where we're at this
set<00:04:24.860> as<00:04:25.070> a<00:04:25.100> whole<00:04:25.460> is<00:04:25.910> interesting<00:04:26.720> I<00:04:26.900> like<00:04:27.080> the

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
set as a whole is interesting I like the

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.650 
set as a whole is interesting I like the
miracle<00:04:27.650> ring<00:04:27.889> it<00:04:28.190> makes<00:04:28.400> a<00:04:28.550> cool<00:04:28.880> sound<00:04:29.270> and<00:04:29.599> I

I think it's a nice little kind of

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.000 
I think it's a nice little kind of
gimmicky<00:04:34.280> toy<00:04:34.550> to<00:04:34.820> have<00:04:35.030> but<00:04:35.900> um<00:04:36.169> obviously

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
the sounds that the super sentai ring

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.580 
the sounds that the super sentai ring
makes<00:04:40.580> is<00:04:40.789> very<00:04:40.820> generic<00:04:41.389> ish<00:04:41.900> it<00:04:42.139> doesn't

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
makes is very generic ish it doesn't

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.740 
makes is very generic ish it doesn't
like<00:04:42.740> do<00:04:43.160> anything<00:04:43.580> cuter<00:04:44.090> related<00:04:44.510> or

Gokaiger related or anything like that
so<00:04:48.500> it's<00:04:48.710> a<00:04:48.800> very<00:04:49.010> generic<00:04:49.160> sound<00:04:49.639> so<00:04:50.330> if<00:04:50.870> you

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
so it's a very generic sound so if you

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.980 
so it's a very generic sound so if you
just<00:04:51.289> want<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.710> ring<00:04:51.830> for<00:04:52.220> it's<00:04:52.490> um<00:04:52.910> kind<00:04:53.810> of

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
cool look to it I really like the way

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.850 
cool look to it I really like the way
that<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.510> Super<00:04:56.960> Sentai<00:04:57.260> ring<00:04:57.470> ends<00:04:57.740> up

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
that the Super Sentai ring ends up

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.640 
that the Super Sentai ring ends up
looking<00:04:58.010> but<00:04:58.880> um<00:04:59.090> that<00:04:59.570> both<00:05:00.110> of<00:05:00.139> these<00:05:00.410> are

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
looking but um that both of these are

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.320 
looking but um that both of these are
currently<00:05:00.860> not<00:05:01.190> available<00:05:01.340> in<00:05:01.699> gastrin<00:05:02.150> or

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
currently not available in gastrin or

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.770 
currently not available in gastrin or
candy<00:05:02.630> toy<00:05:02.780> as<00:05:03.050> of<00:05:03.260> yet<00:05:03.620> who<00:05:04.610> knows<00:05:04.849> might<00:05:05.630> be<00:05:05.750> a

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
candy toy as of yet who knows might be a

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
candy toy as of yet who knows might be a
couple<00:05:05.960> more<00:05:06.169> sets<00:05:06.470> along<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.889> way<00:05:07.210> but<00:05:08.800> it's

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
couple more sets along the way but it's

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.770 
couple more sets along the way but it's
not<00:05:09.979> that<00:05:10.190> expensive<00:05:10.460> of<00:05:10.910> a<00:05:11.000> set<00:05:11.270> I<00:05:11.300> think<00:05:11.690> it's

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
not that expensive of a set I think it's

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.650 
not that expensive of a set I think it's
only<00:05:11.930> uh<00:05:12.550> probably<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:13.699> same<00:05:13.940> as<00:05:13.970> normal<00:05:14.479> ring

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
only uh probably the same as normal ring

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.290 
only uh probably the same as normal ring
sets<00:05:14.900> about<00:05:15.080> 1000<00:05:15.680> yen<00:05:15.830> so<00:05:16.550> not<00:05:16.729> bad<00:05:16.940> at<00:05:17.090> all<00:05:17.180> if

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
sets about 1000 yen so not bad at all if

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.400 
sets about 1000 yen so not bad at all if
you<00:05:17.389> want<00:05:17.510> you<00:05:17.690> to<00:05:17.750> do<00:05:17.870> these<00:05:17.990> rings<00:05:18.229> I<00:05:18.349> do

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
you want you to do these rings I do

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.050 
you want you to do these rings I do
