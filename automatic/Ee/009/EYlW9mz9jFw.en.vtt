well<00:00:00.450> you<00:00:00.630> know<00:00:00.780> I'm<00:00:01.319> going<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.650> explain<00:00:01.979> a

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
well you know I'm going to explain a

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.010 
well you know I'm going to explain a
little<00:00:02.159> bit<00:00:02.460> more<00:00:02.730> about<00:00:02.939> Spade<00:00:03.300> bits<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.870> you

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
little bit more about Spade bits to you

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.440 
little bit more about Spade bits to you
so<00:00:04.890> that<00:00:05.100> maybe<00:00:05.370> you'll<00:00:05.700> understand<00:00:06.210> them<00:00:06.359> and

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
so that maybe you'll understand them and

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.179 
so that maybe you'll understand them and
hopefully<00:00:06.960> learn<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.259> use<00:00:07.410> them<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:07.710> know<00:00:07.890> that

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
hopefully learn to use them I know that

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.200 
hopefully learn to use them I know that
they're<00:00:08.400> one<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.639> most<00:00:08.730> fun<00:00:08.970> things<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.510> do

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
they're one of the most fun things I do

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
they're one of the most fun things I do
bits<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.719> general<00:00:13.820> work<00:00:14.820> from<00:00:15.210> two<00:00:15.599> functions

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
bits and general work from two functions

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.189 
bits and general work from two functions
and<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.220> would<00:00:17.369> be<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.970> leverage<00:00:18.420> on<00:00:18.690> the

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
and that would be the leverage on the

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.570 
and that would be the leverage on the
cheek<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:20.070> other<00:00:20.220> words<00:00:20.369> where<00:00:20.550> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
cheek in other words where the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.200 
cheek in other words where the
mouthpiece<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.420> placed<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.350> cheek<00:00:22.619> and

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
mouthpiece is placed on the cheek and

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.179 
mouthpiece is placed on the cheek and
mouthpiece<00:00:24.210> power<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.140> that's<00:00:25.289> all<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:26.010> makes

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
mouthpiece power and that's all it makes

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.290 
mouthpiece power and that's all it makes
a<00:00:26.460> bit<00:00:26.670> really<00:00:27.119> work<00:00:27.359> as<00:00:28.080> far<00:00:28.439> as<00:00:28.640> how<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.939> feels

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
a bit really work as far as how it feels

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.120 
a bit really work as far as how it feels
when<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.779> pull<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.140> there's<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.439> lot<00:00:31.619> more<00:00:31.890> to

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
when you pull it there's a lot more to

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.850 
when you pull it there's a lot more to
the<00:00:32.219> mechanics<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:32.969> far<00:00:33.239> as<00:00:33.380> signals<00:00:34.380> go<00:00:34.620> as

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
the mechanics as far as signals go as

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.310 
the mechanics as far as signals go as
you'll<00:00:35.190> learn<00:00:35.430> here<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.969> few<00:00:36.180> minutes<00:00:36.510> so

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
you'll learn here in a few minutes so

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.580 
you'll learn here in a few minutes so
leverage<00:00:38.280> means<00:00:38.579> if<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.270> pull<00:00:39.570> one<00:00:39.600> ounce<00:00:40.110> here

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
leverage means if I pull one ounce here

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.729 
leverage means if I pull one ounce here
that<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.309> might<00:00:41.610> get<00:00:41.820> 4<00:00:42.180> ounces<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.780> pressure

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
that I might get 4 ounces of pressure

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.049 
that I might get 4 ounces of pressure
from<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> curb<00:00:44.700> strap<00:00:45.200> also<00:00:46.399> lower<00:00:47.399> leverage

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
from the curb strap also lower leverage

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.869 
from the curb strap also lower leverage
like<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> lower<00:00:49.890> leverage<00:00:50.430> speed

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
like this is a lower leverage speed

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.580 
like this is a lower leverage speed
right<00:00:51.149> here<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.570> mouthpiece<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.170> set<00:00:52.379> down

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
right here the mouthpiece is set down

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.860 
right here the mouthpiece is set down
just<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.460> little<00:00:53.730> bit<00:00:53.850> further<00:00:54.180> than<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.660> first

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
just a little bit further than the first

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.380 
just a little bit further than the first
one<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.140> picked<00:00:55.469> up<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> higher

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
one I picked up and this is a higher

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.599 
one I picked up and this is a higher
leverage<00:00:58.050> speed<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:58.800> see<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
leverage speed you can see the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.180 
leverage speed you can see the
mouthpiece<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.420> set<00:01:00.660> very<00:01:00.870> high<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.920> one

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
mouthpiece is set very high on this one

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.690 
mouthpiece is set very high on this one
now<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> high<00:01:03.480> leverage<00:01:03.780> Spain<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
now this is a high leverage Spain and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.899 
now this is a high leverage Spain and
this<00:01:05.700> Spain<00:01:06.090> moves<00:01:06.840> slow<00:01:07.680> when<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> top<00:01:08.549> moves

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
this Spain moves slow when the top moves

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.789 
this Spain moves slow when the top moves
the<00:01:09.479> Spade<00:01:09.780> moves<00:01:10.460> fairly<00:01:11.460> slow<00:01:12.049> versus<00:01:13.080> this

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the Spade moves fairly slow versus this

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.320 
the Spade moves fairly slow versus this
is<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> lot<00:01:14.460> lower<00:01:14.939> leverage<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.140> you'll<00:01:16.890> see

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
is a lot lower leverage and you'll see

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.359 
is a lot lower leverage and you'll see
see<00:01:18.330> how<00:01:18.420> fast<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.990> Spade<00:01:19.530> moves<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.189> makes

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
see how fast that Spade moves it makes

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.700 
see how fast that Spade moves it makes
quite<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.759> big<00:01:21.060> move<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.900> other<00:01:22.049> Spade<00:01:22.409> made<00:01:22.680> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
quite a big move the other Spade made a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.429 
quite a big move the other Spade made a
real<00:01:22.950> short<00:01:23.369> move<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.479> put<00:01:24.689> yourself<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
real short move so put yourself in a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.640 
real short move so put yourself in a
horse's<00:01:25.740> position<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:27.479> short<00:01:27.810> move<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.470> not

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
horse's position and a short move is not

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.910 
horse's position and a short move is not
near<00:01:28.979> scary<00:01:29.610> as<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.939> great<00:01:30.810> big<00:01:31.110> move<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.710> also

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
near scary as a great big move it also

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.910 
near scary as a great big move it also
has<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> little<00:01:32.670> more<00:01:32.939> feel<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.540> me<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.900> did<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> lot

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
has a little more feel to me I did a lot

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.940 
has a little more feel to me I did a lot
of<00:01:35.040> experimentation<00:01:35.939> with<00:01:36.450> spades<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.409> built

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
of experimentation with spades I built

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.730 
of experimentation with spades I built
probably<00:01:38.220> all<00:01:38.790> around<00:01:39.299> 30<00:01:39.600> spades<00:01:39.990> last<00:01:40.439> year

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
probably all around 30 spades last year

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.940 
probably all around 30 spades last year
for<00:01:41.310> myself<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.750> experimented<00:01:43.320> with<00:01:43.470> three

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
for myself and I experimented with three

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.910 
for myself and I experimented with three
real<00:01:44.159> nice<00:01:44.399> horses<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.060> was<00:01:45.210> bridling

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
real nice horses that I was bridling

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.580 
real nice horses that I was bridling
some<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.009> those<00:01:47.100> spades<00:01:48.170> like<00:01:49.170> for<00:01:49.500> example

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
some of those spades like for example

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.429 
some of those spades like for example
this<00:01:50.220> one<00:01:50.329> which<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.540> beautiful<00:01:51.990> little

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
this one which is a beautiful little

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.560 
this one which is a beautiful little
Spade<00:01:52.799> but<00:01:53.100> as<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:53.790> see<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.149> rusty

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
Spade but as you can see it's rusty

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.560 
Spade but as you can see it's rusty
because<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.500> don't<00:01:55.710> use<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.189> when<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.210> when<00:01:57.509> I

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
because I don't use it when I when I

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.840 
because I don't use it when I when I
built<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.020> speed<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.320> looked<00:01:58.649> at<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.159> it

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
built this speed I looked at it and it

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.480 
built this speed I looked at it and it
just<00:01:59.880> had<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.689> feel<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.320> look<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:02.130> a

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
just had the feel and the look of a

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.359 
just had the feel and the look of a
really<00:02:02.759> nice<00:02:02.909> Spade<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.990> used<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.829> only<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.130> few

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
really nice Spade I used it only a few

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.730 
really nice Spade I used it only a few
days<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:06.299> was<00:02:06.420> real<00:02:06.600> obvious<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:07.469> really

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
days it was real obvious it really

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.199 
days it was real obvious it really
wasn't<00:02:07.920> going<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> work<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.610> comparison<00:02:09.179> to

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
wasn't going to work in comparison to

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.360 
wasn't going to work in comparison to
some<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.629> other<00:02:09.860> experimental<00:02:10.860> bits<00:02:11.190> that

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
some of the other experimental bits that

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.990 
some of the other experimental bits that
I've<00:02:11.520> made<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.599> hangs

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
I've made so it hangs

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.360 
I've made so it hangs
up<00:02:13.060> here<00:02:13.300> now<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:14.350> bits<00:02:14.560> a<00:02:14.650> little<00:02:14.920> too<00:02:15.100> fast

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
up here now the bits a little too fast

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.400 
up here now the bits a little too fast
actually<00:02:16.330> when<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.660> move<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.960> bottom<00:02:17.320> the

sure works different than the other and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.180 
sure works different than the other and
you'll<00:02:37.270> find<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:37.690> out<00:02:37.900> if<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.140> get<00:02:38.290> into<00:02:38.650> you

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
know the speed bit if you get interested

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.410 
know the speed bit if you get interested
in<00:02:41.860> Spade<00:02:42.100> bits<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:44.380> what<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.040> look<00:02:45.400> for<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.940> in

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
in Spade bits so what I look for is in

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.990 
in Spade bits so what I look for is in
setting<00:02:47.050> up<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.320> spade<00:02:47.560> bit<00:02:47.590> as<00:02:48.070> I<00:02:48.610> set<00:02:48.880> the

they'll all get loose and they all get

where they pop like this one does this

to it some people like it I personally

to it some people like it I personally
prefer<00:03:26.769> bars<00:03:27.580> that<00:03:28.420> have<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:29.049> little<00:03:30.010> more

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
prefer bars that have a little more

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.039 
prefer bars that have a little more
tongue<00:03:30.430> relief<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.000> they<00:03:31.090> they<00:03:31.480> seem<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.870> work

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
tongue relief and they they seem to work

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.590 
tongue relief and they they seem to work
a<00:03:32.230> little<00:03:32.350> more<00:03:32.590> on<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.799> outside<00:03:33.400> corners<00:03:34.390> of

a little more on the outside corners of

a little more on the outside corners of
the<00:03:34.750> bars<00:03:34.989> than<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.440> flat<00:03:35.680> top<00:03:36.010> of<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.280> bars

the bars than the flat top of the bars

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.210 
the bars than the flat top of the bars
which<00:03:36.700> is<00:03:36.850> it's<00:03:37.390> more<00:03:37.660> of<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.810> peak<00:03:38.080> so<00:03:38.739> it<00:03:38.890> fits

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
which is it's more of a peak so it fits

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.310 
which is it's more of a peak so it fits
in<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.459> horse's<00:03:39.730> mouth<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.030> little<00:03:40.420> cleaner<00:03:40.660> you

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
dip my my bits in a water trough or

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.060 
dip my my bits in a water trough or
squirt<00:03:49.329> them<00:03:49.480> off<00:03:49.600> with<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:49.900> hose<00:03:50.110> every<00:03:50.920> two

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
squirt them off with the hose every two

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.620 
squirt them off with the hose every two
or<00:03:51.190> three<00:03:51.400> times<00:03:51.579> that<00:03:51.820> I<00:03:51.940> use<00:03:52.150> them<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.480> get

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
or three times that I use them to get

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.920 
or three times that I use them to get
the<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:53.320> horse<00:03:53.590> slobber<00:03:54.180> out<00:03:55.180> of<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.480> corners

the the horse slobber out of the corners

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.780 
the the horse slobber out of the corners
here<00:03:56.140> so<00:03:56.320> they<00:03:56.440> don't<00:03:56.470> gunk<00:03:56.890> up<00:03:57.070> too<00:03:57.310> bad<00:03:57.519> and

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
here so they don't gunk up too bad and

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.819 
here so they don't gunk up too bad and
lose<00:03:58.329> the<00:03:58.540> crispness<00:03:58.959> that's<00:03:59.410> part<00:03:59.680> of<00:03:59.739> the

I've<00:04:02.620> experimented<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.489> lot<00:04:03.670> with<00:04:03.750> bars<00:04:04.750> I've

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
I've experimented a lot with bars I've

I've experimented a lot with bars I've
experimented<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.549> lot<00:04:06.790> with<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:07.450> angle<00:04:08.019> of<00:04:08.230> the

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
experimented a lot with the angle of the

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.150 
experimented a lot with the angle of the
Spade<00:04:09.120> there's<00:04:10.120> three<00:04:10.650> positions<00:04:11.650> as<00:04:11.829> far<00:04:11.860> as

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
Spade there's three positions as far as

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.720 
Spade there's three positions as far as
Spade<00:04:12.489> angles<00:04:13.090> go<00:04:13.530> I've<00:04:14.530> come<00:04:14.769> up<00:04:14.920> with<00:04:14.950> the

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
Spade angles go I've come up with the

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.969 
Spade angles go I've come up with the
correct<00:04:16.090> angle<00:04:16.390> for<00:04:17.079> the<00:04:17.200> Spade<00:04:17.500> that<00:04:17.769> makes

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
correct angle for the Spade that makes

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.420 
correct angle for the Spade that makes
it<00:04:18.190> most<00:04:18.340> user-friendly<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:20.039> the<00:04:21.039> most

this<00:04:26.050> this<00:04:26.560> man

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
this this man

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.999 
this this man
mouthpiece<00:04:27.159> in<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.550> cheek<00:04:28.139> now<00:04:29.139> I<00:04:29.470> like<00:04:29.979> a

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
mouthpiece in the cheek now I like a

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.960 
mouthpiece in the cheek now I like a
slower<00:04:30.520> Spade<00:04:31.030> so<00:04:31.419> I<00:04:31.449> set<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:31.780> fairly<00:04:32.289> high<00:04:32.530> and

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
slower Spade so I set it fairly high and

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.719 
slower Spade so I set it fairly high and
I've<00:04:33.970> come<00:04:34.330> up<00:04:34.509> with<00:04:34.539> different<00:04:35.289> speeds<00:04:36.280> and

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
I've come up with different speeds and

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.929 
I've come up with different speeds and
different<00:04:37.060> bar<00:04:37.949> combinations<00:04:38.949> than<00:04:39.639> most

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:39.939 
different bar combinations than most

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:43.230 
different bar combinations than most
people<00:04:40.389> have<00:04:40.599> in<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:40.900> past<00:04:41.370> this<00:04:42.370> is<00:04:42.699> the

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
people have in the past this is the

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.300 
people have in the past this is the
result<00:04:43.629> of<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:44.770> lot<00:04:45.129> of<00:04:45.280> experimentation<00:04:46.120> and

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
result of a lot of experimentation and

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.550 
result of a lot of experimentation and
again<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:48.520> see<00:04:48.629> what<00:04:49.629> you<00:04:49.750> might<00:04:49.960> think<00:04:49.990> is<00:04:50.439> an

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
again you see what you might think is an

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.290 
again you see what you might think is an
odd-looking<00:04:50.770> bar<00:04:51.370> for<00:04:51.699> a<00:04:51.729> spade<00:04:52.030> and<00:04:52.180> an

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
odd-looking bar for a spade and an

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.749 
odd-looking bar for a spade and an
odd-looking<00:04:52.449> spade<00:04:53.110> for<00:04:53.379> Spade<00:04:53.710> I<00:04:53.979> kind<00:04:54.699> of

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
odd-looking spade for Spade I kind of

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.309 
odd-looking spade for Spade I kind of
wanted<00:04:55.000> to<00:04:55.060> do<00:04:55.210> something<00:04:55.539> like<00:04:55.659> this<00:04:55.900> this<00:04:56.199> is

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319
