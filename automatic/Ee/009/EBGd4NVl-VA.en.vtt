hey everyone Antonia here from XLE calm

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.670 
hey everyone Antonia here from XLE calm
and<00:00:14.460> today<00:00:14.639> I'm<00:00:14.849> gonna<00:00:15.000> explain<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.049> guys<00:00:16.230> how

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
and today I'm gonna explain you guys how

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.810 
and today I'm gonna explain you guys how
what<00:00:17.609> CG<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.359> on<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.320> hell<00:00:19.470> are<00:00:19.710> what<00:00:20.279> CG<00:00:20.699> is

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
what CG is on the hell are what CG is

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.890 
what CG is on the hell are what CG is
actually<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.390> anything<00:00:22.820> CG<00:00:23.820> stands<00:00:24.720> for

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
actually in anything CG stands for

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.170 
actually in anything CG stands for
center<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.439> gravity<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.130> planes<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.060> is

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
center of gravity in planes it is

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.990 
center of gravity in planes it is
extremely<00:00:27.990> critical<00:00:28.230> without<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.340> if<00:00:29.580> let's

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
extremely critical without that if let's

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.240 
extremely critical without that if let's
say<00:00:30.119> if<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.359> plane<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.869> tell<00:00:31.470> heavy<00:00:31.679> you'll

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
say if the plane is to tell heavy you'll

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.709 
say if the plane is to tell heavy you'll
probably<00:00:32.489> never<00:00:32.730> see<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.059> plane<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.570> one

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
probably never see that plane to one

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.430 
probably never see that plane to one
piece<00:00:33.930> again

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
piece again

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.500 
piece again
muhuali<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.489> helicopter<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.239> can<00:00:36.270> actually

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
muhuali a helicopter you can actually

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.240 
muhuali a helicopter you can actually
kind<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.050> get<00:00:37.200> away<00:00:37.290> with<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.890> little<00:00:38.129> bit

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
kind of get away with it a little bit

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.470 
kind of get away with it a little bit
more<00:00:38.489> than<00:00:39.390> planes<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:39.989> by<00:00:40.469> adding<00:00:40.649> trim<00:00:41.070> so

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
more than planes just by adding trim so

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.270 
more than planes just by adding trim so
let's<00:00:42.480> check<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> CG<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.469> your<00:00:43.739> traditional

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
let's check the CG on your traditional

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.479 
let's check the CG on your traditional
flybar<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.989> we<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.320> here<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.950> blue<00:00:47.340> where

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
flybar like we have here is a blue where

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.420 
flybar like we have here is a blue where
a<00:00:47.520> guy<00:00:47.730> here<00:00:47.969> for<00:00:48.390> 50<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.590> traditional

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
a guy here for 50 so on traditional

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.400 
a guy here for 50 so on traditional
flowers<00:00:50.789> very<00:00:51.210> simply<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:51.899> grab<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.110> by<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
flowers very simply just grab it by the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.000 
flowers very simply just grab it by the
fly<00:00:52.739> bar<00:00:53.090> lift<00:00:54.090> straight<00:00:54.390> up<00:00:54.649> and<00:00:55.649> obviously

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
fly bar lift straight up and obviously

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.430 
fly bar lift straight up and obviously
you<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.280> see<00:00:56.309> there<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.329> helicopter<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.079> tail

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
you can see there the helicopter is tail

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.740 
you can see there the helicopter is tail
heavy<00:00:58.649> there<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.699> no<00:00:59.850> battery<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.300> there<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.719> I

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
heavy there is no battery in there so I

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.979 
heavy there is no battery in there so I
was<00:01:01.050> expecting<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> battery

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
was expecting that and with the battery

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:10.310 
was expecting that and with the battery
let's<00:01:03.989> mount<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.409> battery<00:01:09.020> velcro<00:01:10.020> down

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
let's mount the battery velcro down

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.240 
let's mount the battery velcro down
there<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.860> go

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
there we go

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.380 
there we go
and<00:01:11.490> once<00:01:12.210> again<00:01:12.360> use<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.170> same<00:01:13.380> procedure

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
and once again use the same procedure

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.460 
and once again use the same procedure
right<00:01:15.390> out<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> fly<00:01:15.840> bar<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.229> grab<00:01:16.439> it

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
right out the fly bar just grab it

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.350 
right out the fly bar just grab it
straight<00:01:16.860> up<00:01:18.770> there<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.890> go<00:01:20.180> what<00:01:21.180> that's

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
straight up there you go what that's

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.740 
straight up there you go what that's
gonna<00:01:21.600> sure<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:23.189> swash<00:01:23.610> needs<00:01:24.450> no

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
gonna sure is that the swash needs no

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.840 
gonna sure is that the swash needs no
trim<00:01:25.140> at<00:01:25.439> all<00:01:25.710> at<00:01:26.040> least<00:01:26.280> forward<00:01:26.700> and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
trim at all at least forward and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.580 
trim at all at least forward and
backward<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.299> not<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.810> elevators<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.409> don't

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
backward is not on the elevators I don't

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.350 
backward is not on the elevators I don't
need<00:01:28.680> any<00:01:28.860> trim<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.820> should<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.180> pretty

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
need any trim it should be pretty

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.450 
need any trim it should be pretty
centered<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.229> I've<00:01:31.590> asshole<00:01:31.920> heard<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.280> lot<00:01:32.430> of

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
centered and I've asshole heard a lot of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.240 
centered and I've asshole heard a lot of
guys<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.820> do<00:01:33.000> 3d<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:34.110> don't<00:01:34.500> even<00:01:35.040> bother

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
guys that do 3d that don't even bother

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.740 
guys that do 3d that don't even bother
to<00:01:35.549> check<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.909> CG<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.240> always<00:01:36.479> hear<00:01:36.630> them

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
to check the CG I always hear them

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.230 
to check the CG I always hear them
complain<00:01:37.170> saying<00:01:37.470> why<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.610> certain<00:01:38.970> maneuvers

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
complain saying why in certain maneuvers

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.149 
complain saying why in certain maneuvers
they<00:01:39.630> have<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.930> input<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.619> little<00:01:40.920> bit<00:01:41.009> more

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
they have to input a little bit more

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.639 
they have to input a little bit more
elevator<00:01:41.899> and<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.020> always<00:01:43.110> tell<00:01:43.380> them<00:01:43.439> did<00:01:43.619> you

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
elevator and I always tell them did you

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.649 
elevator and I always tell them did you
do<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.009> CG<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.549> they<00:01:44.640> look<00:01:44.820> at<00:01:44.939> me<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.450> I'm

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
do the CG and they look at me like I'm

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.080 
do the CG and they look at me like I'm
speaking<00:01:46.229> another<00:01:46.530> language<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.280> when

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
speaking another language and when

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.270 
speaking another language and when
finally<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.780> help<00:01:49.110> them<00:01:49.290> out<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.159> get

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.920 
finally I help them out and we do get
the<00:01:50.399> helicopter<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:50.909> CG<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.509> guys<00:01:51.750> like

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
the helicopter and CG that guys like

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.929 
the helicopter and CG that guys like
dude<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.290> feels<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> totally<00:01:53.549> different

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
dude it feels like a totally different

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.730 
dude it feels like a totally different
helicopter<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.689> don't<00:01:55.259> have<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.530> input

with technology that do have fly bar
less<00:02:07.409> setup<00:02:07.799> artists<00:02:08.520> there<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.729> no<00:02:08.970> fly<00:02:09.479> bar

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
less setup artists there is no fly bar

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.710 
less setup artists there is no fly bar
to<00:02:10.020> lift<00:02:10.259> up<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:10.890> what<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.160> would<00:02:11.280> do<00:02:11.720> you

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
to lift up on so what you would do you

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.790 
to lift up on so what you would do you
grab<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.379> hell

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
grab the hell

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.930 
grab the hell
copter<00:02:14.040> by<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.250> blade<00:02:14.580> grips<00:02:14.850> like<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:16.940> you

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
copter by the blade grips like so you

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.420 
copter by the blade grips like so you
would<00:02:18.120> lift<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.540> up<00:02:18.660> horizontally<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:20.130> just

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
would lift it up horizontally and just

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.300 
would lift it up horizontally and just
let<00:02:20.640> go<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.270> nose<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.660> helicopter

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
let go of the nose of the helicopter

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.770 
let go of the nose of the helicopter
here<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.460> can<00:02:23.580> see<00:02:23.790> obviously<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.540> tell

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
here you can see obviously it is tell

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.570 
here you can see obviously it is tell
heavy<00:02:24.990> there<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.380> no<00:02:25.530> battery<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.070> there<00:02:26.220> so

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
heavy there is no battery in there so

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.030 
heavy there is no battery in there so
that's<00:02:26.790> what<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.660> would<00:02:27.810> see<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.530> what<00:02:28.920> I'd

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
that's what you would see and what I'd

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.470 
that's what you would see and what I'd
like<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.250> do<00:02:29.520> when<00:02:29.730> I'm<00:02:29.850> doing<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.210> on<00:02:30.300> my<00:02:30.450> own

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
like to do when I'm doing it on my own

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.530 
like to do when I'm doing it on my own
helicopters<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.500> like<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.770> take<00:02:31.980> out<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.250> gears

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
helicopters I like to take out the gears

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.200 
helicopters I like to take out the gears
just<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:33.690> there<00:02:33.960> is<00:02:34.080> no<00:02:34.850> so<00:02:35.850> there<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.090> no

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
just so there is no so there is no

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.880 
just so there is no so there is no
resistance<00:02:36.540> between<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.320> motor<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.860> motor

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
resistance between the motor the motor

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.000 
resistance between the motor the motor
pinion<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.030> actual<00:02:39.540> gear<00:02:39.750> itself<00:02:40.110> so

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
pinion and the actual gear itself so

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.260 
pinion and the actual gear itself so
it's<00:02:41.130> only<00:02:41.250> writing<00:02:41.580> down<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.940> bearings

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
it's only writing down the bearings

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.080 
it's only writing down the bearings
because<00:02:43.050> here<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.560> can<00:02:43.680> see<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.010> how<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.700> it

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
because here you can see it how it it

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.760 
because here you can see it how it it
finds<00:02:45.420> up<00:02:45.540> although<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:45.960> can<00:02:46.140> be<00:02:46.170> done<00:02:46.500> with

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
finds up although it can be done with

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.580 
finds up although it can be done with
the<00:02:46.890> gears<00:02:47.190> set<00:02:47.820> on<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.210> you<00:02:48.750> could<00:02:48.870> also<00:02:49.050> you

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
the gears set on and you could also you

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.320 
the gears set on and you could also you
could<00:02:49.710> also<00:02:49.800> use<00:02:50.160> that<00:02:50.370> way<00:02:50.550> for<00:02:51.210> the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
could also use that way for the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.280 
could also use that way for the
traditional<00:02:52.110> fly<00:02:52.560> bar<00:02:53.150> hold<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.330> let<00:02:54.870> go<00:02:55.080> and

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
traditional fly bar hold it let go and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.990 
traditional fly bar hold it let go and
it's<00:02:55.620> pretty<00:02:55.950> leveled<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.460> guys<00:02:56.610> can<00:02:56.790> see

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
it's pretty leveled you guys can see

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.080 
it's pretty leveled you guys can see
there<00:02:57.210> so<00:02:57.840> both<00:02:58.470> ways<00:02:58.710> can<00:02:59.460> be<00:02:59.610> used<00:02:59.880> on<00:03:00.030> both

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
there so both ways can be used on both

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.490 
there so both ways can be used on both
helicopters<00:03:00.810> by<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:00.990> grips

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
helicopters by the grips

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.010 
helicopters by the grips
although<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.610> grabbing<00:03:03.150> if<00:03:03.240> I<00:03:03.360> buy<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.720> fly

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
although the grabbing if I buy the fly

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.870 
although the grabbing if I buy the fly
bar<00:03:04.200> can<00:03:04.380> only<00:03:04.500> be<00:03:04.860> used<00:03:05.100> on<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.370> fly<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.730> our

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
bar can only be used on the fly of our

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.310 
bar can only be used on the fly of our
helicopters<00:03:06.450> since<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.780> fly<00:03:06.960> rod<00:03:07.110> list

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
helicopters since the fly rod list

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.410 
helicopters since the fly rod list
doesn't<00:03:07.530> have<00:03:07.800> one<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.460> hope<00:03:09.150> these<00:03:09.360> are

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
doesn't have one so I hope these are

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.600 
doesn't have one so I hope these are

notice<00:03:13.740> your<00:03:14.040> helicopters<00:03:14.550> fly<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.730> lot<00:03:14.970> better

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
notice your helicopters fly a lot better

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.900 
notice your helicopters fly a lot better
you<00:03:16.260> will<00:03:16.470> probably<00:03:16.770> not<00:03:17.100> use<00:03:17.160> too<00:03:17.520> they're

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
you will probably not use too they're

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.640 
you will probably not use too they're
not<00:03:18.120> need<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.450> use<00:03:18.600> any<00:03:18.630> correction<00:03:19.350> let's<00:03:19.560> say

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
not need to use any correction let's say
