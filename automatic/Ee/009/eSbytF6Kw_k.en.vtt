then<00:01:58.759> I<00:01:58.789> make<00:01:59.030> a<00:01:59.060> huge<00:01:59.479> mistake<00:01:59.659> there<00:02:00.590> is

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
then I make a huge mistake there is

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.679 
then I make a huge mistake there is
basically<00:02:01.100> no<00:02:01.340> way<00:02:01.549> to<00:02:01.609> run<00:02:01.850> from<00:02:02.060> Chaika<00:02:02.420> with

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.359 
basically no way to run from Chaika with
lizard<00:02:03.049> so<00:02:03.469> I<00:02:03.499> should<00:02:03.799> have<00:02:03.829> stayed<00:02:04.130> and
