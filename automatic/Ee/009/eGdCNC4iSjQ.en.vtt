it
well<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> crackers<00:01:22.860> might<00:01:23.130> lead<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.400> today

well the crackers might lead you today
thank<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.240> did<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> carbs<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.140> didn't

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
thank you I did the carbs I didn't

thank you I did the carbs I didn't
consider<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.770> lose<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.310> crackers<00:01:26.610> eat<00:01:26.729> more

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
consider that lose the crackers eat more

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.429 
consider that lose the crackers eat more
cheese<00:01:27.030> put<00:01:27.450> cheese<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.750> cheese<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.320> need

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
cheese put cheese on cheese and I need

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.560 
cheese put cheese on cheese and I need
that<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> results<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.329> because

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
that I like the results of this because

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.690 
that I like the results of this because
they<00:01:30.689> do<00:01:30.750> enjoy<00:01:31.140> cheese<00:01:31.530> not<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:31.979> much<00:01:32.130> as<00:01:32.280> most

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
they do enjoy cheese not as much as most

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.100 
they do enjoy cheese not as much as most
Americans<00:01:33.240> perhaps<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.689> like<00:01:33.840> putting<00:01:33.990> on

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
Americans perhaps so I like putting on

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.929 
Americans perhaps so I like putting on
my<00:01:34.259> omelets<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.740> stuff<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.130> at<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
my omelets and stuff like that at the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.260 
my omelets and stuff like that at the
same<00:01:36.150> time<00:01:36.390> though<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.920> I<00:01:37.920> doubt<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.850> ability

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
same time though I I doubt the ability

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.749 
same time though I I doubt the ability
of<00:01:39.390> these<00:01:39.540> researchers<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.500> tease<00:01:40.890> out<00:01:41.280> the

16<00:01:46.950> years<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.700> Riley<00:01:48.030> I've<00:01:48.240> read<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> lot

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
16 years I like to Riley I've read a lot

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.020 
16 years I like to Riley I've read a lot
of<00:01:48.689> books<00:01:48.990> actually<00:01:49.439> about<00:01:49.710> diet<00:01:50.430> studies<00:01:50.850> I'm

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
of books actually about diet studies I'm

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.609 
of books actually about diet studies I'm
really<00:01:51.240> interested<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.930> have<00:01:52.079> some<00:01:52.350> I

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
really interested in it I have some I

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.800 
really interested in it I have some I
don't<00:01:53.130> believe<00:01:53.610> some<00:01:53.820> things<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.270> aren't

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
don't believe some things that aren't

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.090 
don't believe some things that aren't
even<00:01:54.930> supported<00:01:55.439> by<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.860> don't

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
even supported by this like I don't

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.350 
even supported by this like I don't
personally<00:01:56.610> think<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.790> read<00:01:57.000> me<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.240> all

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
personally think that read me is all

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.310 
personally think that read me is all
that<00:01:57.479> bad<00:01:57.600> for<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.810> actually<00:01:57.960> from<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
that bad for you actually from the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.289 
that bad for you actually from the
reader<00:01:58.469> from<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.829> research<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.100> I've<00:01:59.250> done

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
reader from the research that I've done

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.429 
reader from the research that I've done
but<00:02:00.299> when<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.540> comes<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.840> cheese<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:01.229> they're

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
but when it comes to cheese like they're

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.230 
but when it comes to cheese like they're
relying<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:01.979> people<00:02:02.310> reporting<00:02:02.880> what<00:02:03.119> they

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
relying on people reporting what they

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.060 
relying on people reporting what they
eat<00:02:03.479> over<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.840> course<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.200> literally<00:02:04.680> years

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
eat over the course of literally years

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.520 
eat over the course of literally years
and<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:06.329> know<00:02:06.479> compared<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.079> all<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> other

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
and so to know compared to all the other

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.690 
and so to know compared to all the other
different<00:02:07.890> things<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.160> influence<00:02:08.580> your

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
different things that influence your

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.850 
different things that influence your
diet<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.179> one<00:02:09.450> bit<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.020> cheese<00:02:10.379> versus

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
diet that one bit of cheese versus

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.589 
diet that one bit of cheese versus
another<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.370> don't<00:02:12.090> know<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.209> just<00:02:12.239> doesn't

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
another I don't know it just doesn't

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.880 
another I don't know it just doesn't
make<00:02:12.660> sense<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.959> me<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.080> think<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.379> cheese<00:02:13.620> is

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
make sense to me I think that cheese is

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.530 
make sense to me I think that cheese is
good<00:02:14.010> for<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.730> largely<00:02:15.150> think<00:02:15.450> that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
good for you and so I largely think that

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.600 
good for you and so I largely think that
this<00:02:15.690> supports<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.620> position<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:17.220> just<00:02:17.430> don't

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
this supports that position I just don't

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.699 
this supports that position I just don't
know<00:02:17.819> how<00:02:18.540> much<00:02:18.810> over<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.140> course<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.440> 16

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
know how much over the course of 16

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.949 
know how much over the course of 16
years<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.520> can<00:02:20.670> tell<00:02:20.940> one<00:02:21.209> food<00:02:21.540> from<00:02:21.750> another

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
years you can tell one food from another

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.930 
years you can tell one food from another
how<00:02:22.260> much<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.590> an<00:02:22.650> effect<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:22.980> has<00:02:23.130> buzzkill

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
how much of an effect it has buzzkill

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.199 
how much of an effect it has buzzkill
yeah<00:02:24.540> no<00:02:24.750> I'm<00:02:24.930> glad<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:26.640> made<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.030> made<00:02:27.180> a

yeah no I'm glad you made you made a
really<00:02:27.420> good<00:02:27.540> point<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.140> I'm<00:02:28.350> glad<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.800> you

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
really good point and I'm glad that you

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.440 
really good point and I'm glad that you
you<00:02:29.400> know<00:02:29.640> put<00:02:29.819> into<00:02:30.030> question<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
you know put into question the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.150 
you know put into question the
methodology<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.230> study<00:02:31.320> because<00:02:31.770> it<00:02:32.010> does

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
methodology of the study because it does

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.610 
methodology of the study because it does
have<00:02:32.310> its<00:02:32.490> flaws<00:02:32.550> but<00:02:33.450> nonetheless<00:02:33.630> they<00:02:34.440> say

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
have its flaws but nonetheless they say

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.290 
have its flaws but nonetheless they say
cheese<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:35.010> good<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.400> eat<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.610> cheese<00:02:35.910> uh-huh

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
cheese is good so eat the cheese uh-huh

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.430 
cheese is good so eat the cheese uh-huh
there's<00:02:36.570> nothing<00:02:36.840> wrong<00:02:36.959> with<00:02:37.140> that

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
there's nothing wrong with that

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.050 
there's nothing wrong with that
remember<00:02:37.740> we<00:02:37.890> recently<00:02:38.100> did<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.520> study<00:02:38.760> about

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
remember we recently did a study about

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.540 
remember we recently did a study about
this<00:02:39.930> ridiculous<00:02:40.380> correlation<00:02:41.190> which

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
this ridiculous correlation which

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.270 
this ridiculous correlation which
doesn't<00:02:41.910> mean<00:02:42.540> anything<00:02:43.290> but<00:02:43.830> the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
doesn't mean anything but the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.740 
doesn't mean anything but the
researchers<00:02:44.880> found<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:45.209> correlation

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
researchers found this correlation

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.479 
researchers found this correlation
between<00:02:45.900> people<00:02:46.380> who<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:46.890> eat<00:02:47.070> grilled

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
between people who like to eat grilled

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.490 
between people who like to eat grilled
cheese<00:02:47.820> and<00:02:48.300> people<00:02:48.720> who<00:02:48.840> like<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.020> have<00:02:49.170> sex

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
cheese and people who like to have sex

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.900 
cheese and people who like to have sex
so<00:02:49.709> if<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:49.920> love<00:02:50.130> grilled<00:02:50.430> cheese<00:02:50.640> you're

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
so if you love grilled cheese you're

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.090 
so if you love grilled cheese you're
more<00:02:51.120> likely<00:02:51.330> to<00:02:51.540> be<00:02:51.750> like<00:02:51.989> sexually<00:02:52.950> active

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
more likely to be like sexually active

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.020 
more likely to be like sexually active

cheese<00:03:10.590> or<00:03:10.920> cheese<00:03:11.100> yes<00:03:11.519> maybe<00:03:11.760> it's<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.150> more

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
cheese or cheese yes maybe it's a more

cheese or cheese yes maybe it's a more
direct<00:03:12.570> link<00:03:12.930> like<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.560> person<00:03:13.980> who<00:03:14.100> eats<00:03:14.340> a

it's nice to just smell like cheddar

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.170 
it's nice to just smell like cheddar
sometimes<00:03:31.250> sometimes<00:03:32.250> when<00:03:32.459> I<00:03:32.489> give<00:03:32.790> one<00:03:33.000> to

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
sometimes sometimes when I give one to

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.470 
sometimes sometimes when I give one to
my<00:03:33.329> dog<00:03:33.570> I'm<00:03:33.959> like<00:03:34.110> that<00:03:34.530> smells<00:03:34.769> good<00:03:34.980> and

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.819 
my dog I'm like that smells good and
sometimes<00:03:36.480> Milk<00:03:37.049> Bone<00:03:37.170> will<00:03:37.410> smell<00:03:37.620> like<00:03:37.680> a

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
sometimes Milk Bone will smell like a

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.280 
sometimes Milk Bone will smell like a
pop-tart<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.820> think<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.720> know<00:03:39.840> no<00:03:40.079> one's

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
pop-tart and I think you know no one's

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.830 
pop-tart and I think you know no one's
actually<00:03:40.560> watching<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:42.120> maybe<00:03:42.390> I'll<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.660> want

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
actually watching so maybe I'll you want

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.080 
actually watching so maybe I'll you want
umm<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:43.829> I<00:03:43.860> know<00:03:43.950> that<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.610> were<00:03:44.760> saying

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
umm so I know that you were saying

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.630 
umm so I know that you were saying
earlier<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.410> hardcore<00:03:47.100> paleo

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
earlier that the the hardcore paleo

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.910 
earlier that the the hardcore paleo
people<00:03:47.970> should<00:03:48.630> perhaps<00:03:48.780> question<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.590> part

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
people should perhaps question that part

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.590 
people should perhaps question that part
like<00:03:50.220> that's<00:03:50.430> one<00:03:50.640> part<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.150> Paleo<00:03:51.390> diet

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
like that's one part of the Paleo diet

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.660 
like that's one part of the Paleo diet
is<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:51.810> they<00:03:52.049> do<00:03:52.110> they<00:03:53.010> think<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.340> dairy

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
is that they do they think that dairy

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.310 
is that they do they think that dairy
and<00:03:53.940> cheese<00:03:54.000> products<00:03:54.660> are<00:03:54.810> bad<00:03:54.989> for<00:03:55.200> you

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
and cheese products are bad for you

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.319 
and cheese products are bad for you
overall<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:55.980> maybe<00:03:56.190> they<00:03:56.340> can<00:03:56.400> ease<00:03:56.820> up<00:03:56.850> a<00:03:57.150> bit

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
overall so maybe they can ease up a bit

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.569 
overall so maybe they can ease up a bit
on<00:03:57.360> that<00:03:57.750> they<00:03:58.110> can<00:03:58.410> ease<00:03:58.590> up<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:58.980> bit<00:03:59.220> on<00:03:59.250> that

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
on that they can ease up a bit on that

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.970 
on that they can ease up a bit on that
so<00:03:59.850> paleo<00:04:00.570> people<00:04:00.780> are<00:04:01.019> gonna<00:04:01.140> email<00:04:01.530> me<00:04:01.709> and

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
so paleo people are gonna email me and

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.310 
so paleo people are gonna email me and
I'm<00:04:02.100> gonna<00:04:02.250> get<00:04:02.459> annoyed<00:04:02.670> with<00:04:02.910> them<00:04:03.090> but<00:04:03.870> tell

they<00:04:06.930> studied<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.500> didn't<00:04:07.950> conduct<00:04:08.220> I<00:04:08.459> do<00:04:08.640> not

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
they studied and didn't conduct I do not

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.910 
they studied and didn't conduct I do not
conduct<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.299> studies<00:04:09.660> but<00:04:09.810> here's<00:04:10.049> let's

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
conduct the studies but here's let's

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.740 
conduct the studies but here's let's
take<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.250> dairy<00:04:11.489> component<00:04:12.390> out<00:04:12.480> of<00:04:12.630> this

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
take the dairy component out of this

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.780 
take the dairy component out of this
story<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.320> just<00:04:13.530> focus<00:04:13.890> on<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.160> Paleo<00:04:14.370> diet

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
story and just focus on the Paleo diet

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.180

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.850 
people are gonna disagree with me but
look<00:04:54.600> I<00:04:54.750> think<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:54.990> best<00:04:55.169> diet<00:04:55.440> is<00:04:55.680> something

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
look I think the best diet is something

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.770 
look I think the best diet is something
that<00:04:56.190> you<00:04:56.250> can<00:04:56.430> actually<00:04:56.610> stick<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.300> that<00:04:57.510> is

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
that you can actually stick to that is

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.110 
that you can actually stick to that is
nutritious<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:58.889> so<00:04:59.100> once<00:04:59.460> you<00:04:59.610> start<00:04:59.850> saying

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
nutritious and so once you start saying

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.000 
nutritious and so once you start saying
I'm<00:05:00.480> never<00:05:00.780> gonna<00:05:01.020> eat<00:05:01.080> dairy<00:05:01.440> again<00:05:01.650> I'm

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.980

starting to see in studies like this and
articles<00:05:12.000> like<00:05:12.180> this<00:05:12.330> about<00:05:12.510> the<00:05:12.660> studies

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
articles like this about the studies

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.020 
articles like this about the studies
that<00:05:13.500> they<00:05:13.620> acknowledge<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:14.490> effect<00:05:14.850> of

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
that they acknowledge the effect of

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.940 
that they acknowledge the effect of
increased<00:05:15.630> carbs<00:05:16.050> basically<00:05:16.590> they're

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
increased carbs basically they're

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.440 
increased carbs basically they're

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
possible and they're starting to

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.390 
possible and they're starting to
integrate<00:05:20.940> newer<00:05:21.720> research<00:05:22.229> into<00:05:22.590> carbs<00:05:22.890> that

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400

I<00:05:23.460> enjoy<00:05:23.729> we're<00:05:24.000> finally<00:05:24.540> starting<00:05:24.600> to<00:05:24.990> shift

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
I enjoy we're finally starting to shift

I enjoy we're finally starting to shift
away<00:05:25.440> from<00:05:25.590> like<00:05:26.160> the<00:05:26.400> butter<00:05:26.700> demonization

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
away from like the butter demonization

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.440 
away from like the butter demonization
which<00:05:28.650> is<00:05:28.770> also<00:05:29.040> good<00:05:29.220> weight<00:05:29.669> water<00:05:30.060> well<00:05:30.300> the

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
which is also good weight water well the

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.760 
which is also good weight water well the
thing<00:05:30.600> is<00:05:30.630> like<00:05:30.930> of<00:05:31.080> course<00:05:31.139> butter<00:05:31.620> in

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
moderation is fine and remember we went

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.230 
moderation is fine and remember we went
from<00:05:34.560> butter<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:35.220> margarine<00:05:35.790> margarine<00:05:35.970> is

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
from butter to margarine margarine is

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.760 
from butter to margarine margarine is
actually<00:05:36.600> more<00:05:37.050> harmful<00:05:37.530> to<00:05:37.650> your<00:05:37.710> health

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
actually more harmful to your health

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.190 
actually more harmful to your health
than<00:05:38.010> butter<00:05:38.340> is<00:05:38.550> and<00:05:39.090> so<00:05:39.300> we've<00:05:39.510> we've<00:05:39.840> gotten

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
than butter is and so we've we've gotten

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.780 
than butter is and so we've we've gotten
a<00:05:40.260> lot<00:05:40.410> smarter<00:05:40.710> when<00:05:40.979> it<00:05:41.070> comes<00:05:41.250> to<00:05:41.430> that<00:05:41.550> so

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
a lot smarter when it comes to that so

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.850 
a lot smarter when it comes to that so
anyway<00:05:42.120> I<00:05:42.419> love<00:05:42.900> these<00:05:43.110> studies<00:05:43.440> I'm<00:05:43.650> into

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
anyway I love these studies I'm into

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.500 
anyway I love these studies I'm into
health<00:05:44.010> and<00:05:44.130> fitness<00:05:44.220> so<00:05:44.820> it<00:05:45.090> made<00:05:45.240> me<00:05:45.360> feel

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
as harmful as I think it is but it is

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.469 
as harmful as I think it is but it is
