since<00:03:29.530> I<00:03:29.980> mixed<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.910> couple<00:03:31.420> of<00:03:31.510> different

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
since I mixed a couple of different

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.620

effect that I got on the Apple up here

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.050 
effect that I got on the Apple up here
so<00:03:37.510> I<00:03:37.840> didn't<00:03:38.170> really<00:03:38.560> want<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:39.070> go<00:03:39.700> for<00:03:39.910> that

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
so I didn't really want to go for that

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.020 
so I didn't really want to go for that
crisp<00:03:40.450> from<00:03:41.290> red<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.590> white<00:03:41.890> so<00:03:42.549> I<00:03:42.580> wanted<00:03:42.970> to

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
crisp from red to white so I wanted to

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.330

got right there with that and also with
the<00:03:47.799> leaf<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:49.420> then<00:03:49.900> on<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.170> inside<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:50.650> my

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
the leaf and then on the inside of my

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.220 
the leaf and then on the inside of my
card<00:03:50.830> I<00:03:51.519> went<00:03:52.120> ahead<00:03:52.180> and<00:03:52.330> I<00:03:52.510> matted<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:53.019> with

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
card I went ahead and I matted it with

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.890 
card I went ahead and I matted it with
some<00:03:53.500> white<00:03:53.769> cardstock<00:03:54.130> and<00:03:54.790> then<00:03:55.660> I<00:03:55.750> went

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
some white cardstock and then I went

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.020 
some white cardstock and then I went
ahead<00:03:55.959> and<00:03:56.080> I<00:03:56.230> stamped<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.739> pencil<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:57.430> again

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
ahead and I stamped the pencil and again

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.020 
ahead and I stamped the pencil and again
I<00:03:58.060> use<00:03:58.299> my<00:03:58.330> Copic<00:03:58.840> markers<00:03:59.200> and<00:03:59.470> then<00:03:59.739> I<00:04:00.070> used<00:04:00.700> a

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
I use my Copic markers and then I used a

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.610 
I use my Copic markers and then I used a
tumble<00:04:01.870> marker<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:03.720> accent<00:04:04.720> certain<00:04:05.170> areas

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
tumble marker to accent certain areas

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.750 
tumble marker to accent certain areas
but<00:04:05.890> mainly<00:04:06.370> it's<00:04:06.700> all<00:04:06.910> Copic<00:04:07.450> markers<00:04:08.760> right

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
but mainly it's all Copic markers right

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.120 
but mainly it's all Copic markers right
in<00:04:09.970> there<00:04:10.180> so<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:11.049> created<00:04:11.410> this<00:04:11.590> sweet<00:04:11.920> and

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
in there so I created this sweet and

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.850 
in there so I created this sweet and
simple<00:04:12.430> card<00:04:12.970> but<00:04:13.570> it's<00:04:13.840> really<00:04:14.440> going<00:04:14.769> to

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
simple card but it's really going to

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.250 
simple card but it's really going to
make<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.130> statement<00:04:15.489> when<00:04:15.880> I<00:04:15.910> give<00:04:16.120> it<00:04:16.150> to<00:04:16.260> when
