by<00:00:52.490> jeffing<00:00:53.000> gap<00:00:53.380> here<00:00:54.380> we<00:00:54.530> have<00:00:54.740> a<00:00:54.980> croissant

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
by jeffing gap here we have a croissant

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.330 
by jeffing gap here we have a croissant
that<00:00:55.760> was<00:00:55.940> preserved<00:00:56.410> with<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.650> gas<00:00:57.800> function

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
that was preserved with the gas function

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.730 
that was preserved with the gas function
and<00:00:58.610> here<00:00:59.390> we<00:00:59.540> have<00:00:59.690> ones<00:00:59.960> that<00:01:00.170> did<00:01:00.410> not<00:01:00.530> use

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:00.740 
and here we have ones that did not use

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.230 
and here we have ones that did not use
the<00:01:00.950> gas<00:01:01.100> function<00:01:03.550> so<00:01:04.550> here<00:01:04.580> we<00:01:04.970> have<00:01:05.120> an

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
the gas function so here we have an

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.350 
the gas function so here we have an
example<00:01:05.600> of<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.230> sensor<00:01:06.560> controlled<00:01:06.980> machine

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360

let's<00:01:08.360> take<00:01:08.570> a<00:01:08.600> pastry<00:01:09.080> like<00:01:09.440> a<00:01:09.470> croissant

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.770 

okay<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:15.530> we<00:01:15.740> set<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.610> program<00:01:16.820> number<00:01:17.360> two

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
okay so we set the program number two

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.370 
okay so we set the program number two
and<00:01:18.640> our<00:01:19.640> vacuum<00:01:19.910> person<00:01:20.479> I<00:01:20.540> did<00:01:20.780> we<00:01:21.050> will<00:01:21.170> set

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
and our vacuum person I did we will set

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.050 
and our vacuum person I did we will set
it<00:01:21.410> to<00:01:21.530> 99%<00:01:22.510> and<00:01:23.830> just<00:01:24.830> some<00:01:25.070> extra<00:01:25.580> vacuum

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
it to 99% and just some extra vacuum

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.730 
it to 99% and just some extra vacuum
time<00:01:26.330> of<00:01:26.570> one<00:01:26.750> second<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:29.150> gas<00:01:29.360> if<00:01:30.290> we<00:01:30.470> change

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
time of one second the gas if we change

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.870 
time of one second the gas if we change
it<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:31.430> 75%<00:01:32.530> that<00:01:33.530> means<00:01:33.740> there<00:01:34.070> will<00:01:34.130> be<00:01:34.190> 24

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
it to 75% that means there will be 24

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.999 
it to 75% that means there will be 24
percent<00:01:35.330> of<00:01:35.660> gasps<00:01:36.229> sighs<00:01:38.140> gasps<00:01:39.140> upon<00:01:42.009> stop

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
percent of gasps sighs gasps upon stop

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.780 
percent of gasps sighs gasps upon stop
time<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.460> three<00:01:43.670> seconds<00:01:44.950> soft<00:01:45.950> air<00:01:46.280> of<00:01:46.520> two

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
time of three seconds soft air of two

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:58.679 
time of three seconds soft air of two
seconds<00:01:47.500> here<00:01:48.500> we<00:01:48.530> go

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:05.609 

there<00:01:59.689> we<00:01:59.780> have<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:00.049> our<00:02:00.320> pastry<00:02:01.159> is<00:02:01.340> preserved

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.650 

here<00:02:06.619> really<00:02:06.830> use<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.399> semi<00:02:07.640> time<00:02:08.179> control

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
here really use the semi time control

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:21.360 
here really use the semi time control
machine<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.500> still<00:02:10.280> two<00:02:10.399> oranges

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.760 

okay<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:23.000> we<00:02:23.150> have<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:23.420> set<00:02:23.660> at<00:02:23.840> 30<00:02:24.200> seconds

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
okay so we have it set at 30 seconds

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.680 
okay so we have it set at 30 seconds
which<00:02:24.950> is<00:02:25.099> sufficient<00:02:25.670> but<00:02:25.880> where<00:02:26.060> is<00:02:26.209> this

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.740 

steel<00:02:29.690> time<00:02:29.900> is<00:02:30.080> 3.5<00:02:30.830> seconds<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:32.270> we'll<00:02:32.569> turn

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
steel time is 3.5 seconds and we'll turn

00:02:32.750 --> 00:03:04.020 
steel time is 3.5 seconds and we'll turn
the<00:02:32.870> air<00:02:33.050> function<00:02:33.530> on<00:02:33.910> step

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.490 

solving<00:03:05.030> some<00:03:05.180> exacting<00:03:05.660> machine<00:03:06.019> you<00:03:06.349> can

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
solving some exacting machine you can

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.470 
solving some exacting machine you can
use<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.800> vacuform<00:03:07.099> function<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:08.150> hook<00:03:08.330> up

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
use the vacuform function and hook up

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.880 
use the vacuform function and hook up
this<00:03:08.660> container<00:03:09.019> here<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:11.720> preserve<00:03:11.900> sauces
