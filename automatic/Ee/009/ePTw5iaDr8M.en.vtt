there are several ways that you can
actually<00:01:55.620> edit<00:01:56.620> this<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:58.240> I<00:01:58.360> said<00:01:58.420> guys<00:01:58.810> I

actually edit this like I said guys I

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.570 
actually edit this like I said guys I
mean<00:01:59.050> this<00:01:59.170> is<00:01:59.320> a<00:01:59.350> pretty<00:01:59.710> new<00:01:59.980> city<00:02:00.250> of<00:02:00.370> tweak

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
mean this is a pretty new city of tweak

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.650 
mean this is a pretty new city of tweak
there's<00:02:00.760> not<00:02:00.850> gonna<00:02:00.940> be<00:02:01.030> that<00:02:01.120> many<00:02:01.300> features

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
there's not gonna be that many features

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.060 
there's not gonna be that many features
yet<00:02:01.960> but<00:02:02.290> it's<00:02:02.410> definitely<00:02:02.650> worth<00:02:03.040> checking

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
yet but it's definitely worth checking

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.710 
yet but it's definitely worth checking
out<00:02:03.520> especially<00:02:03.790> if<00:02:04.120> you<00:02:04.210> can<00:02:04.360> get<00:02:04.480> it<00:02:04.570> for

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
out especially if you can get it for

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.630 
out especially if you can get it for
free<00:02:04.780> I<00:02:04.990> wouldn't<00:02:05.620> recommend<00:02:05.920> paying<00:02:06.250> for<00:02:06.580> it

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
free I wouldn't recommend paying for it

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.359 
free I wouldn't recommend paying for it
since<00:02:06.730> it<00:02:06.910> does<00:02:07.060> only<00:02:07.210> come<00:02:07.480> with<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.690> HTC

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
since it does only come with the HTC

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.280 
since it does only come with the HTC
theme<00:02:09.369> but<00:02:10.060> there<00:02:10.269> are<00:02:10.479> definitely<00:02:10.840> going<00:02:11.200> to

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
theme but there are definitely going to

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.839 
theme but there are definitely going to
make<00:02:11.379> some<00:02:11.560> more<00:02:11.650> things<00:02:11.890> for<00:02:12.069> this<00:02:12.219> and<00:02:12.489> I

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
make some more things for this and I

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.089 
make some more things for this and I
will<00:02:12.909> definitely<00:02:13.120> check<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.450> out<00:02:13.859> to<00:02:14.859> edit

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
two ways you can actually do this you

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.809 
two ways you can actually do this you
can<00:02:48.060> XL<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.600> application<00:02:49.549> wait<00:02:50.549> for<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.730> to

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
can XL the application wait for it to

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.130 
can XL the application wait for it to
load<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.269> then<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.569> will<00:02:51.690> show<00:02:51.870> up<00:02:51.900> right

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140
