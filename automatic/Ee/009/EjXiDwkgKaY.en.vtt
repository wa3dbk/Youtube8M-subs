 according to the new console xbox live 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.469
 good oberto record where I'm going to show 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.640
 how to use your old hard drive 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.849
 I formed with soderling 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.849
 the first thing we are a screwdriver point to another 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.390

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.700

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.450
 just press here 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.100

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.830

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.070
 ventilation 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.970
