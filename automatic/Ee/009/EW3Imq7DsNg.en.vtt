 a stick

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.100

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.540
 end of this video a photo with the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.119
 civilizations so you can see the 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.500
 a little more in detail what has 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.500
 gone to each one of us 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:13.870
 and also said and rational I have not said 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.890
 a good professional 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.890
 you already have to point 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.310
 they pay you for this as a great 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.110
 professional 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.620
 as a professional 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:43.810
 to the performance 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.150
 is that for this base very easy and close 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.350
 of others there is behind the camera in the 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:02.450
 site 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:04.340
 It's done 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.160
 after hanging from a strike of these that 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.400
 stretches after recording the sound but the 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.400
 video 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.599
 this is for a hobby it's not for money 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.530
 it's fine if verdasco and lopez in this 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:32.300
 case propose things look 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.300
 and from here to here 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.690
 here you can follow the camera 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.430
 to which a diagonal has been issued 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:53.310
 It has also been totally 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:57.000
 the brother and what we can do is 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.060
 put the cards a bit towards 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.060
 above 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.560
 here we do not care 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:15.680
 and it's going to be hard to get to the cards 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.900
 chips here and more rights if 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.530
 then move because it is devoid of 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.530
 things and we put them 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.870
 now that we live as an anxiety that 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.800
 It's enough 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.800
 activities 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.510
 the pp 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.510
 let's start the game
