00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
from a smaller end and flares out to a

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.290 
from a smaller end and flares out to a
bigger<00:00:53.250> end<00:00:53.550> kind<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.539> butterfly<00:00:55.079> wing

this<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.480> kind<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.750> odd<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.469> scent<00:00:58.770> of

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
this is kind of odd but the scent of

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.950 
this is kind of odd but the scent of
this<00:00:59.070> mascara<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.609> very<00:01:00.090> strong<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:00.870> you

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
this mascara is very strong so if you

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.760 
this mascara is very strong so if you
don't<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.320> that

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
don't like that

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.770 
don't like that
then<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.190> wouldn't<00:01:02.460> recommend<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.359> again

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
then I wouldn't recommend this but again

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.570 
then I wouldn't recommend this but again
it's<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.439> smaller<00:01:04.710> mascara<00:01:05.220> you're<00:01:05.430> not

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
it's just the smaller mascara you're not

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.850 
it's just the smaller mascara you're not
going<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.060> smelling<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.689> all<00:01:06.810> day<00:01:06.990> but<00:01:07.590> just

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
going to be smelling it all day but just

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.469 
going to be smelling it all day but just
wanted<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> throw<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.490> there<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.299> have

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
wanted to throw that in there so I have

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.330 
wanted to throw that in there so I have
no<00:01:09.630> shadows<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.200> or<00:01:10.350> anything<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.159> have

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
no shadows on or anything I just have

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.240 
no shadows on or anything I just have
the<00:01:11.640> NYX<00:01:11.939> matte<00:01:12.180> black<00:01:12.510> liner<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.290> use<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.070> to

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the NYX matte black liner I use that to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.060 
the NYX matte black liner I use that to
tightline<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.939> then<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.439> benefit<00:01:16.890> I

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
tightline and then I have the benefit I

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.219 
tightline and then I have the benefit I
brighten<00:01:17.369> my<00:01:17.520> waterline<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.390> first<00:01:19.020> I'm<00:01:19.170> just

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
brighten my waterline so first I'm just

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:30.240 
brighten my waterline so first I'm just
going<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> curl<00:01:19.890> my<00:01:19.920> lashes

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.650 

so<00:01:30.850> I'm<00:01:30.910> just<00:01:31.030> going<00:01:31.150> to<00:01:31.270> get<00:01:31.360> right<00:01:31.540> into

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
so I'm just going to get right into

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.710 
so I'm just going to get right into
applying<00:01:32.080> it

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.100 

so<00:01:39.170> far<00:01:39.410> I<00:01:39.440> really<00:01:39.860> like<00:01:39.980> it<00:01:40.370> it's<00:01:40.610> definitely

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
so far I really like it it's definitely

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.060 
so far I really like it it's definitely
separating<00:01:42.110> my<00:01:42.230> lashes<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:42.800> it's<00:01:42.920> not

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
separating my lashes and it's not

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.270 
separating my lashes and it's not
clumping<00:01:43.960> it's<00:01:44.960> definitely<00:01:45.410> giving<00:01:45.680> a<00:01:45.800> lot<00:01:46.070> of

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
clumping it's definitely giving a lot of

00:01:46.280 --> 00:02:07.750 
clumping it's definitely giving a lot of
volume<00:01:46.550> and<00:01:47.060> coding<00:01:47.420> each<00:01:47.600> lash

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.719 

I<00:02:07.820> like<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.570> turn<00:02:08.750> my<00:02:08.900> brush<00:02:09.140> kind<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.500> vertical

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
I like to turn my brush kind of vertical

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:23.600 
I like to turn my brush kind of vertical
just<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.880> get<00:02:11.060> in<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.510> inner<00:02:12.260> corner<00:02:12.740> there

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.700 

so<00:02:24.210> that's<00:02:24.360> what<00:02:24.510> my<00:02:24.630> upper<00:02:24.960> lashes<00:02:25.200> look<00:02:25.530> like

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
so that's what my upper lashes look like

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.680 
so that's what my upper lashes look like
with<00:02:25.890> one<00:02:26.070> coat<00:02:26.250> I'm<00:02:26.490> gonna<00:02:26.700> go<00:02:26.850> ahead<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.360> do

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
with one coat I'm gonna go ahead and do

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.310 
with one coat I'm gonna go ahead and do
my<00:02:27.720> lower<00:02:28.080> lashes<00:02:32.420> it's<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.480> little<00:02:33.780> harder<00:02:34.140> to

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
my lower lashes it's a little harder to

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.930 
my lower lashes it's a little harder to
get<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.500> your<00:02:34.710> lower<00:02:34.920> lashes<00:02:35.280> because<00:02:35.640> this

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
get to your lower lashes because this

00:02:35.940 --> 00:03:06.790 
get to your lower lashes because this
brush<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.420> kind<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.810> big<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.830> bulky

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.920 

it's<00:03:07.340> definitely<00:03:07.520> lengthens<00:03:08.420> your<00:03:08.720> lower

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
it's definitely lengthens your lower

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.290 
it's definitely lengthens your lower
lashes<00:03:09.230> as<00:03:09.470> well<00:03:09.590> but<00:03:10.580> I<00:03:10.640> feel<00:03:10.850> like<00:03:10.940> it's<00:03:11.180> a

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
lashes as well but I feel like it's a

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.150 
lashes as well but I feel like it's a
little<00:03:11.570> bit<00:03:11.780> harder<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.170> get<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.590> lashes<00:03:12.980> down

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
little bit harder to get the lashes down

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:39.290 
little bit harder to get the lashes down
there

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.210 

so<00:03:39.870> here<00:03:40.050> are<00:03:40.110> my<00:03:40.170> lashes<00:03:40.440> with<00:03:40.620> one<00:03:40.980> coat<00:03:41.190> of

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
so here are my lashes with one coat of

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.770 
so here are my lashes with one coat of
mascara<00:03:41.430> I'm<00:03:41.850> gonna<00:03:42.030> go<00:03:42.180> ahead<00:03:42.360> and<00:03:42.480> do<00:03:42.750> a

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
mascara I'm gonna go ahead and do a

00:03:42.780 --> 00:04:01.690 
mascara I'm gonna go ahead and do a
second<00:03:43.260> on<00:03:43.380> both<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.770> top<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.190> bottom<00:03:44.250> lashes

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.130 

I<00:04:01.819> definitely<00:04:02.180> feel<00:04:02.540> like<00:04:02.599> if<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:03.020> add

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
I definitely feel like if you add

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.140 
I definitely feel like if you add
another<00:04:03.440> layer<00:04:03.800> doesn't<00:04:04.310> get<00:04:04.400> all<00:04:04.550> clumpy<00:04:05.030> and

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
another layer doesn't get all clumpy and

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.800 
another layer doesn't get all clumpy and
nasty

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
nasty

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:42.100 
nasty
it<00:04:06.170> definitely<00:04:06.349> lengthens<00:04:06.950> them<00:04:07.190> even<00:04:07.610> more

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.950

eyelashes still have a lot of volume but
there<00:04:58.520> is<00:04:58.639> a<00:04:58.669> ton<00:04:59.060> of<00:04:59.090> flaking<00:04:59.479> like<00:04:59.900> those

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.290 
little black flecks all over my face and
underneath<00:05:03.080> my<00:05:03.199> eyes<00:05:03.469> which<00:05:03.860> is<00:05:04.159> a<00:05:04.430> downside<00:05:04.729> I

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
underneath my eyes which is a downside I

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.520 
underneath my eyes which is a downside I
would<00:05:05.569> say<00:05:05.719> that<00:05:05.840> this<00:05:05.960> mascara<00:05:06.409> is

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
would say that this mascara is

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.290 
would say that this mascara is
definitely<00:05:07.129> lengthening<00:05:07.939> but<00:05:08.120> not

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
definitely lengthening but not

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.300 
definitely lengthening but not
thickening<00:05:08.599> I<00:05:08.990> think<00:05:09.500> this<00:05:09.650> mascara<00:05:10.039> will<00:05:10.219> be

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
thickening I think this mascara will be

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.760 
thickening I think this mascara will be
perfect<00:05:10.879> with<00:05:11.060> eith<00:05:11.419> more<00:05:11.840> thicker<00:05:12.169> mascara

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
perfect with eith more thicker mascara

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.830 
perfect with eith more thicker mascara
on<00:05:12.919> top<00:05:13.099> of<00:05:13.280> it<00:05:13.430> I<00:05:13.610> would<00:05:13.939> say<00:05:14.120> that<00:05:14.389> it's<00:05:14.599> a

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
on top of it I would say that it's a

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.570 
on top of it I would say that it's a
false<00:05:15.110> lash<00:05:15.379> effect<00:05:15.409> and<00:05:16.039> it's<00:05:16.159> definitely

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
false lash effect and it's definitely

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.510 
false lash effect and it's definitely
similar<00:05:17.090> to<00:05:17.479> the<00:05:17.629> their<00:05:17.870> real<00:05:18.020> mascara<00:05:18.199> I<00:05:18.830> feel

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
similar to the their real mascara I feel

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.309 
similar to the their real mascara I feel
like<00:05:19.669> I<00:05:19.729> get<00:05:19.789> the<00:05:20.150> same<00:05:20.360> length<00:05:20.690> with<00:05:20.990> that<00:05:21.139> one

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:21.319 
like I get the same length with that one

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:21.640 
like I get the same length with that one
as<00:05:21.440> well

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
as well

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.980 
as well
I<00:05:21.889> would<00:05:22.340> give<00:05:22.490> this<00:05:22.610> mascara<00:05:23.060> maybe<00:05:23.449> an<00:05:23.599> 8<00:05:23.810> or

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
I would give this mascara maybe an 8 or

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.779 
I would give this mascara maybe an 8 or
9<00:05:24.169> out<00:05:24.409> of<00:05:24.440> 10<00:05:24.710> just<00:05:24.979> because<00:05:25.250> of<00:05:25.370> the<00:05:25.490> flaking

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
9 out of 10 just because of the flaking

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.219 
9 out of 10 just because of the flaking
but<00:05:26.539> that's<00:05:26.719> pretty<00:05:26.870> much<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.169> only

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
but that's pretty much the only

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:28.930 
but that's pretty much the only
complaint<00:05:27.800> that<00:05:27.919> I<00:05:27.979> have<00:05:28.190> I<00:05:28.219> really<00:05:28.610> like<00:05:28.759> this
