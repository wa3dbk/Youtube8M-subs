 services can easily be from 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.530
 an application 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.960
 very face of the activist brand for the 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.970
 young public for people who like it 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.040
 technology we are going to present a 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.170
 what do you do now? 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.819
 from this web application or interact 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.010
 From Portugal 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.310
 this is the interface that has 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.170
 echebastar applications is 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.139
 available for both platforms 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.090
 Android as for kabul platforms 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:34.560
 we are currently developing the 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:37.020
 blackberry for about february 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.120
 from here the main services that 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.610
 you can do is open your vehicle 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.599
 remotely you loose for example that 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.000
 do not download the control where you have 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.440
 the time because I simply know what 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.090
 you want to leave someone and you do not want 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.459
 give you security titles then you 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.769
 you'll feel good since you do not have the lyrics 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.720
 parked that in case of leaving your 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.250
 car to do somewhere and that 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.930
 you do not want that you do not want that you what 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.620
 move a valet parking or the mother of a 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.540
 car, they make you leave an alert 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.019
 and parked the car moves more than 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.870
 five meters this generates a 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.730
 notification that comes to your cell phone 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.070
 and also currently a mail that you 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.019
 reaches your cell phone or your 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.479
 computer on the other hand you can also 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.760
 close your vehicle or send the command 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.370
 of lights and speaker that in case of going 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.970
 Large parking you used to 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.229
 find your speed warning vehicle 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.270
 it can be for a control issue 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.660
 parental or when you lend a vehicle 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.340
 if a work vehicle 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.220
 or simply if you lend it is a 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.650
 friend and I noticed a lot of confidence 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.420
 that will lead him to lower the 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.160
 West if you put a certain 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.160
 speed where simply 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.080
 where you simply set a speed 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.130
 at the moment the vehicle 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.200
 exceeds the set speed and you 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.920
 will reach a notification is remarkable 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.710
 4 smartphones we also have 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.740
 emergency calls or this one button 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.320
 of that 11 that generates a text message 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.140
 where we automatically go 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.150
 to return the user's call in case 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.150
 that I do not have minutes in case 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.930
 example your cell phone 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:24.630
 inside the car you can also 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.730
 locate the card this many times what 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:31.070
 they use people who have two or three 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:33.600
 productive cars to find where 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.820
 and if it is fulfilling more or less for the 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.350
 itinerary this is very similar to what 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.080
 offers at this moment I'm ready to 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.510
 fleets for everyone on the most platforms 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.190
 robust but let's say here you're going to 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.130
 put yourself in the opportunity to locate 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.330
 your car and follow it at intervals of 15 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.060
 minutes 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.370
 another other utility there is the control 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.009
 parental case of those parents 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.740
 what are we say with teenage children 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:01.500
 starting to catch them the car is this 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.120
 type of service is quite useful for 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.620
 they 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.830
 what we want to present to you with three 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.570
 also in new new updates 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.570
 with many more surprises where the truth 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:17.410
 we are betting a lot to integrate the 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:21.430
 cellular heat to vehicles is a 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:24.090
 hybrid between cellular technology and 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.090
 technology 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:28.169
 thank you very much everyone who is well
