00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.830 
regardless if I'm not fighting but it is
a<00:02:13.610> little<00:02:13.760> bit<00:02:13.940> less<00:02:14.150> cool<00:02:14.390> without<00:02:14.569> them

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
a little bit less cool without them

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.119 
a little bit less cool without them
fighting<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.410> think<00:02:15.620> it's<00:02:15.709> supposed<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:15.950> have

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
fighting I think it's supposed to have

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.309 
fighting I think it's supposed to have
them<00:02:16.280> fight<00:02:16.519> but<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:16.910> doesn't<00:02:17.269> so<00:02:17.480> they<00:02:18.140> take

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
them fight but it doesn't so they take

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.630 
them fight but it doesn't so they take
take<00:02:18.830> bullets<00:02:19.160> for<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.400> oh<00:02:19.599> yes<00:02:20.599> yes<00:02:21.640> victory

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
take bullets for it oh yes yes victory

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.270 
take bullets for it oh yes yes victory
oh<00:02:22.970> my<00:02:23.239> sivir<00:02:23.450> cat<00:02:23.690> died<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:24.140> don't<00:02:25.099> know<00:02:25.160> he's

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
oh my sivir cat died I don't know he's

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.100 
oh my sivir cat died I don't know he's
just<00:02:25.400> just<00:02:25.819> resting<00:02:26.300> cuz<00:02:26.450> he's<00:02:26.569> almost<00:02:26.840> dead

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
just just resting cuz he's almost dead

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.680 
just just resting cuz he's almost dead
just<00:02:27.920> close<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.280> dead<00:02:28.459> so<00:02:29.030> they<00:02:29.120> attack<00:02:29.390> I

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
just close to dead so they attack I

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.120 
just close to dead so they attack I
think<00:02:30.230> this<00:02:30.380> is<00:02:30.530> kind<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.860> hard<00:02:31.010> environment

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
think this is kind of a hard environment

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.800 
think this is kind of a hard environment
for<00:02:31.489> them<00:02:31.580> attacking<00:02:31.819> first<00:02:32.269> of<00:02:32.420> all<00:02:32.480> there<00:02:32.720> in

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
for them attacking first of all there in

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.199 
for them attacking first of all there in
a<00:02:32.870> little<00:02:33.400> bunch<00:02:34.400> of<00:02:34.519> environment<00:02:34.940> but<00:02:35.030> maybe

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
a little bunch of environment but maybe

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.330 
a little bunch of environment but maybe
in<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.510> wild<00:02:36.349> outside<00:02:36.709> they<00:02:36.860> do<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.010> lot<00:02:37.160> better

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
in the wild outside they do a lot better

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.699 
in the wild outside they do a lot better
but<00:02:37.670> still<00:02:37.879> their<00:02:38.750> names<00:02:38.930> are<00:02:39.019> top<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.379> gragas

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
but still their names are top and gragas

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.380 
but still their names are top and gragas
I<00:02:39.890> think<00:02:40.670> it's<00:02:40.790> really<00:02:40.970> awesome<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.239> they

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
I think it's really awesome that they

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.940 
I think it's really awesome that they
attack<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:41.840> they<00:02:41.900> can<00:02:42.049> be<00:02:42.200> your<00:02:42.530> kind<00:02:42.709> of<00:02:42.769> beef

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
attack and they can be your kind of beef

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.199 
attack and they can be your kind of beef
