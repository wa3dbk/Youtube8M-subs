 like mario until the video so that's what 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.100
 that we are I do not know if it's the same as the 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.300
 my own 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.230
 but all you have to do is 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.230
 turn it off 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.760
 when I'm crazy 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.919
 I want to power 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.269
 it's okay 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.059
 same as if it is equal to this one in this 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.180
 button that is the hall to go up and down 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.089
 volume I'm going to pay what you're going to do is 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.430
 own house and press the payment button 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:01:00.210
 to increase volume and home 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.210
 do not leave 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.960
 to press this button that is the home 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.280
 this one is to turn this here off 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.680
 usually goes up and down volume 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.010
 let's press when destroying volume 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.400
 then the turn off the home the three to 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.400
 the same 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.229
 until the screen and salsa come out 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.229
 when you use screen, you loose them 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.170
 will go into recovery mode 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.869
 of four options 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.840
 until that sad rebound he does not 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:41.289
 I let it be from sd card 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.050
 u and datafactory reset you ask in the 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.210
 third option 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.540
 to go down and up is with the keys 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.540

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.380
 Well, in the third option 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.479
 and the pieces of the home key because 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.310
 is to select you are stepped on is the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.140
 piece have this minor what he's going to do 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.470
 It is that you'll lose the cursor to 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.380
 where it says and is it is this time 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.160
 by the resort where it says yes and you give it in 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.630
 the home button that is to select 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.910
 style you choose and I'll start 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.370
 leave with many letters up 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.210
 many many letters and horta I do not 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.130
 because if not visionary left 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.960
 already when the process is finished 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.110
 here in these letters suns that are 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.360
 here 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.800
 is going to say that something that is 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.320
 Completed 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.230
 already when I say this you will step on the 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.170
 first option that says reboot system what 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.550
 which is for the phone to restart 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.190
 and makes it happen 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.370
 the keys are going to start going up a lot 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.390
 letters many many letters and there they go 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.390
 to start over the phone 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.240
 it is giving up the best it took a 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.330
 little because as it is restarting the 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.230
 from the first time it will restart and 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.230
 it's going to take a little 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.270
 what are you waiting for here 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.319
 that everything starts only 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.890
