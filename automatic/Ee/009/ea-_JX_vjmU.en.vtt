00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:21.630
 hi friends 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.710
 lately we have received many reports 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.839
 on 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.140
 the types of protein during 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.259
 feeding 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.520
 the types of proteins talking about the 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.170
 meats eggs protein supplements 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.140
 serum 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.539
 slow curtains fast proteins all 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.289
 the types of proteins that harbor the 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:48.850
 feeding well since already as 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:52.430
 I want to give you the best guideline 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:56.059
 of how to combine all types of 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.449
 proteins during the day in moments 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.659
 more appropriate since proteins 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.879
 depending on what type they are then 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.280
 digest at a speed or another 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.800
 speed and at time of day how is 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.929
 Fasting before sleep before 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.740
 train or after training are done 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:18.649
 more appropriate one or the other 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.959
 starting with breakfast after a 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.979
 fasting for several hours without eating the 

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:26.000
 body is a pretty state 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.159
 catabolic here the first types of 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.060
 proteins that I advise is a protein 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:35.079
 fast and a protein 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.680
 in this case eggs emerged in the form 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:42.039
 of tortillas in the shape of each curve baby 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.789
 and another amount in the form of an isolated 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:49.299
 Serum for example egg whites more 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.640
 two whole eggs with 25 grams of 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.220
 protein isolated in my advice is that it 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.429
 you spend 25 grams of protein isolated 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.590
 in a regular meal since too much 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.580
 amount of protein would exceed the 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.899
 liver capacity and could give a 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.179
 regeneration of glucose genesis and 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.720
 convert that amount of amino acids into 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:13.630
 glucose can be taken together, I'm worth it 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.080
 I make my breakfast with my protein source 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.170
 solid and my smoothie that I'm drinking to the 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.660
 time 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.550
 the following the following meals 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.270
 in this case as an example I can put 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.630
 second third meal would be food 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.550
 solid well we can search for meat or 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.200
 any other kind my advice 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.830
 professional on the second meal of the day 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.560
 also be egg-shaped single egg 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.340
 an intermediate protein because still 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.070
 it takes time to get us out of that 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.290
 nocturnal catabolism that not only with the 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:54.430
 first meal we got it 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.709
 if there is a prevailing food 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.980
 before training and to make a 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.470
 meat meal 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.060
 in this case the food just before the 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.410
 I train 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.500
 I could carry 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.560
 half meat half a protein shake 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.680
 again I like to insert the 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.260
 Payment protein in the form of meat is 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.990
 a protein is similar to chicken but 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.060
 that still contains less fat and so 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.280
 both digests more quickly in the 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.900
 skin of sanz and with the training in this 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.320
 case I like I like to eat about 200 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.950
 171 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.400
 6 ounces of Pablo cooked in about 35 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.230
 grams of egg proteins 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.510
 it will not be like at the hour and 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.579
 mean that during strong training 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.590
 I train 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.319
 we have to take a quantity of 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.629
 protein amino acids or 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.599
 that is very easy to digest in this 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:55.000
 case we should opt for the amino acids 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.790
 in free form that well as your word 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.159
 he says they are in free form and do not need 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.290
 digestion and therefore will not give us 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:06.370
 no heaviness during training 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.620
 once the training is over I recommend 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.980
 an isolated protein may well be 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.389
 hydrolysed or an isolated protein 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.940
 either a crossed flowmeter between 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:23.820
 ion exchange although you know that in 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.160
 my favorite is micro cross flow 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.530
 to this shake we can also add the 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.350
 half in this case of free amino acids 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.150
 it means that instead of throwing 50 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.580
 grams of short protein isolated that 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.950
 it would be 30 grams of isolated protein and 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.430
 another part of free amino acids 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.430
 we continue with the food that follows 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.130
 post I train in this food already 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.930
 we should put a protein source 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.150
 solid 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.840
 in this case it was always obtained with the 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.720
 meat white meat like turkey chicken 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.280
 or also a white fish that does not 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.360
 contains fat and that I have a 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.490
 assimilation on average 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.020
 one thing I like at a professional level that 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.410
 I like that I like it 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.810
 mix with this food is a part 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.479
 also egg protein that is 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.569
 would put a part of solid protein in 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.879
 this case of fish chicken or turkey and a 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:25.379
 egg protein shake of any 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:28.050
 the taste and I would drink it along with that together 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:30.659
 with that food while we eat everything 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.300
 in this case we still have a 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:35.550
 protein is semi fast as is the 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.740
 egg protein and a slow protein 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.860
 how is the solid food of the fish 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.530
 chicken turkey this helps us get it out more 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.680
 catabolism effectively train 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:50.460
 remember that not only does the shake have 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.120
 / we do not leave categorically well in this 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.159
 case 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.800
 we can already have as an example in the 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:57.479
 last meal of the day the dinner in which 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.330
 I already like to take with a protein 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:02.180
 solid in a slow way like it can be 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:06.840
 any kind of meat red meat 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.460
 fish turkey chicken and a part of 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.680
 micellar casein 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.080
 already in this case we get a protein 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.060
 slow normal that allows us a 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.669
 amount of nitrogen released and the 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.680
 micellar casein that will help us 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:23.120
 maintain a fluid amino acid contact 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.120
 All night long
