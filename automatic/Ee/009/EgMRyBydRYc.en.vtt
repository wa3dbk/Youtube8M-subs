 said Collussi it 's cool to people in 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.880
 heart shape so it came out of the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.760

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.969

 when I get a piece here a project 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.379
 the magazine I look for the name in the liner notes 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.629
 in the form of a heart that removes a 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.230
 template love love fame cut in unique 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.090
 magazine 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.320
 I will put my vegetable paper and without 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.530
 I've done the same thing he sees in 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.350
 natural size of my mold and this 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.119
 work is the technique time foundation 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.710
 everyone in the same block in the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.090
 same drawing 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.610
 so I did that strong good 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.470
 the staff at home who understand is what 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.000
 I do when I talk to you. 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.540
 sew right out of my risk 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.060
 with the back of the fabric so I put 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.810
 here upon the avaí in his shop after 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.470
 its numbering and forró 5 is born near and 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.950
 this and places the right of the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.979
 my number 1 with number two and I'm going 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.090
 sew on risk 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:57.170
 imagining that it will cover two is not 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:03.140
 This, then, I 'm going to do this sewing. 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:05.630
 This is luis costa ciro 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.950
 I threw over the risk and it's 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:13.940
 exactly the normal thing is to do with pencils 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.069
 with the tip very thin to not overcome 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.760
 the sewing image 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.980
 so here I open and I do the faith 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.069
 so I'll do the same I do here 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.860
 I cut work here at my risk that I 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.239
 I doubled here at the risk of number two with 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.860
 the number 3 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.580
 I'll cut with my ruler. 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.370
 fit the ruler and I 'll find the partner 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.760
 forgotten this so as not to make a difference 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.489
 in my fabric I come here from 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.100
 number 2 and number 11 that the number 3 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.799
 here you do not have to cut there I come with 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.959
 second guess what is this beige 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.569
 I'll put it right again with 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.680
 right 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:03:01.700
 the pce du to the end and is not acting vote 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.799
 it is not and I will sew it to those who do not need it 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.440
 sew I've already shown that the 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:11.390
 even make number four the number 15 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:15.320
 So I 've already sewed everyone here. 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.079
 until number 5 cut the latter 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.299
 Here, this space is mine. 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.900
 seam allowance that I am going to 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.609
 fabrics with the right to cut in the 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.340
 same size 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:33.470
 the same heart shape I do not need 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:36.769
 do the mold because the ps already on screen already 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:41.380
 has the exact measure I need to 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:44.859
 I sew pin and will build air 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.859
 move risk 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.780
 so I can see exactly one risk 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.300
 already brought an air that sew dinho then 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.610
 I deviate from this opening that I 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.489
 I left 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:05.900

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:08.120
 Perfect finish then detour I heard

 just be careful with the tip of it 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.040
 to hurt the work is completely 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:33.680
