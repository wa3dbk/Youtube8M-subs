SR<00:00:06.720> there's<00:00:07.109> always<00:00:07.379> been<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.710> debate<00:00:07.890> about

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
SR there's always been a debate about

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.549 
SR there's always been a debate about
what's<00:00:09.269> better<00:00:09.570> especially<00:00:10.290> if<00:00:10.380> you're<00:00:10.469> going

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
what's better especially if you're going

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.169 
what's better especially if you're going
to<00:00:10.650> build<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.010> engine<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.460> turbocharged<00:00:12.000> it

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
to build the engine and turbocharged it

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.970 
to build the engine and turbocharged it
the<00:00:12.300> KSR<00:00:12.809> vowel<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.139> pretty<00:00:13.349> badass<00:00:13.530> because<00:00:13.889> I

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
the KSR vowel is pretty badass because I

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.250 
the KSR vowel is pretty badass because I
used<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.190> have<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.370> 240<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.030> few<00:00:15.330> years<00:00:15.540> back<00:00:15.839> so

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
used to have a 240 a few years back so

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.349 
used to have a 240 a few years back so
just<00:00:16.619> seeing<00:00:17.100> build<00:00:17.400> ups<00:00:17.580> like<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.090> is

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
just seeing build ups like this is

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.160 
just seeing build ups like this is
pretty<00:00:18.660> cool

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
pretty cool

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.679 
pretty cool
so<00:00:19.320> we<00:00:19.439> decided<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.060> basically<00:00:21.060> build<00:00:21.330> up<00:00:21.510> two

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
so we decided to basically build up two

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.599 
so we decided to basically build up two
of<00:00:21.779> these<00:00:21.869> vehicles<00:00:22.170> at<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.560> same<00:00:22.920> time<00:00:23.250> and

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
of these vehicles at the same time and

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.689 
of these vehicles at the same time and
we<00:00:24.240> put<00:00:24.449> feature<00:00:24.689> editor<00:00:25.130> hrf<00:00:28.460> Richard<00:00:29.460> Fong

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
we put feature editor hrf Richard Fong

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.959 
we put feature editor hrf Richard Fong
in<00:00:29.880> charge<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.449> sr20<00:00:31.439> build<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.700> put

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
in charge of the sr20 build and we put

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.360 
in charge of the sr20 build and we put

bill<00:00:35.579> now<00:00:35.820> bullet<00:00:36.120> builds<00:00:36.420> gonna<00:00:36.570> be<00:00:36.630> pretty

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
bill now bullet builds gonna be pretty

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.270 
bill now bullet builds gonna be pretty
badass<00:00:37.079> but<00:00:37.469> they<00:00:37.559> all<00:00:37.710> have<00:00:37.920> their<00:00:38.040> weak

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
badass but they all have their weak

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.160 
badass but they all have their weak
points<00:00:38.700> before<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.000> SR<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.719> think<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
points before the SR I think the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.319 
points before the SR I think the
weakness<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.010> lack<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.340> torque<00:00:41.730> granted

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
weakness is a lack of torque granted

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.119 
weakness is a lack of torque granted
that<00:00:42.420> it's<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.629> 4-cylinder<00:00:43.230> engine<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:43.950> if<00:00:44.040> you

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
that it's a 4-cylinder engine but if you

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.729 
that it's a 4-cylinder engine but if you
compare<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.850> KA<00:00:45.170> there's<00:00:46.170> tons<00:00:46.590> of

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
compare that to the KA there's tons of

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.410 
compare that to the KA there's tons of
torque<00:00:47.039> with<00:00:47.340> gerunds<00:00:47.820> car<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> KA

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
torque with gerunds car on the KA

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.119 
torque with gerunds car on the KA
there's<00:00:48.899> two<00:00:49.230> things<00:00:49.530> he<00:00:49.710> probably<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.010> gonna

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
there's two things he probably is gonna

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.770 
there's two things he probably is gonna
have<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> worry<00:00:50.550> about<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:51.120> his<00:00:51.480> tranny

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
have to worry about is his tranny

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.910 
have to worry about is his tranny
solution<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.730> his<00:00:53.730> head<00:00:53.940> gasket<00:00:54.800> whereas<00:00:55.800> on

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
solution and his head gasket whereas on

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.799 
solution and his head gasket whereas on
Rich's<00:00:56.160> car<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.760> been<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> more<00:00:57.420> proven

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
Rich's car it's been a more proven

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.090 
Rich's car it's been a more proven
engine<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.109> lot<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.410> people<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.859> developed

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
engine a lot of people have developed

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.430 
engine a lot of people have developed
that<00:00:59.399> engine<00:00:59.730> as<00:00:59.850> opposed<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> K<00:01:00.480> 24<00:01:01.079> so

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
that engine as opposed to the K 24 so

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.260 
that engine as opposed to the K 24 so
rich<00:01:02.190> has<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> little<00:01:02.699> bit<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.910> an<00:01:03.000> advantage

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
rich has a little bit of an advantage

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.579 
rich has a little bit of an advantage
there<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.780> know<00:01:03.870> Darren<00:01:04.260> has<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> lot<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
there I know Darren has a lot of

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.590 
there I know Darren has a lot of
experience<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.280> drag<00:01:05.489> racing<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> expect

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
experience in drag racing so I expect

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.260 
experience in drag racing so I expect
that<00:01:06.720> he'll<00:01:06.900> do<00:01:07.140> relatively<00:01:08.070> well<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:09.119> as

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
that he'll do relatively well because as

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.230 
that he'll do relatively well because as
Richard<00:01:09.299> proved<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.110> DVD<00:01:10.650> 20<00:01:11.159> where<00:01:11.520> he<00:01:11.640> took

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
Richard proved in DVD 20 where he took

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.840 
Richard proved in DVD 20 where he took
his<00:01:12.450> 12<00:01:12.960> second<00:01:13.320> car<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.740> ran<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> 14<00:01:14.430> something

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
his 12 second car and ran a 14 something

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.120 
his 12 second car and ran a 14 something
and<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> road<00:01:15.479> racing<00:01:15.960> both<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.979> them

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
and so the road racing both of them

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.270 
and so the road racing both of them
spend<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.030> lot<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.210> time<00:01:18.509> off<00:01:19.110> track<00:01:19.530> vital<00:01:20.189> me

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
spend a lot of time off track vital me

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.010 
spend a lot of time off track vital me
driving<00:01:20.670> off<00:01:20.759> tracks<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.270> they<00:01:21.630> don't<00:01:21.810> get<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
driving off tracks but they don't get a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.410 
driving off tracks but they don't get a
lot<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.229> seat<00:01:22.830> time<00:01:23.009> road<00:01:23.460> racing<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.210> think

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
lot of seat time road racing so I think

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.390 
lot of seat time road racing so I think
that's<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.140> be<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> toss-up<00:01:25.530> rich<00:01:26.159> has

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
that's going to be a toss-up rich has

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.730 
that's going to be a toss-up rich has
like<00:01:26.759> hundreds<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.479> hours<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.900> seat<00:01:28.320> time<00:01:28.350> on

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
like hundreds of hours of seat time on

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.560 
like hundreds of hours of seat time on
the<00:01:28.799> road<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.070> course<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.430> his<00:01:29.670> s15<00:01:30.180> let<00:01:30.420> alone

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
the road of course in his s15 let alone

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.230 
the road of course in his s15 let alone
that<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.500> he<00:01:31.979> has<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> huge<00:01:32.400> advantage<00:01:32.670> there<00:01:32.939> so

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
that so he has a huge advantage there so

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.149 
that so he has a huge advantage there so
the<00:01:33.630> dyno<00:01:33.930> challenge<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.799> huge

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the dyno challenge is going to be a huge

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.010 
the dyno challenge is going to be a huge
variable<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:35.820> both<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.150> them<00:01:36.240> there's<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.840> lot

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
variable for both of them there's a lot

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.600 
variable for both of them there's a lot
I<00:01:37.049> could<00:01:37.200> say<00:01:37.320> about<00:01:37.470> both<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.040> platforms

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
I could say about both of the platforms

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.120 
I could say about both of the platforms
but<00:01:38.850> for<00:01:39.060> me<00:01:39.270> working<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.659> d<00:01:39.900> sport<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.829> fact

but for me working for d sport the fact

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.370 
but for me working for d sport the fact
that<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.520> get<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.700> see<00:01:42.030> two<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.570> our<00:01:42.750> employees

the s15 silvia are a perfect match up

back<00:03:28.460> stronger<00:03:29.030> than<00:03:29.060> it<00:03:29.240> was<00:03:29.650> so<00:03:30.650> I<00:03:31.070> think

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
back stronger than it was so I think

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.520 
back stronger than it was so I think
with<00:03:31.850> those<00:03:31.970> two<00:03:32.210> handicaps<00:03:32.810> it's<00:03:33.080> been<00:03:33.260> very

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
with those two handicaps it's been very

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.140 
with those two handicaps it's been very
difficult<00:03:33.770> for<00:03:34.100> them<00:03:34.310> to<00:03:34.550> complete<00:03:35.000> their

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
difficult for them to complete their

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.630 
difficult for them to complete their
project<00:03:35.690> Plus<00:03:35.930> along<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.590> way<00:03:36.770> they<00:03:37.400> made<00:03:37.610> a

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
project Plus along the way they made a

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.910 
project Plus along the way they made a
lot<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.030> stupid<00:03:38.540> mistakes<00:03:38.600> one<00:03:39.500> after<00:03:39.800> the

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
lot of stupid mistakes one after the

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.250 
lot of stupid mistakes one after the
other<00:03:39.950> I<00:03:40.160> don't<00:03:40.370> know<00:03:40.490> which<00:03:40.640> one's<00:03:40.880> worse<00:03:41.260> had

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
other I don't know which one's worse had

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.930 
other I don't know which one's worse had
one<00:03:42.500> of<00:03:42.620> them<00:03:42.710> actually<00:03:42.920> completed<00:03:43.550> on<00:03:43.670> time

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
one of them actually completed on time

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.890 
one of them actually completed on time
the<00:03:44.120> other<00:03:44.240> one<00:03:44.360> probably<00:03:44.450> would<00:03:44.720> have<00:03:44.780> been

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
the other one probably would have been

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.620 
the other one probably would have been
fired<00:03:45.200> so<00:03:45.350> maybe<00:03:45.740> it's<00:03:45.890> some<00:03:46.070> type<00:03:46.280> of

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
fired so maybe it's some type of

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.880 
fired so maybe it's some type of
collusion<00:03:47.630> that<00:03:47.810> they<00:03:48.020> have<00:03:48.170> going<00:03:48.410> on<00:03:48.620> to

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
collusion that they have going on to

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.640 
collusion that they have going on to
never<00:03:49.100> finish<00:03:49.490> K<00:03:49.700> versus<00:03:50.180> SR<00:03:50.570> so<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.470> people

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
never finish K versus SR so the people

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.950 
never finish K versus SR so the people
who<00:03:51.830> think<00:03:52.070> that<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.460> K<00:03:52.640> versus<00:03:53.120> SR<00:03:53.480> battle<00:03:53.900> is

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
who think that the K versus SR battle is

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.770 
who think that the K versus SR battle is
taking<00:03:54.110> too<00:03:54.350> long<00:03:54.380> it<00:03:54.680> is<00:03:54.740> taking<00:03:54.920> too<00:03:55.460> long

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
taking too long it is taking too long

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.840 
taking too long it is taking too long
unlike<00:03:56.780> some<00:03:57.110> of<00:03:57.230> my<00:03:57.440> peers<00:03:58.190> who<00:03:58.310> have<00:03:58.459> had<00:03:58.700> the
