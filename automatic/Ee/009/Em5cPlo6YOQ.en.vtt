battle rifle which is the DMR very cool

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.760 
battle rifle which is the DMR very cool
pretty<00:01:29.250> awesome<00:01:30.049> which<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.140> guess<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.350> DMR's<00:01:31.710> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
pretty awesome which I guess the DMR's a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.530 
pretty awesome which I guess the DMR's a
totally<00:01:32.189> different<00:01:32.490> weapon<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:32.909> they

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
totally different weapon but they

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.740 
totally different weapon but they
replaced<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> better<00:01:34.259> Eiffel<00:01:35.509> so<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> little

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
replaced the better Eiffel so the little

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.130 
replaced the better Eiffel so the little
peg<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.290> could<00:01:37.409> peg<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.799> his<00:01:37.920> back<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
peg so you could peg it on his back and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.359 
peg so you could peg it on his back and
then<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.290> course<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.650> comes<00:01:40.740> with<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.040> frag

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
then of course it comes with a frag

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.910 
then of course it comes with a frag
grenade<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.750> which<00:01:42.990> doesnt<00:01:43.200> have<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.500> peg<00:01:43.770> in

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920

grenade and which doesnt have the peg in
it<00:01:44.270> but<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.390> does<00:01:45.509> have<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.869> whole<00:01:46.100> which<00:01:47.100> you

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
very cool I really like that option I'm

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.820 
very cool I really like that option I'm
kind<00:02:47.460> of<00:02:47.520> makes<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.760> cool<00:02:48.410> for<00:02:49.410> these<00:02:49.560> main

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
kind of makes it cool for these main

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.710 
kind of makes it cool for these main
characters<00:02:50.280> like<00:02:50.460> re<00:02:50.670> not<00:02:51.060> keep<00:02:51.300> his<00:02:51.450> armor

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
characters like re not keep his armor

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.610 
characters like re not keep his armor
the<00:02:51.840> same<00:02:52.080> but<00:02:52.790> if<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:53.940> had<00:02:54.090> just<00:02:54.210> more<00:02:54.620> obscure

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
the same but if I had just more obscure

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.910 
the same but if I had just more obscure
characters<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.520> probably<00:02:57.180> change<00:02:57.450> them<00:02:57.600> out

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
characters and probably change them out

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.290 
characters and probably change them out
and<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.070> can<00:02:59.160> change<00:02:59.340> out<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.670> chest<00:03:00.000> plates

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
and you can change out the chest plates

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.970 
and you can change out the chest plates
and<00:03:00.570> stuff<00:03:00.660> just<00:03:01.050> like<00:03:01.170> in<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.350> game<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.800> can

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
and stuff just like in the game you can

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.660 
and stuff just like in the game you can
make<00:03:02.910> your<00:03:03.030> own<00:03:03.090> character<00:03:04.490> it's<00:03:05.490> very

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
make your own character it's very

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
articulation on these guys and aside

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.100 
articulation on these guys and aside
from<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.340> torso<00:03:53.760> joint<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.300> all<00:03:54.450> moves<00:03:54.720> pretty

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
from the torso joint it all moves pretty

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.650 
from the torso joint it all moves pretty
well<00:03:55.640> which<00:03:56.640> is<00:03:56.670> nice<00:03:57.000> because<00:03:57.240> some<00:03:57.540> of<00:03:57.570> the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
well which is nice because some of the

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.760 
well which is nice because some of the
series<00:03:57.960> one<00:03:58.140> figures<00:03:58.470> were<00:03:58.650> really<00:03:59.040> stiff<00:04:00.770> but

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
series one figures were really stiff but

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.170 
series one figures were really stiff but
it<00:04:01.920> seems<00:04:02.130> like<00:04:02.220> MacFarlane's<00:04:02.880> kind<00:04:03.090> of

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
it seems like MacFarlane's kind of

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.490 
it seems like MacFarlane's kind of
tweaking<00:04:03.390> them<00:04:03.600> a<00:04:03.660> little<00:04:03.810> bit<00:04:04.020> and<00:04:04.200> making

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
tweaking them a little bit and making

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.140 
tweaking them a little bit and making
them<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.680> little<00:04:04.800> bit<00:04:05.010> better<00:04:05.160> so<00:04:06.060> that's

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
them a little bit better so that's

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.960 
them a little bit better so that's
awesome<00:04:06.740> i'm<00:04:07.740> so<00:04:07.980> hopefully<00:04:08.250> I<00:04:08.280> can<00:04:08.400> find<00:04:08.640> cat

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
awesome i'm so hopefully I can find cat

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.960 
awesome i'm so hopefully I can find cat
and<00:04:09.240> then<00:04:09.390> with<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.290> series<00:04:10.650> 3<00:04:10.950> jun<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.820> i'll
