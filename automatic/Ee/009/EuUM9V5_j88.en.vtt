and oxygen when the gas is hot enough
its<00:01:01.949> molecules<00:01:02.370> break<00:01:03.059> apart<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.930> atoms

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170

heat<00:01:09.869> keeps<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.650> fuel<00:01:11.010> at<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.490> ignition

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
heat keeps the fuel at the ignition

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.359 
heat keeps the fuel at the ignition
temperature<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.990> keeps<00:01:13.200> burning<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.890> long

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
temperature so it keeps burning as long

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.149 
temperature so it keeps burning as long
as<00:01:14.549> there<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.909> fuel<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.450> oxygen<00:01:16.320> there<00:01:17.070> you

as there is fuel and oxygen there you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.090 
as there is fuel and oxygen there you
have<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.549> fire<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.570> result<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.170> extreme<00:01:19.799> heat

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
have it fire the result of extreme heat
