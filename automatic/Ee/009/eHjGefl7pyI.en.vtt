00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.380
 london in 1999 playstation had 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.779
 many good war games titles 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.779
 rommedahl for example is very crazy 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.430
 the game is set in the final years of 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.700
 World War II more or less in 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.829
 1955 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.750
 In it you assume the role of lieutenant dm 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.890
 petersson to fight alongside states 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.260
 united in the secret service 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.449
 the game's scenarios represent a lot 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.699
 well the war 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.100
 when I was a child I felt a maximum 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.530
 in initial missions using those 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.809
 fixed machine guns with infinite bullets 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.000
 is connected to it is very nostalgic in 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.770
 absurd levels 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.229
 another mission of this game that I also 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.030
 I will never forget it is the one you 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.490
 infiltrates enemy bases with 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.500
 false documents to be showing that 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.759

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.830

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.090

 the year 2000 came to an end. 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.049
 continuation 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.540
 mega the steering wheel and ground nor the people 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.360
 enters headlong into war and places of 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.140
 Europe and Africa, and it's just that the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.840
 our character of the time is a woman is 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.770
 Nice battisti in French representing 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.810
 very secure a missile launcher sweat 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.119
 the cover of the game a mission that does not have 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.979
 How to forget in the underground is the man 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.350
 that you infiltrate enemy bases 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.689
 with a camera 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.729
 There you goofing soldiers, they stay. 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.689
 doing pose to take picture is very 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.610
 funny 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:12.319
 Diego Ashes plays the metal and the two pedal 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.910
 it's two great games 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.790
 I especially liked the way 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.549
 multiplayer or kills kills with the screen 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.010
 divided between us I met with the 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.230
 friends in the play area was very 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.910

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.290
 kind of game these days 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.540

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.360
 Old gold where I'm playing if I go 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.239
 article 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.160

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.250
 the playstation computers were 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.950
 off the move 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.950
 I'm not talking about the halachah megaphone 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.560
 I remember that I did not believe that as 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.720
 the cars were photos because it is not 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.540
 any 2002 computer that could handle the 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.060
 Traffic in this game there was this hulking 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.130
 Maybe we 're in Lieutenant Mark's face. 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.850

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.950

 the game has very creative missions and 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.959
 you can also notice strong 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:25.940
 inspirations from the movie the rescue of the side 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:28.490

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.260
 also known as the beach phase o 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.030
 day that this phase is indeed 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.980

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.610

 Talk about the flash you go along the sides 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.790

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.440
