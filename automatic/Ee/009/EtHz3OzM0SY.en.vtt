00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.300 
think of maybe there's something I
haven't<00:03:58.030> explored<00:03:58.570> yet<00:03:58.860> so<00:03:59.860> that's<00:04:00.100> what<00:04:00.280> I

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
haven't explored yet so that's what I

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.400 
haven't explored yet so that's what I
try<00:04:00.580> to<00:04:00.610> do<00:04:00.820> then<00:04:01.420> I'm<00:04:01.510> actually<00:04:01.780> working<00:04:02.110> on<00:04:02.350> a

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
try to do then I'm actually working on a

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.520 
try to do then I'm actually working on a
new<00:04:02.590> thing<00:04:02.800> predictions<00:04:03.580> to<00:04:04.180> anyone<00:04:04.450> I'm<00:04:05.140> back

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
new thing predictions to anyone I'm back

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.940 
new thing predictions to anyone I'm back
to<00:04:05.710> my<00:04:05.740> story<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:07.320> so<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.470> new<00:04:08.590> thing<00:04:08.800> I'm

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
to my story the so the new thing I'm

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.220 
to my story the so the new thing I'm
trying<00:04:08.980> to<00:04:09.340> work<00:04:09.490> on<00:04:09.670> is<00:04:09.820> no<00:04:10.510> words<00:04:10.750> in<00:04:10.930> a<00:04:11.050> way

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
trying to work on is no words in a way

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.800 
trying to work on is no words in a way
although<00:04:11.470> I<00:04:11.640> continued<00:04:12.640> I've<00:04:12.820> decided<00:04:13.330> to<00:04:13.480> not

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
although I continued I've decided to not

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.140 
although I continued I've decided to not
ever<00:04:14.110> walk<00:04:14.440> away<00:04:14.710> from<00:04:14.890> this<00:04:15.070> because<00:04:15.910> it

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
ever walk away from this because it

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.840 
ever walk away from this because it
brings<00:04:16.269> me<00:04:16.420> pleasure<00:04:16.890> but<00:04:17.890> now<00:04:18.100> I'm<00:04:18.310> trying<00:04:18.700> to

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
brings me pleasure but now I'm trying to

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.000 
brings me pleasure but now I'm trying to
create<00:04:20.070> juxtapositions<00:04:21.720> contradictions

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
create juxtapositions contradictions

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.860 
create juxtapositions contradictions

that is like overkill or balloons with

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.130 
that is like overkill or balloons with
barbed<00:05:05.440> wire<00:05:07.410> or<00:05:08.410> I<00:05:08.919> did<00:05:09.430> cactus<00:05:10.120> with<00:05:10.510> blowing

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
barbed wire or I did cactus with blowing

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.520 
barbed wire or I did cactus with blowing
bubbles<00:05:11.740> across<00:05:12.190> it<00:05:12.430> so<00:05:12.660> they're<00:05:13.660> all<00:05:13.900> they're

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
bubbles across it so they're all they're

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.800 
bubbles across it so they're all they're
all<00:05:14.850> contradictions<00:05:15.850> in<00:05:16.030> a<00:05:16.090> way<00:05:16.270> of<00:05:16.510> things

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
all contradictions in a way of things

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.590 
all contradictions in a way of things
that<00:05:17.050> are<00:05:17.520> rough<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:18.700> brutal<00:05:18.880> and<00:05:19.270> things

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
that are rough and brutal and things

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.300 
that are rough and brutal and things
that<00:05:19.720> are<00:05:19.840> fragile<00:05:20.169> and<00:05:20.530> huggable<00:05:21.040> and

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
that are fragile and huggable and

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.670 
that are fragile and huggable and
lovable<00:05:21.880> so<00:05:22.600> that's<00:05:22.810> not<00:05:22.990> trying<00:05:23.230> to<00:05:23.320> do<00:05:23.440> next

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
lovable so that's not trying to do next

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.680 
lovable so that's not trying to do next
because<00:05:23.919> I<00:05:24.130> think<00:05:24.370> that<00:05:24.490> it<00:05:24.640> as<00:05:25.180> long<00:05:25.450> as<00:05:25.480> you

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
because I think that it as long as you

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.480 
because I think that it as long as you
can<00:05:25.870> do<00:05:26.050> something<00:05:26.320> you<00:05:26.770> pull<00:05:27.070> people<00:05:27.400> in

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
can do something you pull people in

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.210 
can do something you pull people in
