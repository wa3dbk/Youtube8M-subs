00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.320
 hi guys welcome to my 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.180
 channel and today I will have culinary 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.480
 video today we will be with you 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.640
 cook very simple for a delicious dessert 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.100
 this dessert is very popular in Swedish 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.379
 children they inspired me on 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.479
 cooking today's goodies 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.670
 perhaps those of children can also 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:58.030
 cook it because it's cooked 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.430
 in just 10 minutes and it was 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.949
 called factory barlare in swedish 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.700
 in Russian it will be like balls from 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:09.810
 oatmeal everything is very simple everything is elementary 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.810
 and so it went 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.390
 Well, let's go in the most fun lesson 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.049
 mixing all of our ingredients 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.150
 ideas will need our precious pens 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.700
 and very much when I cook I love very much 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.159
 include music so now we will 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.110
 with you to cook to music often whose 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:48.240
 songs that I really like now 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:48.240
 and what shall we do now two or three 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:02:02.320
 and I have 300 songs that honestly press 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:10.270
 oil is not the most pleasant to develop 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:12.660
 but the butter does not really melt 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.660
 need to 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.569
 go now you found 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.969
 that's because of this test from our ball 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.939
 we will make smaller balls I am 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:41.689
 already was about this 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:44.569
 The size, that is, the size of the children, is very 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:47.459
 develop and drink and then here's the step we 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.159
 dip in coconut shavings spared 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.319
 coconut shavings because there will be 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.269
 tastier in general can also be nuts in 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.709
 the test then you can add the nuts will be 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:01.349
 more delicious and very very tasty 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.930
 such a ball is ready and now we go 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.930
 with you everything else dough do 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.060
 In general, while doing the frying thought the most 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:22.519
 you can get a little swedish 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.590

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.000

 that most so ha ha st firstly 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.370
 emphasis is placed on the last syllable and 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.180
 this is not cocoa 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:51.260

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:54.970
