00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.509
 [Music] 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.960
 in the set films and welcome to another 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.430
 tutorial about video and production my 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.769
 name is nicolÃ¡s amelio artist and today 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.480
 let's talk about filters I hope that 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.310
 remember our last video 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.529
 about color temperature do not remember 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.300
 well if you did not see it do not worry about the 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.380
 topic is that today we are going to work with 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.359
 terms that have to do with 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.340
 color temperature so it would be good 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.489
 if you see it, you can actually see it 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.629
 clicking there go and see it later 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.480
 come back because if I'm not going to miss them 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.070
 so do not miss it anyway 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.140
 question is that the last time we had 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.030
 talked about the different sources of 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.470
 light and what were its temperature color and 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.660
 we had learned that the light of 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.239
 tungsten has a color temperature 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.489
 other than sunlight for example and 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.379
 that we could take stock 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.989
 of whites with our camera so that 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.000
 it adjusts to the color temperature of 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.739
 each light source now this that 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.989
 We said it is more than good always and 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.790
 when we have a single source of light 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.400
 but what happens if we have what 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.340
 next ok I'm now in a garden 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.470
 illuminated by the light of day or I made 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.140
 a white balance at a temperature 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.119
 of color of 5600 degrees Kelvin and what 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.030
 I want to know what happens if I grab 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.119
 this lamp that we see here and it illuminated me 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.280
 with her they see that you start to see more of 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.840
 orange color how can we do to 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.000
 Fix this 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.189
 as we know we are in a 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.460
 5600 degree color temperature 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.710
 kelvin and this lamp has 3200 degrees 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.899
 Kelvin because it's tungsten light like that 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.719
 how do we solve it good an idea 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.610
 is to turn off the lamp and we have everything 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.270
 solved we can wait for it 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.159
 make night 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.439
 but I think that's going to take a while 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.290
 long or we can consider the last 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.430
 option to be seized 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.710
 this blue filter that you see here and put it 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.380
 about our lamp and there it is already 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.110
 we have light equal to sunlight 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.910
 ok as you saw the filters serve us 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.490
 to modify the color temperature 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.530
 of our lights in this case we use it 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.800
 to change our color temperature 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.450
 of tungsten at a temperature similar to 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.459
 that of sunlight 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.200
 now there are a lot of filters 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.520
 light for cinema and everyone modifies the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.470
 Different color temperature 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.620
 ways but with those who are most going to 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.970
 find you is with these two this 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.550
 blue that you see here that is the one we use 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.709
 previously it is called ctv full color 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.870
 temperature blue and what it does is 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.690
 modify the color temperature of a 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.200
 Tungsten light osea 3200 degrees Kelvin 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.239
 at a color temperature of 5600 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.670
 Kelvin degrees that is the same as light 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.010
 of the sun on the other hand this orange that 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.200
 we have here is called cto or color 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.270
 temperature orange how good you are 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.890
 with English dad and it helps us to 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.720
 do just the opposite what 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.600
 does this is to convert a temperature 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.580
 color of 5600 degrees Kelvin to one of 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.739
 3200 Kelvin degrees in other words 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.910
 converts daylight into light of 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.770
 tungsten or is 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.260
 if you for example have a room 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.210
 lit with tungsten lamps but 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.160
 they have a window through which sun enters 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.100
 all they have to do is grab 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.960
 that window and put this filter to 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.420
 that converts the color temperature 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.190
 sun color temperature tungsten 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.020
 they saw how easy it is now apart from 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.760
 the filters that modify the temperature 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.800
 color like the ones we saw we just have 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.900
 other very common filters within the 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.960
 cinematographic or television field that 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.330
 are the diffusers the diffusers what 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.210
 they basically do is make our 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.280
 light is a little softer does not modify the 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.800
 color temperature do not change any of that 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.600
 they simply make our light 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.060
 softer and therefore that shadows 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.740
 that project are not so hard for 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.780
 last another filter that they will see very 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.720
 followed is this black who have here that 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.240
 it's called nd or neutral density and what 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.550
 does is just lower the 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.980
 intensity of our lights so that 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.900
 about exposing our material about 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.120
 expose that is a pretty term 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.600
 strange good, it really would not be if 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.000
 they saw this tutorial here 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.860
 look at overexposure and all that 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.660
 in short, surely you are wondering 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.970
 where did you buy the filters where 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.800
 they get look depends on the country where 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.020
 live and depends on your provider 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.000
 but most places where they sell 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.700
 movie articles and similar things 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.650
 They have filters for sale so they can 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.750
 ask there and if they do not have surely 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.400
 they're going to tell you from somewhere where the 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.750
 can they get so they do not have 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.910
 no problem at the time of 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.010
 buy tell them that the standard brands 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.810
 of filters that is those used in the 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.320
 cinema on television in almost all are 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.720
 the filters or the filters rosco these 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.190
 are the ones that are used for everything and what 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.290
 I like these brands is that they do not 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.790
 they only make filters to correct 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.070
 color temperature they also do things 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.169
 pretty crazy look for example this 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.490
 green that we have here, although we 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.530
 it serves to correct some temperatures 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.540
 colors also helps us to make 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.460
 very creative things here for example 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.930
 we have a red one that helps us 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.290
 correct any color temperature 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.360
 but we already know what it can be used for 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.310
 this one here is magenta and I used it only one 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.950
 time and look at the things he does about me 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.170
 face 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.150
 it's a fun filter all filters 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.280
 They are so funny I hope that 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.870
 have fun using them so good I hope 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.270
 that this tutorial has served you 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.890
 they liked to put me like it down there 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.630
 comment on the video and do not hesitate 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.490
 subscribe for new tutorials all 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.740
 the very important weeks very 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.020
 important is that they share this video 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.820
 with your friends remember to share 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.890
 it makes them better people and better 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.510
 photographers and remember that if they have 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.800
 some kind of questions suggestion or 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.150
 they want to ask for a tutorial for more 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.010
 Further, you can contact me at 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:41.050
