the<00:04:25.030> van<00:04:25.300> I<00:04:25.540> barely<00:04:25.960> didn't<00:04:26.320> do<00:04:26.410> anything<00:04:26.770> as

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
the van I barely didn't do anything as

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.000 
the van I barely didn't do anything as
this<00:04:27.640> car<00:04:27.910> I<00:04:28.150> think<00:04:28.810> it's<00:04:28.930> too<00:04:29.110> heavy<00:04:29.140> in<00:04:29.590> the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
this car I think it's too heavy in the

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.440 
this car I think it's too heavy in the
lighter<00:04:30.220> cars<00:04:30.490> go<00:04:30.670> a<00:04:30.700> lot<00:04:30.880> further<00:04:31.060> in<00:04:31.330> my

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
lighter cars go a lot further in my

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.930 
lighter cars go a lot further in my
opinion<00:04:32.310> so<00:04:33.310> I<00:04:34.980> prefer<00:04:35.980> the<00:04:36.340> lighter<00:04:36.580> lower

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
opinion so I prefer the lighter lower

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.850 
opinion so I prefer the lighter lower
cars<00:04:37.330> instead<00:04:37.630> of<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.900> bigger<00:04:38.140> trucks<00:04:38.620> or

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
cars instead of the bigger trucks or

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.150 
cars instead of the bigger trucks or
vans<00:04:39.570> there<00:04:40.570> as<00:04:41.020> it<00:04:41.170> go<00:04:41.290> song<00:04:41.560> I<00:04:41.740> fill<00:04:41.950> out<00:04:42.040> the

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160

vans there as it go song I fill out the
front<00:04:42.370> wheel<00:04:42.550> chilled<00:04:42.910> and<00:04:43.150> then<00:04:44.050> die<00:04:44.290> hitting

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
front wheel chilled and then die hitting

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.970

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
you can see right there they don't

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.930 
you can see right there they don't
really<00:04:53.170> work<00:04:53.440> either<00:04:53.680> because<00:04:54.040> there's<00:04:54.820> no

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
really work either because there's no

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.330 
really work either because there's no
doors<00:04:55.240> and<00:04:55.570> no<00:04:55.920> windshields<00:04:56.920> to<00:04:56.980> stop<00:04:57.190> you
