00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello all welcome to this you 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.819
 change lives on doctissimo 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.170
 if I tell you that 180 thousand deaths are 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.120
 caused each year by diseases 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.920
 cardiovascular you think everything from 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.429
 following cholesterol and it's a good 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.410
 reflex 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.540
 provided you know your own rate 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.560
 cholesterol because that it can 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.560
 really change your mind 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.250
 at the base of cholesterol it is rather a 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.109
 friend or even very good friends because he is 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.220
 just essential to life it's him 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.750
 especially who make all our 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.790
 cells and all our hormones but 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.690
 it's a bit like doctor jekyll and 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.309
 mister hyde 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.680
 because there is the good and the bad 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.110
 cholesterol so our good is the hdl 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.850
 the bad is the ldl and it using 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.440
 too much can happen 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.940
 turn into an executioner of hearts but 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.129
 not in the good sense of the word since 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.930
 will invade your vessels and your arteries 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.579
 causing for example angina of 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.500
 chest then precisely you who me 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.519
 was watching there do you have an idea of your 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.680
 cholesterol 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.699

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.960
 immediately with your doctor 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.640
 with him would you make a point on your 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.080
 diet he will prescribe you a plug 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.879
 of blood then there are also tests 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.949
 you can buy in pharmacy 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.540

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.549

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.049
 may be a maximum of 2 grams 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.700
 per liter of blood the ham street in 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.960

 it's also paying attention to his 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.399
 feeding then a time gap in 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.079
 time is not a big deal but know
