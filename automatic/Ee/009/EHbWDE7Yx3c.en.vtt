wants to make a custom exhaust for their

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.190 
wants to make a custom exhaust for their
ride<00:00:04.500> on<00:00:04.650> mower<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:05.540> its<00:00:06.540> really<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.899> reason

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
ride on mower and its really the reason

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.810 
ride on mower and its really the reason
why<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.350> had<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.500> do<00:00:07.710> this<00:00:07.859> for<00:00:08.040> mine<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.490> because

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
why I had to do this for mine is because

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.209 
why I had to do this for mine is because
this<00:00:09.059> muffler<00:00:09.330> is<00:00:09.660> too<00:00:09.900> big<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.769> fit<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.099> this

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
this muffler is too big to fit in this

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.400 
this muffler is too big to fit in this
flock<00:00:11.519> this<00:00:12.120> engine<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.509> not<00:00:12.540> forstride<00:00:13.170> on

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
flock this engine is not forstride on

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.279 
flock this engine is not forstride on
mower<00:00:13.700> so<00:00:14.700> what<00:00:14.910> I've<00:00:15.000> done<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.450> I've<00:00:15.960> put<00:00:16.199> this

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
mower so what I've done is I've put this

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.400 
mower so what I've done is I've put this
extension<00:00:16.859> pipe<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.480> bolted<00:00:18.930> using<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
extension pipe in and I bolted using the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.380 
extension pipe in and I bolted using the
original<00:00:19.529> bolts<00:00:20.070> from<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.279> muffler<00:00:20.760> I've

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
original bolts from the muffler I've

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.060 
original bolts from the muffler I've
bolted<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:22.140> onto<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:23.310> extension<00:00:23.699> pipe<00:00:24.019> now

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
bolted that onto that extension pipe now

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.470 
bolted that onto that extension pipe now
originally<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.580> muffle<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.000> should<00:00:27.269> be<00:00:27.390> in

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
originally this muffle it should be in

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.390 
originally this muffle it should be in
there<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.810> say<00:00:28.050> but<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.710> can't<00:00:29.039> because

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
there like I say but I can't because

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.240 
there like I say but I can't because
this<00:00:29.699> steering<00:00:30.240> arm<00:00:30.539> down<00:00:31.050> here<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
this steering arm down here is in the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.030 
this steering arm down here is in the
way<00:00:32.930> now<00:00:33.930> smaller<00:00:34.290> engine<00:00:34.590> will<00:00:34.710> fit<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:34.950> there

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
way now smaller engine will fit in there

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.389 
way now smaller engine will fit in there
no<00:00:35.219> problem<00:00:35.550> at<00:00:35.610> all<00:00:35.780> but<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.870> one<00:00:37.050> doesn't

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
no problem at all but this one doesn't

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.680 
no problem at all but this one doesn't
now<00:00:38.399> there<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.640> an<00:00:38.730> alternative<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.450> as

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
now there is an alternative to this as

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.720 
now there is an alternative to this as
well<00:00:39.840> as<00:00:39.989> doing<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.410> there<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.460> buy<00:00:41.640> an

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
well as doing this there is to buy an

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.549 
well as doing this there is to buy an
official<00:00:42.090> part<00:00:42.329> which<00:00:42.899> already<00:00:43.260> comes<00:00:43.469> with

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
official part which already comes with

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.410 
official part which already comes with
this<00:00:43.770> extension<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.520> then<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.210> got<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
this extension and then it's got the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.000 
this extension and then it's got the
muffler<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.899> end<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.620> fact<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:46.980> just

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
muffler on the end in fact it's just

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.750 
muffler on the end in fact it's just
over<00:00:47.309> here<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.610> I'm<00:00:47.700> going<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.879> show<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:49.760> one

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
over here so I'm going to show you one

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.150 
over here so I'm going to show you one
of<00:00:50.879> these<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.770> comes<00:00:53.010> with

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
of these you can see that it comes with

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.209 
of these you can see that it comes with
its<00:00:54.090> extension<00:00:54.899> pipe<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:55.770> it's<00:00:55.980> welded

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
its extension pipe and then it's welded

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.240 
its extension pipe and then it's welded
on<00:00:56.489> there<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:57.420> muffler<00:00:57.750> part<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> end<00:00:58.289> now

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
on there the muffler part on the end now

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.520 
on there the muffler part on the end now
that<00:00:59.280> was<00:00:59.730> all<00:00:59.850> right<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.629> did<00:01:00.840> use<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.079> for

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
that was all right and I did use it for

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.210 
that was all right and I did use it for
a<00:01:01.559> while<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.520> see<00:01:02.840> it's<00:01:03.840> used<00:01:04.189> but<00:01:05.189> I

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
a while as you can see it's used but I

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.160 
a while as you can see it's used but I
found<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.640> was<00:01:05.820> very<00:01:06.000> loud<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.600> these

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
found that was very loud and these

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.310 
found that was very loud and these
mufflers<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.890> me<00:01:08.040> seem<00:01:08.520> quite<00:01:08.760> quiet<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
mufflers to me seem quite quiet and to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.200 
mufflers to me seem quite quiet and to
be<00:01:10.409> honest<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.740> don't<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.430> loud<00:01:11.670> mower<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
be honest I don't like a loud mower and

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.600 
be honest I don't like a loud mower and
so<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.110> wanted<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.500> stick<00:01:13.890> around<00:01:14.040> these<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
so I wanted to stick around these and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.820 
so I wanted to stick around these and
probably<00:01:14.790> soon<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.869> will<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.140> buying<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.470> new<00:01:16.650> one

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
probably soon I will be buying a new one

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.530 
probably soon I will be buying a new one
of<00:01:16.950> these<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.430> actually<00:01:17.700> bonds<00:01:18.030> here<00:01:18.270> instead

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
of these to actually bonds here instead

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.020 
of these to actually bonds here instead
of<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.869> want<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.530> was<00:01:19.770> purely<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.460> test<00:01:20.759> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
of this I want this was purely a test to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.679 
of this I want this was purely a test to
see<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.360> worked

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
see if it worked

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.480 
see if it worked
and<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.900> actually<00:01:22.020> worked<00:01:22.409> very<00:01:22.590> well<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:23.430> just

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
and it actually worked very well it just

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.800 
and it actually worked very well it just
needs<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.850> few<00:01:24.030> modifications<00:01:24.600> here<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.380> there

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
needs a few modifications here and there

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.179 
needs a few modifications here and there
so<00:01:27.810> yeah<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.829> what<00:01:29.009> I've<00:01:29.070> come

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
so yeah this is this is what I've come

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.969 
so yeah this is this is what I've come
up<00:01:29.310> with<00:01:29.750> bolted<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.869> onto<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.350> extension

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
up with bolted this onto this extension

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.289 
up with bolted this onto this extension
pipe<00:01:32.130> which<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.340> actually<00:01:32.490> found<00:01:32.820> which<00:01:33.270> was

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
pipe which I actually found which was

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.210 
pipe which I actually found which was
struggle<00:01:34.079> oak<00:01:34.200> because<00:01:34.530> I've<00:01:34.950> been<00:01:35.100> looking

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
struggle oak because I've been looking

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.560 
struggle oak because I've been looking
for<00:01:35.430> these<00:01:35.490> everywhere<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.880> can't<00:01:36.180> find<00:01:36.479> them

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
for these everywhere I can't find them

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.410 
for these everywhere I can't find them
on<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.659> internet<00:01:37.020> can't<00:01:37.259> find<00:01:37.439> them<00:01:37.560> anywhere

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
on the internet can't find them anywhere

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.390 
on the internet can't find them anywhere
I'm<00:01:39.420> sure<00:01:39.869> they're<00:01:40.079> out<00:01:40.170> there<00:01:40.380> somewhere<00:01:40.770> but

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
I'm sure they're out there somewhere but

I'm sure they're out there somewhere but
this<00:01:41.700> was<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:41.909> kicking<00:01:42.240> about<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.930> I've<00:01:43.049> used

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
this was just kicking about so I've used

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.330 
this was just kicking about so I've used
it<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:44.299> yeah<00:01:45.299> I've<00:01:45.659> just<00:01:45.720> used<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:47.189> original

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
it and yeah I've just used the original

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.700 
it and yeah I've just used the original
muster<00:01:47.759> bolts<00:01:48.030> bolted<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.659> onto<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.110> bracket

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
muster bolts bolted it onto that bracket

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.190 
muster bolts bolted it onto that bracket
there<00:01:49.890> put<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> gasket<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.149> there<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.630> then<00:01:51.960> I

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
there put a gasket in there and then I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.510 
there put a gasket in there and then I
don't<00:01:52.229> know<00:01:52.439> how<00:01:52.560> well<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.799> can<00:01:52.890> see<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.340> I

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
just get a light hopefully you can see

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.469 
just get a light hopefully you can see
in<00:01:57.600> there<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.930> there's<00:01:58.829> two<00:01:59.000> gaskets<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.090> X<00:02:00.329> it

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
in there and there's two gaskets in X it

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.940 
in there and there's two gaskets in X it
was<00:02:00.600> leaking<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.960> bit<00:02:01.110> making<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.530> bit<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.710> excess

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
was leaking a bit making a bit of excess

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.550 
was leaking a bit making a bit of excess
noise<00:02:02.390> but<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.600> really<00:02:03.899> just<00:02:03.960> two<00:02:04.229> bolts

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
noise but that is really just two bolts

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.200 
noise but that is really just two bolts
that's<00:02:04.740> put<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.009> there<00:02:05.130> with<00:02:05.340> two<00:02:05.369> gaskets<00:02:06.030> and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
that's put in there with two gaskets and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.080 
that's put in there with two gaskets and
it's<00:02:07.110> actually<00:02:07.740> really<00:02:08.099> nice<00:02:08.429> now<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.970> it's

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
going to take it apart completely

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.670 
going to take it apart completely
because<00:02:13.230> I've<00:02:13.379> put

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
because I've put

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.709 
because I've put
locking<00:02:14.040> nuts<00:02:14.219> on<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.640> it's<00:02:15.239> nice<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.599> secure

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:15.719

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.949 
locking nuts on and it's nice and secure
and<00:02:16.170> sturdy<00:02:16.890> on<00:02:17.250> there<00:02:17.519> so<00:02:18.450> I'd<00:02:18.569> like<00:02:18.689> to<00:02:18.840> keep

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
and sturdy on there so I'd like to keep

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.990 
and sturdy on there so I'd like to keep
it<00:02:19.140> as<00:02:19.260> one<00:02:19.290> complete<00:02:19.650> unit<00:02:19.950> but<00:02:20.730> I'll<00:02:20.819> show

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
it as one complete unit but I'll show

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.819 
it as one complete unit but I'll show
you<00:02:21.060> what<00:02:21.239> I've<00:02:21.299> done<00:02:21.359> I've<00:02:22.349> taken<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
you what I've done I've taken the

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.860 
you what I've done I've taken the
bracket<00:02:23.159> off<00:02:23.250> there<00:02:23.489> which<00:02:23.760> originally<00:02:24.420> used

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
bracket off there which originally used

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.539 
bracket off there which originally used
to<00:02:25.019> bar<00:02:25.200> into<00:02:25.439> the<00:02:25.530> front<00:02:25.829> of<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.040> engine<00:02:26.370> just

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
to bar into the front of the engine just

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.089 
to bar into the front of the engine just
on<00:02:27.090> there<00:02:27.329> you<00:02:27.420> can't<00:02:27.629> really<00:02:27.750> see<00:02:27.989> but<00:02:28.200> there

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
on there you can't really see but there

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.089 
on there you can't really see but there
was<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.430> bracket<00:02:30.030> on<00:02:30.090> there<00:02:30.359> and<00:02:30.739> so<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.799> cut<00:02:31.980> it

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
was a bracket on there and so to cut it

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.390 
was a bracket on there and so to cut it
off<00:02:32.189> you<00:02:32.670> can<00:02:32.819> use<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:32.939> hacksaw<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.629> and

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
off you can use a hacksaw for that and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.209 
off you can use a hacksaw for that and
then<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.430> found<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:36.000> pipe<00:02:36.450> like<00:02:36.659> a<00:02:36.689> site<00:02:37.219> which

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.219 
then I found this pipe like a site which

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.990 
then I found this pipe like a site which
is<00:02:38.569> well<00:02:39.569> very<00:02:40.109> rusty<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.980> it's<00:02:41.549> just<00:02:41.730> kicking

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
is well very rusty and it's just kicking

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.750 
is well very rusty and it's just kicking
about

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
about

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.470 
about
so<00:02:44.760> yeah<00:02:44.879> it's<00:02:45.030> got<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.389> standard<00:02:46.189> exhaust

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
so yeah it's got a standard exhaust

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.619 
so yeah it's got a standard exhaust
gasket<00:02:48.480> off<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.730> engine<00:02:50.730> model<00:02:51.120> number<00:02:51.389> and

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
gasket off this engine model number and

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.559 
gasket off this engine model number and
that<00:02:52.230> fits<00:02:52.680> perfectly<00:02:53.159> luckily<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.180> bracket

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
that fits perfectly luckily this bracket

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.509 
that fits perfectly luckily this bracket
was<00:02:54.689> exactly<00:02:55.079> the<00:02:55.230> right<00:02:55.349> size<00:02:55.590> which<00:02:56.280> was<00:02:56.489> a

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
was exactly the right size which was a

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.289 
was exactly the right size which was a
big<00:02:56.730> help<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:58.200> then<00:02:58.620> behind<00:02:59.129> that<00:02:59.579> gasket<00:03:00.060> is

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
big help and then behind that gasket is

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.940 
big help and then behind that gasket is
this<00:03:00.719> place<00:03:01.019> that's<00:03:01.349> just<00:03:01.560> like<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.709> heat

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
this place that's just like a heat

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.830 
this place that's just like a heat
deflector<00:03:02.370> plate<00:03:02.579> so<00:03:02.939> you<00:03:03.180> don't<00:03:03.480> touch<00:03:03.689> the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
deflector plate so you don't touch the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.920 
deflector plate so you don't touch the
muffler<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.439> also<00:03:05.159> to<00:03:05.219> stop<00:03:05.459> those<00:03:05.930> muffler

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
muffler and also to stop those muffler

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.890 
muffler and also to stop those muffler
bolts<00:03:07.230> from<00:03:07.349> coming<00:03:07.680> loose<00:03:07.709> in<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.099> rain<00:03:08.250> and

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
bolts from coming loose in the rain and

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.170 
bolts from coming loose in the rain and
then<00:03:09.900> it's<00:03:10.019> just<00:03:10.139> two<00:03:10.260> locking<00:03:10.530> nuts<00:03:10.709> so<00:03:11.489> I'm

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
then it's just two locking nuts so I'm

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.849 
then it's just two locking nuts so I'm
very<00:03:12.359> happy<00:03:12.750> with<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.230> can<00:03:13.500> see<00:03:13.680> it's

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
very happy with that you can see it's

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.069 
very happy with that you can see it's
not<00:03:14.129> great<00:03:14.370> condition<00:03:14.849> but<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.510> does<00:03:15.719> the<00:03:15.870> job

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
not great condition but it does the job

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.319 
not great condition but it does the job
and<00:03:16.139> it<00:03:16.409> is<00:03:16.500> relatively<00:03:17.280> quiet<00:03:17.669> compared<00:03:18.209> to

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
and it is relatively quiet compared to

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.420 
and it is relatively quiet compared to
what<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.599> was<00:03:18.750> like<00:03:18.930> so<00:03:19.290> I'm<00:03:19.470> very<00:03:19.680> pleased

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
what it was like so I'm very pleased

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.180 
what it was like so I'm very pleased
with<00:03:20.459> that

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
with that

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.059 
with that
so<00:03:23.190> yeah<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.519> end<00:03:23.909> is<00:03:24.419> slightly<00:03:25.199> bent<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.949> I

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
so yeah this end is slightly bent and I

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.710 
so yeah this end is slightly bent and I
had<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.340> use<00:03:26.459> two<00:03:26.489> gaskets<00:03:27.180> in<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.389> end<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.629> get

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
had to use two gaskets in the end to get

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.080 
had to use two gaskets in the end to get
a<00:03:27.780> good<00:03:27.930> seal<00:03:28.199> you<00:03:29.069> probably<00:03:29.400> won't<00:03:29.609> need<00:03:29.849> to

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
a good seal you probably won't need to

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.479 
a good seal you probably won't need to
yeah<00:03:30.299> see<00:03:30.359> why<00:03:30.689> I<00:03:30.720> did<00:03:31.079> but<00:03:31.439> they're<00:03:32.159> the<00:03:32.280> two

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
yeah see why I did but they're the two

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.119 
yeah see why I did but they're the two
and<00:03:32.840> they<00:03:33.840> work<00:03:34.049> well<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.680> worked<00:03:34.889> very<00:03:34.949> well

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
and they work well it worked very well

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.429 
and they work well it worked very well
here<00:03:35.519> so<00:03:36.389> I<00:03:36.419> just<00:03:36.569> have<00:03:36.689> to<00:03:36.780> put<00:03:36.930> two<00:03:37.109> on<00:03:37.260> there

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:37.439 
here so I just have to put two on there

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.740 
here so I just have to put two on there
because<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.680> was<00:03:37.769> blowing<00:03:38.370> out<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.669> side<00:03:38.879> but

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
because it was blowing out the side but

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.719 
because it was blowing out the side but
with<00:03:39.900> those<00:03:39.989> two<00:03:40.049> on<00:03:40.379> there<00:03:40.620> does<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.370> very<00:03:41.609> good

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:41.729 
with those two on there does a very good

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.550 
with those two on there does a very good
job<00:03:41.790> so<00:03:42.209> if<00:03:42.720> you<00:03:42.810> make<00:03:42.959> one<00:03:43.079> of<00:03:43.169> these<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.470> it

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
job so if you make one of these and it

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.289 
job so if you make one of these and it
does<00:03:43.709> leak<00:03:43.949> just<00:03:44.400> put<00:03:44.609> another<00:03:44.759> gasket<00:03:45.180> in

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
does leak just put another gasket in

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.550 
does leak just put another gasket in
there<00:03:45.509> and<00:03:45.750> then<00:03:46.680> I've<00:03:47.250> just<00:03:47.310> got<00:03:47.639> to<00:03:48.560> used

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
there and then I've just got to used

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.759 
there and then I've just got to used
that<00:03:49.949> you<00:03:50.069> use<00:03:50.280> not<00:03:50.519> new<00:03:51.030> just<00:03:51.540> bolts<00:03:51.930> these

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
that you use not new just bolts these

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.089 
that you use not new just bolts these
are<00:03:52.949> imperial<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:54.229> I've<00:03:55.229> put<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.500> washer<00:03:55.709> and

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
are imperial and I've put a washer and

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.909 
are imperial and I've put a washer and
an<00:03:56.639> anti-vibration<00:03:57.319> washer<00:03:58.319> on<00:03:58.439> there<00:03:58.650> and

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
an anti-vibration washer on there and

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.530 
an anti-vibration washer on there and
they<00:03:59.189> hold<00:03:59.400> it<00:03:59.519> very<00:03:59.759> very<00:03:59.939> tight<00:04:00.060> onto<00:04:00.449> the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
they hold it very very tight onto the

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.479 
they hold it very very tight onto the
engine<00:04:00.629> and<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.620> doesn't<00:04:01.889> wobble<00:04:02.040> around<00:04:02.220> at

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
engine and it doesn't wobble around at

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.039 
engine and it doesn't wobble around at
all<00:04:02.669> there's<00:04:03.060> no<00:04:03.120> signs<00:04:03.509> of<00:04:03.599> becoming<00:04:03.930> loose

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
all there's no signs of becoming loose

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.360 
all there's no signs of becoming loose
or<00:04:04.259> anything<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.620> I've<00:04:04.739> been<00:04:04.859> using<00:04:05.040> it<00:04:05.220> for<00:04:05.250> a

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
or anything and I've been using it for a

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.789 
or anything and I've been using it for a
while<00:04:05.489> so<00:04:06.359> that<00:04:06.659> is<00:04:06.959> pretty<00:04:07.139> much<00:04:07.319> it<00:04:07.379> it<00:04:07.680> just

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
while so that is pretty much it it just

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.069 
while so that is pretty much it it just
needs<00:04:08.009> bolting<00:04:08.370> back<00:04:08.519> on<00:04:08.669> now<00:04:08.879> as<00:04:09.780> you

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
needs bolting back on now as you

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.449 
needs bolting back on now as you
probably<00:04:10.349> already<00:04:10.590> know<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:11.009> goes<00:04:11.159> into<00:04:11.340> here

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
probably already know it goes into here

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.819 
probably already know it goes into here
this<00:04:11.909> is<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.150> exhaust<00:04:12.389> port<00:04:12.780> two<00:04:13.379> bolts<00:04:13.680> go

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
this is the exhaust port two bolts go

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.259 
this is the exhaust port two bolts go
through<00:04:13.889> those<00:04:14.189> holes<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.729> they're<00:04:14.909> threaded

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
through those holes and they're threaded

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.499 
through those holes and they're threaded
and<00:04:15.799> I<00:04:16.799> just<00:04:17.430> need<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.639> get<00:04:17.759> the<00:04:17.849> two<00:04:18.000> gaskets

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 
and I just need to get the two gaskets

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:23.780 
and I just need to get the two gaskets
and<00:04:19.159> put<00:04:20.159> these<00:04:20.310> on<00:04:20.549> top<00:04:20.789> of<00:04:21.380> this<00:04:22.380> muffler

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
and put these on top of this muffler

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.650 
and put these on top of this muffler
pipe<00:04:24.830> lines<00:04:25.830> to<00:04:26.130> holes<00:04:26.370> up<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:26.850> then<00:04:27.180> put<00:04:27.570> the

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
pipe lines to holes up and then put the

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.170 
pipe lines to holes up and then put the
two<00:04:27.840> bolts<00:04:28.170> through<00:04:29.450> just<00:04:30.450> put<00:04:30.630> those<00:04:30.750> in<00:04:30.920> to

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
two bolts through just put those in to

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.030 
two bolts through just put those in to
gaskets<00:04:33.180> on<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.420> top<00:04:35.420> and<00:04:36.500> then<00:04:37.500> here's<00:04:37.950> the

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
gaskets on the top and then here's the

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.490 
gaskets on the top and then here's the
tricky<00:04:38.400> bit<00:04:38.550> holding<00:04:39.480> it<00:04:39.570> all<00:04:39.660> together<00:04:39.810> and

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
tricky bit holding it all together and

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:54.999 
tricky bit holding it all together and
bolting<00:04:40.860> it<00:04:40.950> on

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.139 

so<00:04:56.009> that's<00:04:56.189> the<00:04:56.309> two<00:04:56.459> bolts<00:04:56.819> in<00:04:56.909> there

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:57.149 
so that's the two bolts in there

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:59.269 
so that's the two bolts in there
finger-tight<00:04:57.719> just<00:04:58.439> need<00:04:58.559> to<00:04:58.649> tighten<00:04:58.799> up<00:04:59.039> now

00:04:59.269 --> 00:04:59.279 
finger-tight just need to tighten up now

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:00.949 
finger-tight just need to tighten up now
don't<00:04:59.909> overdo<00:05:00.269> it<00:05:00.299> because<00:05:00.449> it's<00:05:00.689> only<00:05:00.809> aa

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:00.959 
don't overdo it because it's only aa

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:03.769 
don't overdo it because it's only aa
minium<00:05:01.459> and<00:05:02.459> you<00:05:02.579> can<00:05:02.729> very<00:05:03.119> easily<00:05:03.209> strip<00:05:03.719> the

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:03.779 
minium and you can very easily strip the

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:09.439 
minium and you can very easily strip the
threads<00:05:03.809> so<00:05:05.779> just<00:05:06.779> until<00:05:07.049> it's<00:05:07.199> tight<00:05:08.449> just

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
threads so just until it's tight just

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:15.039 
threads so just until it's tight just
overdo<00:05:10.019> it

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:15.049 

00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:18.709 

also<00:05:16.049> don't<00:05:16.259> do<00:05:16.469> one<00:05:17.009> time<00:05:17.309> and<00:05:17.579> one<00:05:17.969> still

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:18.719 
also don't do one time and one still

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:29.899 
also don't do one time and one still
looseness<00:05:19.019> you<00:05:19.589> go<00:05:19.829> gradually<00:05:28.159> and<00:05:29.159> that's<00:05:29.639> it

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
looseness you go gradually and that's it

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:30.979 
looseness you go gradually and that's it
that's<00:05:30.029> all<00:05:30.239> there<00:05:30.360> is<00:05:30.419> to<00:05:30.689> it

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:30.989 
that's all there is to it

00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:32.509 
that's all there is to it
you<00:05:31.139> can<00:05:31.259> see<00:05:31.409> it's<00:05:31.529> very<00:05:31.589> sturdy<00:05:32.009> on<00:05:32.279> there

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:32.519 
you can see it's very sturdy on there

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:35.389 
you can see it's very sturdy on there
and<00:05:33.229> now<00:05:34.229> going<00:05:34.379> to<00:05:34.469> strike<00:05:34.949> this<00:05:35.039> thing<00:05:35.279> up

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:35.399 
and now going to strike this thing up

00:05:35.399 --> 00:07:01.630 
and now going to strike this thing up
and<00:05:35.610> I'll<00:05:35.729> show<00:05:35.909> you<00:05:35.969> it<00:05:36.089> running

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:01.640 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.340 

one<00:07:02.640> thing<00:07:02.940> to<00:07:03.150> note<00:07:03.330> which<00:07:03.870> I<00:07:03.990> will<00:07:04.140> be<00:07:04.230> doing

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
one thing to note which I will be doing

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.890 
one thing to note which I will be doing
is<00:07:04.800> this<00:07:05.520> pipe<00:07:05.790> you<00:07:06.180> can<00:07:06.240> see<00:07:06.450> it's<00:07:06.570> very<00:07:06.600> close

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
is this pipe you can see it's very close

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.990 
is this pipe you can see it's very close
to<00:07:06.930> that<00:07:07.110> carburetor<00:07:07.440> ball<00:07:07.800> and<00:07:08.010> I<00:07:08.760> will<00:07:08.880> be

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
to that carburetor ball and I will be

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.970 
to that carburetor ball and I will be
putting<00:07:09.240> some<00:07:09.390> heat<00:07:09.600> wrap<00:07:09.810> on<00:07:09.990> this<00:07:10.170> this<00:07:10.770> will

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:10.980 
putting some heat wrap on this this will

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.310 
putting some heat wrap on this this will
stop<00:07:11.190> it<00:07:11.220> from<00:07:11.600> letting<00:07:12.600> heat<00:07:12.870> out<00:07:13.050> onto<00:07:13.290> that

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
stop it from letting heat out onto that

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.680
