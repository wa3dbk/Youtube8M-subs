when you go to videos the gyro

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.400 
when you go to videos the gyro
stabilization<00:02:29.410> goes<00:02:30.220> into<00:02:30.489> action<00:02:31.410> which

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
stabilization goes into action which

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.130 
stabilization goes into action which
makes<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:33.010> slow<00:02:33.310> down<00:02:33.519> during<00:02:33.760> videos<00:02:34.269> the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
makes it slow down during videos the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.800 
makes it slow down during videos the

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
volunteer evermark which is obviously

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.969 
volunteer evermark which is obviously
for<00:04:16.510> trim<00:04:16.780> sort<00:04:17.079> of<00:04:17.139> your<00:04:17.320> helicopter<00:04:17.889> is

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
good I'll try and bring up close but

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.040 
good I'll try and bring up close but
very<00:05:26.350> much<00:05:26.530> control<00:05:27.460> them<00:05:27.850> these<00:05:28.390> patrols<00:05:28.810> is

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
very much control them these patrols is

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.370 
very much control them these patrols is
a<00:05:29.080> bad<00:05:29.440> thing<00:05:29.470> about<00:05:29.800> this<00:05:30.100> it's<00:05:31.090> a<00:05:31.380> obvious

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
a bad thing about this it's a obvious

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.320 
a bad thing about this it's a obvious
flying<00:05:32.800> use<00:05:32.980> a<00:05:33.010> couple<00:05:33.310> years<00:05:33.550> about<00:05:33.850> sticky

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
flying use a couple years about sticky

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.580 
flying use a couple years about sticky
so<00:05:36.240> course<00:05:37.240> I<00:05:37.450> could<00:05:37.630> take<00:05:37.810> a<00:05:37.840> video<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.530> then

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
so course I could take a video and then

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.790 
so course I could take a video and then
we<00:05:39.070> could<00:05:39.280> mount<00:05:39.520> it<00:05:39.820> not<00:05:40.780> mounted<00:05:41.170> and<00:05:41.410> put<00:05:41.710> it

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
we could mount it not mounted and put it

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.550 
we could mount it not mounted and put it
with<00:05:41.890> a<00:05:41.950> real<00:05:42.130> video<00:05:42.370> if<00:05:42.490> you<00:05:42.580> want<00:05:43.410> you<00:05:44.410> like

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
with a real video if you want you like

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.450 
with a real video if you want you like
to<00:05:44.710> do<00:05:44.800> that<00:05:45.010> I<00:05:45.340> guess<00:05:46.300> we<00:05:46.600> should<00:05:46.840> do<00:05:46.990> that<00:05:47.460> but

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
to do that I guess we should do that but

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.670 
to do that I guess we should do that but
I<00:05:48.730> freken<00:05:49.360> this<00:05:49.510> one<00:05:49.720> will<00:05:49.900> be<00:05:50.050> going<00:05:50.290> up<00:05:50.410> first

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
I freken this one will be going up first

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.290 
I freken this one will be going up first
and<00:05:51.040> then<00:05:51.100> maybe<00:05:51.370> we'll<00:05:51.520> add<00:05:51.670> that<00:05:51.700> video<00:05:52.150> and

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
and then maybe we'll add that video and

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.460 
and then maybe we'll add that video and
after<00:05:54.450> people<00:05:55.450> would<00:05:55.570> be<00:05:55.660> anxious<00:05:56.140> to<00:05:56.290> see

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
after people would be anxious to see
