is<00:04:23.940> I<00:04:23.970> think<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.509> think<00:04:24.870> it's<00:04:25.020> it's<00:04:25.349> a<00:04:25.440> very

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
is I think I think it's it's a very

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.740 
is I think I think it's it's a very
novel<00:04:25.919> idea<00:04:26.430> I<00:04:26.520> can<00:04:26.789> understand<00:04:27.270> why<00:04:27.509> you'd

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
novel idea I can understand why you'd

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.770 
novel idea I can understand why you'd
want<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.080> do<00:04:28.289> it<00:04:28.440> but<00:04:29.030> don't<00:04:30.030> be<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.180> dickhead

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
want to do it but don't be a dickhead

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.719 
want to do it but don't be a dickhead
okay<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.530> movement<00:04:31.919> is<00:04:32.070> not<00:04:32.099> worthy<00:04:32.550> of

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
okay the movement is not worthy of

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.170 
okay the movement is not worthy of
display<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:33.599> I<00:04:34.529> think<00:04:34.979> it's<00:04:35.580> best<00:04:35.849> if<00:04:36.029> you

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
display and I think it's best if you

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.250 
display and I think it's best if you
just<00:04:36.440> don't<00:04:37.440> damage<00:04:37.740> the

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
just don't damage the

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.830 
just don't damage the
water<00:04:38.380> proofing<00:04:38.890> integrity<00:04:39.610> and<00:04:39.880> I<00:04:40.540> think

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
water proofing integrity and I think

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.630 
water proofing integrity and I think
it's<00:04:40.960> best<00:04:41.170> just<00:04:41.290> to<00:04:41.560> leave<00:04:41.830> your<00:04:42.070> Rolex<00:04:42.310> the

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
it's best just to leave your Rolex the

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.850 
it's best just to leave your Rolex the
way<00:04:42.760> it<00:04:42.910> is<00:04:43.030> if<00:04:43.180> you<00:04:43.300> want<00:04:43.510> a<00:04:43.660> a<00:04:43.900> real<00:04:44.500> piece<00:04:44.830> of
