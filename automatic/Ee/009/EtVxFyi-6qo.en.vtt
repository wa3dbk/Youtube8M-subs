in<00:00:00.060> this<00:00:00.539> video<00:00:00.840> I'll<00:00:01.110> be<00:00:01.170> comparing<00:00:01.770> six

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
in this video I'll be comparing six

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.070 
in this video I'll be comparing six
different<00:00:02.340> HD<00:00:02.850> action<00:00:03.030> cams<00:00:03.419> in<00:00:03.689> two

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
different HD action cams in two

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.050 
different HD action cams in two
different<00:00:04.259> form<00:00:04.620> factor<00:00:05.009> categories<00:00:05.549> first

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
different form factor categories first

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.059 
different form factor categories first
we<00:00:06.240> have<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.540> möbius<00:00:06.960> type<00:00:07.200> form<00:00:07.440> factor<00:00:07.859> and

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
we have the möbius type form factor and

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.250 
we have the möbius type form factor and
then<00:00:08.550> we<00:00:08.700> have<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.970> GoPro<00:00:09.330> type<00:00:09.570> form<00:00:09.840> factor

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
then we have the GoPro type form factor

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.230 
then we have the GoPro type form factor
for<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.889> Mobius<00:00:11.250> type<00:00:11.429> we<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.849> course<00:00:12.059> have

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
for the Mobius type we of course have

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.770 
for the Mobius type we of course have
the<00:00:12.269> Mobius<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:13.290> runcam<00:00:13.650> HD<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:15.120> HD<00:00:15.540> tube

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
the Mobius the runcam HD and the HD tube

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.140 
the Mobius the runcam HD and the HD tube
cam<00:00:16.080> now<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.680> avoid<00:00:17.010> wasting<00:00:17.400> time<00:00:17.580> I'll<00:00:17.910> just

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
cam now to avoid wasting time I'll just

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.970 
cam now to avoid wasting time I'll just
come<00:00:18.300> right<00:00:18.449> out<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.660> say<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.170> HD<00:00:19.500> tube<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
come right out and say the HD tube is a

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.490 
come right out and say the HD tube is a
water<00:00:20.189> stick<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.730> wouldn't<00:00:21.210> pay<00:00:21.359> more<00:00:21.570> than<00:00:21.720> $25

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
water stick I wouldn't pay more than $25

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.429 
water stick I wouldn't pay more than $25
for<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:23.180> the<00:00:24.180> video<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.630> way<00:00:24.779> over<00:00:25.019> sharpened

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
for it the video is way over sharpened

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.320 
for it the video is way over sharpened
and<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.830> nmuk<00:00:26.250> range<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.640> colors<00:00:26.910> just<00:00:26.939> suck

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.850 

to<00:00:31.780> compare<00:00:32.080> the<00:00:32.169> rest<00:00:32.320> of<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.500> cameras

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
to compare the rest of the cameras

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.220 
to compare the rest of the cameras
mounted<00:00:33.460> them<00:00:33.790> on<00:00:33.820> to<00:00:34.150> the<00:00:34.239> POV<00:00:34.510> of<00:00:34.690> vibration

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
mounted them on to the POV of vibration

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.110 
mounted them on to the POV of vibration
isolator<00:00:35.590> which<00:00:36.220> is<00:00:36.370> not<00:00:36.520> mounted<00:00:36.670> to<00:00:37.000> the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
isolator which is not mounted to the

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
isolator which is not mounted to the
twin<00:00:37.360> cargo<00:00:37.660> plane

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.930 

the<00:00:42.680> first<00:00:42.860> thing<00:00:43.010> I<00:00:43.100> noticed<00:00:43.490> is<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:43.700> the

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
the first thing I noticed is that the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.910 
the first thing I noticed is that the
runcam<00:00:44.300> has<00:00:44.480> very<00:00:44.690> saturated<00:00:44.930> colors<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:45.860> a

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
runcam has very saturated colors and a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.500 
runcam has very saturated colors and a
warmer<00:00:46.250> image<00:00:46.550> kind<00:00:46.910> of<00:00:46.970> like<00:00:47.060> a<00:00:47.090> GoPro<00:00:47.480> Hero

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
warmer image kind of like a GoPro Hero

00:00:47.510 --> 00:01:04.969 
warmer image kind of like a GoPro Hero
one<00:00:47.960> did

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.190 

if<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:05.759> zoom<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.090> closer<00:01:06.329> you<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.869> tell<00:01:07.079> but

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
if we zoom in closer you can tell but

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.020 
if we zoom in closer you can tell but
runcam<00:01:07.590> also<00:01:07.920> has<00:01:08.039> a<00:01:08.070> more<00:01:08.340> sharpening<00:01:08.700> which

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
runcam also has a more sharpening which

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:21.500 
runcam also has a more sharpening which
is<00:01:09.180> not<00:01:09.299> necessarily<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> good<00:01:10.200> thing

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.930 

with<00:01:22.050> my<00:01:22.230> tests<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.920> seems<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> mobius<00:01:23.640> hangs

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
with my tests it seems the mobius hangs

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.460 
with my tests it seems the mobius hangs
on<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.270> highlight<00:01:24.600> detail<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> little<00:01:25.170> better

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
on to highlight detail a little better

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.500 
on to highlight detail a little better
and<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:26.250> runcam<00:01:26.610> has<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> little<00:01:27.120> more<00:01:27.240> shadow

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
and that runcam has a little more shadow

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.300 
and that runcam has a little more shadow
detail<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.260> basically<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:28.770> means<00:01:29.100> their

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
detail this basically just means their

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.400 
detail this basically just means their
own<00:01:29.430> cams<00:01:29.700> exposure<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> bit<00:01:30.630> brighter<00:01:30.780> now

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
own cams exposure is a bit brighter now

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.470 
own cams exposure is a bit brighter now
the<00:01:31.470> thing<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.950> all<00:01:32.310> these<00:01:32.610> parameters<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.300> just

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
the thing is all these parameters I just

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.210 
the thing is all these parameters I just
compared<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:34.080> be<00:01:34.170> adjusted<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.800> you<00:01:34.890> plug<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
compared can be adjusted if you plug the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.070 
compared can be adjusted if you plug the
camera<00:01:35.370> into<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.760> computer<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.810> spent

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
camera into the computer so if you spent

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.330 
camera into the computer so if you spent
some<00:01:37.200> time<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.410> it<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.980> could<00:01:38.100> probably

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
some time on it you could probably

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.280 
some time on it you could probably
adjust<00:01:38.580> things<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.180> get<00:01:39.330> both<00:01:39.570> images<00:01:40.020> looking

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
adjust things to get both images looking

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.170 
adjust things to get both images looking
nearly<00:01:40.620> identical<00:01:40.770> with<00:01:41.580> that<00:01:41.730> being<00:01:41.940> said

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
nearly identical with that being said

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.550 
nearly identical with that being said
I'd<00:01:42.480> probably<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:43.080> go<00:01:43.230> with<00:01:43.350> whatever

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
I'd probably just go with whatever

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.380 
I'd probably just go with whatever
camera<00:01:43.950> was<00:01:44.160> cheaper<00:01:44.550> there<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.150> one

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
camera was cheaper there is one

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.000 
camera was cheaper there is one
additional<00:01:45.630> benefit<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.230> the<00:01:46.380> run<00:01:46.500> cam<00:01:46.740> and

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
additional benefit to the run cam and

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.440 
additional benefit to the run cam and
that's<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.580> comes<00:01:47.760> with<00:01:47.820> an<00:01:48.000> AV<00:01:48.180> out

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
that's that it comes with an AV out

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.770 
that's that it comes with an AV out
cable<00:01:48.840> for<00:01:48.990> fpv<00:01:49.440> now<00:01:50.280> I'll<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.820> comparing<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
cable for fpv now I'll be comparing the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.310 
cable for fpv now I'll be comparing the
Xiaomi<00:01:52.440> Yi<00:01:52.980> and<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.330> turnigy<00:01:54.330> HD<00:01:54.780> action<00:01:55.140> cam

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
Xiaomi Yi and the turnigy HD action cam

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.800 
Xiaomi Yi and the turnigy HD action cam
the<00:01:55.980> yi<00:01:56.220> has<00:01:56.550> much<00:01:56.790> warmer<00:01:57.150> colors<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.690> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the yi has much warmer colors like the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.690 
the yi has much warmer colors like the
hero<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.320> did<00:01:58.530> now<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.250> looks<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.490> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
hero one did now it looks like the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.490 
hero one did now it looks like the
action<00:02:00.030> cams<00:02:00.210> colors<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> bit<00:02:00.990> cooler<00:02:01.320> than

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
action cams colors are a bit cooler than

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.950 
action cams colors are a bit cooler than
accurate<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:02.940> action<00:02:03.240> cam<00:02:03.390> definitely<00:02:03.810> has<00:02:03.930> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
accurate the action cam definitely has a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.500 
accurate the action cam definitely has a
lot<00:02:04.200> more<00:02:04.260> digital<00:02:04.920> sharpen<00:02:05.360> resulting<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.480> a

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
lot more digital sharpen resulting in a

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.470 
lot more digital sharpen resulting in a
much<00:02:06.720> grainier<00:02:07.230> image<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.430> YZ<00:02:08.670> image<00:02:09.180> looks

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:09.480 
much grainier image the YZ image looks

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.150 
much grainier image the YZ image looks
like<00:02:09.630> it<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:09.930> higher<00:02:10.320> quality<00:02:10.740> overall

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
like it is just higher quality overall

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.430 
like it is just higher quality overall
it<00:02:12.000> definitely<00:02:12.480> has<00:02:12.600> a<00:02:12.630> higher<00:02:12.900> dynamic<00:02:13.110> range

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
it definitely has a higher dynamic range

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.220 
it definitely has a higher dynamic range
and<00:02:13.920> more<00:02:14.100> accurate<00:02:14.520> colors<00:02:14.850> however<00:02:15.600> it<00:02:16.020> is

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
and more accurate colors however it is

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.830 
and more accurate colors however it is
not<00:02:16.350> very<00:02:16.590> sharp<00:02:16.680> at<00:02:17.040> all<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:18.450> lens<00:02:18.660> is

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
not very sharp at all the lens is

not very sharp at all the lens is

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
the downside to this camera is that it

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.929 
the downside to this camera is that it

comparison<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.659> hero4<00:02:42.989> black<00:02:43.200> shooting

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
comparison to the hero4 black shooting

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.190 
comparison to the hero4 black shooting
at<00:02:43.950> 4k<00:02:44.220> 30<00:02:44.670> frames<00:02:44.909> a<00:02:45.060> second<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.750> black<00:02:46.019> is

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
at 4k 30 frames a second the black is

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.199 
at 4k 30 frames a second the black is
obviously<00:02:46.620> much<00:02:46.920> wider<00:02:47.220> than<00:02:47.370> either<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:48.030> has

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
obviously much wider than either and has

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.240 
obviously much wider than either and has
the<00:02:48.329> most<00:02:48.510> accurate<00:02:48.750> colors<00:02:49.319> it's<00:02:49.829> loads

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
the most accurate colors it's loads

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.339 
the most accurate colors it's loads
sharper<00:02:50.849> because<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.480> 4k<00:02:51.870> but<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.230> also

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
sharper because of the 4k but it also

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.869 
sharper because of the 4k but it also
looks<00:02:52.620> like<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.980> optics<00:02:53.370> are<00:02:53.519> much<00:02:53.700> better

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
looks like the optics are much better

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.360 
looks like the optics are much better
this<00:02:54.629> is<00:02:54.810> expected<00:02:55.319> though<00:02:55.500> as<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.890> costs<00:02:56.220> more

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
this is expected though as it costs more

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.250 
this is expected though as it costs more
than<00:02:56.519> four<00:02:56.700> times<00:02:56.909> as<00:02:57.090> much<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.810> dynamic

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
than four times as much the dynamic

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.930 
than four times as much the dynamic
range<00:02:58.409> is<00:02:58.650> much<00:02:58.799> better<00:02:59.010> as<00:02:59.250> well

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.140 

you

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.539 

going<00:03:11.930> back<00:03:12.079> to<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.349> e<00:03:12.379> versus<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.040> HD<00:03:13.370> action

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
going back to the e versus the HD action

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.000 
going back to the e versus the HD action
cam<00:03:13.849> the<00:03:14.420> e<00:03:14.450> definitely<00:03:15.019> wins<00:03:15.230> for<00:03:15.439> image<00:03:15.709> for

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
cam the e definitely wins for image for

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.039 
cam the e definitely wins for image for
the<00:03:16.099> action<00:03:16.400> cam<00:03:16.610> wins<00:03:16.909> for<00:03:17.120> accessories<00:03:17.599> it

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
the action cam wins for accessories it

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.110 
the action cam wins for accessories it
has<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.230> built-in<00:03:18.709> LCD<00:03:18.980> screen<00:03:19.579> which<00:03:19.909> makes

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
has a built-in LCD screen which makes

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.610 
has a built-in LCD screen which makes
changing<00:03:20.629> settings<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.170> framing<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.590> shot

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
changing settings and framing the shot

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.069 
changing settings and framing the shot
really<00:03:22.040> easy<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.939> e<00:03:22.970> has<00:03:23.420> nothing<00:03:23.870> but

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
really easy the e has nothing but

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.809 
really easy the e has nothing but
changing<00:03:24.709> colors<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.069> blinking<00:03:25.610> lights

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
changing colors and blinking lights

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:46.020 
changing colors and blinking lights
which<00:03:26.090> can<00:03:26.269> be<00:03:26.390> really<00:03:26.569> annoying

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.480 

this<00:03:46.600> is<00:03:46.750> before<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:47.260> modified<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:47.980> focus<00:03:48.340> on

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
this is before I modified the focus on

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.750 
this is before I modified the focus on
the<00:03:48.610> EE

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.820 

you<00:03:52.450> can<00:03:52.599> see<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.870> tree<00:03:53.110> is<00:03:53.260> sharp<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:53.739> the

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
you can see the tree is sharp and the

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.039 
you can see the tree is sharp and the
trees<00:03:54.069> in<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.310> distance<00:03:54.519> are<00:03:54.909> dull<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.780> change

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
trees in the distance are dull to change

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.479 
trees in the distance are dull to change
it<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:56.290> have<00:03:56.409> to<00:03:56.590> pry<00:03:56.829> off<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.010> cover<00:03:57.370> and

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
it you have to pry off the cover and

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.009 
it you have to pry off the cover and
rotate<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.090> lens<00:03:58.269> to<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.569> right<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:58.810> little

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
rotate the lens to the right a little

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.089 
rotate the lens to the right a little
bit<00:03:59.170> here's<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.069> before<00:04:00.189> and<00:04:00.400> after<00:04:00.819> I<00:04:02.099> hope

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
bit here's the before and after I hope

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.740 
bit here's the before and after I hope
that<00:04:03.280> comparison<00:04:03.670> helps<00:04:04.060> thanks<00:04:04.629> for

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
that comparison helps thanks for

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.500 
that comparison helps thanks for
