00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 the crew does not expect a disaster lounge 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.420
 there is patch for stars edition and it 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.000
 gives an appointment for the second part 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.620
 from brocade hauser internet i know her 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.940
 already regrets this door 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.759
 to have gotten because here there is 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:23.220
 no chocolate but just tough 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:24.750
 news there will be pets in cities 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.849
 that's what chris roberts has in one 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.380
 open letter to the community explains 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.840
 the reason is that it is the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.730
 community has managed the 64 million 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.960
 Dollar brand crowdfunding too 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.020
 In the meantime, even exceed 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.820
 already more than 65 million which animals 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.809
 it still can be concrete 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.730
 not because there is no real picture 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.410
 material goes for roberts but explains 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.710
 It will be quite normal standard 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.289
 give pets like dogs or cats 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.410
 but also something extraordinary or 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.449
 maybe even that disgusting thing 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.280
 whole is by the way as thanks to the dog 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.230
 pennington to understand the time at 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.960
 the first crowdfunding campaign yet 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.969
 helped to achieve the first goal 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.470
 I do not know how you are furry 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.580
 companion on board comes to me 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.740
 actually only one in the sense 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.869
 in the shadow of the launch debacle of drive 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.909
 works and the problematic start of 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.860
 Assassin's creed II shows ubisoft 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.780
 Now both crew are very optimistic about what 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.820
 the start of this online racing game 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.040
 As far as the designer is very km h 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.860
 he says in an interview that he is 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.720
 complete confidence in the stability and 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.670
 the performance of the game on launch 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.170
 In addition, his team has everything 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.540
 What you need to be successful 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.040
 He further stated that he would guarantee a launch 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.780
 also that it helped the team a lot 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.220
 to perform the many beta phases 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.650
 So only then confident that the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.540
 then server will withstand 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.540
 knock on wood the morning starts 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.840
