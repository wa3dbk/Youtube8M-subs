00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
tough from humble and we backed it up

bed<00:00:36.860> first<00:00:37.100> look<00:00:37.850> at<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:38.120> statistics<00:00:38.720> of<00:00:38.870> the

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
bed first look at the statistics of the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.160 
bed first look at the statistics of the
at<00:00:39.829> the<00:00:40.220> ground<00:00:40.489> it's<00:00:40.730> a<00:00:40.820> ways<00:00:41.000> it<00:00:41.480> seems<00:00:41.750> like

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
at the ground it's a ways it seems like

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.080 
at the ground it's a ways it seems like
eight<00:00:42.320> o'clock<00:00:42.559> starts<00:00:42.980> it's<00:00:43.130> easier<00:00:43.460> to<00:00:43.640> bat

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
eight o'clock starts it's easier to bat

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.940 
eight o'clock starts it's easier to bat
first<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:44.630> that's<00:00:44.930> what<00:00:45.079> we<00:00:45.170> wanted<00:00:45.559> to<00:00:45.620> do<00:00:45.800> and

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
first so that's what we wanted to do and

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.799 
first so that's what we wanted to do and
it<00:00:46.010> worked<00:00:46.160> out<00:00:46.340> but<00:00:46.550> some<00:00:47.420> days<00:00:47.570> it<00:00:47.600> doesn't

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
it worked out but some days it doesn't

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.470 
it worked out but some days it doesn't
work<00:00:48.079> out<00:00:48.260> but<00:00:48.500> today<00:00:48.739> at<00:00:48.800> good<00:00:49.010> so<00:00:49.450> you<00:00:50.450> don't

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
15 14 of the last six holes this is that

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.469 
15 14 of the last six holes this is that
something<00:01:40.450> that<00:01:42.900> happened<00:01:44.880> yes<00:01:45.880> but<00:01:46.120> I<00:01:46.150> think

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
something that happened yes but I think

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.110 
something that happened yes but I think
186<00:01:47.080> was<00:01:47.200> so<00:01:47.380> very<00:01:47.560> good<00:01:47.740> school<00:01:48.100> I'm<00:01:48.820> going<00:01:49.030> to

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
186 was so very good school I'm going to

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.300 
186 was so very good school I'm going to
take<00:01:49.270> into<00:01:49.540> account<00:01:49.780> them<00:01:50.020> linger<00:01:50.290> bowls<00:01:50.590> at

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
take into account them linger bowls at

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.920 
take into account them linger bowls at
the<00:01:51.490> India<00:01:51.820> is<00:01:51.970> obviously<00:01:52.270> difficult<00:01:52.510> to<00:01:52.810> get

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
the India is obviously difficult to get

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.020 
the India is obviously difficult to get
away<00:01:53.050> when<00:01:53.470> you<00:01:53.530> got<00:01:53.650> new<00:01:53.800> batsman<00:01:54.130> so<00:01:54.430> that's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
away when you got new batsman so that's

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.280 
away when you got new batsman so that's
part<00:01:55.270> of<00:01:55.300> a<00:01:55.360> game<00:01:55.510> we<00:01:55.630> won't<00:01:55.750> be<00:01:55.900> happy<00:01:56.140> with

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
part of a game we won't be happy with

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.960 
part of a game we won't be happy with
but<00:01:56.470> we<00:01:56.680> won't<00:01:57.010> dwell<00:01:57.160> on<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.550> either<00:01:57.670> because

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
but we won't dwell on it either because

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.170 
but we won't dwell on it either because
we<00:01:58.420> still<00:01:58.690> scored<00:01:59.170> 186<00:01:59.920> so<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.280> we're<00:02:01.000> pretty

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
we still scored 186 so it we're pretty

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.230 
we still scored 186 so it we're pretty
happy<00:02:01.270> with<00:02:01.540> that

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.749 

distinction<00:02:08.200> should<00:02:08.349> a<00:02:08.530> question<00:02:08.979> Mozgov<00:02:09.610> in

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
distinction should a question Mozgov in

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.330 
distinction should a question Mozgov in
this<00:02:09.880> scenario<00:02:10.119> first<00:02:10.690> in<00:02:10.869> origin<00:02:11.290> were<00:02:12.069> in

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
this scenario first in origin were in

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.110 
this scenario first in origin were in
the<00:02:12.459> bed<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.849> I'm<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.450> student<00:02:14.910> other<00:02:15.910> than

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
the bed and I'm a student other than

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.140 
the bed and I'm a student other than
medicine<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:17.980> would<00:02:18.400> think<00:02:18.520> it<00:02:18.700> takes<00:02:18.880> my

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
medicine so I would think it takes my

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.070 
medicine so I would think it takes my
sister<00:02:19.830> planets<00:02:20.830> what<00:02:21.550> is<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.870> pretty<00:02:22.870> awesome

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
sister planets what is it pretty awesome

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
match-winners when they saw it so it was

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.640 
match-winners when they saw it so it was
important<00:03:12.310> but<00:03:13.269> we<00:03:13.420> were<00:03:13.690> still<00:03:14.049> wary<00:03:14.500> of

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
important but we were still wary of

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.870 
important but we were still wary of
their<00:03:14.859> ability<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.310> company<00:03:15.820> out<00:03:16.030> of<00:03:16.060> us<00:03:16.329> so

their ability to company out of us so

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.310 
their ability to company out of us so
it's<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:18.940> balancing<00:03:19.359> act<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.780> knowing<00:03:20.140> when<00:03:20.290> the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
it's a balancing act to knowing when the

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.140 
it's a balancing act to knowing when the
games<00:03:20.620> actually<00:03:20.859> wanted<00:03:21.370> it's<00:03:21.760> incredibly

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
games actually wanted it's incredibly

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.030

big night I think I be I think guys were
taking<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.480> pretty<00:04:00.600> easy<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:01.200> first<00:04:02.070> up

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
taking it pretty easy so first up

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.650 
taking it pretty easy so first up
tonight<00:04:02.550> and<00:04:02.820> then<00:04:03.030> hopefully<00:04:03.240> we<00:04:03.540> can

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
tonight and then hopefully we can

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.230 
tonight and then hopefully we can
celebrate<00:04:03.900> tomorrow<00:04:07.910> probably<00:04:08.910> not<00:04:09.060> for

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
celebrate tomorrow probably not for

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.819 
celebrate tomorrow probably not for
meetings<00:04:09.690> you've<00:04:11.660> actually<00:04:12.660> eaten<00:04:13.020> of<00:04:14.690> others

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
meetings you've actually eaten of others

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.530 
meetings you've actually eaten of others
I<00:04:16.829> think<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.820> other<00:04:17.940> strips<00:04:18.239> going<00:04:18.419> to<00:04:18.480> be

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
I think the other strips going to be

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.409 
I think the other strips going to be
even<00:04:18.720> slower<00:04:18.959> so<00:04:19.650> it's<00:04:19.890> over<00:04:20.220> see<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.700> look<00:04:21.269> at

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
even slower so it's over see a look at

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.650 
even slower so it's over see a look at
that<00:04:21.570> suited<00:04:21.930> chennai<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:22.290> they<00:04:22.590> know<00:04:23.040> it<00:04:23.070> so

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
that suited chennai and they know it so

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.850 
that suited chennai and they know it so
we've<00:04:24.660> won<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:24.870> lot<00:04:24.930> of<00:04:25.080> games<00:04:25.350> on<00:04:25.530> it<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:25.800> I'm

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
we've won a lot of games on it so I'm

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.830 
we've won a lot of games on it so I'm
sure<00:04:26.130> it's<00:04:26.280> going<00:04:26.400> to<00:04:26.490> be<00:04:26.610> slow<00:04:27.000> in<00:04:27.150> return<00:04:27.480> so

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
sure it's going to be slow in return so

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.170 
sure it's going to be slow in return so
I'd<00:04:28.440> be<00:04:28.740> ninety-nine<00:04:29.340> point<00:04:29.580> nine<00:04:29.700> percent

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
I'd be ninety-nine point nine percent

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.560 
I'd be ninety-nine point nine percent
sure<00:04:30.360> we<00:04:30.510> play<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.810> same<00:04:30.990> team<00:04:33.770> I<00:04:35.330> did<00:04:36.330> a<00:04:36.360> great
