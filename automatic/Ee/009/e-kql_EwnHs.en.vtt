00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:16.440

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:21.090
 Today we'll have an Easter breakfast 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:26.869
 different for our Easter breakfast 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:33.300
 we need the spring onions 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:36.480
 ham cheese gherkins paprika eggs 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.090
 do not be surprised because I have got 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.879
 you use me now 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.879
 egg dyeing jumped there are relative 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:50.570
 singer and a box of the me 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.430
 me already with fresh foil 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:01:00.170
 have interpreted then start first time 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.730
 when we have our water to cook and 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:08.040
 then we do the broth and the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.850
 gelatine pure but just so under 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.140
 water boils 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:17.420
 down a gear we go now 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.420
 a spoonful of the shed pulper 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.740
 and for us the gelatine 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.150
 So I'm lucky you can do the same 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.450
 I did not have a pipe in water 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.450
 dissolve 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.300
 and we're leaving that all for now 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.790
 simmer for two minutes until I get that 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:49.640
 The whole city is always dissolved 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:55.060
 once again perform yourself 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.060
 completely the relative brains 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:03.350
 we're doing that a bit cool now 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:13.780
 I mean it should be complete 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:13.780
 Cooled very important referent this 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:29.390
 is going to cool our cramps in 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:32.680
 a bowl instead of cream fraiche 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:41.630
 who does not like it can take sour cream 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:48.769
 quark stuff water-holding would then 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:55.930
 Let's give three spoons to it all now 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:55.930
 and add salt to it 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:13.150
 now comes 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:16.560
 the remaining ingredients so except for the 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.560
 Everything seems to be all right 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.560
 mix 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:29.260
 so now it is completely cooled 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:32.319
 Now we pour this into the mustard cream 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.069
 fraiche mass very important people I have 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.450
 forget that 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.799
 at the beginning alzheimer all the ingredients 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.260
 you have to please in small cubes 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.150
 to cut 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.060
 very important we pour the 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:53.049
 liquid now to the rhine and 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:54.540
 do not mix up the whole thing 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.579
 sometimes too fluid 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:03.069
 that will be in the fridge now 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:06.239
 Let's take the box shape and 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.239
 pour in the half 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.780
 split well evenly 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:35.940
 and then our egg egg comes to lay her down 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.940
 you push yourself so little bit 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.640
 now just the rest 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.520
 ugly 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.520
 gossip 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.360
 the whole is coming now for a few 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.870
 hours in the fridge so me 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.150
 personally leave it in overnight because 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:11.220
 I sure want to go that that 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:15.610
 remains hard is rat is hard and 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.530
 when it cools down, you hit it 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:24.039
 just on a plate and away 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:28.020
