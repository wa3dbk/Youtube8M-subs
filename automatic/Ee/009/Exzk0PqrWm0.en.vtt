okay<00:00:05.799> it's<00:00:06.040> a<00:00:06.130> 2001<00:00:06.850> Ford<00:00:07.210> Explorer<00:00:07.689> symptoms

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
okay it's a 2001 Ford Explorer symptoms

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.240 
okay it's a 2001 Ford Explorer symptoms
uh<00:00:08.740> I<00:00:09.010> have<00:00:09.490> no

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
uh I have no

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.670 
uh I have no
low<00:00:10.430> speed<00:00:10.490> median<00:00:11.330> and<00:00:14.170> what<00:00:15.170> you<00:00:15.290> need<00:00:15.440> to<00:00:15.530> do

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
low speed median and what you need to do

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.130 
low speed median and what you need to do
is<00:00:15.860> you<00:00:15.950> need<00:00:16.100> to<00:00:16.130> get<00:00:16.309> down<00:00:16.490> in<00:00:16.670> there<00:00:17.050> so<00:00:18.050> you

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
is you need to get down in there so you

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.000 
is you need to get down in there so you
have<00:00:18.290> to<00:00:18.440> remove<00:00:18.740> this<00:00:19.040> out<00:00:19.850> of<00:00:20.029> here<00:00:20.800> now<00:00:21.800> this

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
have to remove this out of here now this

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.690 
have to remove this out of here now this
is<00:00:22.189> just<00:00:22.400> held<00:00:22.580> in<00:00:22.730> with<00:00:22.910> pins<00:00:24.340> and<00:00:25.340> it<00:00:25.490> fits

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
is just held in with pins and it fits

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.390 
is just held in with pins and it fits
right<00:00:25.850> down<00:00:26.090> in<00:00:26.270> here<00:00:26.710> that<00:00:27.710> it<00:00:28.630> and<00:00:30.220> pop<00:00:31.220> the

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
right down in here that it and pop the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.540 
right down in here that it and pop the
screw<00:00:31.669> off<00:00:31.849> of<00:00:32.029> here<00:00:32.300> for<00:00:32.989> the<00:00:33.190> assembly

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.710 

something<00:00:37.550> up<00:00:37.670> here<00:00:38.200> two<00:00:39.200> bolts<00:00:39.680> one<00:00:40.220> there<00:00:40.720> in

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
something up here two bolts one there in

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.130 
something up here two bolts one there in
there<00:00:42.050> and<00:00:42.500> I'm<00:00:43.100> not<00:00:44.050> doing<00:00:45.050> in<00:00:46.040> there<00:00:46.370> as<00:00:46.640> well

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
there and I'm not doing in there as well

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.870 
there and I'm not doing in there as well
and<00:00:48.140> what<00:00:48.590> we're<00:00:48.740> after<00:00:48.920> is<00:00:49.250> that<00:00:49.430> thing<00:00:49.670> way

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
and what we're after is that thing way

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.550 
and what we're after is that thing way
down<00:00:50.090> in<00:00:50.300> there<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:52.340> resistor<00:00:52.910> of<00:00:53.030> some<00:00:53.180> type

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
down in there the resistor of some type

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.720 
down in there the resistor of some type
anyway<00:00:54.590> I'll<00:00:54.830> show<00:00:55.010> you<00:00:55.100> a<00:00:55.160> little<00:00:55.370> more<00:00:55.520> when

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
anyway I'll show you a little more when

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.710 
anyway I'll show you a little more when
I<00:00:55.760> get<00:00:55.970> this<00:00:56.090> pizza

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
I get this pizza

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:06.640 
I get this pizza
oh<00:00:57.070> yes<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:58.460> also<00:01:00.520> this<00:01:01.520> right<00:01:02.240> here<00:01:03.070> was<00:01:05.650> in

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
oh yes and also this right here was in

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.050 
oh yes and also this right here was in
there<00:01:07.750> just<00:01:08.750> pop<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.110> bolts<00:01:09.409> out<00:01:09.530> of<00:01:09.619> there

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
there just pop the bolts out of there

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.920 
there just pop the bolts out of there
unplug<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.090> wire<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:12.500> set<00:01:12.920> it<00:01:13.130> aside

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
unplug the wire and set it aside

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.850 
unplug the wire and set it aside
okay<00:01:17.170> okay<00:01:18.170> no<00:01:18.890> problem<00:01:19.430> found<00:01:20.500> this<00:01:21.500> is<00:01:21.710> what

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
okay okay no problem found this is what

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.780 
okay okay no problem found this is what
we<00:01:21.980> were<00:01:22.100> looking<00:01:22.370> for<00:01:24.190> and<00:01:25.190> this<00:01:25.340> is<00:01:25.490> what<00:01:25.640> we

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
we were looking for and this is what we

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.930 
we were looking for and this is what we
found<00:01:25.970> on<00:01:26.720> this<00:01:26.900> one<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.350> plug<00:01:27.590> so<00:01:27.860> I<00:01:28.729> think

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
found on this one the plug so I think

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.580 
found on this one the plug so I think
what<00:01:29.060> I'm<00:01:29.150> gonna<00:01:29.270> do<00:01:29.510> is<00:01:29.690> just<00:01:29.900> replace<00:01:30.290> this

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
what I'm gonna do is just replace this

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.430 
what I'm gonna do is just replace this
wire<00:01:31.210> it<00:01:32.210> could<00:01:32.360> have<00:01:32.450> been<00:01:32.570> just<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:33.020> bad

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
wire it could have been just a bad

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.670 
wire it could have been just a bad
connection<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:34.790> shorted<00:01:35.180> out<00:01:35.409> and<00:01:36.409> then<00:01:36.530> I

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
connection and it shorted out and then I

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.590 
connection and it shorted out and then I
replaced<00:01:37.040> this<00:01:37.190> end<00:01:37.490> here<00:01:37.940> and<00:01:38.060> plug<00:01:38.479> it<00:01:38.570> back

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
replaced this end here and plug it back

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.050 
replaced this end here and plug it back
in<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.140> see<00:01:39.260> if<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:39.470> works

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
in and see if it works

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.190 
in and see if it works
because<00:01:41.060> everything<00:01:41.450> looks<00:01:41.630> good<00:01:41.900> there

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
because everything looks good there

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.990 
because everything looks good there
aside<00:01:42.650> from<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:43.040> rust<00:01:43.280> I'm<00:01:43.549> gonna<00:01:43.700> clean<00:01:43.970> that

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
aside from the rust I'm gonna clean that

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.899 
aside from the rust I'm gonna clean that
out<00:01:44.180> in<00:01:44.510> there<00:01:44.659> a<00:01:44.690> little<00:01:44.870> bit<00:01:45.310> that<00:01:46.310> resistor

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
out in there a little bit that resistor

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.090 
out in there a little bit that resistor
I<00:01:46.940> suppose<00:01:47.240> it<00:01:47.420> could<00:01:47.570> check<00:01:47.810> that<00:01:48.080> but<00:01:48.979> it

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
I suppose it could check that but it

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.230 
I suppose it could check that but it
doesn't<00:01:49.370> look<00:01:49.460> like<00:01:49.520> there's<00:01:49.790> anything<00:01:49.970> wrong

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
doesn't look like there's anything wrong

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.940 
doesn't look like there's anything wrong
with<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:51.110> all<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:51.409> lawyers<00:01:51.560> are<00:01:51.830> all

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
with it and all the lawyers are all

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.990 
with it and all the lawyers are all
connected<00:01:52.659> so<00:01:53.659> I<00:01:54.549> guess<00:01:55.549> we<00:01:55.670> could<00:01:55.820> run<00:01:55.970> a

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
connected so I guess we could run a

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.380 
connected so I guess we could run a
whole<00:01:56.240> meter<00:01:56.510> on<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:56.869> just<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.140> see<00:01:58.210> but<00:01:59.210> I'll

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
whole meter on it just to see but I'll

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.160 
whole meter on it just to see but I'll
show<00:01:59.540> you<00:01:59.570> what<00:01:59.810> I<00:01:59.869> got

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
show you what I got

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.980 
show you what I got
let<00:02:00.440> me<00:02:00.560> get<00:02:00.680> her<00:02:00.770> done

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.859 

okay<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:03.170> this<00:02:04.100> was<00:02:04.310> our<00:02:04.460> problem<00:02:04.750> pulled<00:02:05.750> it

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
okay so this was our problem pulled it

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.040 
okay so this was our problem pulled it
all<00:02:05.960> apart<00:02:06.290> replace<00:02:06.829> that<00:02:07.040> wire<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:08.050> clean

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
all apart replace that wire and clean

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.530 
all apart replace that wire and clean
the<00:02:09.170> terminals<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:10.250> now<00:02:11.000> everything<00:02:11.510> seems

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
the terminals and now everything seems

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.309 
the terminals and now everything seems
to<00:02:11.810> be<00:02:11.900> working<00:02:11.959> okay<00:02:13.810> except<00:02:14.810> for<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:15.020> first

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
to be working okay except for a first

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.830 
to be working okay except for a first
speed<00:02:16.000> there's<00:02:17.000> nothing<00:02:17.390> there

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
speed there's nothing there

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.830 
speed there's nothing there
but<00:02:18.620> there<00:02:18.830> is<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:18.980> low<00:02:19.310> speed<00:02:19.670> which<00:02:20.239> seems<00:02:20.750> to

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
but there is a low speed which seems to

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.610 
but there is a low speed which seems to
be<00:02:20.930> running<00:02:21.290> all<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.650> time<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.900> second<00:02:24.349> speed

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
be running all the time the second speed

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.530 
be running all the time the second speed
works<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.550> high<00:02:25.670> speed<00:02:25.730> works<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:28.540> don't

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
works and the high speed works I don't

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.089 
works and the high speed works I don't
know<00:02:29.690> what<00:02:29.870> would<00:02:30.080> be<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.349> problem<00:02:30.590> with<00:02:30.980> the

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
know what would be the problem with the

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.240 
know what would be the problem with the
low<00:02:31.280> speed<00:02:32.500> but<00:02:33.500> everything<00:02:33.860> seems<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.160> be
