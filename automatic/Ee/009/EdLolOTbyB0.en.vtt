00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 welcome to trani theory i know it's a bit 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.450
 that you don't see me but I leave the bullshit 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.150
 on how busy I was at the end of 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.889
 video plus other various explanations so a 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.969
 who cares I am of the tutorial just looks 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.969
 the tutorial initialization 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.850
 today let's talk about the rc6 is a 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.440
 remote control for your machine 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.480
 photographic in this case is for the 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.970
 canon but I imagine there is also the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.640
 nikon correspondent then lerici 6 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.619
 precisely a remote control that is basic 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.300
 was made for photography then for 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.890
 the selfies or otherwise to stay 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.850
 away from the camera and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.280
 via this wireless remote control 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.899
 take the picture inside tiburon 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.600
 boxing 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.200
 inside you will find a leaflet of 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.930
 instructions that one opens it says the uncle 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.180
 how many things will hold oh my god and of 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.730
 all the languages ​​of the world and there will be a 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.000
 paragraph for each book back me not 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:05.309
 need you find the convenient one does so to speak 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.100
 baby carrier, a baby carrier loosens the pocket 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.700
 to put him in high lands carlo through 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.729
 these things to your room that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.189
 it can serve and not engage and finally 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.770
 this is the director and you see it really is 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.219
 very simple to a single key 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.450
 central and a switch behind it really is 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.039
 easy to use 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.359
 then how was this before 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.130
 made for photography 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:32.189
 then officially on the website of 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.829
 canon we talk about photography is written 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.399
 that the function set to on the one 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.979
 serves for a snapshot 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.289
 the switch instead on the 2 serves for I think 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.490
 that ten seconds is enough 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.799
 typically then your room will start to 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.209
 make a beep type count down exclusion 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.770
 of the world 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:51.659
 this is however it can also be 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.359
 used for videos 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.340
 this is probably very useful for 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.469
 people who blog for people 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.279
 that maybe they make videos by themselves and have 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.100
 the need to take fire from 

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:06.899
 far away without having to stand 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.130
 dummy what kind to start the 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.130
 video without having to step forward 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.990
 therefore it can be very useful way 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.569
 to use it at the video level is the 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.069
 next first you have to go 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.230
 set in your options 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.460
 reflex instead of the shutter option 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.650
 single went to select 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.560
 put the one with the wireless or two 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.870
 ten seconds doesn't really matter 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.270
 once done this business of 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.460
 button makes the photo to use in 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.220
 video mode you have to peel on 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.950
 video mode of your 550 600's 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.570
 650 so on 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.240
 once that happened on the mode 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.760
 video this will change functions 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.830
 then function 1 will always serve for 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.350
 take photography but in doing the 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.300
 photography will focus you will take 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.440
 the fire will make the photo but you will have the 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.180
 right focus in the position where 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.850
 you are on ichat and at 2 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.010
 press and the video starts so this is it 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.350
 a very comfortable way 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.360
 I know I could have done better 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.220
 you have to take one 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.290
 photography every time to get the fire 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.210
 right, however, there is still one 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.820
 photography is not that it occupies this 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.200
 great thing so it's all there is a 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.030
 middle button plus the two 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.240
 the thing that is experienced is that 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.430
 on the 5d mark ii it doesn't work very well 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.160
 because the 5d mark ii unlike the 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.110
 other SLRs, perhaps even thirst 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.270
 I don't remember anyway he doesn't have one 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.980
 own video mode ie on 5th 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.840
 when you put in live view 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.570
 if in video mode you don't have to 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.740
 click on the video accordingly i have 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:41.170
 noticed that live view imposed me 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.420
 You can make photography, but you can do it without it 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.770
 take the fire automatically by 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.070
 consequently I with this remote control 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.020
 on the 5d mark ii I can be part of the 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.180
 video but I can't take the picture before 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.040
 that is, he takes my picture first but does not put it on me 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.360
 automatic fire because in live view 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.380
 finance on the 5d mark ii is a bit pointless 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.360
 start the video automatically if you 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:06.310
 you have already set all the options of 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.390
 fire may be fine otherwise not though 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.820
 for all the other machines I know that 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.830
 it works and that's about twenty 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.840
 of euros therefore it is an expense that can be 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.650
 do if you know what blog you have 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.889
 need to 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.049
 have this kind of comfort 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.910
 I think I even think it is 18 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.009
 euro on amazon.it 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.810
 so I think it's an expense 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:27.160
 can do is the tutorial ends here 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.220
 I know it was simple too 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.900
 quite lacking in great content but 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.820
 for those who didn't know what one was 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.199
 necessary or there was the possibility 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.600
 to have this kind of remote control 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:41.169
 now he knows but we come to me then a 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.430
 those who do not care can get out the reason 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.479
 as already mentioned on the facebook page e 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:49.330
 twitter for which the format was not 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:51.160
 very much format in these in 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.050
 this last week is part of the 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.139
 last and why I was away from home then 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.630
 I was doing over stuff I wasn't 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.560
 present in the house and therefore could not 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.240
 use her my loving coleen 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.610
 now I can't create a format 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.190
 because as someone knows I'm in 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.990
 Italy from Friday to Wednesday therefore not 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.970
 I can do the format 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.160
 however this Friday will come out anyway 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.740
 live desk that I had prepared by one 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.960
 life therefore emiliano excuse the next one 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.849
 week still there will be intervals 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.110
 loading irregular 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:28.000
 I have already sent my alternate to create 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.530
 something so you can set up a 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.120
 content during this week a 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.720
 something else maybe I'll be able to load 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.030
 however this is the situation in these in 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.580
 these times then last from the week 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.940
 again after all it should come back 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.229
 to the normality I all those that me 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.940
 they are following that they start 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.310
 embarrassing scandals about me mine 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.050
 life is everything now thank you for 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.990
 always be present and among all 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.520
 those who want to keep up to date 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.800
 my facebook and twitter page e 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.169
 exceeds no spam day 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.970
 rest assured however it is in the sense it is not that 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.560
 I disappeared from YouTube but up 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.300
 facebook and twitter those who follow me know that 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.380
 I've always been and always has 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.620
 kept up to date 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:11.860
 so if that's the way to do it there 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.690
 I remember that tomorrow evening on sequence 02 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.909
 then on the giacomo zito tris canal 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.099
 81 we will have the classic point of sequences 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:20.000
 02 will be a guest at ezio shooter so yes 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:22.220
 will talk to him 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.110
 less than they are are cute 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.250
 girls who send him the photos is the 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.710
 end of and of the kind 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.480
 we also point out that the contest has 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.900
 passed already a lot 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.010
 the ten videos is therefore official 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.070
 that February 28th 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.690
 the contest will then start if you don't know 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.100
 what am i talking about click here from 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.560
 some part the link will appear for 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.290
 go to see the context the context 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.790
 what is the context looks like type a 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:51.020
 absorbent 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:56.140
 for those who are producing ticks instead 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:58.010
 tic tac l'aris do it by 28 because 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.550
 I don't know that 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:03.530
 thank you for watching us there 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:07.480
 see Friday with live desk and then in 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.480
 these days vaguely show
