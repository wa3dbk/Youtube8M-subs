bottom from head to toe so first of all

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.460 
bottom from head to toe so first of all
I'm<00:00:14.910> going<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.150> start<00:00:15.360> off<00:00:15.509> with<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.929> displays

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
I'm going to start off with the displays

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
I'm going to start off with the displays
we<00:00:16.650> get<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> 5.7<00:00:17.730> inch<00:00:17.880> IPS<00:00:18.660> LCD<00:00:19.350> display<00:00:20.130> so

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
we get a 5.7 inch IPS LCD display so

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.779 
we get a 5.7 inch IPS LCD display so
it's<00:00:20.910> neither<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:21.510> 720p<00:00:21.960> HD<00:00:22.199> display<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.859> it's

it's neither in 720p HD display and it's

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.089 
it's neither in 720p HD display and it's
not<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.269> 1080p<00:00:24.600> HD<00:00:24.930> display<00:00:25.260> it's<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.650> IPS<00:00:25.949> LCD

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
not a 1080p HD display it's the IPS LCD

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.540 
not a 1080p HD display it's the IPS LCD
display<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.439> also<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.800> terms<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
display and also in terms of the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.690 
display and also in terms of the
processor<00:00:30.510> under<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.019> hood<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.619> get<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.949> 1.2

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
processor under the hood we get a 1.2

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.000 
processor under the hood we get a 1.2
gigahertz<00:00:33.030> processor<00:00:33.390> quad-core<00:00:34.380> processor

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
gigahertz processor quad-core processor

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.030 
gigahertz processor quad-core processor
MediaTek<00:00:35.910> processor<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:37.590> course<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:37.980> a

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
MediaTek processor and of course it's a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.160 
MediaTek processor and of course it's a
cheaper<00:00:38.340> processor<00:00:38.790> with<00:00:38.969> cortex<00:00:39.329> a7<00:00:39.510> cores

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
cheaper processor with cortex a7 cores

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.280 
cheaper processor with cortex a7 cores
no<00:00:40.680> cordless<00:00:40.980> a15<00:00:41.610> cores<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
no cordless a15 cores so it's a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.410 
no cordless a15 cores so it's a
disappointment<00:00:43.680> here<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.489> also<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.180> terms<00:00:45.300> of

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
disappointment here and also in terms of

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.060 
disappointment here and also in terms of
the<00:00:45.510> software<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:45.960> get<00:00:46.079> an<00:00:46.230> order<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.770> jelly

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
the software we get an order to jelly

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.529 
the software we get an order to jelly
bean<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.460> same<00:00:47.640> software<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.149> get<00:00:48.360> on

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
bean the same software that we get on

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.139 
bean the same software that we get on
the<00:00:48.660> wise<00:00:48.930> x<00:00:49.170> 5<00:00:49.379> octa<00:00:49.710> core<00:00:49.940> nothing<00:00:50.940> fancy

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the wise x 5 octa core nothing fancy

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.790 
the wise x 5 octa core nothing fancy
here<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.719> normal<00:00:51.989> difference<00:00:52.350> between<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
here it's normal difference between the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.100 
here it's normal difference between the
air<00:00:52.920> for<00:00:53.160> two<00:00:53.550> or<00:00:53.730> four<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:54.180> two<00:00:54.539> or<00:00:54.719> four<00:00:54.930> point

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
air for two or four to two or four point

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.930 
air for two or four to two or four point
three<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.770> main<00:00:55.920> difference<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.399> KitKat

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
three the main difference is the KitKat

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.660 
three the main difference is the KitKat
so<00:00:57.420> yes<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> local<00:00:58.980> brand<00:00:59.250> if<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.550> buy

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
so yes this is a local brand if you buy

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.240 
so yes this is a local brand if you buy
this<00:00:59.730> handset<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.690> won't<00:01:00.960> be<00:01:01.320> getting<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
this handset you won't be getting the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.270 
this handset you won't be getting the
KitKat<00:01:02.910> because<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.930> know<00:01:04.080> Kim<00:01:04.470> well<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:05.010> will

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
KitKat because you know Kim well I will

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.010 
KitKat because you know Kim well I will
not<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.670> device<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.060> KitKat<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.780> course

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
not have this device to KitKat of course

these q well yes maybe i will get a

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.270 
these q well yes maybe i will get a
cumin<00:03:26.510> oil<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:27.170> when<00:03:27.410> they<00:03:27.590> you<00:03:27.709> know<00:03:27.739> produce

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
cumin oil and when they you know produce

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.660 
cumin oil and when they you know produce
a<00:03:28.489> very<00:03:28.790> great<00:03:29.239> device<00:03:29.540> very<00:03:29.840> great<00:03:30.230> q<00:03:30.470> mobile

innovation<00:03:36.590> so<00:03:37.310> yes<00:03:38.500> making<00:03:39.500> humid<00:03:39.799> videos<00:03:40.190> is

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
innovation so yes making humid videos is

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.539 
innovation so yes making humid videos is
only<00:03:41.150> for<00:03:41.480> pakistani<00:03:42.049> users<00:03:42.530> Norval<00:03:43.070> wise<00:03:43.280> so

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
only for pakistani users Norval wise so

only for pakistani users Norval wise so
that's<00:03:43.790> a<00:03:43.940> big<00:03:44.120> reason<00:03:44.299> why<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:45.110> don't<00:03:45.530> actually

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
that's a big reason why I don't actually

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.120 
that's a big reason why I don't actually
