00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
drove this around a little bit I really

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.840 
drove this around a little bit I really
liked<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.559> only<00:00:37.739> hard<00:00:38.219> thing<00:00:38.280> about<00:00:38.610> this

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
liked it the only hard thing about this

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.400 
liked it the only hard thing about this
is<00:00:39.120> hooking<00:00:41.000> the<00:00:42.000> dolly<00:00:42.239> up<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> trailers

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
is hooking the dolly up and the trailers

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.200 
is hooking the dolly up and the trailers
and<00:00:43.770> stuff<00:00:43.800> like<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.280> takes<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.000> little<00:00:45.120> time

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
and stuff like that takes a little time

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.410 
and stuff like that takes a little time
backing<00:00:45.780> them<00:00:45.899> up<00:00:46.219> but<00:00:47.219> other<00:00:47.730> than<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.149> it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
backing them up but other than that it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.940 
backing them up but other than that it
