00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello you love even more delicious today 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.910
 vegan chocolate cupcakes with coconut 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.770
 frosting as I promised you that 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.660
 I need the first one for that 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.320
 Muffins are the foundation representing cocoa 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.500
 wheat me perfectly baking powder with me 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.100
 the sugarcane sugar sunflower oil and 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.560
 water as give me the 150 grams 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.560
 wholemeal bowl 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.990
 There are another 150 grams of that 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.990
 normal mail 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.320
 then a packet of baking powder film one 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.320
 stone baking powder taken 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.629
 then add the four tablespoons cacau 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.140
 1 packet of vanilla sugar 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:57.760
 100 milliliter oil just totally the 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.390
 no grave there will be no traffic light and 250 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.390
 grams of sugar 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.150
 and at the end still at 150 milliliters 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.490
 water i promise you there you will notice 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.960
 the difference 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:13.549
 that was very, very good 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.549
 the whole next dynamics 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.010
 and then make your cupcake 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.770
 That's how it looks then 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.360
 from the joints and then you fill that 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.430
 also for me with a small cellar 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.600
 it is actually best distributed 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.640
 that in there 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.810
 that I have everywhere equally westward 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.310
 there was still a bit left and 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.490
 I then shape the large tray 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.490
 filled 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.760
 then it goes on a baking tray and 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.860
 then comes the for about 15 to 20 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.060
 minutes at 175 degrees in the oven 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.610
 the rod probe could fall make 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.260
 if you have bigger movies for 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.160
 You then need the coco stopping as 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:59.610
 in coconut milk or grated coconut and 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.880
 vanilla first 150 grams so in 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.420
 make a shape with six tablespoons 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.420
 coconut flakes 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.610
 six tablespoons of powdered sugar 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.730
 and 4 tablespoons of coconut i have here 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.950
 a creamy sometimes taken a lot 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.890
 Liquid sometimes but as I would the 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.450
 does not matter but it also assumes in 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.220
 what made so that the consistency 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.950
 at the end then something else in common 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.730
 the manipulations 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.420
 I myself have more or 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.709
 Less thought and then in 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.020
 given remixer then you need one 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.430
 bigger glass is there then yours 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.870
 Pouch I'm still here unfortunately 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.030
 somewhere else I hope soon 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.830
 in the back spray bag and then you have 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.330
 outer shell likely war that 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.769
 even for three euros grow out and then 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.450
 could play out again and again 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.820
 that was pretty good but that was at 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.470
 my set and then you have yours 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.350
 finished buttercream which looks like this 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.620
 of consistency and you give that then 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.340
 into the glass and fill the glass 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.340
 complete with it 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.989
 Of course you can do it later too 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.989
 on the market 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.010
 you take practically the plastic bag 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.190
 Everything comes out of the glass 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.870
 a little further down pushes that 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.610
 screw the ring together from one 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.610
 spout dies once over it 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.840
 Hold on to that then you can top it off 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.350
 screw and then you have the finished 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.350
 injection bag 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.620
 that is then first the fridge 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.120
 it will be a bit harder then 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.439
 do you have your cupcakes we see the 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.129
 summer plants how do you leave first good 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.769
 cooling down 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.360
 During the sprint you will be content 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.560
 then you have to firmly 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.390
 Try a little bit that is sometimes 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.280
 not so easy especially at the beginning 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.750
 is relatively much in the spray bag in it 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.189
 I 'm only doing that now too 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.439
 That's not the second time 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.299
 beautiful but it is super great 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.920
 delicious to try this but get 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.620
 a feeling for it relatively quickly 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.450
 Once around with the injection bag and 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.849
 then up to the small pot full on it 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.970
 That's what you do with your cupcakes 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:17.220
 and in the end it is always nice 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.470
 even if it is not perfect, of course 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.310
 the kik have that nice shape too 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.990
 change from very cheap and then 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.610
 At the end there is still a bit coconut 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.570
 about that a few coconut rasps that 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.520
 just looks pretty you can 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.870
 Of course, take over any pianos 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.349
 but I think that fits because easy 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.550
 best 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.400
 then only comes my fridge 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.870
 so that something gets colder and so on 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.030
 sees the whole then also go by meters 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.949
 out and that came with my guests very much 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.380
 good at the time those of mine 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.240
 other vegan cake not excited 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.440
 but he has him 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.880
 tasted very good and there 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.699
 really no difference at all 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.139
 Of course , take and do the dough like that 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.490
 So I wish you a whole 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.830
 very good appetite and I hope you 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.560
 I like that more or less myself 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.449
 so invented recipe so at least above 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.440
 the topping and you try that 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.440
 outside appetite
