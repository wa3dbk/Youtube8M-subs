00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 And there goes the good that is generated and rafa 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.990
 on live making a video plus one 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.820
 little video using the xbox the studio 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.049
 Now little different year I solved 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:18.000
 just put my pretty face in the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.920
 my collection also what is enough 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.340
 Young man to run after this joke. 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:30.199
 and I decided to do this thinking to talk 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.199
 bit about the conquests finding 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.329
 that I can say is people is a 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.350
 nice news 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.230
 the first one that I think is 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:50.969
 It is interesting to say that now 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:01:03.750
 thing can give to netflix however not 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:15.270
 nobody goes and they do not have the challenges 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:22.020
 now in the games but he is temporary for 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:24.390
 example had a challenge that you 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.720
 I thought playing start the game is at least 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.850
 at least seven days after the launch 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:36.320
 winning a team in the conquest is a 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.270
 story gives a prize of aragon 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.299
 differentiated stronger 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.909
 Another thing that is cool is the challenge. 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.770
 being temporary is that you may have 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.630
 a challenge they do not have yet to 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.490
 that I have seen but they can give 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.380
 it seems more like a game then 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.079
 example may have a challenge to id 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.810
 soon to kill 500 the floor of the 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:05.579
 hayden and 500,000 in two days for 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.590
 example, this may have 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.090
 lots of vague combination and also they 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.560
 can have their steps and this is a 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.690
 challenge for the whole community 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.530
 lazio player can give some time 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:21.490
 It has a challenge to to play to that 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.620
 were the five players reach there 500 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.780
 thousand miles on a day of days 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.730
 when you choose the 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.380
 developers 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.850
 another cool thing also monitoring 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.950
 now you can buy for us the 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.030
 most of the conquests of the sponge 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.420
 sit there 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.280
 but it's because if in the classic knesset here 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.260
 what to do with the other said chan that is a 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.570
 super nintendo game 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.910
 you have to win 40 wins with 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.370
 each one when you go there leaves you 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.870
 get in there you can see how many by 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.760
 percent against the victory already have with each 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.740
 one while missing you unlock 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.620
 This conquest is our 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.780
 conquest because always way defends 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.170
 the developer is what Joseph is not 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.880
 put the 2005 games psd not know 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.720
 How many thousand deaths and you never know 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:12.430
 how many did you have when there was a 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.740
 little or even that pleasure, yes 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.810
 expectation is that now it is now 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.330
 between friends online with your 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.489
 expectation of crushing this 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.459
 these left 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.739
 there it was nice but I look at the profile 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.209
 to choose between did not know and know 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:35.260
 exactly when will you get it? 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:37.900
 I went to know something else, nice thing. 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.400
 that this decision now of the dvr game 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.770
 games is that you can record any 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.080
 thing is playing is when by 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.580
 example is what you want to do with that 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.380
 promotion able to show that you did 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.630
 invitation but when you're playing a 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.400
 random golf game and you hit a 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.380
 record either of the two cup games 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.989
 world without crash that was other people 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.239
 they are being very nice and it's an edit 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.519
 very cool to join the achievements and 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.760
 hotel game duty to see the dvd a chance 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.860
 recording and such people there let alone 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.120
 with a little piece of lightning that already 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.010
 I'm really enjoying it 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.840
 is there next month to record a 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.269
 promises an analysis of the pop star golf 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.820
 maybe the next one is razed the jorginho 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.810
 I do not know what to say. 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.810
 hug bye
