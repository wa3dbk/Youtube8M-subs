the large range but it's gonna be a

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.609 
the large range but it's gonna be a
little<00:01:25.509> bit<00:01:25.689> of<00:01:25.749> a<00:01:25.840> personal<00:01:26.079> preference

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
little bit of a personal preference

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:27.810 
little bit of a personal preference
whether<00:01:26.770> you'd<00:01:27.009> rather<00:01:27.130> be<00:01:27.310> a<00:01:27.340> little<00:01:27.609> bit<00:01:27.700> on

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
whether you'd rather be a little bit on

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.069 
whether you'd rather be a little bit on
the<00:01:27.909> larger<00:01:28.240> side<00:01:28.420> or<00:01:28.570> a<00:01:28.600> little<00:01:28.810> bit<00:01:28.929> on<00:01:28.990> the

the larger side or a little bit on the

the larger side or a little bit on the
medium<00:01:29.439> or<00:01:29.560> on<00:01:29.679> the<00:01:29.770> smaller<00:01:30.070> side<00:01:30.340> but<00:01:31.210> since

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
medium or on the smaller side but since

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.090 
medium or on the smaller side but since
the<00:01:31.689> Bower<00:01:31.840> one<00:01:32.109> I<00:01:32.140> was<00:01:32.319> pretty<00:01:32.530> squarely<00:01:32.890> in

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
the Bower one I was pretty squarely in

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.410 
the Bower one I was pretty squarely in
the<00:01:33.189> medium<00:01:33.490> section<00:01:33.880> I<00:01:33.939> can<00:01:33.969> feel<00:01:34.210> pretty

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
the medium section I can feel pretty

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.550 
the medium section I can feel pretty
confident<00:01:34.929> that<00:01:34.960> that's<00:01:35.170> gonna<00:01:35.289> be<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.469> right

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
confident that that's gonna be the right

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.410 
confident that that's gonna be the right
shoulder<00:01:35.890> pad<00:01:36.009> for<00:01:36.219> me<00:01:36.310> so<00:01:37.090> now<00:01:37.179> we've

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
shoulder pad for me so now we've

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.899 
shoulder pad for me so now we've
selected<00:01:37.689> the<00:01:38.499> correct<00:01:38.740> size<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.340> go<00:01:39.460> with<00:01:39.670> and

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
selected the correct size to go with and

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.219 
selected the correct size to go with and
we're<00:01:40.240> going<00:01:40.359> to<00:01:40.420> show<00:01:40.600> you<00:01:40.659> here<00:01:40.869> what<00:01:41.200> a

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
we're going to show you here what a

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.840 
we're going to show you here what a
properly<00:01:41.859> fitting<00:01:42.100> shoulder<00:01:42.340> pad<00:01:42.520> will<00:01:42.640> look

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
properly fitting shoulder pad will look

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.789 
properly fitting shoulder pad will look
like<00:01:43.030> so<00:01:43.810> here<00:01:43.840> we<00:01:44.140> have<00:01:44.229> on<00:01:44.319> our<00:01:44.409> mannequin<00:01:44.770> a

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
like so here we have on our mannequin a

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.440 
like so here we have on our mannequin a
medium<00:01:45.249> which<00:01:45.819> is<00:01:45.969> about<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.270> same

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
medium which is about the same

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.989 
medium which is about the same
dimensions<00:01:46.960> myself<00:01:47.469> so<00:01:48.280> you'll<00:01:48.520> see<00:01:48.670> here<00:01:48.880> is

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
dimensions myself so you'll see here is

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:50.190 
dimensions myself so you'll see here is
the<00:01:49.149> one<00:01:49.329> thing<00:01:49.450> you<00:01:49.569> want<00:01:49.719> to<00:01:49.780> notice<00:01:49.960> first

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
the one thing you want to notice first

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.230 
the one thing you want to notice first
off<00:01:50.409> is<00:01:50.619> that<00:01:50.679> the<00:01:51.310> shoulder<00:01:51.639> caps<00:01:51.880> are<00:01:52.030> really

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
off is that the shoulder caps are really

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.969 
off is that the shoulder caps are really
squarely<00:01:52.719> above<00:01:53.109> the<00:01:53.259> top<00:01:53.469> of<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.710> shoulder

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
squarely above the top of the shoulder

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.289 
squarely above the top of the shoulder
that<00:01:54.100> it's<00:01:54.219> not<00:01:54.340> going<00:01:54.429> to<00:01:54.520> be<00:01:54.579> too<00:01:54.759> low<00:01:54.969> on<00:01:55.149> it

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
that it's not going to be too low on it

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.520 
that it's not going to be too low on it
or<00:01:55.420> it's<00:01:55.539> not<00:01:55.659> going<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.840> be<00:01:55.899> too<00:01:56.079> up<00:01:56.289> on<00:01:56.439> the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
or it's not going to be too up on the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.230 
or it's not going to be too up on the
player<00:01:56.740> if<00:01:56.950> it's<00:01:57.340> too<00:01:57.490> far<00:01:57.670> up<00:01:57.850> you<00:01:57.939> might<00:01:58.090> be<00:01:58.210> a

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
player if it's too far up you might be a

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.969 
player if it's too far up you might be a
sign<00:01:58.479> that<00:01:58.509> can<00:01:58.780> be<00:01:58.869> a<00:01:58.899> little<00:01:59.020> too<00:01:59.200> small<00:01:59.499> and

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
sign that can be a little too small and

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.289 
sign that can be a little too small and
if<00:02:00.069> it's<00:02:00.219> hanging<00:02:00.429> down<00:02:00.759> it's<00:02:01.060> going<00:02:01.149> to<00:02:01.209> be

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
if it's hanging down it's going to be

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:02.520 
if it's hanging down it's going to be
more<00:02:01.479> on<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.659> outside<00:02:02.079> you're<00:02:02.229> not<00:02:02.319> going<00:02:02.469> to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
more on the outside you're not going to

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.230 
more on the outside you're not going to
get<00:02:02.619> as<00:02:02.770> much<00:02:03.009> protection<00:02:03.310> where<00:02:03.850> you<00:02:03.939> need<00:02:04.090> it

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
get as much protection where you need it

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.199 
get as much protection where you need it
as<00:02:04.990> far<00:02:05.170> as<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.350> bicep<00:02:05.709> card<00:02:05.950> goes<00:02:06.249> some

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
as far as the bicep card goes some

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:08.160 
as far as the bicep card goes some
shoulder<00:02:07.479> pads<00:02:07.600> some<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:07.929> higher-end

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
shoulder pads some of the higher-end

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.480 
shoulder pads some of the higher-end
ones<00:02:08.470> are<00:02:08.590> going<00:02:08.679> to<00:02:08.740> have<00:02:08.830> adjustable

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
ones are going to have adjustable

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.730 
ones are going to have adjustable
lengths<00:02:09.970> like<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:10.270> one<00:02:10.450> right<00:02:10.569> here<00:02:10.650> so<00:02:11.650> if

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
lengths like this one right here so if

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.650 
lengths like this one right here so if
you<00:02:11.830> can<00:02:11.950> see<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.400> there<00:02:12.610> where<00:02:12.820> that<00:02:12.850> elastic

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
you can see in there where that elastic

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.210 
you can see in there where that elastic
is<00:02:13.840> with<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.140> velcro<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.680> can<00:02:15.010> actually

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
is with the velcro you can actually

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.130 
is with the velcro you can actually
determine<00:02:16.000> how<00:02:16.120> far<00:02:16.390> down<00:02:16.690> it

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
determine how far down it

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.900 
determine how far down it
or<00:02:17.319> how<00:02:17.500> far<00:02:17.740> up<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.220> that's<00:02:18.670> going<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.850> be

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
or how far up and that's going to be

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.640 
or how far up and that's going to be
more<00:02:19.150> specific<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.930> go<00:02:20.110> with<00:02:20.260> what<00:02:20.440> kind<00:02:20.620> of

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
more specific to go with what kind of

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.960 
more specific to go with what kind of
elbow<00:02:20.920> pads<00:02:21.130> you<00:02:21.250> have<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.580> make<00:02:21.700> sure<00:02:21.850> you

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
elbow pads you have to make sure you

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.699 
elbow pads you have to make sure you
don't<00:02:22.120> have<00:02:22.360> any<00:02:22.540> gaps<00:02:22.810> in<00:02:22.990> protection<00:02:23.560> and

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
don't have any gaps in protection and

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.160 
don't have any gaps in protection and
then<00:02:24.190> as<00:02:24.280> far<00:02:24.459> as<00:02:24.550> on<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.700> front<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.840> can<00:02:25.990> see

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
then as far as on the front you can see

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.780 
then as far as on the front you can see
here<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.470> covers<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.830> majority<00:02:27.310> of<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.490> chest

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
here it covers the majority of the chest

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.300 
here it covers the majority of the chest
some<00:02:28.450> will<00:02:28.690> have<00:02:28.810> removable<00:02:29.560> belly<00:02:29.950> guards

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
some will have removable belly guards

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.710 
some will have removable belly guards
which<00:02:30.459> actually<00:02:30.790> this<00:02:30.880> one<00:02:31.090> kind<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.600> got

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
which actually this one kind of got

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.540 
which actually this one kind of got
tucked<00:02:32.020> up<00:02:32.230> there<00:02:32.470> but<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.040> can<00:02:33.160> see<00:02:33.370> how<00:02:33.490> that

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
tucked up there but you can see how that

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.800 
tucked up there but you can see how that
kind<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:33.910> goes<00:02:34.060> down<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.480> pants<00:02:34.750> would

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
kind of goes down the pants would

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.180 
kind of goes down the pants would
probably<00:02:35.080> come<00:02:35.200> up<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.470> right<00:02:35.650> about<00:02:35.680> here<00:02:36.160> so

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
probably come up to right about here so

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.620 
probably come up to right about here so
there's<00:02:36.430> not<00:02:36.580> too<00:02:36.820> big<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.150> gap<00:02:37.209> in<00:02:37.570> that

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
there's not too big of a gap in that

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.720 
there's not too big of a gap in that
region<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.740> removal<00:02:39.130> Bella<00:02:39.340> guard<00:02:39.550> is<00:02:39.700> a

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
region the removal Bella guard is a

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.630 
region the removal Bella guard is a
personal<00:02:40.240> preference<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:41.440> can<00:02:41.830> just

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
personal preference so you can just

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.400 
personal preference so you can just
remove<00:02:42.910> this<00:02:43.120> away<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.630> there'd<00:02:44.020> be<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.140> little

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
remove this away so there'd be a little

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.960 
remove this away so there'd be a little
bit<00:02:44.500> more<00:02:44.709> of<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.860> gap<00:02:44.890> between<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.580> pants<00:02:45.880> and
