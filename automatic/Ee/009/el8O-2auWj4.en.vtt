00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
complications and I think that along

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.020 
complications and I think that along
with<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.290> fact<00:04:29.470> that<00:04:29.669> Markham<00:04:30.669> free<00:04:30.850> was

file<00:04:59.470> better<00:05:00.190> graphics<00:05:00.639> probably<00:05:01.120> most<00:05:01.389> of

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
file better graphics probably most of

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.950 
file better graphics probably most of
the<00:05:01.660> process<00:05:02.280> so<00:05:03.280> I<00:05:03.669> mean<00:05:04.389> that<00:05:04.510> could<00:05:04.660> also

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
the process so I mean that could also

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.379 
the process so I mean that could also
cancel<00:05:05.560> out<00:05:05.650> a<00:05:05.680> couple<00:05:05.860> devices<00:05:06.430> plus<00:05:07.240> you

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
cancel out a couple devices plus you

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:08.490 
cancel out a couple devices plus you
know<00:05:07.479> you<00:05:07.539> can't<00:05:07.870> change<00:05:07.990> your<00:05:08.110> name<00:05:08.229> on<00:05:08.350> game

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
know you can't change your name on game

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.740 
know you can't change your name on game
off<00:05:08.680> so<00:05:09.010> hopefully<00:05:09.910> they<00:05:10.180> might<00:05:10.360> have<00:05:10.539> like<00:05:10.720> a

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
off so hopefully they might have like a

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.260 
off so hopefully they might have like a
tag<00:05:11.110> feature<00:05:11.410> I<00:05:11.770> didn't<00:05:12.580> call<00:05:12.760> Judy<00:05:13.030> where<00:05:13.210> you

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
tag feature I didn't call Judy where you

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.659 
tag feature I didn't call Judy where you
can<00:05:13.389> go<00:05:13.539> to<00:05:13.900> your<00:05:13.960> barracks<00:05:14.830> or<00:05:15.070> whatever<00:05:15.370> and

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
can go to your barracks or whatever and

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.390 
can go to your barracks or whatever and
you<00:05:16.330> know<00:05:16.389> put<00:05:16.600> your<00:05:16.780> own<00:05:16.840> tagging<00:05:17.320> but<00:05:18.250> if<00:05:18.310> you

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
you know put your own tagging but if you

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.750 
you know put your own tagging but if you
don't<00:05:18.940> have<00:05:19.090> that<00:05:19.270> I<00:05:19.479> think<00:05:20.169> clans<00:05:20.580> they<00:05:21.580> might

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
don't have that I think clans they might

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.100 
don't have that I think clans they might
not<00:05:21.910> be<00:05:22.410> like<00:05:23.410> they<00:05:23.650> used<00:05:23.889> to<00:05:24.160> be<00:05:24.280> marketed<00:05:24.699> to

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
not be like they used to be marketed to

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.180 
not be like they used to be marketed to
but<00:05:26.110> i<00:05:26.139> hope<00:05:26.380> i<00:05:26.650> hope<00:05:27.130> they<00:05:27.280> will<00:05:27.460> be<00:05:27.610> um<00:05:27.820> and

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
but i hope i hope they will be um and

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.129 
but i hope i hope they will be um and
yeah<00:05:30.190> so<00:05:30.490> um<00:05:30.669> if<00:05:30.970> your<00:05:31.090> own<00:05:31.300> perspective<00:05:32.050> on

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
yeah so um if your own perspective on

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.500 
yeah so um if your own perspective on
