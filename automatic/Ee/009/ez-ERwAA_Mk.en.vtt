00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:10.590
 Yokkaichi Kogyo practice incorporates new practice 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:17.280
 There is also a method, but I cherish the basic practice very much 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:20.190
 I do a wide range of basic practice to the point of applied practice game 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:25.680
 5 through the ring 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:30.900
 We have been studying very much the timing of what kind of practice should be done 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.070
 Please take a look, especially in the stroke, it is very important to bite the ball 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.640
 Also I'd have 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.170
 At this time, it is actually trying to get in the ball from the heel and heel by taking back 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.830
 It is difficult during the game 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.700
 It's difficult during rally, but it's such a hand-out ball 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:50.500
 At the time of ball capture with the racket 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:55.710
 I will do such a thing and make a fake back at that time and enter from the heel 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:01:01.900
 And after the body starts up the racket comes out last 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:06.340
 If this is high school students become the junior and senior high school students because I want to beat the city's ball 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.290
 The racket comes out at the same time as I step in, but when I stepped in I still take 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.490
 Keep Tame the Gu' in the back 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:17.700
 Not go and do not hit the ball when or even in's a Attari ball out at my own power 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:22.200
 I don't want the racket to come out at the same time when I stepped in 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.630
 The image around here like this is going a little late 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.010
 Tedashi but in the soup stock 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.830
 Let's make it and stick 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:36.300
 The time to bite into the racket will be a little longer 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:40.890
 It is short to be short 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:46.409
 This swing is also long 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:49.140
 The mouth is very necessary to take in various drills 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:54.000
 At this time, we will introduce 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.600
 We're going to place stepping in take-back depressed I'd give the ball 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.420
 But I will go through there already 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.840
 I do not pretend the racket and practice conscious that accumulate around it 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.840
 Through 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.700
 Ekko 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.120
 At the time it was bound 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.120
 Take back fast 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.640
 Acting 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.190
 Let's go open We will do this as well as our open stance Open stance as well 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.720
 Attract 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.720
 I will not hit the ball 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.720
 Things 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.460
 Items 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.680
 Went another attracted 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:22.280
 In just leadership but it seems to racket comes out early ah 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.280
 From ankle to ankle 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:33.400
 Abdominal muscle reinforcement This is only the last after the torso is completely made 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:36.150
 If the form is like saying that the racket comes out first, this side improvement 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.150
 This has become necessary
