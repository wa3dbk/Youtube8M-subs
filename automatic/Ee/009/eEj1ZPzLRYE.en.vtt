it may take a little bit longer to load
a<00:03:56.660> map<00:03:56.930> thing<00:03:57.260> that's<00:03:57.890> because<00:03:58.220> you're<00:03:58.430> trying

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
a map thing that's because you're trying

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
to load um the more codes than what Call

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.180 
to load um the more codes than what Call
of<00:04:02.150> Duty<00:04:02.480> actually<00:04:02.960> you<00:04:03.350> know<00:04:03.470> put<00:04:03.500> out<00:04:03.860> so

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
of Duty actually you know put out so

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.370 
of Duty actually you know put out so
you're<00:04:04.370> loading<00:04:04.880> literally<00:04:05.390> essentially<00:04:06.170> a

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
hundred more kilobytes of stuff so it

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.540 
hundred more kilobytes of stuff so it
doesn't<00:04:09.320> make<00:04:09.410> that<00:04:09.590> much<00:04:09.650> longer<00:04:10.070> but<00:04:10.280> still

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
doesn't make that much longer but still

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.180
