00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
thing that lib tex does is tucked in

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.680 
thing that lib tex does is tucked in
edges<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.430> if<00:01:17.760> you<00:01:17.850> want<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.120> get<00:01:18.240> Spinney

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
edges so if you want to get Spinney

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.230 
edges so if you want to get Spinney
spinning<00:01:19.530> off<00:01:19.620> those<00:01:19.830> jumps<00:01:20.220> what<00:01:20.729> happens<00:01:21.120> is

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
spinning off those jumps what happens is

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.910 
spinning off those jumps what happens is
instead<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.570> having<00:01:21.659> full<00:01:22.110> wrap<00:01:22.290> edges<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> lot

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
instead of having full wrap edges a lot

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.170 
instead of having full wrap edges a lot
of<00:01:22.979> times<00:01:23.130> still<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:23.670> come<00:01:23.790> up<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.060> around

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
of times still I just come up and around

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.990 
of times still I just come up and around
the<00:01:24.330> nose<00:01:24.510> and<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.870> tail<00:01:25.049> said<00:01:26.040> stick<00:01:26.850> them

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the nose and the tail said stick them

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.760 
the nose and the tail said stick them
off<00:01:27.120> tuck<00:01:27.540> them<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.810> reduces<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> swing

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
off tuck them in reduces the swing

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.990 
off tuck them in reduces the swing
weight<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.100> when<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.280> go<00:01:29.370> to<00:01:29.430> spin<00:01:29.670> off<00:01:29.700> those

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
weight so when you go to spin off those

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.140 
weight so when you go to spin off those
jumps<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.870> board<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> lot<00:01:32.010> easier<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.970> get

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
jumps the board is a lot easier to get

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.510 
jumps the board is a lot easier to get
around<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.409> last<00:01:34.619> thing<00:01:34.799> really<00:01:35.070> simple
