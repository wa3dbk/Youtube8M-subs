Ok then today..
-I will be choosing!
-You can choose the theme for today!

00:00:25.148 --> 00:00:27.653
I like that we can do anything on this show!

00:00:28.587 --> 00:00:30.123
I picked one.

00:00:31.357 --> 00:00:32.425
Oh!
-What is it?

00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:36.802
Toward summer.
-Toward summer...

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:39.643
When it comes to this, girls have only one answer, right?

00:00:40.472 --> 00:00:41.472
Yeah we have only one answer!

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.834
Right?

00:00:43.172 --> 00:00:44.439
Right!

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:48.044
Let's say it all together!
-Wait, wait, wait! Toward summer?
-Yep!

00:00:48.278 --> 00:00:50.947
You should know it!!

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:52.989
There is only one answer!

00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:55.023
Let's say the answer all together.

00:00:55.318 --> 00:00:55.953
It's..

00:00:56.217 --> 00:00:57.219
Diet!

00:01:00.246 --> 00:01:03.680
The answer is Diet!
-Yeah it's diet.
-It must be diet!

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.773
What type of diet have you done before?

00:01:09.023 --> 00:01:12.960
I have done public diet which was organised by Zipper.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.335
Yeah I remember that!

00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:21.967
I revealed my weight and measurements and the 
 project went for 6 to 12 months.

00:01:22.504 --> 00:01:25.476
That was called recording diet.
-I see!

00:01:25.977 --> 00:01:30.614
They gave me a notebook and 5 books talking about how to lose weight.

00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:32.383
They told me to read all of them!

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.657
Wow, it was very serious!
-Yeah!

00:01:35.263 --> 00:01:41.740
They also gave me a calorie chart and told me to 
 write down how many calories I consumed in my notebook.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.910
What did you eat?
-There was no restriction on food.

00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:50.400
Just needed to take note of what I ate.
-Made you 
 paying more attention to what you consumed each day.
-Yep!

00:01:50.778 --> 00:01:53.480
I did put on 5 to 6 kg 
 in the first 2 months at uni.

00:01:53.912 --> 00:01:56.050
I also gained weight during the first year in Tokyo.

00:01:56.436 --> 00:02:03.110
I was on the chubby side at the time 
 and Heisho-san said to me 'Let's lose weight'.

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.040
Is that right?
-Yeah!
-I didn't know that!

00:02:06.558 --> 00:02:12.560
And we thought that it would be more fun 
 if we make it public.
-I see! 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.300
It was good that you had someone kind enough to 
 tell you that.
-Yeah I'm glad that he told me.

00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:18.440
That made me realise that I got chubby.

00:02:18.807 --> 00:02:23.480
So we are gonna lose weight by the summer! 
-Yeah 
 that's right!
-Let's do it! We can do it!

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:30.840
Although we keep eating snacks that are placed in front of us
-Yeah 
 right! We say we'll go on diet but keep eating..

Let's talk about fashion items for this summer.
-fashion items..

00:03:15.693 --> 00:03:20.360
I actually have a question that I wanna ask you two. 
 Is everyone wearing bra-tops this year as well?
-I would!

00:03:20.604 --> 00:03:24.140
And you?
Una: I would wear one.
-My tummy is bit chubby at the moment.

00:03:24.434 --> 00:03:28.840
I went shopping the other day.
-I remember you were asking that question.

00:03:29.107 --> 00:03:33.750
Because they were so popular last year.
-I think people 
 would still wear them this year.
-You think?

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:39.650
But I would probably pair bra-tops with different bottoms this time.

00:03:40.438 --> 00:03:45.340
Last year, I used to pair them with short skirts.

00:03:46.277 --> 00:03:50.220
For this summer, I think it's cute to 
 match one with denim jeans like these.

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:56.200
Or you could wear one with an oversized clothe.
-You bought an 
 NIKE clothe. The one in black and white. -Yeah.

00:03:56.638 --> 00:03:57.730
Last year,

00:03:58.654 --> 00:04:04.180
well.. those who were not confident enough to wear them, 
 this year
-They can try bra-tops out this year!

00:04:04.646 --> 00:04:06.650
Ok then!
Would you wear one, Mi-chan?

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.980
That means I have to lose weight!
-I know! We have to do it!

00:04:11.538 --> 00:04:15.110
If we wanna enjoy fashion, then yeah.

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:17.920
We have to work hard.
-It's important to do so.

-Well, spread a some kind 
 of sheet and..
-What's that! You don't know the name of it!

00:05:34.604 --> 00:05:36.700

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:59.090
Oh but I can't break an egg..
-I'm really good at 
 making dashi maki tamago (Japanese omelette with broth)

00:06:01.493 --> 00:06:02.750
I was like.. what? what? 

00:06:03.594 --> 00:06:07.760
Dashi maki.. So you can't break an egg?
-No I can't..
-Why is that?

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.170
I can but..
-does it mean you can't break one well?
-It's because I'm kinda scared..

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:15.540
Of what?
-of a chick hatching from egg shell..
-That's not gonna happen..!
