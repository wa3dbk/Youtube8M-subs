heavier more opaque colors to give you a
little<00:00:17.760> more<00:00:18.090> feeling<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:19.250> contrast<00:00:20.250> between

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
little more feeling of contrast between

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.810 
little more feeling of contrast between
that's<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.960> foreground<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.820> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
background and as you can see the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.410 
background and as you can see the
brushstrokes<00:00:28.650> are<00:00:29.250> not<00:00:29.460> spreading<00:00:29.849> out<00:00:30.090> there

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
brushstrokes are not spreading out there

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.849 
brushstrokes are not spreading out there
still<00:00:30.689> spreading<00:00:31.019> out<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:31.560> they're<00:00:31.740> not

still spreading out but they're not
spreading<00:00:32.250> out<00:00:32.489> like<00:00:32.730> they<00:00:32.940> were<00:00:33.000> earlier<00:00:33.660> and

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
spreading out like they were earlier and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.190 
spreading out like they were earlier and
this<00:00:35.160> would<00:00:35.370> be<00:00:35.399> like<00:00:35.760> an<00:00:35.940> under<00:00:36.210> painting<00:00:36.540> as

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200

getting<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> little<00:00:47.579> more<00:00:47.850> contrast<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:49.350> my

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
wonderful that way is not one flesh

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.210 
wonderful that way is not one flesh
color<00:01:48.540> there's<00:01:48.840> not<00:01:49.049> one<00:01:49.350> tree<00:01:49.680> color<00:01:50.009> and

paint all flesh don't well there is a

paint all flesh don't well there is a
flesh<00:02:06.630> tone<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.350> it's<00:02:07.470> only<00:02:07.650> one<00:02:07.800> of<00:02:08.069> them<00:02:08.660> and

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
flesh tone but it's only one of them and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.680 
flesh tone but it's only one of them and
think<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.440> gives<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.220> novice<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.940> idea<00:02:12.420> that

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
think it gives the novice a idea that

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.420 
think it gives the novice a idea that
well<00:02:12.870> they<00:02:12.990> could<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:13.350> put<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.590> down<00:02:13.830> and

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
well they could just put that down and

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.750 
well they could just put that down and
they<00:02:15.120> won't<00:02:15.330> have<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.950> mix<00:02:16.950> up<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.280> flesh<00:02:17.520> tone

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
they won't have to mix up a flesh tone

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.210 
they won't have to mix up a flesh tone
which<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.180> very<00:02:18.390> difficult<00:02:21.800> now<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.830> think<00:02:22.980> I

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
which is very difficult now I think I

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.280 
which is very difficult now I think I
would<00:02:23.370> leave<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.760> goal<00:02:23.970> right<00:02:24.270> now<00:02:24.330> for<00:02:25.140> my

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
would leave that goal right now for my

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.729 
would leave that goal right now for my
washes<00:02:25.770> on<00:02:25.980> this<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.140> would<00:02:31.320> want<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.590> work

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
washes on this and I would want to work

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.880 
washes on this and I would want to work
dry<00:02:32.250> into<00:02:32.610> dry
