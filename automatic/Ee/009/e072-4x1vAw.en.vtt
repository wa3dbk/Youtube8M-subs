this<00:00:00.450> year<00:00:00.659> we're<00:00:00.870> very<00:00:01.350> excited<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.860> be

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
this year we're very excited to be

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.550 
this year we're very excited to be
introducing<00:00:02.100> our<00:00:02.850> new<00:00:03.060> X<00:00:03.419> platformer<00:00:04.170> machine

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
introducing our new X platformer machine

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.760 
introducing our new X platformer machine
which<00:00:04.799> is<00:00:04.920> an<00:00:05.040> open<00:00:05.339> frame<00:00:05.609> design<00:00:06.350> all<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.620> our

actually<00:01:18.869> no<00:01:19.049> tools<00:01:19.320> at<00:01:19.619> all<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:20.340> we

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
actually no tools at all on this one we

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.420 
actually no tools at all on this one we
also<00:01:20.790> feature<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.960> machine<00:01:22.430> centerline

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
also feature on this machine centerline

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.960 
also feature on this machine centerline
design<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.750> center<00:01:25.530> line<00:01:25.710> thinking<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.790> this

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
design and center line thinking so this

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.109 
design and center line thinking so this
machine<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.390> set<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.170> red<00:01:29.009> dot<00:01:29.280> red

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
machine is set up to have red dot red

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.630 
machine is set up to have red dot red
dot<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.509> your<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:31.200> your<00:01:31.470> flap<00:01:31.770> guides<00:01:32.130> or<00:01:32.460> your

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
dot on your on your flap guides or your

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.380 
dot on your on your flap guides or your
side<00:01:32.939> guides<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.320> would<00:01:34.439> have<00:01:35.390> showing

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
side guides and you would have showing

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.620 
side guides and you would have showing
red<00:01:36.689> dot<00:01:36.900> on<00:01:37.079> your<00:01:37.110> forming<00:01:37.710> tube<00:01:37.890> adjustment

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
red dot on your forming tube adjustment

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.300 
red dot on your forming tube adjustment
so<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.810> central<00:01:40.170> line<00:01:40.320> thinking<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:40.860> all<00:01:41.159> you

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
so it's central line thinking so all you

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.510 
so it's central line thinking so all you
need<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.409> set<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.590> red<00:01:43.860> dot<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.340> red

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
need to do is just set up red dot to red

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.359 
need to do is just set up red dot to red
dot<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.909> red<00:01:45.090> dot<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:46.170> very<00:01:46.560> easy<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.159> very

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
dot to red dot it's very easy and very

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.460 
dot to red dot it's very easy and very
