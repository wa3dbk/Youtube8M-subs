spewing in this little hose here I do

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.000 
spewing in this little hose here I do
not<00:00:32.489> know<00:00:32.730> what<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:32.969> hose<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.950> all<00:00:34.950> I

not know what this hose is for all I

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.500 
not know what this hose is for all I
know<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.280> that's<00:00:35.430> between<00:00:35.640> these<00:00:35.969> two<00:00:36.149> carbs

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
know is that's between these two carbs

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.479 
know is that's between these two carbs
here<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.809> there's<00:00:36.930> one<00:00:37.110> each<00:00:37.290> side<00:00:37.500> gas<00:00:38.219> only

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
here and there's one each side gas only

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.590 
here and there's one each side gas only
come<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.000> one<00:00:39.210> not<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.020> one<00:00:41.600> so

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
come out of this one not that one so

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.720 
come out of this one not that one so
yeah<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.960> I'll<00:00:43.020> guess<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.460> just<00:00:44.460> spring

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
yeah so I'll guess it just just spring

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.860 
yeah so I'll guess it just just spring
out<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.059> there<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.329> getting<00:00:45.450> all<00:00:45.629> over<00:00:45.660> the

hose I don't know what that means

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.740 
hose I don't know what that means
because<00:01:26.640> there's<00:01:26.909> no<00:01:27.000> other<00:01:27.150> hose<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.570> here

because there's no other hose in here

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.649 
because there's no other hose in here
that<00:01:27.930> could<00:01:28.049> possibly<00:01:28.470> connect<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.659> did

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that could possibly connect to that did

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.080 
that could possibly connect to that did
also<00:01:30.869> see<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.439> diagram<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:32.009> some<00:01:32.670> hoses

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
also see on the diagram that some hoses

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.270 
also see on the diagram that some hoses
should<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.540> through<00:01:34.380> these<00:01:34.500> two<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:35.159> as

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
should be going through these two but as

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.789 
should be going through these two but as
you<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.579> see<00:01:35.640> there<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:37.790> I<00:01:39.380> can't<00:01:40.380> choke

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
you can see there is not I can't choke

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.350 
you can see there is not I can't choke
the<00:01:41.009> bike<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:43.470> all<00:01:44.189> been<00:01:44.549> able<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.790> do<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.090> kind

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the bike so all been able to do is kind

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.359 
the bike so all been able to do is kind
of<00:01:45.450> work<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.750> throttle<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.229> little<00:01:46.439> bit<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:47.100> you

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
of work the throttle a little bit as you

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.109 
of work the throttle a little bit as you
can<00:01:47.490> see<00:01:48.380> that's<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.710> that's<00:01:50.369> that's<00:01:50.850> gone

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
can see that's just that's that's gone

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.530 
can see that's just that's that's gone
and<00:01:51.890> it's<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.490> don't<00:01:54.060> know<00:01:54.240> what<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.420> would

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
and it's so I don't know what I would

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.530 
and it's so I don't know what I would
win<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.170> instead<00:01:55.470> he<00:01:55.619> stalled<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:57.119> cute

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
win so instead he stalled this this cute

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.870 
win so instead he stalled this this cute
little<00:01:57.570> number<00:01:58.079> which<00:01:58.579> actually<00:01:59.579> doesn't

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
little number which actually doesn't

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.060 
little number which actually doesn't
move<00:02:00.060> which<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.710> wouldn't<00:02:01.710> make<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> difference

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
move which is wouldn't make a difference

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.940 
move which is wouldn't make a difference
otherwise<00:02:02.610> because<00:02:03.090> uh-oh<00:02:03.619> it's<00:02:04.619> not

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
otherwise because uh-oh it's not

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.760 
otherwise because uh-oh it's not
connected<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.399> anything<00:02:05.490> anyways<00:02:06.350> so<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.619> is

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
connected to anything anyways so this is

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.940 
connected to anything anyways so this is
just<00:02:07.950> a

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
just a

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.070 
just a
fun<00:02:09.790> little<00:02:09.910> cable<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.420> drag<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.840> ground

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.890 
to be empty I don't know if that could
be<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:32.860> problem<00:02:33.420> maybe<00:02:34.420> there's<00:02:34.660> just<00:02:34.690> a

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
be the problem maybe there's just a

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
way around this thing just quite yet but

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.880 
way around this thing just quite yet but
that's<00:02:43.270> pretty<00:02:44.110> much<00:02:44.200> all<00:02:44.350> I've<00:02:44.470> gotten<00:02:44.740> so

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890
