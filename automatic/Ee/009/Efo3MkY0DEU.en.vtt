 guys and girls welcome a new 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.370
 video of regressions supplements in this 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.230
 occasion I bring you something that many 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.849
 they prevented him from investigating and giving them 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.780
 and verdito so welcome a video 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.780
 of l-carnitine 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.320
 during the last decade they have appeared 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.330
 many new supplements the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.970
 which really promise things 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.340
 incredible that you lose fat very fast 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.140
 gain muscle very fast increase 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.150
 your kisses will be many 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.430
 novel supplements that obviously not 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.810
 they flaunt to buy and approve however 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.970
 L-carnitine has become very popular 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.440
 the last years promising and 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.559
 making sure you're going to burn fat 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.690
 much faster let's see if this is 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.910
 true in this video I'm just going to 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.500
 talk about l-carnitine 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.330
 related to fat loss what 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.769
 it seems to them if we are going to see a little bit of 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.989
 what is l-carnitine and what 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.360
 does l-carnitine participate in the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.580
 energy metabolism and protection 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.229
 I 'll put it on and if you did not know it 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.260
 L-carnitine is produced in our body 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.299
 and it can also be taken by taking 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.690
 supplements and a meal eye the 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:05.460
 L-carnitine does not burn fat unless 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.619
 the subject who is taking them is 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.720
 deficient of l carnitine let's see 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.580
 which subjects are deficient of the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.170
 l-carnitine and to those who can 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.090
 benefit take the supplement and 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.010
 let's ask ourselves in this video how the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.040
 l-carnitine can work to burn 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.140
 grease 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.330
 emphasize that l-carnitine has several 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.160
 functions of our body but in this 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.400
 video I want you not just 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.860
 let's concentrate on the potential that 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.600
 L-carnitine for fat burning the 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.720
 l-carnitine is exposed and defined 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.310
 as a fat transporter 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.400
 let us imagine that l-carnitine is a 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.460
 plane and transports fats makes a 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.920
 target which is the mitochondria ovens 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.540
 where the nutrients are burned to 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.060
 energy and once you've understood 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.160
 what is the function of l carnitine 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.320
 let's see if there are really few 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.140
 Studies have claimed that l-carnitine 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.570
 It works for fat burning even 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.180
 there have been overwhelming claims that 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.520
 they verify us and they affirm and validate us 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.869
 that carnitine has nothing to do 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.610
 with the metabolism of fats in 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.530
 subjects of trained or overweight 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.750
 as I told you at the beginning of the video 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.670
 can only serve if there is any 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.650
 deficiency of meat have the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.840
 muscles and I tell them again in 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.390
 conclusion and directly take this 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.430
 supplement as a goal to say 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.830
 motivate and increase the oxidation of 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.050
 fats will not give you any of that 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.610
 so do not do this do not increase the 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.930
 oxidation of fats and it will not give you 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.970
 No additional benefit for you 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.220
 you define much faster eye do not say that 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.890
 the l-carnitine is a scam and is a 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.060
 waste simply is not going to 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.220
 serve a topic of additional benefits 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.350
 in what is fat burning the 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.850
 bacteria of weight then you were such 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.740
 ready to invest your money in the 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.330
 l-carnitine that someone offered you that 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.700
 are you going to do now your intake of 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.350
 macronutrients the most important thing you have 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.540
 to be sure that you are in a deficit 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.700
 caloric consumed your proteins 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.250
 carbohydrates and fats exactly 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.020
 that is, inject your money better in 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.270
 foods which provide you with a 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.590
 high quality protein source 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.910
 build your diet first the law 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.470
 Carnitine does not seem to influence 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.870
 positively in the metabolism of 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.220
 fats in fat loss unless 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.200
 which subject is deficient of the 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.330
 carnitine since subjects I mean already 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.120
 through all the vegan people 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.610
 vegetarians lacking advanced meat 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.080
 age etcetera basically these subjects 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.760
 that I mentioned are those that can be 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.930
 deficient ica retina and those who 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.459
 They can really benefit one 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.740
 little bit because somehow the 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.360
 l-carnitine for loss objectives 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.440
 fat and do not look for supplements that you 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.140
 they will help to lose weight 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.900
 at a much faster rate remember a 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.790
 pounds the healthy week of cardio 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.490
 between mind of weights and is of the other 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.470
 Do not look for magical things and good you 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.050
 you know whether or not to buy l carnitine 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.550
 it's up to you to save your money and 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.560
 remember see you in the next video 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.390
 of the supplements review that you plan 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.220
 do about the thermogenic ones the 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.380
 fat burners if you like the idea 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.730
 dale like let's see how much we reach 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.610
 how many people so interested in this 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.830
 theme remember I'm an unstoppable and this 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.080
 video was a review of the carnitine 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.860
 stay informed 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.860
 Paris 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:32.099
 nothing comes out 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.099
 it happened to me that
