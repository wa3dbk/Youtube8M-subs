00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.960
 Hello people, welcome, one more 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.330
 Passat Kan does not pass today 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.710
 I'll show you the difference between 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.179
 the nokia asha 300 and 5 and the nokia asha 311 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.820
 good 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:23.279
 Ah, and I'll take the opportunity to talk too. 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:27.300
 about the technology of today's screens 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:33.320
 which are the resistive that this here and the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:37.559
 live helmet that is nokia 311 good asha 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.790
 you can see the beauty of the design 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.930
 I found the two very nice design 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.320
 The two of you are beautiful to show you. 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.160
 here o 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.820
 the design is beautiful the two have to have 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:59.960
 the same thickness if I'm not mistaken is fine 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.960
 next to the other he was going to bring 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:08.130
 but in my opinion the humble law 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:14.369
 opinion if it matters 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:19.229
 I found 305 more beautiful and what I 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:23.640
 I found ugly in 311 was that here O 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:27.180
 the buttons we are here I 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.460
 can see the buttons of the device they 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.390
 they are startled in relief 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.509
 table 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.670
 I did not like that, I really did not like it 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:41.759
 but that's it, did not let the team lose the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.240
 beauty of it for that reason let's talk 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.270
 Let's talk about up to the screens. 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.149
 Now the technology of the screens 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.899
 nokia asha 300 handset and 5 it 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:59.369
 resisted the nokia asha resistive screen 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:05.070
 311 is capacitive as I mentioned before 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:10.220
 main difference to the main 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:14.090
 between the two technologies is the 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.950
 I'm here or when you play here 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.170
 in that precision that leaves you noticed 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.510
 some devices when you click 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.100
 one thing he does not click on what you 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.110
 want to click the bottom button 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.030
 mainly happens when you are 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.850
 accessing the internet you click the button 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:34.460
 He'll stay in the other, stay put. 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:40.100
 Life happens a lot in the resistive null in 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:43.910
 311 is capacitive ie the screens 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:48.890
 Resistive 75 to 85 has eighty 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:53.720
 five percent accuracy in touch 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.090
 capacitive screens have 99% more than 10 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.890
 25% and 11% 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:06.530
 it makes a lot of difference if you want 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:09.740
 vote if you want to know when I'm walking 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.680
 device is resistive and another is k or 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:17.570
 existed or capacitive year only legal one 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.570
 face on the screen the difference, I did not have 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:24.170
 there is perceived here pacu and that 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:27.100
 that looks like a really cool sticker 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:32.720
 cool I think the focus is bad 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:37.190
 so it's nice to show it here. 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:41.769
 I'm going to get here to get our 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:45.470
 guest of today and is luke skywalker 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:50.959
 will use his sword to see you on the screen 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:57.470
 resistive backrest nothing happens 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:04:01.250
 in the tip but if I go there there is 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:06.350
 opa opa opa 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:09.790
 Look, it only works. 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:14.090
 already on the living helmet does not work because 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:18.310
 the capacitive screen she responds 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.840
 through if I'm not mistaken electrons 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.449
 energy our body 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.260
 of energy for those who do not know 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.530
 contact capacitive screen it 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.160
 responds 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.990
 already the resistive screen it has a film 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.870
 with several films in them are several 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.650
 movies that when when we play 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:43.010
 got in touch with the mec is even a 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.590
 I knew how to play we played on the screen. 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:50.000
 she got in touch she went in 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:52.220
 contact and give the action the interactivity 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.889
 so if I do anything 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.180
 any surface touch here 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.630
 anything that is not here in the 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.479
 surface will work already in nokia 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.580
 asha resistive not only through the 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:07.310
 finger or those special 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.460
 come on is that she also 20 and bita 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.560
 electricity 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:23.780
 Forget that role of electrons that I 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:27.470
 I think I said it's wrong, and that 's it. 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:36.680
 very soft because clothes 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:39.050
 the wife then the capacitive screen better 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.729
 of what exists, that is why 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.510
 devices with resistive screen are more 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.120
 cheap 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.260
 many come with resistive screen this is 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.340
 too bad 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:53.360
 capacitive today but only one 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.820
 a little more expensive and that he thinks 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.410
 childhood of the nokia asha has 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.099
 As I mentioned several months but I'm going 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:04.910
 mention again here you have the 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:10.700
 1 ghz processor and wifi 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:13.760
 already the nokia to a caste 211 excuse 5 only 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:25.240
 there is internet 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:28.130
 ooo 311 3g wifi 3g find 2002 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.310
 good staff so hope you guys 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.310
 have enjoyed 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.420
 but if you liked the jorginho and hope 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.419
 that I have helped between the two in 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:45.419
 choose the interest here is to help in 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:47.340
 choice of appliance that matters 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:49.440
 you are looking for circled search too 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.470
 have this help in choosing 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:58.430
 Did you like the jewel and if you did not like it? 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:07:00.600
 also sign up for the channel and 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.280
 Let's change an idea put in the 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.139
 comment may in the comments that 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.610
 He sought than you have I will try 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:08.550
 Answer, I'll help you. 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:12.020
 There I stay with God and see you next time. 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.020
 that in the past by car
