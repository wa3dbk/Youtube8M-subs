00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
 you want back in your 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.529
 today for a brand new 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.899
 video it's already the third episode of 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.910
 the potential series nex agoride so 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.650
 the first two episodes are 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.150
 wonderfully well spent at the level 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.980
 lay people at the level of comments 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.870
 you have been very very present that makes 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.820
 extremely pleasure I hope it's ok 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.970
 continue like this at the level of 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.760
 episodes I think he'll stay two 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.800
 even three episodes still so we 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.080
 is coming soon at the end of January the players 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.490
 are going to happen so their program five 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.640
 new players who are ramos ferati 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.219
 batshuayi ramsi and that elsewhere so we 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.079
 will start with the first one that is 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:39.739
 adrian ramos the hertha colombian 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.510
 berlin who is the top scorer 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.219
 currently from the Bundesliga in the lead 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.160
 with lewandowski 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.309
 it's 76 their basic art I decided 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.110
 to pass it to 79 will have there too 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.910
 because Ben is one of the very 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.840
 best 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.370
 here I think that in addition to hertha 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.539
 berlin makes a very good start to the season 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.010
 I think he will have this little +3 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.619
 Perhaps we'll see two can 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.450
 dads too much we'll see but I'd like 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.590
 although a little colder because it 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.549
 would be a good little player plays in 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.080
 attack for those who do not have much 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.020
 of credit and I think he could 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.900
 hurt with his 86 leading and 87 of 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.009
 speed that could then have then 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.830
 a second player 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.680
 the italian of paris saint germain marco 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.600
 will see who is who and 77 our few of 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.420
 base used to make it go to 80 and 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.250
 of rare lemurs here I think that 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.030
 marco to haiti according to all 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.070
 best in the championship 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.909
 at present it certainly does not do much 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.040
 assists not many goals 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.079
 never marked one seems but in the 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.540
 game it is so precious it is 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.200
 so huge all self that 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.229
 frankly let it be said 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.759
 four stars of technical gestures that 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.040
 really would not steal it only has 3 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.689
 it's a shame but still we can 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.520
 see that if they think they can 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.380
 three levels pass quality again 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.210
 defense it will be much better than 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.000
 these virtuous than his basic version which 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.460
 is not very correct in relation to him 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.480
 even then with this third 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.810
 player has 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:11.130
 the Belgian standard is bath chooses 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.490
 so he has 71 rare base year 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.080
 used to pass it to 74 dollars there 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.270
 also simply be because 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.860
 a chaos war thorgan hazard one of 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.820
 best Belgian who is black there too 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.670
 I do not see why I put it very 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.000
 rare him is to be one of the best there 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.440
 also but otherwise we go it's simple 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.170
 I think he's the top scorer of 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.700
 from belgium with I believe a goal by 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.200
 average match almost or even 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.170
 maybe more I think she had to put 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.810
 15 goals just about it all better 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.980
 roles a little + 3c that's fine and 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.050
 frankly their help is very very 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.790
 good stats even though it's not uncommon for 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.460
 a scorer and I think it would not be 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.440
 bad to buy to test especially so 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.460
 then we have a new player whose 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.160
 it's the fourth it's callejÃ³n so 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.450
 the spanish of naples who he and 75 of 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.980
 base is pretty weird anyway 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.630
 that they were only 75 at first because 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.370
 than a case that the real madrid before 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.540
 it was still a good player 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.870
 often played and scored a lot of 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.670
 goals 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.450
 there this season it is confirmed in more 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.680
 it's not a player who plays scorer so 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.470
 who plays rather on the right side 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.370
 sometimes you need to know 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.260
 some tablecloths I believe he put 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.150
 close and he put eight or nine goals have 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.770
 almost starting the mid season for 1 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.340
 for a right winger it's still 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.470
 not bad so I pass them 78 and I 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.180
 think it's perfectly normal but 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.000
 maybe more because frankly he 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.239
 There are have very badly noted at the beginning of 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.760
 season 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.800
 then we will continue with the 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.290
 fifth and last player who is 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.100
 aaron ramsey so him the welsh of 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.270
 arsenal we know it very very good I 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.870
 believe bay is the best scorer 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.640
 of arsenal tied with giro 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.560
 I believe that there is the game 9 goals eight 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.900
 or nine goals and for a central place 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.760
 it's huge this season ramses it 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.900
 scores a lot of fine goals and more 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.580
 early this year even at the end of the year 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.349
 last he scored a lot and there 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.000
 frankly it's abused mom league of 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.230
 champions in couple they mark they 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.200
 so mark so frankly the 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.610
 pass to the 81 and the rare master 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.260
 it will not be stolen because they 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.659
 deserve so much you'll be able to see these 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.239
 stadiums still in sticks and 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.470
 would go largely improved compared to 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.230
 his basic ration that is not very 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.840
 good but it's normal so here we go 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.829
 this is the third episode I hope 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.500
 that he could have you if that's the case they 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.229
 did not hesitate to like a comment and 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.080
 also to follow me on twitter the cheek 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.210
 but my little one finally not my little gain 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.919
 but rather my little pictures with my 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.449
 name of twitter here if you want 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.960
 to follow me there's no problem I'll be 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.550
 assets 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.660
 about the next videos here 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.660
