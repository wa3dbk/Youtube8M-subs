 mihilidi gentlemen today will not 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.210
 kite review come on android today 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.179
 there will be such a small insert about 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.059
 site did not do tinydeal.com this site 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.429
 which represents a multitude of all sorts 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.580
 Chinese gadgets of various products 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.730
 starting from clothes of some kind of toys 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.650
 case of your iphone and ending 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.840
 intimate goods with christ 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.189
 really can find anything and here 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.949
 such an anboxing such one of 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.910
 packages that are designed to 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.600
 tinydeal site 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.760
 one of those things well here in this here 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.750
 the envelope was sent the whole set was 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.270
 there was a wrist watch there was a tripod mat 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.450
 mouse radio mouse it is wireless 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.379
 It is meant to cover ipod incidentally 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.640
 a dollar and a half is not cheap let's say 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.570
 in fact, now we go to the clock 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.329
 what came to me as a watch in general 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.370
 The parcel went 18 days then from China to Kiev 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.710
 and the watch model is called in sem 1104 by 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.119
 the cost of the watch is about 15 dollars 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.680
 a link under the video to find a watch 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.840
 be sure to go look there and with 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.180
 different models and they are presented in 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.950
 form like a skeleton he really 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.140
 click on the link is very interesting 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.040
 they are made there are different colors 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.600
 I have a solution in such a brown color 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.420
 as for the watch itself about their 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.070
 quality can be judged well, most likely not 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.780
 on the strap because the strap is the most 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.820
 the usual most likely there in a year or two 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.740
 it will have to be changed difficult to say 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.390
 principle of the carpenter so he is not scattering 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.579
 if you bend it so it doesn't break 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.530
 as it happens generally on cheap on 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.500
 very much the same 15 dollars for Chinese 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.509
 hours this is clock skeletons visible mechanism 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.659
 inside in golden brown 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.149
 strap 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.549
 and as you can see from behind it with a car factory 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.100
 not the only nuance that the firm 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.600
 called bio okey some but this 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.240
 most likely a replica of some 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.130
 famous brand and basically on hand 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.469
 look show on our right usually 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.979
 pour so it will be easier to see here 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.509
 so they look like on the arm 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.420
 here you can see well, in principle, not bad 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.259
 Looks like when such cheap hours 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.410
 Permanent wear probably will not 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.590
 practical all the same it is not saphir 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.900
 mastic is some kind of ordinary glass well 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.450
 so here it was scratched but I would not 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.640
 said principle can recommend you 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.440
 this site is one of the advantages 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.200
 in any way embroidered in any way because 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.110
 that already have experience in the packaging have a deadline 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.520
 return that is if you did not like 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.860
 then you can send you money 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.560
 return or exchange for another item what 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.570
 much simpler but of the minuses you do n't 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.680
 did it what you have to wait long again 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.500
 from the pros free absolutely 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.390
 delivery i.e. your time and 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.890
 spend on cat expectations 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.740
 bounces that you nothing for 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.540
 do not pay principle 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.820
 visit the website here is the link below the video 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.420
 Again, repeat, check it out 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.970
