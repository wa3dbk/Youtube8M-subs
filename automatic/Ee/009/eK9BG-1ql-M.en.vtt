in this case is actually thirty dollars
which<00:03:02.100> as<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.700> know<00:03:02.730> if<00:03:02.910> you've<00:03:03.030> watched<00:03:03.209> my

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
which as you know if you've watched my

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.490 
which as you know if you've watched my
reviews<00:03:03.570> before<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.900> know<00:03:03.990> thirty<00:03:04.200> dollars

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
reviews before you know thirty dollars

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.690 
reviews before you know thirty dollars
is<00:03:04.620> probably<00:03:04.950> what<00:03:05.130> I<00:03:05.160> would<00:03:05.220> consider<00:03:05.400> a

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
is probably what I would consider a

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.340 
is probably what I would consider a
reasonably<00:03:06.360> priced<00:03:06.570> case<00:03:06.780> so<00:03:07.080> that's<00:03:07.260> how

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
reasonably priced case so that's how

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.050 
reasonably priced case so that's how
much<00:03:07.500> this<00:03:07.560> case<00:03:07.740> cost<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:08.790> if<00:03:08.910> you're<00:03:09.030> the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
much this case cost so if you're the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.720 
much this case cost so if you're the
type<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.360> person<00:03:09.480> is<00:03:09.840> very<00:03:10.140> active<00:03:10.440> but<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.580> do

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
type of person is very active but you do

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.220 
type of person is very active but you do
also<00:03:11.940> have<00:03:12.060> an<00:03:12.330> office<00:03:12.600> job<00:03:12.630> maybe<00:03:12.930> where<00:03:13.140> you

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
also have an office job maybe where you

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.900 
also have an office job maybe where you
need<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.590> want<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.100> keep<00:03:14.190> on<00:03:14.310> your<00:03:14.459> side<00:03:14.610> of

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.890 
case even if you're not a very active
person<00:03:23.160> if<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.150> just<00:03:24.180> want<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.540> use<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.780> bow

clip<00:03:25.080> it<00:03:25.170> would<00:03:25.260> be<00:03:25.350> awesome<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.830> don't<00:03:26.640> have

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
clip it would be awesome I don't have

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.040

any<00:03:27.000> issues<00:03:27.209> with<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.480> all<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.600> think<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:27.930> does<00:03:28.019> a

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
any issues with it all I think it does a

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.240 
any issues with it all I think it does a
really<00:03:28.110> good<00:03:28.290> job<00:03:28.350> protecting<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.890> it

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
really good job protecting it it

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.250 
really good job protecting it it
obviously<00:03:29.640> doesn't<00:03:30.000> cover<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.450> screen<00:03:30.989> but

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
obviously doesn't cover the screen but

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.540 
obviously doesn't cover the screen but
it<00:03:31.290> does<00:03:31.530> come<00:03:31.680> with<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:31.890> built-in<00:03:31.980> plastic

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
it does come with a built-in plastic

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.590 
it does come with a built-in plastic
here<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:32.880> it<00:03:33.060> would<00:03:33.180> protect<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.540> from

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
here so it would protect it from

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.960 
here so it would protect it from
scratches<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.110> that<00:03:34.290> type<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.470> thing<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:34.970> the
