00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.689
 Hello and welcome to today's video tutorial 

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:16.670
 I would like to wait for you to tell something about Boban 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.929
 not always never 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:21.400
 usually knows the youth 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.500
 Stander prefectures are housed and primarily have the purpose of light 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.669
 bundle up 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.240
 say to avoid stray light but is today for use in Baden 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.310
 at 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.240
 Light-formal larger type speak also the boxes 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.730
 one or the other 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.430
 it will have been seen all are professional studio area 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.630
 Often, such frosts still use boxes to be used 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.680
 but has been prone to such investment at Sonova 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.780
 sometimes costs just as much as the soft box itself 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.010
 that was wonderful but can be useful I want you to one of 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.470
 explain a little practical example 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.330
 we Amir our model that does not promise 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.860
 a classic portrait perspective on the light 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.890
 in 5 40 degree angle approximately from Dr 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.090
 higher percent 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.900
 cheap is being lit 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.470
 and we have in the case 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.460
 then a huge problem 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.090
 if we purposefully still our background light behind at the accident it is 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.010
 a white wall 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.230
 externally or separately separates taxes want rules that is 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.320
 you probably do not just work with a light form 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.130
 but we do not want to be around for the background with anyone else 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.039
 other flashlights work 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.290
 speak make the background for yourself 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.970
 but if we have relocated our model relatively background and come along 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.780
 a juice bar Xen the larger of here different model trains 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.430
 and accordingly and use free decision makers appropriate color 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.939
 we are making the problem in front of this light 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.219
 the similar formalities in our case the soft boxes do not scatter so much 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.059
 sends out sends 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:10.840
 the dr background 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.069
 still relatively heavily illuminated by this soft box 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.989
 yes I've photographed you the whole forfait times 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.320
 and planned that one 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.220
 and from the result you can already see that the area 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.180
 to the left of the model 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.320
 even Weller gets a lot of flare light from this soft box 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.950
 I want to avoid that 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.630
 It really only remains the possibility of the light ahead of ours 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.909
 Softbox so a honeycomb buckle 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.909
 which is attached with Velcro percent 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.129
 and swallows in the case 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.149
 about seven tenths 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:56.169
 around me welded seven-tenths of a complete aperture so always off 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:57.219
 think 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.529
 if not complains live images, for example, would like to create soon 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:02.849
 as well as box with or without barber 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.739
 we have now claim that I am first at the Staufen box or have been 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.319
 measured in camera direction 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.189
 the Wonderwall made that one exact aperture here 8 so became the motif 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:15.359
 photographed 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:16.639
 and 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:21.680
 If we look at these a few throws before that percent in front of the SOF boxing phrases 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:24.679
 we lose exactly seven-tenths of a complete aperture 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:28.900
 to illuminate the model again too high 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.859
 I just have to be corrected according to the places 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:37.099
 and how he sees in the picture with the stretcher what is shown again 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.860
 that just the area to the left of the model 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.679
 Almost almost black 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:48.430
 Of course that depends a bit on the distance with which the model 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.660
 to stand against the background for our case is about one and a half 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.619
 Meter the result would be so 

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:57.399
 Year to be much stronger 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:04:00.450
 if we put the model further away from the background 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.940
 and it depends on Prozaus Knauss on it with what background 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.259
 to edit 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:09.499
 speak also with white background have gray background or black ones 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:10.809
 Peter Groth 

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:11.869
 therefore 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:17.299
 whoever is dependent on the percent of the main light source as possible 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.930
 little to 2 almost no light on the background falls from this 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.860
 Main light source around which can not help but have a corresponding was before 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.740
 The light format to strap and thus has the possibility of the light 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.949
 much better to taxes 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.830
 that was it 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.690
 I wish you lots of fun while copying a lot of fun sweet and up to date 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.210
 nothing to do
