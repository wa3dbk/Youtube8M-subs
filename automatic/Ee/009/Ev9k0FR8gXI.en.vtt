difference<00:01:16.580> isn't<00:01:17.060> that<00:01:17.180> bad<00:01:18.880> really<00:01:19.880> there

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149

isn't<00:01:20.299> much<00:01:20.600> of<00:01:20.630> a<00:01:20.840> washout<00:01:21.259> effect<00:01:21.619> I'd<00:01:21.770> say

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
isn't much of a washout effect I'd say

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:33.219 
isn't much of a washout effect I'd say
just<00:01:23.030> a<00:01:23.149> very<00:01:23.929> slight<00:01:24.440> amount<00:01:32.110> you<00:01:33.110> can

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
just a very slight amount you can

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:43.420 
just a very slight amount you can
generally<00:01:34.009> see<00:01:34.190> that<00:01:34.369> 35<00:01:35.179> watt<00:01:35.360> is<00:01:35.830> bluer

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.020 

it's<00:01:44.030> not<00:01:44.210> too<00:01:44.390> bad<00:01:44.570> I<00:01:44.630> actually<00:01:44.810> do<00:01:45.170> like<00:01:46.030> the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
it's not too bad I actually do like the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.940 
it's not too bad I actually do like the
blue<00:01:47.210> color<00:01:47.240> from<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:47.750> 35<00:01:48.140> watt<00:01:48.380> compared<00:01:48.770> to

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
blue color from the 35 watt compared to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.620 
blue color from the 35 watt compared to
the<00:01:49.690> 55<00:01:51.400> but<00:01:52.400> what<00:01:52.580> can<00:01:52.730> you<00:01:52.820> do<00:01:53.000> unless<00:01:53.420> I

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
the 55 but what can you do unless I

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.130 
the 55 but what can you do unless I
order<00:01:53.660> 6k<00:01:55.180> well<00:01:56.180> actually<00:01:56.330> maybe<00:01:56.690> it'll<00:01:56.930> be<00:01:57.020> my

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
order 6k well actually maybe it'll be my

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.850 
order 6k well actually maybe it'll be my
next<00:01:57.380> thing<00:01:57.530> but<00:01:58.010> whatever

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
next thing but whatever

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.050 
next thing but whatever
actually<00:02:00.860> no<00:02:00.980> I<00:02:01.010> couldn't<00:02:01.580> think<00:02:01.700> of<00:02:01.850> it<00:02:01.940> there

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
actually no I couldn't think of it there

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:12.460 
actually no I couldn't think of it there
actually<00:02:02.360> is<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.570> huge<00:02:02.780> color<00:02:02.990> difference

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.840 

that's<00:02:13.470> for<00:02:13.680> output<00:02:14.130> before<00:02:14.280> see<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.760> the

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
that's for output before see on the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.800 
that's for output before see on the
ground<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.240> did<00:02:15.450> see<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:16.020> has<00:02:16.830> output<00:02:17.250> on<00:02:17.810> on

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
ground you did see that has output on on

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.160 
ground you did see that has output on on
the<00:02:18.959> cut<00:02:19.170> offs<00:02:19.910> I'll<00:02:20.910> just<00:02:21.180> keep<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.870> here<00:02:22.050> for

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
the cut offs I'll just keep it here for

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.630 
the cut offs I'll just keep it here for
a<00:02:22.230> bit<00:02:22.440> see<00:02:22.709> what<00:02:22.740> you<00:02:22.890> guys<00:02:22.980> compared<00:02:23.459> because

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
a bit see what you guys compared because

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
a bit see what you guys compared because
I<00:02:23.700> don't<00:02:23.910> see<00:02:24.120> too<00:02:24.360> much<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.720> difference

just a 55 watt it's a blip a bit more
blurry<00:02:35.700> right<00:02:35.970> guess<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.570> say<00:02:36.690> actually<00:02:36.930> I'm

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
blurry right guess and say actually I'm

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.229 
blurry right guess and say actually I'm
not<00:02:37.320> too<00:02:37.500> sure<00:02:37.680> maybe<00:02:37.920> see<00:02:38.130> much<00:02:38.250> sharper

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
actually sort of like I guess blurry

you<00:03:12.290> can<00:03:12.470> even<00:03:12.560> see<00:03:12.770> the<00:03:12.860> color<00:03:13.010> like<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.520> e
