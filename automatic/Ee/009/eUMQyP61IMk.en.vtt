not doesn't matter all right so on there

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.920 
not doesn't matter all right so on there
is<00:01:29.229> what<00:01:29.680> your<00:01:29.860> cone<00:01:30.100> looks<00:01:30.430> like<00:01:30.690> once<00:01:31.690> you

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
is what your cone looks like once you

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.020 
is what your cone looks like once you
get<00:01:32.229> it<00:01:32.350> out<00:01:32.530> can't<00:01:32.890> let<00:01:33.009> see<00:01:33.220> if<00:01:33.250> I<00:01:33.460> good<00:01:33.700> hold

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
get it out can't let see if I good hold

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.200 
get it out can't let see if I good hold
on<00:01:34.380> yeah<00:01:35.380> that's<00:01:35.619> it<00:01:35.800> right<00:01:35.950> there<00:01:36.009> it's<00:01:36.850> just

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
on yeah that's it right there it's just

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.350 
on yeah that's it right there it's just
that's<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.660> best<00:01:38.320> abasic<00:01:38.890> part<00:01:39.130> right<00:01:39.280> there

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that's the best abasic part right there

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.550 
that's the best abasic part right there
that's<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.660> part<00:01:40.899> that<00:01:40.930> was<00:01:41.110> sticking<00:01:41.440> out

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
that's the part that was sticking out

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.219 
that's the part that was sticking out
and<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:42.759> black<00:01:42.940> part<00:01:43.270> there<00:01:43.600> that<00:01:44.110> goes

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
and the black part there that goes

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.529 
and the black part there that goes
inside<00:01:44.440> the<00:01:44.649> exhaust<00:01:45.160> and<00:01:45.580> I<00:01:45.729> think<00:01:46.270> I'm

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
inside the exhaust and I think I'm

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.359 
inside the exhaust and I think I'm
pretty<00:01:46.750> sure<00:01:46.990> that's<00:01:47.229> what<00:01:47.470> cancels<00:01:47.920> most<00:01:48.190> of

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
pretty sure that's what cancels most of

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.430 
pretty sure that's what cancels most of
the<00:01:48.460> sound<00:01:48.729> and<00:01:49.000> I'm<00:01:49.149> pretty<00:01:49.810> sure<00:01:49.899> that's<00:01:50.200> why

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
the sound and I'm pretty sure that's why

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.399 
the sound and I'm pretty sure that's why
it's<00:01:50.799> a<00:01:50.979> lot<00:01:51.189> louder<00:01:52.119> once<00:01:52.810> you<00:01:52.930> take<00:01:53.110> it<00:01:53.260> off

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
it's a lot louder once you take it off

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.060 
it's a lot louder once you take it off
see<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:53.920> as<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.520> can<00:01:54.670> see<00:01:54.880> it<00:01:55.330> is<00:01:56.229> too<00:01:56.650> big<00:01:56.830> hole

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
see it as you can see it is too big hole

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.929 
see it as you can see it is too big hole
right<00:01:57.280> there<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:58.500> it's<00:01:59.500> it's<00:02:00.340> a<00:02:00.520> lot<00:02:00.700> louder

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
right there and it's it's a lot louder

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:02.999 
right there and it's it's a lot louder
