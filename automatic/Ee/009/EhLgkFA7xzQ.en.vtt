00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.010 

so<00:00:04.859> let's<00:00:05.040> get<00:00:05.190> started<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:06.000> classic<00:00:06.600> glider

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
so let's get started the classic glider

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.100 
so let's get started the classic glider
starts<00:00:07.710> off<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.639> same<00:00:08.910> way<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.269> classic<00:00:09.570> dart

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
starts off the same way the classic dart

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.200 
starts off the same way the classic dart
did<00:00:10.380> in<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.650> first<00:00:10.920> airplane<00:00:11.429> video<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:12.090> we

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
did in the first airplane video that we

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.539 
did in the first airplane video that we
made<00:00:12.679> so<00:00:13.679> we're<00:00:13.830> going<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.009> line<00:00:14.250> up<00:00:14.400> the

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
made so we're going to line up the

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.370 
made so we're going to line up the
corners<00:00:15.529> and<00:00:16.529> it's<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.640> good<00:00:17.850> idea<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.660> move<00:00:19.199> it

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
corners and it's a good idea to move it

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.980 
corners and it's a good idea to move it
forward<00:00:19.710> move<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.460> back<00:00:20.699> until<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.630> get<00:00:21.840> it

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
forward move it back until you get it

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.630 
forward move it back until you get it
just<00:00:22.020> right<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:25.279> make<00:00:26.279> sure<00:00:26.400> you're<00:00:26.519> doing

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
just right and make sure you're doing

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.259 
just right and make sure you're doing
this<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.150> table<00:00:28.189> to<00:00:29.189> get<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> best<00:00:29.699> results

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
this on a table to get the best results

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.420 
this on a table to get the best results
there<00:00:31.140> we<00:00:31.230> go<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.529> once<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.859> got<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.189> we're

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
there we go and once we got it we're

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.569 
there we go and once we got it we're
going<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.610> hold<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.030> firmly<00:00:33.300> with<00:00:33.600> one<00:00:33.780> hand<00:00:34.079> I

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
going to hold it firmly with one hand I

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.780 
going to hold it firmly with one hand I
like<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.730> start<00:00:36.000> off<00:00:36.149> with<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> corners

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
like to start off with the corners

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.160 
like to start off with the corners
gently<00:00:38.790> getting<00:00:39.090> our<00:00:39.210> fold<00:00:41.780> back<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.809> our

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
gently getting our fold back and our

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.279 
gently getting our fold back and our
weight<00:00:43.379> across

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
weight across

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.510 
weight across
once<00:00:46.289> we've<00:00:46.469> got<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> good<00:00:46.920> fold<00:00:47.160> we're<00:00:47.399> going

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
once we've got a good fold we're going

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.910 
once we've got a good fold we're going
to<00:00:47.579> reinforce<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.300> using<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.200> tip<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
to reinforce it using the tip of the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.520 
to reinforce it using the tip of the
finger<00:00:53.480> and<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.719> again<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.230> way<00:00:57.530> great

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
finger and do that again this way great

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.599 
finger and do that again this way great
so<00:00:59.489> now<00:00:59.640> we're<00:00:59.760> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.910> open<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.359> up<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:02.579> that

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
so now we're going to open it up so that

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.119 
so now we're going to open it up so that
it<00:01:02.820> looks<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.090> mountain<00:01:03.739> so<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> next

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
it looks like a mountain so the next

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.789 
it looks like a mountain so the next
part<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.729> taking<00:01:06.420> down<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.840> top<00:01:07.200> part<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
part is taking down the top part of the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.480 
part is taking down the top part of the
plane<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.400> bringing<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.180> down<00:01:10.100> to<00:01:11.100> line<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.310> up

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
plane and bringing it down to line it up

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.750 
plane and bringing it down to line it up
with<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.790> center<00:01:12.979> take<00:01:13.979> your<00:01:14.159> time<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.640> try

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
with the center take your time and try

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.170 
with the center take your time and try
to<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> best<00:01:15.450> fold<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.080> because

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
to get the best fold you can because

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.520 
to get the best fold you can because
folding<00:01:18.180> paper<00:01:18.390> airplanes<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.110> one<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.409> those

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
folding paper airplanes is one of those

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.380 
folding paper airplanes is one of those
things<00:01:19.830> where<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> more<00:01:20.250> patience<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.150> have

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
things where the more patience you have

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.560 
things where the more patience you have
and<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:23.159> more<00:01:23.340> careful<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.850> are<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.390> better

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
and the more careful you are the better

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.289 
and the more careful you are the better
your<00:01:24.810> plane<00:01:25.110> will<00:01:25.259> come<00:01:25.409> out<00:01:25.560> at<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> end<00:01:26.299> and

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
your plane will come out at the end and

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.710 
your plane will come out at the end and
it<00:01:27.900> takes<00:01:28.110> practice<00:01:28.909> so<00:01:29.909> hold<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:30.540> one

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
it takes practice so hold it with one

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.109 
it takes practice so hold it with one
hand<00:01:30.750> once<00:01:31.200> you've<00:01:31.350> got<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.759> make<00:01:32.970> your

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
hand once you've got it and make your

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.289 
hand once you've got it and make your
crease<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.990> we're<00:01:34.140> going<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.290> reinforce<00:01:34.829> it

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
crease and we're going to reinforce it

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.550 
crease and we're going to reinforce it
I'm<00:01:36.299> going<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> same<00:01:36.840> thing<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.409> left

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
I'm going to the same thing to the left

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.230 
I'm going to the same thing to the left
side<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.189> bring<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.520> down<00:01:38.700> towards<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.150> center

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
side so bring it down towards the center

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.139 
side so bring it down towards the center
and<00:01:42.860> try<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.950> make<00:01:44.159> sure<00:01:44.189> we've<00:01:44.490> got<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.729> lined

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
and try to make sure we've got it lined

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.630 
and try to make sure we've got it lined
up

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.750 

I<00:01:48.700> can<00:01:49.390> tell<00:01:49.570> them<00:01:49.659> lines<00:01:49.840> isn't<00:01:50.020> lined<00:01:50.350> up

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
I can tell them lines isn't lined up

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.130 
I can tell them lines isn't lined up
perfectly<00:01:51.760> but<00:01:52.000> it's<00:01:52.180> okay<00:01:52.450> we're<00:01:52.930> going<00:01:53.020> to

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
perfectly but it's okay we're going to

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:01.109 
perfectly but it's okay we're going to
work<00:01:53.260> with<00:01:53.409> what<00:01:53.560> we<00:01:53.650> got<00:01:59.400> so<00:02:00.400> this<00:02:00.640> part<00:02:00.970> is

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
work with what we got so this part is

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.300 
work with what we got so this part is
exactly<00:02:01.780> like<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:02.260> classic<00:02:02.800> dart<00:02:03.040> that<00:02:03.190> we

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
exactly like the classic dart that we

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.810 
exactly like the classic dart that we
did<00:02:03.460> in<00:02:03.550> the<00:02:03.640> first<00:02:03.820> video<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:06.250> next<00:02:06.610> step

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
did in the first video and the next step

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.820 
did in the first video and the next step
is<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.180> bring<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.690> tip<00:02:07.960> down<00:02:08.259> towards<00:02:08.740> the

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
is to bring the tip down towards the

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.449 
is to bring the tip down towards the
center<00:02:10.620> and<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.740> want<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.010> bring<00:02:12.160> it<00:02:12.280> down

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
center and you want to bring it down

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.280 
center and you want to bring it down
doesn't<00:02:13.000> have<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.240> be<00:02:13.330> exact<00:02:13.720> but<00:02:13.959> you<00:02:14.080> want<00:02:14.230> to

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
doesn't have to be exact but you want to

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.470 
doesn't have to be exact but you want to
bring<00:02:14.440> it<00:02:14.530> down<00:02:14.560> a<00:02:14.739> bit<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:16.150> sides

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
bring it down a bit so that the sides

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.370 
bring it down a bit so that the sides
here<00:02:17.050> have<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.470> little<00:02:17.800> straight<00:02:18.489> part<00:02:19.380> this

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
here have a little straight part this

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.720 
here have a little straight part this
plane<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:20.739> definitely<00:02:21.100> going<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.250> be<00:02:21.310> smaller

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
plane is definitely going to be smaller

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.010 
plane is definitely going to be smaller
than<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.480> first<00:02:23.170> plane<00:02:23.709> that<00:02:23.739> we<00:02:24.070> made<00:02:25.020> so

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
than the first plane that we made so

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:33.870 
than the first plane that we made so
we'll<00:02:26.140> start<00:02:26.410> with<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.680> corners<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:32.880> another

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
we'll start with the corners and another

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.420 
we'll start with the corners and another
tip<00:02:34.239> is<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.810> make<00:02:35.140> sure<00:02:35.170> your<00:02:35.470> crease<00:02:35.890> is<00:02:35.920> lined

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
tip is to make sure your crease is lined

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:44.220 
tip is to make sure your crease is lined
up<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.580> then<00:02:42.820> reinforce<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:43.510> fold<00:02:43.870> with<00:02:44.110> the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
up and then reinforce that fold with the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.210 
up and then reinforce that fold with the
tip<00:02:44.440> of<00:02:44.620> our<00:02:44.680> finger<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:47.530> next<00:02:47.830> step<00:02:48.040> is

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
tip of our finger and the next step is

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.100 
tip of our finger and the next step is
to<00:02:48.370> bring<00:02:48.610> these<00:02:48.820> two<00:02:49.030> corners<00:02:49.510> down<00:02:49.690> towards

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
to bring these two corners down towards

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.069 
to bring these two corners down towards
the<00:02:50.230> center<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:55.000> hopefully<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:55.720> can<00:02:55.750> still

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
the center so hopefully you can still

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.940 
the center so hopefully you can still
see<00:02:56.290> your<00:02:56.440> crease<00:02:56.799> and<00:02:58.170> then<00:02:59.170> once<00:02:59.440> you<00:02:59.590> got<00:02:59.739> it

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
see your crease and then once you got it

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.150 
see your crease and then once you got it
hold<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:00.519> with<00:03:00.640> one<00:03:00.790> hand

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
hold it with one hand

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.740 
hold it with one hand
like<00:03:03.160> I<00:03:03.310> said<00:03:03.370> starting<00:03:03.910> with<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.120> corners<00:03:04.540> is

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
like I said starting with the corners is

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.630 
like I said starting with the corners is
what<00:03:05.350> I<00:03:05.380> like<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.650> do<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:09.220> then<00:03:09.370> get<00:03:09.489> that

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
what I like to do and then get that

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.720 
what I like to do and then get that
crease<00:03:10.000> going<00:03:10.390> there<00:03:11.250> with<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.370> tip<00:03:12.549> of<00:03:12.670> the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
crease going there with the tip of the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.280 
crease going there with the tip of the
finger<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:14.820> repeat<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:16.150> process<00:03:16.510> on<00:03:17.140> the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
finger and repeat the process on the

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.730 
finger and repeat the process on the
left<00:03:17.320> side<00:03:19.920> here<00:03:20.920> we<00:03:21.160> go

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.220 

so<00:03:24.400> this<00:03:24.610> is<00:03:24.850> really<00:03:25.150> forming<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.780> wing<00:03:26.020> of

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
so this is really forming the wing of

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.620 
so this is really forming the wing of
your<00:03:26.380> plane<00:03:26.760> this<00:03:27.760> crease<00:03:28.090> right<00:03:28.330> here<00:03:30.420> we<00:03:31.420> got

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
your plane this crease right here we got

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:41.520 
your plane this crease right here we got
that<00:03:31.960> I<00:03:39.210> haven't<00:03:40.210> folded<00:03:40.570> paper<00:03:40.930> airplanes<00:03:41.380> in

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
that I haven't folded paper airplanes in

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.860 
that I haven't folded paper airplanes in
a<00:03:41.590> long<00:03:41.920> time<00:03:42.550> so<00:03:42.940> I'm<00:03:43.030> starting<00:03:43.420> off<00:03:43.540> with<00:03:43.600> the

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
a long time so I'm starting off with the

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.080 
a long time so I'm starting off with the
easy<00:03:44.140> ones<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:45.340> then<00:03:45.610> we're<00:03:45.760> going<00:03:45.880> to<00:03:45.910> work

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
easy ones and then we're going to work

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.960 
easy ones and then we're going to work
our<00:03:46.270> way<00:03:46.300> up<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.720> tricky<00:03:47.440> ones<00:03:47.590> so<00:03:48.310> this

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
our way up to the tricky ones so this

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.880 
our way up to the tricky ones so this
step<00:03:49.300> holds<00:03:49.990> the<00:03:50.140> plane<00:03:50.350> together<00:03:50.530> we're

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
step holds the plane together we're

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.370 
step holds the plane together we're
going<00:03:50.980> to<00:03:51.070> take<00:03:51.310> this<00:03:51.720> part<00:03:52.720> right<00:03:52.930> here<00:03:53.200> and

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
going to take this part right here and

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.600 
going to take this part right here and
fold<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.740> up<00:03:53.860> so<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.950> folds<00:03:57.310> are<00:03:57.400> going<00:03:57.550> to

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
fold it up so the folds are going to

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.700 
fold it up so the folds are going to
start<00:03:57.820> getting<00:03:58.470> tougher<00:03:59.470> and<00:03:59.620> tougher

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
start getting tougher and tougher

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.950 
start getting tougher and tougher
because<00:04:00.400> paper<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:01.360> getting<00:04:01.600> thicker<00:04:01.840> and

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
because paper is getting thicker and

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
because paper is getting thicker and
thicker<00:04:04.830> okay

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
thicker okay

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.530 
thicker okay
now<00:04:06.160> we're<00:04:06.460> going<00:04:06.550> to<00:04:06.610> fold<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.120> plane<00:04:07.390> in

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
now we're going to fold the plane in

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.710 
now we're going to fold the plane in
half<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:09.370> can<00:04:09.550> kind<00:04:09.880> of<00:04:10.000> see<00:04:10.210> a<00:04:10.240> taking

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
half and you can kind of see a taking

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.630 
half and you can kind of see a taking
shape

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
shape

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.860 
shape
so<00:04:12.640> let's<00:04:12.820> reinforce<00:04:13.240> that<00:04:13.660> fold<00:04:14.020> here<00:04:14.470> and

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
so let's reinforce that fold here and

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.830 
so let's reinforce that fold here and
the<00:04:16.870> last<00:04:17.140> step<00:04:17.440> is<00:04:17.710> to<00:04:18.310> make<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:18.970> wings<00:04:19.210> so

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
the last step is to make the wings so

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.890 
the last step is to make the wings so
we're<00:04:20.080> going<00:04:20.260> to<00:04:20.580> take<00:04:21.580> this<00:04:21.880> part<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:22.540> line

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
we're going to take this part and line

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.630 
we're going to take this part and line
it<00:04:22.930> up<00:04:23.140> with<00:04:23.320> this<00:04:23.530> part<00:04:23.830> here<00:04:24.100> at<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.280> bottom

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
it up with this part here at the bottom

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:34.240 
it up with this part here at the bottom
so<00:04:25.680> let's<00:04:26.680> fold<00:04:26.920> it<00:04:27.100> down

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.600 

and<00:04:35.250> get<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.030> bottom<00:04:36.480> part<00:04:36.780> lined<00:04:37.020> up<00:04:37.170> there

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
and get the bottom part lined up there

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.160 
and get the bottom part lined up there
the<00:04:38.610> front<00:04:38.820> part<00:04:39.180> lined<00:04:39.450> up<00:04:39.600> here<00:04:41.570> and<00:04:42.570> hold<00:04:42.930> it

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
the front part lined up here and hold it

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.170 
the front part lined up here and hold it
with<00:04:43.290> one<00:04:43.500> hand<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:44.100> start<00:04:44.730> making<00:04:45.060> our

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
with one hand and start making our

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:53.480 
with one hand and start making our
crease<00:04:51.500> and<00:04:52.500> then<00:04:52.620> do<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.860> same<00:04:53.070> thing<00:04:53.280> on<00:04:53.370> the

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
crease and then do the same thing on the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:07.360 
crease and then do the same thing on the
other<00:04:53.520> side<00:04:54.500> bring<00:04:55.500> that<00:04:55.710> part<00:04:55.980> down<00:04:56.160> here<00:05:03.020> and

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.040 

start<00:05:08.370> with<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.580> corners<00:05:09.120> getting<00:05:09.810> our

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
start with the corners getting our

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.340 
start with the corners getting our
crease<00:05:11.540> so<00:05:12.540> you<00:05:12.600> got<00:05:12.750> apply<00:05:12.990> a<00:05:13.020> lot<00:05:13.320> more

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
crease so you got apply a lot more

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.680 
crease so you got apply a lot more
pressure<00:05:13.560> on<00:05:14.040> this<00:05:14.370> step<00:05:14.730> because<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.420> paper

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
pressure on this step because the paper

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.990 
pressure on this step because the paper
is<00:05:15.900> a<00:05:15.960> lot<00:05:16.140> of<00:05:16.230> thicker<00:05:19.280> and<00:05:20.280> now<00:05:20.730> that<00:05:20.880> we've

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
is a lot of thicker and now that we've

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.960 
is a lot of thicker and now that we've
got<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.420> plane<00:05:22.020> folded<00:05:22.740> we're<00:05:23.190> all<00:05:23.430> set<00:05:23.790> to

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
got the plane folded we're all set to

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.530 
got the plane folded we're all set to
fly<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:24.270> so<00:05:24.690> throwing<00:05:25.170> a<00:05:25.290> paper<00:05:25.530> airplane<00:05:25.770> is

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
fly it so throwing a paper airplane is

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.150 
fly it so throwing a paper airplane is
almost<00:05:27.540> as<00:05:27.780> important<00:05:28.320> as<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.650> way<00:05:28.740> you<00:05:28.800> fold

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
almost as important as the way you fold

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:36.590 
almost as important as the way you fold
it<00:05:34.250> so<00:05:35.250> you<00:05:35.310> want<00:05:35.550> to<00:05:35.610> practice<00:05:35.820> throwing<00:05:36.480> it

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
it so you want to practice throwing it

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.930 
it so you want to practice throwing it
what<00:05:37.530> I<00:05:37.560> like<00:05:37.740> about<00:05:37.890> this<00:05:38.220> plane<00:05:38.580> is<00:05:38.910> that

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
what I like about this plane is that

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.450 
what I like about this plane is that
it's<00:05:39.210> smaller<00:05:39.660> and<00:05:39.990> that<00:05:40.440> this<00:05:40.770> part<00:05:41.160> looks

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
it's smaller and that this part looks

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.860 
it's smaller and that this part looks
cleaner<00:05:42.110> it<00:05:43.110> holds<00:05:43.560> together<00:05:43.770> better<00:05:44.870> and

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
cleaner it holds together better and

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.930 
cleaner it holds together better and
it's<00:05:46.170> got<00:05:46.530> more<00:05:46.710> weight<00:05:46.980> to<00:05:47.010> it<00:05:47.250> because<00:05:47.760> it's

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
it's got more weight to it because it's

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.420 
it's got more weight to it because it's
smaller<00:05:48.270> in<00:05:48.540> the<00:05:48.630> paper's<00:05:49.050> thicker<00:05:49.430> so

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
smaller in the paper's thicker so

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.760 
smaller in the paper's thicker so
compared<00:05:51.030> to<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.480> first<00:05:51.840> plane<00:05:52.200> that<00:05:52.230> we<00:05:52.500> did

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
compared to the first plane that we did

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.270 
compared to the first plane that we did
the<00:05:53.070> classic<00:05:53.340> dart<00:05:54.560> you<00:05:55.560> can<00:05:55.590> see<00:05:56.010> that

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
the classic dart you can see that

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.910 
the classic dart you can see that
underneath<00:05:57.210> this<00:05:57.780> part<00:05:58.110> opens<00:05:58.440> up<00:05:58.590> a<00:05:58.710> little

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:58.920 
underneath this part opens up a little

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.500 
underneath this part opens up a little
bit<00:05:59.100> more<00:05:59.990> compared<00:06:00.990> to<00:06:01.080> this<00:06:01.230> one
