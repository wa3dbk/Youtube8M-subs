00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
what might have gotten left off sure i

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.789 
what might have gotten left off sure i
mean<00:01:27.090> i<00:01:27.150> think<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.509> fascinating<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.470> look<00:01:28.650> at

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
mean i think it's fascinating to look at

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.999 
mean i think it's fascinating to look at
what<00:01:29.189> people<00:01:29.490> did<00:01:30.420> not<00:01:30.450> vote<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.770> but

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
what people did not vote for and but

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.760 
what people did not vote for and but
assumed<00:01:32.490> would<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.090> list<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
assumed would be on the list so the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.890 
assumed would be on the list so the
little<00:01:34.920> prince<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.909> nowhere<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.540> list<00:01:36.720> to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
little prince is nowhere on the list to

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.710 
great but generally speaking it was it
it's<00:03:14.620> not<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.190> perfect<00:03:15.489> list<00:03:15.970> in<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.330> world<00:03:16.540> I
