00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
getting work all of those things I think

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.630 
getting work all of those things I think
that<00:02:07.119> we<00:02:07.720> need<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.899> have<00:02:08.229> high<00:02:08.560> ambitions<00:02:08.769> of

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
that we need to have high ambitions of

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.910 
that we need to have high ambitions of
the<00:02:09.849> people<00:02:10.179> with<00:02:10.299> learning<00:02:10.450> disabilities

assailant<00:02:11.920> me<00:02:12.010> what<00:02:12.220> people<00:02:12.430> can<00:02:12.760> do<00:02:13.030> and

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
assailant me what people can do and

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.570 
assailant me what people can do and
there's<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.750> great<00:02:13.989> deal<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.470> people<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.310> can

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
there's a great deal of people that can

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.970 
there's a great deal of people that can
achieve<00:02:15.940> rather<00:02:16.510> than<00:02:16.750> saying<00:02:17.019> people<00:02:17.739> can't

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
achieve rather than saying people can't

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
what I think gives people the

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.410 
what I think gives people the
opportunity<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.829> express<00:02:24.069> themselves

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420

personally<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.989> think<00:02:29.380> people<00:02:29.739> with<00:02:29.980> learning

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
personally I think people with learning

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.069
