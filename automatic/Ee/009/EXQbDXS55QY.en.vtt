 him either by ear and break all the strings 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:37.510

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:48.010
 fret jim chords and with everyone in general 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:51.819
 nakajima features 6 and 5 string became 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:57.939

 fight on old-fashioned 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.590
 now how we play fight fight 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.750
 the song is probably the hardest part 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.140

 This is the part of the battle 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.599
 it just repeats afterwards the same 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:34.010
 so the first thing we do we touch 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.010
 blow down the top three strings 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:42.370
 and then the usual blow to all the strings 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.370
 not to be put down 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.070
 so we played down and we played 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:55.400
 all the strings up and 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:57.349
 I will not keep myself from the top 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:03.439
 don't forget till the first three strings for 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:06.230
 because now what will we play on 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.030

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.960
 He plays three times completely. 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:24.230
 further we make such a transition to the next 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.230
 year 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.630
 top to bottom top 3 strings and 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.100
 and this we play roughly in fourth 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:43.530
 just go to the next chord 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.150
 chord g major 7 chord 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.160

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.900
 the game can em7 just like they played 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.280

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.210
 show it slowly 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.110
 if the bond if not the mixture 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.110

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.969
 plus there is 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.600
