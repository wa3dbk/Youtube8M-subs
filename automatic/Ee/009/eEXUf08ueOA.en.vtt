00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.399
 this change is a whole fundamental issue when it comes to the 

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:20.070
 Future of our planet gives 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.429
 I think that's clear to anyone reading the paper and following the reports 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.429
 the phenomenon of a changing climate exists 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.359
 the scientists and professionals and futurologists argue about how 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:37.050
 fast or slow and how exactly the developments will look for 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.770
 our game we assume the failure will be a climate change 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.720
 as probably all the other pros and cons and we go 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.990
 shopping out a scenario 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.380
 where against some areas 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.320
 Nature will be wrested from new areas that benefit from one 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.740
 possible climate change and we start from areas 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.030
 where nature gives people, so to speak, coastal regions and so on 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.790
 in the area of ​​decreases and 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.360
 this is something that will make me play again, that is the player 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.740
 new areas of renewable land 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.020
 for just one of the two factions for which he himself 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.570
 has decided and Sam will too 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.810
 having to deal with a very dynamic world, the whole name will be hard to come by 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.170
 on his decisions 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.060
 and around 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.080
 on his playful focus 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.190
 otherwise when they play 70 in the future the polar ice caps melted off customer 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.350
 global warming 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.590
 therefore the alliance is on our island world the island world percent is like that 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.630
 created by that they just 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.460
 some parts of the previous whole area have been flooded with water 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.920
 and mankind is always with him 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.600
 to put on these and to secure new areas in order to build again 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.170
 and percent the Ecos Rumsfeld in customer talks party it percent 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.550
 Levels trying to learn from those past mistakes 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.030
 In the future it should be avoided and Dieter Kunzelmann with it thus thereby 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.990
 that they want to be fifth and to the old proven ones 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.020
 Finally, methods January for hundreds of years also works 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.379
 continue to insist on it 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.319
 far too rare 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.390
 Now you have to draw the right lessons for the answer 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.609
 Find future in the summer 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:23.569
 we have Vera march I used the graphics engine yes Wanderer knows differently 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.749
 uses only four «already very good» was completely reworked 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.209
 It is completely new things possible in the game you can see the islands 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.170
 Hamburg 29 seats I am not signed hard 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.540
 in contrast to its predecessor in the topography has rather heights and 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.920
 Deep down is important because we are moving in the future and now 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.969
 Of course, at the core, of course, is still a building game and therefore 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.419
 the construction of architecture and buildings play an important role 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.699
 that's the way it will be in the future 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:57.510
 that the architecture of course fell the largest of the area but also a lot 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:02.499
 is higher and we do not want our skyscrapers around the rest 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:05.799
 Surpassing mountain massifs also means that nature is natural 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.709
 must grow with 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.329
 then there is also we have already talked about climate change 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.179
 also substantive reasons that argue that nature is something 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:18.349
 Nature has changed nature is very powerful 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.279
 something we experience again and again these days and that is why it is 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:24.319
 just because 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.649
 but we have the song beautiful percent of the country in Carinthia in our map 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:29.469
 for meeting 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:32.139
 That's the impression we want to convey from nature 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.939
 she is so beautiful but also something in the picture frame 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.940
 as before in the samples it was missing for the mean but we will many 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.970
 see interesting blogs massive 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.080
 see the much larger river percent and so on so the islands will be around 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.020
 a lot more interesting what optics but what do they think
