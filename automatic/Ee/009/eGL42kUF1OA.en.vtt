00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.900 

I<00:05:27.410> think<00:05:28.410> for<00:05:28.560> the<00:05:28.650> next<00:05:28.680> barrage<00:05:29.190> of<00:05:29.460> episodes

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
I think for the next barrage of episodes

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.909 
I think for the next barrage of episodes
what<00:05:30.120> we'll<00:05:30.270> be<00:05:30.360> doing<00:05:30.479> is<00:05:30.750> will<00:05:30.990> change<00:05:31.800> of

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
what we'll be doing is will change of

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.730 
what we'll be doing is will change of
the<00:05:32.040> map<00:05:33.169> considering<00:05:34.169> the<00:05:34.229> close<00:05:34.470> proximity

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
the map considering the close proximity

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.860 
the map considering the close proximity
this<00:05:35.310> has<00:05:35.430> given<00:05:35.550> us<00:05:35.850> a<00:05:36.180> significant

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
this has given us a significant

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.230 
this has given us a significant
advantage<00:05:37.790> let<00:05:38.790> us<00:05:38.940> see<00:05:39.120> what<00:05:39.330> they<00:05:39.479> are<00:05:39.510> up<00:05:39.630> to

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
advantage let us see what they are up to

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.750 
advantage let us see what they are up to
what<00:05:42.240> station<00:05:42.690> is<00:05:42.720> in<00:05:43.020> general

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.320 

already<00:05:48.600> in<00:05:48.810> the<00:05:48.840> GA<00:05:49.220> and<00:05:50.220> then<00:05:50.670> even<00:05:50.910> faster

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
already in the GA and then even faster

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.630 
already in the GA and then even faster
the<00:05:51.540> other<00:05:51.660> two<00:05:52.070> again<00:05:53.070> not<00:05:53.250> having<00:05:53.490> to<00:05:53.550> build

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
the other two again not having to build

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.490 
the other two again not having to build
power<00:05:53.880> plants<00:05:54.390> is<00:05:54.540> decisive

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
power plants is decisive

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.350 
power plants is decisive
it's<00:05:55.740> very<00:05:56.070> nice<00:05:56.340> now<00:05:56.970> we<00:05:57.030> could<00:05:57.240> have<00:05:57.270> done

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
it's very nice now we could have done

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.670 
it's very nice now we could have done
that<00:05:57.600> with<00:05:57.810> any<00:05:58.050> GLA<00:05:58.650> so<00:05:59.270> I<00:06:00.270> believe<00:06:00.900> every<00:06:01.290> GLA

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
that with any GLA so I believe every GLA

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.280 
that with any GLA so I believe every GLA
has<00:06:01.890> access<00:06:02.250> to<00:06:02.280> quad<00:06:02.580> cannon<00:06:03.000> so<00:06:03.240> what<00:06:04.170> we

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
has access to quad cannon so what we

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.260 
has access to quad cannon so what we
really<00:06:04.590> did<00:06:04.740> there<00:06:04.950> is<00:06:05.100> we<00:06:05.250> emphasize<00:06:05.700> an<00:06:05.940> anti

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
really did there is we emphasize an anti

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.000 
really did there is we emphasize an anti
infantry<00:06:06.780> with<00:06:06.930> the<00:06:07.020> quad<00:06:07.260> cannons<00:06:07.710> and<00:06:07.920> an

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
infantry with the quad cannons and an

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.830 
infantry with the quad cannons and an
anti<00:06:08.280> vehicle<00:06:08.790> with<00:06:08.940> those<00:06:09.090> rocket<00:06:09.480> launcher

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
anti vehicle with those rocket launcher

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.620 
anti vehicle with those rocket launcher
infantry<00:06:10.440> so<00:06:10.940> really<00:06:11.940> kept<00:06:12.180> with<00:06:12.360> it<00:06:12.390> we

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
infantry so really kept with it we

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.130 
infantry so really kept with it we
collected<00:06:13.020> more<00:06:13.170> resources<00:06:13.710> which<00:06:13.980> is<00:06:14.130> great

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140 
collected more resources which is great

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.770 
collected more resources which is great
would<00:06:16.140> we<00:06:16.260> lose<00:06:16.410> 6<00:06:16.740> units<00:06:17.160> to<00:06:17.940> 36<00:06:18.510> that's

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
would we lose 6 units to 36 that's

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.170 
would we lose 6 units to 36 that's
awesome<00:06:19.590> was<00:06:20.130> that<00:06:20.160> 6<00:06:20.520> to<00:06:20.670> 1<00:06:22.070> yeah<00:06:23.070> it's<00:06:24.060> not

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
awesome was that 6 to 1 yeah it's not

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.040 
awesome was that 6 to 1 yeah it's not
bad<00:06:24.240> I<00:06:24.630> bet<00:06:25.620> at<00:06:25.740> all<00:06:25.860> so<00:06:26.630> yeah<00:06:27.630> I<00:06:27.660> think<00:06:27.840> that
