remarkably different product since these

remarkably different product since these
birds<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.219> much<00:01:02.520> more<00:01:02.760> room<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.329> roam<00:01:03.690> and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
birds have much more room to roam and

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.380 
birds have much more room to roam and
we're<00:01:04.920> careful<00:01:05.250> about<00:01:05.670> moving<00:01:06.180> them

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
we're careful about moving them

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.380 
we're careful about moving them
frequently<00:01:07.220> they<00:01:08.220> do<00:01:08.280> tend<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.880> be<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> cleaner

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
frequently they do tend to be a cleaner

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.770 
frequently they do tend to be a cleaner
flock<00:01:10.490> with<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.790> recent<00:01:12.210> concern<00:01:12.600> about

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
flock with the recent concern about

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.100 
flock with the recent concern about
salmonella<00:01:13.500> contamination<00:01:13.710> with<00:01:14.670> eggs<00:01:15.110> even

salmonella contamination with eggs even

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.440 
salmonella contamination with eggs even
in<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.380> situation<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.189> can't<00:01:17.490> entirely<00:01:18.000> get

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
in this situation you can't entirely get

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.929 
in this situation you can't entirely get
away<00:01:18.689> from<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:19.200> risk<00:01:19.500> for<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.400> variety<00:01:20.700> of

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
away from that risk for a variety of

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.420 
away from that risk for a variety of
physiological<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:22.049> anatomical<00:01:22.220> reasons<00:01:23.220> but

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
physiological and anatomical reasons but

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.160 
physiological and anatomical reasons but
since<00:01:23.759> these<00:01:23.939> birds<00:01:24.180> just<00:01:24.450> have<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.869> much<00:01:25.110> more

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
since these birds just have so much more

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.140 
since these birds just have so much more
space<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.970> basically<00:01:27.600> reduce<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.290> risk

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
space you you basically reduce the risk

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.030 
space you you basically reduce the risk
every<00:01:30.150> week<00:01:30.329> or<00:01:30.479> two

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
every week or two

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.380 
every week or two
everything<00:01:32.040> gets<00:01:32.159> broken<00:01:32.460> down<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.000> gets

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
everything gets broken down and gets

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.240 
everything gets broken down and gets
moved<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.780> new<00:01:34.020> ground<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:36.140> these<00:01:37.140> very<00:01:38.009> half

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
moved to new ground so these very half

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.420 
moved to new ground so these very half
of<00:01:38.430> chickens<00:01:38.790> I'm<00:01:38.970> happy<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.079> way

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
of chickens I'm happy to do it this way

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.200 
of chickens I'm happy to do it this way
it's<00:01:41.430> much<00:01:41.640> more<00:01:41.909> management<00:01:42.360> intensive<00:01:43.110> it's

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
it's much more management intensive it's

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.740 
it's much more management intensive it's
less<00:01:45.210> productive<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.850> space<00:01:47.850> basis<00:01:48.420> you

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
less productive on a space basis you

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.550 
less productive on a space basis you
know<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.579> production<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.729> eggs<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.600> really

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
know the production of eggs is really

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.830 
know the production of eggs is really
done<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:53.009> high<00:01:53.369> intensity<00:01:53.939> houses<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.810> a

done in high intensity houses for a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.109 
done in high intensity houses for a
variety<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.409> reasons<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.189> whatever<00:01:56.759> your

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
variety of reasons and whatever your

variety of reasons and whatever your
take<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.409> prefer<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.770> raise<00:01:59.189> my<00:01:59.549> food

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
take is I just prefer to raise my food

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.350 
take is I just prefer to raise my food
this<00:02:00.450> way<00:02:00.890> it's<00:02:01.890> much<00:02:02.189> more<00:02:02.430> natural

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
this way it's much more natural

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.420 
this way it's much more natural
