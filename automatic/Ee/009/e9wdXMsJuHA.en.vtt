all<00:01:11.760> right<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.180> you'll<00:01:13.049> actually<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.409> able<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
all right and you'll actually be able to

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.840 
all right and you'll actually be able to
login<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.750> your<00:01:16.320> username<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.430> password

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
login with your username and password

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.580 
login with your username and password
alright<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.810> I'll<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:18.990> wait<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.350> load

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
alright and I'll just wait for this load

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.960 
alright and I'll just wait for this load
so<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:19.950> might<00:01:20.189> be<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> bit<00:01:20.430> slow<00:01:20.549> by<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.850> way

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
so it might be a bit slow by the way

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.249 
so it might be a bit slow by the way
because<00:01:21.150> I'm<00:01:21.330> still<00:01:21.570> transitioning<00:01:21.900> and

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
because I'm still transitioning and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.950 
because I'm still transitioning and
optimizing<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.520> you'll<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.630> able<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.780> log

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
optimizing it but you'll be able to log

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.030 
optimizing it but you'll be able to log
in<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.229> your<00:01:25.259> email<00:01:25.439> address<00:01:25.799> or<00:01:25.890> username
