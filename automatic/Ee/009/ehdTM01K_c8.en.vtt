against<00:00:07.319> tottenham<00:00:07.680> hotspur<00:00:08.010> away<00:00:08.250> now<00:00:08.460> I

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
against tottenham hotspur away now I

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.560 
against tottenham hotspur away now I
thought<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:08.880> would<00:00:08.970> be<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.059> difficult<00:00:09.269> game

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
thought this would be a difficult game

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.959 
thought this would be a difficult game
given<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.110> got<00:00:10.230> smashed<00:00:10.740> at<00:00:10.980> home<00:00:11.160> by<00:00:11.429> two

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
given that I got smashed at home by two

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.580 
given that I got smashed at home by two
teams<00:00:12.179> who<00:00:12.450> were<00:00:12.630> beneath<00:00:12.990> me<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.410> league

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
teams who were beneath me in the league

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.660 
teams who were beneath me in the league
I<00:00:13.740> don't<00:00:13.920> really<00:00:14.040> think<00:00:14.130> that's<00:00:14.460> too

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
I don't really think that's too

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.340 
I don't really think that's too
offensive<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.630> say<00:00:15.780> or<00:00:15.929> anything<00:00:16.199> like<00:00:16.230> that

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
offensive to say or anything like that

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.390 
offensive to say or anything like that
but<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.650> can<00:00:16.800> have<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> look<00:00:17.039> at<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.220> team

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
but you can have a look at the team

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.130 
but you can have a look at the team
line-ups<00:00:17.640> there<00:00:17.940> obviously<00:00:18.090> spreads<00:00:18.990> are

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
line-ups there obviously spreads are

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.810 
line-ups there obviously spreads are
starting<00:00:19.380> with<00:00:19.500> them<00:00:19.650> belly<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.310> behind<00:00:20.580> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
starting with them belly just behind the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.609 
starting with them belly just behind the
foe<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.180> remember<00:00:21.539> he's<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:22.080> going

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
foe and remember he's a going

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.950 
foe and remember he's a going
head-to-head<00:00:22.830> with<00:00:23.269> Hernandez<00:00:24.269> for<00:00:24.510> top<00:00:24.750> goal

scorer in the league at the moment which
is<00:00:26.609> kind<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.029> strange<00:00:27.150> but<00:00:27.480> Hernandez<00:00:27.900> comes

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
is kind of strange but Hernandez comes

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.660 
is kind of strange but Hernandez comes
forward<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.590> 11th<00:00:28.980> minute<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.400> look<00:00:29.550> at

right and I think he's going to be a
really<00:02:25.400> good<00:02:25.520> player<00:02:25.730> he's<00:02:25.940> well<00:02:26.300> able<00:02:26.510> to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
really good player he's well able to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.660 
really good player he's well able to
pass<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.080> ball<00:02:27.230> but<00:02:27.860> next<00:02:28.340> we<00:02:28.430> come<00:02:28.520> up

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
pass the ball but next we come up

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.670 
pass the ball but next we come up
against<00:02:28.880> reading<00:02:29.300> who<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.200> believe<00:02:30.650> are

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
against reading who I believe are

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.500 
against reading who I believe are
actually<00:02:31.010> bought<00:02:31.580> him<00:02:31.730> at<00:02:31.820> a<00:02:31.910> table<00:02:32.090> at<00:02:32.360> this

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
actually bought him at a table at this

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.880 
actually bought him at a table at this
point<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:32.960> thought<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:33.410> would<00:02:33.560> be<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.710> good

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
point and I thought this would be a good

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.490 
point and I thought this would be a good
chance<00:02:34.130> for<00:02:34.310> me<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.550> overcome<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:36.050> like<00:02:36.380> the

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
chance for me to overcome the like the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.050 
chance for me to overcome the like the
weird<00:02:36.800> nerves<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:37.370> had<00:02:37.520> against<00:02:37.820> teams

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
weird nerves that I had against teams

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.490 
weird nerves that I had against teams
like<00:02:38.150> West<00:02:38.450> Brom<00:02:38.660> in<00:02:38.780> West<00:02:38.960> Ham<00:02:39.110> where<00:02:39.320> I<00:02:39.350> lost

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
like West Brom in West Ham where I lost

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.840 
like West Brom in West Ham where I lost
a<00:02:39.710> home<00:02:39.860> but<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.130> Lana<00:02:40.340> comes<00:02:40.580> charging

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
as well Wigan got relegated in real life

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.220 
as well Wigan got relegated in real life
and<00:06:08.820> carne<00:06:09.120> is<00:06:09.180> a<00:06:09.270> really<00:06:09.630> good<00:06:09.750> striker<00:06:10.080> I

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
and carne is a really good striker I

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.360 
and carne is a really good striker I
think<00:06:10.500> in<00:06:10.620> the<00:06:10.680> Premier<00:06:10.950> League<00:06:10.980> like<00:06:11.280> he

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
think in the Premier League like he

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.500 
think in the Premier League like he
played<00:06:11.580> really<00:06:11.760> well<00:06:11.880> for<00:06:12.120> a<00:06:12.210> week<00:06:12.300> and<00:06:12.420> I

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
played really well for a week and I

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.760 
played really well for a week and I
think<00:06:12.690> he<00:06:12.780> could<00:06:12.960> if<00:06:13.080> he<00:06:13.110> could<00:06:13.470> do<00:06:13.590> even

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
think he could if he could do even

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.950 
think he could if he could do even
better<00:06:14.010> with<00:06:14.670> a<00:06:14.700> team<00:06:14.940> who<00:06:15.120> has<00:06:15.420> a<00:06:15.450> tendency<00:06:15.780> to

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
better with a team who has a tendency to

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.260 
better with a team who has a tendency to
score<00:06:16.320> even<00:06:16.500> more<00:06:16.830> goals<00:06:17.100> for<00:06:17.520> their<00:06:17.700> as<00:06:17.850> you

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
score even more goals for their as you

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.820 
score even more goals for their as you
can<00:06:18.390> see<00:06:18.570> demba<00:06:18.990> ba<00:06:19.140> scored<00:06:19.410> there<00:06:19.650> in<00:06:19.740> the

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830
