00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.250 
so at high heat I would touch my sesame
seed<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:18.040> very<00:02:19.040> important<00:02:19.519> to<00:02:19.610> keep<00:02:19.849> steering

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
seed and very important to keep steering

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.900 
seed and very important to keep steering

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
because if you stop steering you will

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.400 
because if you stop steering you will
burn<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:24.129> sesame<00:02:25.129> seed<00:02:25.370> from<00:02:25.700> one<00:02:25.879> side<00:02:26.410> so

burn the sesame seed from one side so

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.740 
burn the sesame seed from one side so
just<00:02:27.440> keep<00:02:27.830> steering<00:02:28.220> for<00:02:29.060> two<00:02:29.569> to<00:02:29.720> three

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
just keep steering for two to three

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.390 
just keep steering for two to three
minutes<00:02:30.019> until<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.680> start<00:02:31.040> having<00:02:31.690> this
