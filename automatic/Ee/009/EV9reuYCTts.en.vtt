which<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:44.129> disappointing<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.360> tried<00:00:46.230> I

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
which is disappointing but I tried I

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.250 
which is disappointing but I tried I
tried<00:00:47.340> very<00:00:47.850> hard<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> guy

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
tried very hard as you can see a guy

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.540 
tried very hard as you can see a guy
kind<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.649> squirming<00:00:49.950> around<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.370> there<00:00:50.520> I

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
kind of squirming around in there I

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.770 
kind of squirming around in there I
think<00:00:50.640> as<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:51.989> got<00:00:52.170> sniped<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.780> didn't

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
think as I just got sniped and didn't

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.310 
think as I just got sniped and didn't
die<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.530> that's<00:00:55.680> cool<00:00:56.629> sometimes<00:00:57.629> no<00:00:58.079> idea

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
die so that's cool sometimes no idea

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.360 
die so that's cool sometimes no idea

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
that would would kill him but it did not

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.609 
that would would kill him but it did not
hit<00:01:24.270> right<00:01:24.479> next<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> door<00:01:25.049> too

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619

which<00:01:26.189> kind<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.430> sucks<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:27.829> was<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.189> was<00:01:29.430> really

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
which kind of sucks I was I was really

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.289 
which kind of sucks I was I was really
close<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:31.110> nailing<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.280> guy<00:01:32.460> getting<00:01:33.060> rid<00:01:33.270> of

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
close to nailing that guy getting rid of

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.240 
close to nailing that guy getting rid of
them<00:01:33.560> getting<00:01:34.560> rid<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.799> him<00:01:35.009> out<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.130> that

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
them getting rid of him out of that

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.819 
them getting rid of him out of that
house<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.909> course<00:01:36.150> people<00:01:36.299> are<00:01:36.390> gonna<00:01:36.479> make

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
house of course people are gonna make

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.190 
house of course people are gonna make
random<00:01:37.829> jokes<00:01:38.220> about<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.750> think<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.049> see

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
random jokes about that so I think I see

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.350 
random jokes about that so I think I see
a<00:01:40.229> guy<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> feel<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.520> I'm<00:01:41.700> probably<00:01:42.000> kind

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
a guy but I feel like I'm probably kind

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.960 
a guy but I feel like I'm probably kind
of<00:01:42.420> outmatched<00:01:43.369> probably<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.430> lot<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.700> people

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
of outmatched probably a lot of people

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.700 
of outmatched probably a lot of people
coming<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.270> through<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.530> guy<00:01:46.680> just

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
coming in through that and that guy just

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.710 
coming in through that and that guy just
got<00:01:47.009> screwed<00:01:47.430> out<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.790> double<00:01:48.090> kill<00:01:48.240> one<00:01:48.600> he

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
got screwed out of a double kill one he

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.690 
got screwed out of a double kill one he
probably<00:01:48.899> should<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.140> had<00:01:49.310> one<00:01:50.310> more<00:01:50.490> bullet

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
probably should have had one more bullet

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.399 
probably should have had one more bullet
at<00:01:50.909> least<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.270> would<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.479> been<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.899> would
