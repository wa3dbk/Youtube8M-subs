00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.400 
qualities I hope that the quality of the
mics<00:03:50.550> decent<00:03:51.060> because<00:03:51.390> until<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:51.959> think<00:03:52.290> it's

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
mics decent because until I think it's

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.280 
mics decent because until I think it's
like<00:03:52.530> 2014<00:03:53.489> there's<00:03:54.209> going<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.510> be<00:03:54.570> no<00:03:54.810> chat
