 facebook from 2nd to 10th October 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.940
 aifon aitate other devices are but is increasingly present we see it also 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.689
 in this case you are in the company of m rossella simonetti the avionics that there 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.399
 explained on the same system of integration with dai then phone 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.329
 then for us the application is we are never in a way to live presario gps 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.040
 not just when embarking 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.360
 but basically every time one thinks of the sea experiences then first 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.250
 and even later 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.950
 the application is available for help for aiphon 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.030
 and for android systems 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.010
 costs on android and on aifon the whole Mediterranean 9 r99 its ipad at 24 euros 99 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.110
 worldwide coverage is still available. you the other applications 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.390
 once as you download the app we now see its ipad just for you 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.460
 big text 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.220
 you remain resident inside the phone then the airsoft user in the card 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.540
 he can visualize it without having to make any kind of connection unless 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.170
 don't want to see google maps 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.530
 because at home on the sofa and because it has a wi-fi connection in this case 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.110
 you need to lizzanella the map to the overlay of google today bing web 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.340
 oh God thought marx the things that can be done with one and with the fathers ad 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.479
 example I want to program the route also I want to do tomorrow 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.710
 I want to take a trip around Genoa 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.360
 I leave the port 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.240
 by fazio my route 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.090
 return to port 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.260
 the save 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
 but to see the route information 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.350
 as soon as I can rename call I see all the data 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.000
 the relative to the rota 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.110
 I agree with it. I can send it via e-mail 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.110
 feisbucco sectors there s you use 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.649
 now depends on what zaccandari mail 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:22.689
 the latest news is the same with the track we are available to 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.089
 all points of the navionics databease 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:28.369
 so I can search inside the navies of shipyards of the 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:29.769
 repair 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.009
 I can view sea 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.009
 this, for example, the Genoa tide I can change 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.540
 and going to see based on the time ooooh flooded 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.349
 that interests me more 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.090
 the latest news, however, that we introduced in Genoa is the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.239
 possibility of using the isee gine detail content as many times 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.659
 let's go to a port 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.810
 in a place we do not know we are not sure 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.260
 because maybe it's called and the navionics card is perfect but maybe 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.139
 we want 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.869
 ancient open in the meantime then 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:12.109
 we have included the possibility to activate a map and raspberries together 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.459
 therefore relative 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.239
 % I see that when opened new restaurant by the sea 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.769
 Click on the point of the card add jet 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:29.839
 services shops we have said restaurant I insert all the information 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:31.149
 restaurant 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:35.619
 I also add them immediately in real time and they are visible on the card 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:40.749
 they recognize themselves deviantly respects the official information because they have a 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.409
 pallino with 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.649
 the duvet for example like these 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:49.859
 if in any case I want only official card data I don't want to do 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.499
 no connection I turn off the community map 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:59.329
 and the points in real time disappear, but here is something, this is the real thing 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.509
 question that cannot be asked 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:05.259
 you can't do it you can't have a battery that can't last 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:08.460
 having with these systems is a waterproof system 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.590
 you can't have a transcribed warning wo i even only reset enlightened then 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.159
 under the sun you see very little now with this technology is this 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:21.189
 pussy the boat license no longer makes anyone 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:26.330
 but this is a matter of conscience knowing how to go by boat is as good as going 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.529
 mountain must fear that more powerful than us 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:34.039
 other novelty navionics the integration between reporter phone let's do it 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.259
 explain 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.139
 how many times also comes mark ama we had done the fine if the phone 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.270
 and we want to find them instantly on the plotter to take hey off without it 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.479
 having to perhaps redo the route this is a product a prototype will be 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.719
 available 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:53.199
 in and I went next 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.199
 but we launched genova as a novelty 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.699
 here you can see that ok, a route has been made too, I have both on the phone 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.770
 kessel that on the plotter the shadow of 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.460
 change it 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.460
 then I change the route 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.650
 we say that sometimes go by 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.889
 genoa finalized 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.710
 up to portofino 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.120
 then I change the route 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.339
 the save 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:33.870
 on the phone and instantly in real time is changed 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.210
 also 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.589
 on the 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:39.589
 on the video plot 

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:44.369
 if for example I want to delete it from 4 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.279
 I remove it 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.879
 sign in and I even disappear for cakes 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:53.259
 same thing if I want 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:56.259
 however it is to make a route on a plotter 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.039
 because you want to do them by boat 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:04.749
 but then the desire to see the safe at home 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:12.079
 nerd you see a little more in real time 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:15.319
 the resource the telephone 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:16.569
 fantastic 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:17.459
 thank you so much
