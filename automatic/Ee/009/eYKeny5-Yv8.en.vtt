we're taking the buzzard helicopter just
outside<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> military<00:01:35.220> base<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:36.119> think<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:37.140> I

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
outside the military base I think that I

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.920 
outside the military base I think that I
think<00:01:37.729> personally<00:01:38.729> getting<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.270> jet<00:01:39.540> out<00:01:39.720> of

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
think personally getting a jet out of

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.380 
think personally getting a jet out of
the<00:01:40.320> military<00:01:40.500> base<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.920> easier<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.880> get<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.299> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the military base is easier you get in a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.999 
the military base is easier you get in a
tank<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:42.869> actually<00:01:43.110> getting<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.439> tank<00:01:43.799> out

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
tank but actually getting the tank out

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.740 
tank but actually getting the tank out
of<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.430> miniature<00:01:44.670> base<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.090> one<00:01:45.240> piece<00:01:45.479> is

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
of the miniature base in one piece is

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.810 
of the miniature base in one piece is
freaking<00:01:46.170> tough<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.220> we're<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.430> going<00:01:47.579> for<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
freaking tough so we're we going for the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.020 
freaking tough so we're we going for the
jet<00:01:48.119> first<00:01:48.390> hopefully<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:49.020> works<00:01:49.229> out<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.680> is

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
jet first hopefully it works out this is

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.130 
jet first hopefully it works out this is
probably<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.240> take<00:01:51.420> me<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.540> few<00:01:51.780> attempts

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
probably going to take me a few attempts

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.289 
probably going to take me a few attempts
to<00:01:52.229> do<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.439> I'm<00:01:52.560> not<00:01:52.740> gonna<00:01:52.920> lie<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
to do is I'm not gonna lie that is a

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.780 
to do is I'm not gonna lie that is a
military<00:01:54.509> base<00:01:54.659> off<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> right<00:01:55.350> there

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
military base off to the right there

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.889 
military base off to the right there
sure<00:01:56.790> some<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.119> guys<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.450> ventured<00:01:57.810> in

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
sure some of you guys have ventured in

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.420 
sure some of you guys have ventured in
and<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.200> realize<00:01:58.590> how<00:01:58.710> hard<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.159> if<00:01:59.340> you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
and you realize how hard it is if you

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.459 
and you realize how hard it is if you
give<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.759> go<00:01:59.939> mommy<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.079> realize<00:02:01.320> how<00:02:01.439> hard

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
give it a go mommy you realize how hard

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.780 
give it a go mommy you realize how hard
is<00:02:01.770> now<00:02:01.890> we're<00:02:02.009> gonna<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.189> doing<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.490> lining

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
is now we're gonna be doing is lining

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.760 
is now we're gonna be doing is lining
just<00:02:02.820> outside<00:02:03.479> some<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.439> guys<00:02:04.530> may<00:02:04.740> have

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
just outside some of you guys may have

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.139 
just outside some of you guys may have
entered<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.219> military<00:02:05.520> base<00:02:05.640> at<00:02:05.850> another

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
entered the military base at another

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.190 
entered the military base at another
route

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
route

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.499 
route
probably<00:02:08.130> because<00:02:08.250> if<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.520> go<00:02:08.700> by<00:02:08.940> car<00:02:09.240> it

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
probably because if you go by car it

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.730 
probably because if you go by car it
will<00:02:09.630> tell<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.050> enter<00:02:10.349> another<00:02:10.500> way<00:02:10.679> you

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
will tell you to enter another way you

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
we want to be entering through the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.100 
we want to be entering through the
bridge<00:02:15.510> way

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
bridge way

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.240 
bridge way
bridge<00:02:16.380> way<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.650> I'm<00:02:16.709> going<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.860> be<00:02:16.950> entering

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
bridge way that I'm going to be entering

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.589 
bridge way that I'm going to be entering
through<00:02:17.489> now<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.760> when<00:02:18.000> we<00:02:18.090> land<00:02:18.330> in<00:02:18.540> the

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
through now is when we land in the

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.910 
through now is when we land in the
helicopter<00:02:19.200> because<00:02:19.349> we<00:02:19.560> actually<00:02:19.680> need<00:02:19.890> to

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
helicopter because we actually need to

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.949 
helicopter because we actually need to
get<00:02:20.069> ourselves<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.489> Hummer<00:02:20.730> don't<00:02:21.569> open<00:02:21.750> up<00:02:21.810> on

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
this is not easy now what we need here

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.630 
this is not easy now what we need here
is<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:45.630> decent<00:02:45.930> car<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.530> infiltrate<00:02:46.920> the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
is a decent car to infiltrate the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.120 
is a decent car to infiltrate the
military<00:02:48.030> base<00:02:48.290> this<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.350> quite<00:02:49.620> an<00:02:49.680> important

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
military base this is quite an important

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.890 
military base this is quite an important
choice<00:02:50.310> don't<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.150> something<00:02:51.540> that's<00:02:51.660> fairly

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
choice don't you something that's fairly

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.009 
choice don't you something that's fairly
quick<00:02:52.280> but<00:02:53.480> is<00:02:54.480> also<00:02:55.400> fairly<00:02:56.510> strong<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:57.870> this

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
quick but is also fairly strong so this

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.539 
quick but is also fairly strong so this
could<00:02:58.230> work<00:02:58.380> quite<00:02:58.709> well<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:59.010> sort<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.250> mixture

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
could work quite well it sort of mixture

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.449 
could work quite well it sort of mixture
of<00:02:59.760> both<00:03:00.290> there's<00:03:01.290> no<00:03:01.440> sports<00:03:01.799> cars<00:03:02.100> around<00:03:02.280> at
