00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
bdmv look down missy stream and then

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.070 
bdmv look down missy stream and then
there<00:02:39.530> are<00:02:39.560> our<00:02:39.800> clips<00:02:40.130> now<00:02:41.060> we<00:02:41.390> can<00:02:41.510> play<00:02:41.690> one

there are our clips now we can play one
clip<00:02:42.470> at<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.680> time<00:02:43.100> but<00:02:43.700> you<00:02:44.120> would<00:02:44.270> have<00:02:44.300> to

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
clip at a time but you would have to

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.240 
clip at a time but you would have to
then<00:02:44.690> go<00:02:44.870> back<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.320> open<00:02:45.590> up<00:02:45.680> each<00:02:45.890> clip

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
then go back and open up each clip

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.430 
then go back and open up each clip
individually<00:02:46.970> as<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.300> go<00:02:47.480> so<00:02:48.050> you<00:02:48.080> don't<00:02:48.320> have

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
individually as you go so you don't have

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.110 
individually as you go so you don't have
to<00:02:48.590> do<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:48.709> on<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.130> Mac<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:49.490> can<00:02:49.670> actually

to do that on the Mac you can actually

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.420 
to do that on the Mac you can actually
then<00:02:50.150> just<00:02:50.510> go<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:50.870> take<00:02:51.080> all<00:02:51.290> these<00:02:51.980> files

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
then just go and take all these files

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.960 
then just go and take all these files
and<00:02:52.850> hit<00:02:53.510> open<00:02:53.810> now<00:02:54.800> over<00:02:55.400> here<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.730> see<00:02:55.940> the

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
what you're going to do then is just

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.760 
what you're going to do then is just
close<00:03:31.710> it<00:03:31.740> out<00:03:32.780> when<00:03:33.780> you're<00:03:33.930> done<00:03:34.110> you<00:03:34.350> can

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
also if you've got a program that can

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.520 
also if you've got a program that can
convert<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:38.790> can<00:03:38.940> grab<00:03:39.240> the<00:03:39.690> mts<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.830> m2ts<00:03:41.790> file

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
convert you can grab the mts I m2ts file

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.240 
convert you can grab the mts I m2ts file
put<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.650> on<00:03:43.740> your<00:03:43.770> desktop<00:03:44.190> like<00:03:44.520> that<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:46.250> I

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.190 
put it on your desktop like that and I
have<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.520> program<00:03:47.850> over<00:03:48.300> here<00:03:48.480> called<00:03:48.720> may<00:03:48.930> pics

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
have a program over here called may pics

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.060 
have a program over here called may pics
dream<00:03:49.590> clip<00:03:49.830> which<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.100> love<00:03:51.830> and<00:03:52.830> then<00:03:53.010> you

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
dream clip which I love and then you

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.070 
dream clip which I love and then you
just<00:03:53.220> take<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.550> file<00:03:53.790> throw<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.600> into<00:03:54.810> this

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
just take the file throw it into this

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.960 
just take the file throw it into this
program<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.860> then<00:03:56.100> you<00:03:56.250> can<00:03:56.430> convert<00:03:56.820> it<00:03:56.910> to
