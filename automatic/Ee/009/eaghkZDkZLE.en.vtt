00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
stay in no matter what because if you do

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.889 
stay in no matter what because if you do
the<00:02:00.149> math<00:02:00.360> here<00:02:00.659> he's<00:02:01.409> got<00:02:01.700> one<00:02:02.700> two<00:02:03.060> three

he's probably gonna call

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.500 
he's probably gonna call
because<00:02:14.190> he's<00:02:14.310> getting<00:02:14.370> seven<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:14.910> one<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.330> his
