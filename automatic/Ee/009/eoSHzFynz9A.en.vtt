00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.620
 the hand a quick recognition of the 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.439
 bad luck that he had another wood this 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.270
 played and the audience is that almost more than 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.040
 take your hands to your head has given 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.910
 the feeling that rejoice that 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.510
 go play squares 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.510
 well 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.760
 destiny 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.110
 past games of all kinds has 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.450
 come to my head I do not know that it is not 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.430
 comparable in the end of the champions 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.500
 of glasgow conquest in the goal 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.169
 real madrid an injury and I was 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.550
 thinking now and if also boxes for 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.149
 height car 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.460
 but let's go to the above to me 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.050
 it seems that the expulsion is rigorous 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.800
 it seems to be rigorous because the 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.530
 sail dribbling is out and the 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.180
 ball is far enough away as 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.530
 to interpret that maybe the bear goes out 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.050
 that where it seems that in which it was 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.150
 there from behind 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.430
 I could reach him he goes away alleys 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.920
 that JosÃ© Mourinho indicated that he is going to 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.680
 leave your hole within the terrain of 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.480
 game no longer just capital 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.010
 to the goalkeeper and have to take a second 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.050
 goalkeeper who has not warmed up is also 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.270
 lose that player and it's alley who 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.010
 is right now with a face because I 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.050
 I think here to talk to who can 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.610
 having before seeing that luck does not have 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.020
 accompanied the machine today we will see from 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.670
 again the play adam is wrong 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.590
 getting the ball for carballo carvalho 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.940
 he does not dominate him from the rostrum he goes towards 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.770
 outside green 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.300
 adam goes out of control and if it comes out 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.300
 uncontrolled 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.660
 to some extent it is understandable 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.660
 problem 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.220
 for me 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.500
 why 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.740
 first candle is out 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.130
 the occasion is being too busy 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.560
 manifest of goal or is not so clear and the 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.600
 squares enters the field that love the 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.670
 tier of the bernabÃ©u and at the end presents 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.550
 better in what we saw in the boot 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.869
 of the party the cricket director 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.060
 squares under the clubs after the 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.680
 expulsion of antonio where he liked 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.810
 that from whom he quoted was an amateur 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.540
 because nobody could think such a thing 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.190
 and let's not say if it's his for the 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.330
 criminal turned a turn of the 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.330
 tremendous events
