00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello to all saw that on the blog on 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.400
 youtube someone told me about 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.070
 try tsf shell 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.099
 I wanted to be able to install it 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.740
 see on the galaxy s3 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.320
 let's go and see it right I think 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.410
 tsf I chose one of the more launchers 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.519
 expensive if not the most expensive on play 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.460
 store 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.740
 let's see what it offers know 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.660
 which certainly offers some excellent ones 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.630
 effects in 3d for example this here 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.910
 of the screens where we can indeed 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.329
 go and choose the one you want 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.210
 now the app menu is of interest here 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.719
 drawer we find it here you can see 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.059
 we know this cylinder effect 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.590
 if we want to insert an application on 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.340
 one of the screens we can go to 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.250
 insert the widgets here now 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.260
 example of this launcher 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.030
 the gallery the weather in the reader 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.379
 musical for example we click on 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.760
 gallery we will have this effect a lot 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.040
 very nice to see 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.030
 which will show our photos 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.300
 present in the gallery we go back 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.720
 the weather is and we click it comes out 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.060
 precisely the means of our city 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.540
 we will be able to set up the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.910
 automatic location of the widget 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:32.950
 weather and and music widget a lot 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:34.840
 simple very simple however we can 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:42.460
 go a little stay the songs that 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:45.220
 we want to have anything run here 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.110
 we will have our widgets we can insert 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.550
 the folders for example from are inserted 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.190
 one of captain we go to see 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.380
 the effect of when they come is opened 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.990
 here we are 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.180
 let's say that su galaxy s3 as you can 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.770
 see it runs very smoothly a lot 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.270
 very fluid mind as you can see on 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.770
 a fresh layer 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.630
 maybe there will be something else to do for you 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.450
 see, however, I think that anyway they are 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.810
 main things we say that is a lot 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.640
 nice to look at though I don't know in 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.159
 how many of you will have purchased the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.610
 version 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:24.519
 the version on the play store also because 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.170
 however it seems to me about 13 bars at 14 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.040
 â‚¬ whereas for the angel I am not 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.150
 few nothing we say it was right for 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.670
 curiosity since he would have it 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.640
 reported wanted to let you see it also on 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.180

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.480
