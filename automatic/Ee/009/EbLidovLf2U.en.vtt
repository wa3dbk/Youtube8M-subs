other day saying what is podcasting mean
I<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.560> thought<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.009> sounded<00:01:50.130> cool<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:50.759> not

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
I just thought it sounded cool but not

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.300 
I just thought it sounded cool but not
sure<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.470> know<00:01:52.560> what<00:01:52.710> maybe<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.100> time

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
sure so you know what maybe it's time

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.749 
sure so you know what maybe it's time
for<00:01:53.340> us<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:54.020> refocus<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.290> little<00:01:55.470> bit<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.649> that

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
for us to refocus a little bit on that

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.889 
for us to refocus a little bit on that
especially<00:01:56.759> with<00:01:57.030> that'll<00:01:57.329> be<00:01:57.390> for<00:01:57.600> coming

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
especially with that'll be for coming

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.660 
especially with that'll be for coming
out<00:01:57.960> we're<00:01:58.530> going<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.710> be<00:01:58.770> doing<00:01:58.860> podcast<00:01:59.460> more

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670

regularly<00:02:00.119> again<00:02:00.469> probably<00:02:01.939> bi-weekly<00:02:02.939> i

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
regularly again probably bi-weekly i

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.200 
regularly again probably bi-weekly i
would<00:02:03.719> think<00:02:03.750> maybe<00:02:04.229> more<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.920> depends<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:05.549> on

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
would think maybe more it depends on on

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.969 
would think maybe more it depends on on
how<00:02:06.600> how<00:02:07.140> things<00:02:07.350> are<00:02:07.500> flowing<00:02:07.770> in

have tossed back some things because

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.640 
have tossed back some things because
what's<00:03:51.570> really<00:03:51.630> cool<00:03:51.900> is<00:03:51.959> that<00:03:52.110> when<00:03:52.320> we<00:03:52.440> first

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
what's really cool is that when we first

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.020 
what's really cool is that when we first
started<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:52.890> channel<00:03:53.100> we<00:03:53.160> didn't<00:03:53.340> have<00:03:53.459> the

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
started a channel we didn't have the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.870 
started a channel we didn't have the
ability<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.620> kind<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.769> you<00:03:55.980> know<00:03:56.010> do<00:03:56.670> what<00:03:56.790> we

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
ability to kind of you know do what we

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.470 
ability to kind of you know do what we
wanted<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.209> because<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.510> was<00:03:58.019> so<00:03:59.239> overdone<00:04:00.239> I

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
wanted to because it was so overdone I

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.240 
wanted to because it was so overdone I
guess<00:04:00.840> as<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.080> is<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.590> way<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.739> put<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.010> so

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
guess as it is the way to put it so

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.680 
guess as it is the way to put it so
every<00:04:02.610> time<00:04:02.640> we<00:04:02.880> came<00:04:03.030> up<00:04:03.090> with<00:04:03.269> were<00:04:03.660> like

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
every time we came up with were like

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.600 
every time we came up with were like
it'd<00:04:03.930> be<00:04:04.049> cool<00:04:04.230> if<00:04:04.260> we<00:04:04.350> did<00:04:04.470> oh<00:04:04.799> that's<00:04:05.489> right

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
it'd be cool if we did oh that's right

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.220 
it'd be cool if we did oh that's right
yeah<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:06.239> one<00:04:06.360> already<00:04:06.480> did<00:04:06.690> that<00:04:06.840> one<00:04:06.989> so<00:04:07.170> it

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
yeah so one already did that one so it

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.220 
yeah so one already did that one so it
would<00:04:07.350> be<00:04:07.470> nice<00:04:07.620> as<00:04:07.799> we<00:04:07.920> get<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:08.640> go<00:04:08.730> in<00:04:08.930> with<00:04:09.930> a
