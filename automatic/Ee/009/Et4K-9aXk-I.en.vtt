00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:06.940
 in february 19 153 the sea submerged from golan of asia and not from part of the country 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.620
 electricity is cut off communications are interrupted 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.269
 yet very quickly some radios walk not new 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.560
 they are powered by small generators driven by 

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.509
 a revolutionary engine 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.739
 but as soon as the operation is over these engines regain the secret of 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:23.929
 Philippe's laboratories 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:25.230
 the electronics giant 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.929
 who developed them 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.619
 and since that is the silence silence all the more strange that this engine 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.280
 accepts all fuels 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.890
 almost perfect kinepolis 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.810
 and especially that its consumption is half of the engines 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.810
 current 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.940
 so who from this miracle engine 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.220
 This is the engine stirling the hot air motor 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.950
 the patent was filed by Scottish Reverend Robert Stirling in 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.380
 eighteen 116 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.010
 fifty years before the four-stroke engine its 91 years before the engine 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.910
 diesel 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.910
 rififi of our cars today 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.550
 how does this engine 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.560
 the principle is simple take a bike or foot pump 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.200
 the compression is enough to warm up the displayed in the crowd 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.030
 now 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.000
 butcher the pump warmed up its end 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.310
 the lens will warm up and its pressure will increase 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.869
 which will push the piston back by compressing the air contained in the other 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.060
 side 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.720
 campeon cooled the skin 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.610
 the piston returns to its initial position 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.610
 the heat is thus transformed into mechanical energy 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.190
 the power of such a device is ridiculous and its poor performance 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.690
 robert kalinka's idea of ​​genius was to add a second pistons 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.690
 for warm air to move from left to right of AIDS 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.319
 the cause of AIDS andré constantly heat up and the right cooled 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.210
 there is still a lot of heat loss so energy 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.150
 to recover this lost heat stirling has come up with the 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.810
 regenerator 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.700
 the original actor comes to capture some of the calories of the dungeon when he 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.800
 part to the cold zone 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.160
 when the gas goes back to the hot zone it recovers its calories 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.749
 as well as sterling lawyer a yield close to 40% against 20% 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.520
 for 4-stroke or diesel engines 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:23.379
 the steering only calls for a source of heat at the end of AIDS 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:28.959
 Any fuel suits case oil fuel oil gas 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.640
 conclusive tests nevertheless 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.640
 better with a brazier 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:39.260
 like these raw fuels in the open burning and almost total 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.569
 no need for exhaust pipes and a level of pollution much lower than 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.569
 engines 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.209
 fausto rinaldi new cases it is necessary to use any pace at this 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.139
 insisted he is one of the best writers and it's just us 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.269
 are friends 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.659
 the study of this engine started in 10 938 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.180
 purpose to manufacture generators for radios and 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.079
 televisions 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.340
 but in 10 950 the invention of the transistor makes it possible to build radio 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:10.849
 battery operated 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.179
 no need for generators 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:16.879
 the Philippine company then looks at other applications of steering 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.879
 like the refrigerator or the heat pump 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:23.489
 karl is she is not only a motor it's also a fantastic 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.299
 thermal machine 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.329
 let's resume our fight at dawn 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:29.569
 instead of counting 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:30.589
 inspired 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:32.799
 the air relaxes and cools 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.759
 that's the principle of any refrigerator 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:37.879
 it's the same with the stirling 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.399
 just train it with an electric motor 

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:44.039
 for the ash head to less than 100 degrees the temperature to 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:47.219
 which looks good he says 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.659
 now inversion of direction of rotation of the electric motor 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.659
 the cylinder is warming up 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.469
 and which earned him yesterday 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.419
 the athlete is over 700 degrees 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.709
 when we stop the electric motor the hot steering 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.779
 becomes an engine 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:10.009
 the philippe sempé company is also trying to sell its know-how to 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:12.639
 car manufacturers like general motors get 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:17.560
 in the format a bus and a boat are equipped with a stirling engine and then at 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.559
 early 70s this torino ford 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:21.410
 Alas 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.120
 the mechanism to vary the engine speed is not in focus 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.040
 10 975 the departure of the CEO of Forbes only the death knell of the project 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:34.550
 demonstrating the ability the commercial application of the service in the elite by 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.590
 elsewhere canada will be a machine after i chained 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.570
 but in the late 70s 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.710
 the philippe society give up and give up 6 years 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.810
 a group of former engineers from the firm then founded general scanning 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.490
 corporation in the united states 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.069
 this company and its subsidiaries sell refrigerant stirling 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:55.069
 he's trying to promote solar scanning 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.300
 two reasons there is always reluctance to change maxime if you 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.120
 are a diesel engine manufacturer 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.020
 you will not be in a hurry to build another type of engine even though as 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.389
 anyone who invests a considerable amount of effort and money anne 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.789
 to make a more efficient model with a pasture of ngos 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.210
 soro but the woods goes back into the manufacture of a car engine 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.800
 manufacture also rely on the pressure of opinion that comes to 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.969
 crack 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:23.009
 it takes a sauce sixteen dates anne the stylist people will continue to 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.319
 produce cars with diesel engine or diesel engine of course 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.999
 there is a dozen or so ngo happening in the country me but when the degree of 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:32.879
 pollution of the two come not very interesting as this is currently 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:35.719
 to forego a military commitment to governments to go to their 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:38.740
 German auto recruiter to produce clean cars long 

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:41.739
 with syria 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.900
 faced with this defense to the extreme round 6 8 me to many consultants in 

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:50.370
 universities at constant number sitting 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.050
 the meeting between us launched on the track of the sterling because the engine 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.290
 stirling she allowed me advances with the best performance at the time 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.770
 it was a particular match to respect them at last that's what we did 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.139
 that's enough then in 1975 we were sentenced a research on the 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.980
 stirling engine shape despite a dream season so do not know who a subsidiary 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:11.860
 from toyota 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.469
 and the largest Japanese automotive subcontractor 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:16.650
 after more than 50 years of development 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.880
 a Japanese company will she reap the fruit of an invention that 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.620
 European and American industry failed to complete
