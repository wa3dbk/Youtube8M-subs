00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.940
 now in our nutrition section 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.680
 hydration sandra suÃ¡rez will explain that 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.170
 we must eat and take the day of the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.240
 good race well in this opportunity 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.740
 we are going to talk to you about what we should 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.779
 do to improve our performance 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.820
 in the 10k races once we get 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.380
 we raise then the day of the race there 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.390
 to consider several things we should 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.369
 consider first that we should not leave 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.730
 to a career in aid the first thing that 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.940
 we must do is eat things that 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.010
 can be absorbed quickly and that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.480
 do not generate any type of flatulence 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.700
 problems that prevent our 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.980
 performance be better in the race thing 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.110
 that are absorbed quickly are those 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.820
 that have neither fiber nor are they food 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.800
 products of your slow neither have big 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.690
 amounts of protein or fat per 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.170
 example a typical breakfast could be 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.000
 a slice of white bread with jam 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.940
 and a little bit of ricotta or cream cheese 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.949
 light and maybe a fruit that between 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.680
 half an hour 45 minutes before the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.860
 race then do not drink a lot of fluid 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.360
 during that time but wait 15 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.770
 minutes before the race to 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.090
 take us at least 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.979
 because the metabolism of water lasts 2 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.659
 hours if we drink a lot of water 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.009
 that we get up will surely make us 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.810
 really want to urinate during the 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.149
 career then the ideal is to avoid 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.710
 drink a lot of fluid and wait until 15 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.590
 minutes before the race to do it 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.500
 and then you take those 15 is 500 cc 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.420
 before the race 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.070
 you can wait more or less 20 minutes 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.620
 because the average liquid loss 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.930
 is for women between 800 and 1200 66 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.729
 for men between 1000 and 2000 it is 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.830
 to avoid from not avoiding any 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.720
 point and take your two little ones and never 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.979
 to get to feel important is that 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.510
 when you feel that now is 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.800
 dehydrated he probably is not going to 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.660
 give time the rest of the race to 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.100
 recover what we have already recovered if 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.960
 they want some additional information 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.600
