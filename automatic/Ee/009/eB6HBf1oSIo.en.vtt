00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 receive a cordial greeting I am henry 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.540
 montoya we are in the football channel and 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.670
 psychology in this video I want 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.920
 share with you something about the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.070
 ball grip technique of this 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.740
 moment we are going to work what is the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.439
 ball that comes in front of the ball that 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.880
 goes up and a ball that we throw 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.759
 in profile on both sides 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.099
 today we are going to start here with the ball that 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.940
 what is going on 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.550
 to do is that the archer 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.370
 receives that ball the thumbs are a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.860
 little by little the other fingers are 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.590
 around the ball the side part that 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.000
 we use with this grip the ball according to the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:49.110
 power that brings it not to 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.570
 happen to us in no time that we know 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.650
 that the ball is quietly in 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.950
 the hands that we have possibility 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.630
 will play you again 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.350
 this other ball the ball that 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:07.170
 we usually go up 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.909
 we look at that grip technique no 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.369
 moment will vary is the same value 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.710
 that I take from the front is the same 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.140
 technique to go to that ball that goes towards 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.380
 up is to pick up a center 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.460
 usually this technique is not going 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.460
 to vary the thumbs nearby 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.729
 of more fingers of the hands around 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:35.770
 the ball if we do it already in a 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:38.080
 movement of the ball on the side both 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.320
 profiles we're also going to look at that the 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.320
 grip 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.400
 the grip technique is still the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.530
 same here what will vary 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.630
 it's simply that the side of the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.630
 archer is going to launch but let's look at that 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.060
 the thumbs are still not so not 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.850
 together but they are still close 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.430
 and the ball this what you are looking for is a very 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.440
 good grip if at some point the ball 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.659
 will take a lot of power the ball will arrive 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.250
 to create the rebound would be the one that would create 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.689
 we look for the rebound to be towards 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.000
 sides and that the one that does not have 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.680
 possibility of reacting again this 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.580
 we give another one to the other side the sun 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.810
 remember that it will always be the same 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.810
 grip technique 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.410
 very good thumbs nearby that's good 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.200
 friends was what I wanted to share with 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.600

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.580
 ball grip who have not done
