impact tools or air tools when putting

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.819 
impact tools or air tools when putting
them<00:01:38.460> back<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:39.079> so<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.320> no<00:01:40.500> risk<00:01:40.710> of

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
them back on so you have no risk of

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.030 
them back on so you have no risk of
cross<00:01:41.159> threading<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.680> then<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:43.860> pretty

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
cross threading and then it's pretty

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.069 
cross threading and then it's pretty
much<00:01:44.159> reverse<00:01:44.729> from<00:01:44.970> there<00:01:45.210> get<00:01:45.750> these<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.020> do

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
much reverse from there get these to do

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.080 
much reverse from there get these to do

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.550 
ratchet first I tighten it grabbing it
by<00:01:55.409> here<00:01:55.920> then<00:01:56.670> from<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> back<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:58.409> that

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
by here then from the back and that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.569 
by here then from the back and that
should<00:01:58.799> hopefully<00:01:58.950> keep<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.340> from<00:01:59.430> putting

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
should hopefully keep you from putting

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.200 
should hopefully keep you from putting
too<00:01:59.850> much<00:01:59.969> torque<00:02:00.329> on<00:02:00.540> these<00:02:01.340> there's<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.430> back

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
too much torque on these there's a back

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.359 
too much torque on these there's a back
I<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.750> will<00:02:04.350> probably<00:02:04.799> put<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.100> up<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
I I will probably put it up in the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.870 
I I will probably put it up in the
description<00:02:06.000> later<00:02:06.149> by<00:02:06.509> a

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
description later by a

description later by a
in<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.060> torque<00:02:08.750> specs<00:02:09.140> but<00:02:10.130> it's<00:02:10.280> pretty

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
in the torque specs but it's pretty

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.880 
in the torque specs but it's pretty
straightforward<00:02:10.819> it's<00:02:11.390> not<00:02:11.599> that<00:02:11.870> bad<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.470> I

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
straightforward it's not that bad and I

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.170 
straightforward it's not that bad and I
just<00:02:13.220> want<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.459> show<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.730> what<00:02:13.849> it<00:02:13.940> looked

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
just want to show you what it looked

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.470 
just want to show you what it looked
like<00:02:14.270> inside<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.470> car<00:02:15.739> just<00:02:16.730> nothing<00:02:17.150> special

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
like inside the car just nothing special

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.770 
like inside the car just nothing special
really<00:02:17.950> but<00:02:18.950> yes<00:02:19.220> this<00:02:19.819> will<00:02:20.090> fit<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.450> non

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
really but yes this will fit the non

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.690 
really but yes this will fit the non
super<00:02:21.260> scored<00:02:21.590> as<00:02:21.709> well<00:02:21.950> as<00:02:22.160> they<00:02:22.310> both<00:02:22.459> use

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
super scored as well as they both use

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.089 
super scored as well as they both use
the<00:02:22.730> same<00:02:22.849> mount<00:02:23.330> well<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.349> can't<00:02:24.739> wait<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:24.890> put

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
the same mount well I can't wait to put

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.459 
the same mount well I can't wait to put
the<00:02:25.190> stack<00:02:25.430> together<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:27.040> see<00:02:28.040> how<00:02:28.160> it<00:02:28.280> works
