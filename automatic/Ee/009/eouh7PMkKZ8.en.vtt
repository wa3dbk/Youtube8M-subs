00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.519
 the bresse potatoes that you can 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.280
 cut into lots of cuts they give 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.830
 do not give way to make various recipes for 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.020
 example for new deck potatoes 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.510
 you start by doing a 2x2 session 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.510
 for a length of about 7 centimeters 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:26.699
 you go to square the potatoes in this 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.300
 so then here I put the waste 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.300
 I put on my side 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.010
 I put it on another side I'm right 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.600
 going to square up and put it on a 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.340
 yet another side I have removed all the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.010
 faults now I go to give the length 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.840
 with potatoes and we make about seven 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.969
 centimeters so now let's go to 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.879
 cut two by two sticks into 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:55.500
 this way it is so then then 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.690
 this is the new pontenuu come 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.910
 then serve on the plate entwined 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.280
 this way then from another potato 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.739
 let's make the cut more classic instead 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.960
 most known in the world fried potatoes o 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.729
 French potatoes you always go to 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.590
 square when you want to do a 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.080
 produced well at home for example often 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.540
 do you cut the potatoes in this way 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.580
 and then you start from here to get the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.409
 shape of the fried potatoes having some 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.509
 tips that then burn because these 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.700
 tips here go to burn having gods 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.860
 of the points that remain raw and of the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.810
 points that remain too cooked then 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.140
 these if we want to make potatoes made 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.299
 waste must not be eliminated 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.009
 they are expensive the potatoes can be made 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.509
 no these wastes I'm not telling you about 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.130
 parry what I know 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.590
 the artichokes or vegetables that cost 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.540
 the more expensive a thing is the waste 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.860
 however they do not throw themselves away from those signs 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.110
 you can make excellent mashed potatoes 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.960
 duchess or other potatoes 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.130
 preparations always based on potatoes 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.070
 where we need mashed potatoes 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:59.159
 now I'm going to cut the fruit a 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:02.610
 centimeter by one centimeter and this e 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:20.129
 let's go to soak in the water 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:21.750
 they too know fried potatoes 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.330
 you have eaten it but maybe not 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.879
 you knew the size no one by one 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.560
 look at them here, able to peek 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.510
 these levers are the various fried potatoes 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.700
 Now let's make the sticky potatoes 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.069
 I go away one by one because I am 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.640
 so many you are behind me francesco 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.819
 micheli some more potatoes please 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.400
 stick potatoes are made half 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:54.420
 centimeter by half a centimeter then 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:57.019
 in this way always height 7 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.019
 about centimeters 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.800
 therefore they will be finer potatoes 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.530
 compared to frits they will therefore remain 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.360
 with a different crunchiness because 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.739
 sure that they will become more crunchy 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.180
 from inside to outside 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.800
 unlike fried potatoes 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.750
 French instead of being larger 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.970
 naturally they remain softer 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.620
 inside the potatoes straw instead 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.510
 you must always do them with a mandolin 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.129
 you have a mandolin here 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:26.360
 that we are going to choose the thickness e 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.360
 let's go do the washers 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:39.820
 and from these washers you get a real e 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.440
 own size so thin thin 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.810
 parades that also fascinating because if 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.550
 you introduce yourself to your guests with 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.220
 potatoes made with serious cuts 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.350
 professional and very precise made 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.320
 certainly another figure from chefs 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.680
 here is where the straw potatoes then exist 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.680
 potatoes instead those that are called 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.540
 anna potatoes the cut is potatoes year a 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.580
 pattada veronese more or less than the 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.580
 half a centimeter thick 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.710
 also here 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.070
 maybe the first patrols we go to 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.990
 remove that are the most subtle ones 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.980
 that smaller then then do not cook 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.760
 on a regular basis 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.799
 ok so from here we can get the 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.840
 Our half- inch of potatoes a 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.160
 washers and are called to potatoes 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.750
 leonesi or patate anna ok and the first 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.370
 look at washers cut that beautiful 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.450
 just do good to see you all yes 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.780
 cuts it slips so it is 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.270
 second round cut the potato 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.180
 chips this is the know no 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.650
 partnerships are subtle thin ones 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.060
 those of the packet so to speak 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.700
 which are then fried become good 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.000
 crunchy and then mandolina in hand e 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.500
 we make thin thin rounds 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.610
 and then maybe I'll do it later 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.610
 fries predicting how to do it 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:03.940
 you see about a millimeter thick 12 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:11.090
 mm maximum and this is the potato chips 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:12.710
 and now we have the checkered ones 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.000
 first squares does nothing if not me 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.530
 in the meantime, stay behind as many as you can 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.370
 I'll show you everything while you are there 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:22.280
 you are exercising and then later you have to 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.800
 pass them again after the first potato e 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.410
 squares are the maxim potatoes that are 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.270
 looking for 3 cm x 3 cm then gods 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.190
 nice big cubes and this is the 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.620
 classic and baked potatoes 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.450
 to be clear, however, that often is 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.100
 gladly they do not see themselves so squared 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.100
 so we have a nice uniform cooking 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.440
 but all the pointed cuts are visible 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.930
 edge and what I said before some 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.550
 they burn and others remain 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:50.889
 raw then you know everyone is digging it 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:54.430
 this tool here with which they are derived 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:56.470
 two types of potatoes, about 2 cm 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.360
 expect the potatoes at Parisian is 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.539
 the one centimeter around yes 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.759
 they stick the potatoes royale then the 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:06.490
 Paris ball is taken out of this 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:07.750
 way is how to use the digger to plant 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.150
 just the ball the ball 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.610
 inside it is rotated in from will 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.080
 as round as possible and waste of 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.000
 new of these potatoes are those 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.889
 they are then used for mashed potatoes 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.330
 potatoes or other potato preparations 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:19.930
 duchess that we will then do in another 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.060
 bet 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:30.160
 ok and these are the Parisian potatoes 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:32.020
 the last the royal potato which is one 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.330
 very small ball then 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.180
 about an inch and a half 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.220
 one centimeter and a half the last hour dina 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.229
 what was missing was the natural one 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.240
 pom natura in French are called 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:50.070
 you take the words with the knife yes 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:57.669
 makes this movement creates a two three 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:07:03.310
 four five and the last 6 creating a 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:06.130
 real potato egg so in 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.870
 this way they will all be the same 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.380
 dimension because this other that I go to 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.840
 to sleep 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.250
 you always return to six faces but 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.259
 always of this final dimension 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.030
 when I go to make them stay it will be all of them 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:18.460
 the boiled potatoes I present to mine 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.530
 host potatoes so read with oil and 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.250
 fine chopped parsley are of the 

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.250
 ladies potatoes
