00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800 

um<00:00:01.760> what<00:00:02.760> I'm<00:00:02.879> going<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.270> demonstrate<00:00:03.449> today

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
um what I'm going to demonstrate today

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.980 
um what I'm going to demonstrate today
is<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.350> harmonic<00:00:04.859> roll<00:00:05.250> which<00:00:05.790> is<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.000> device

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
is the harmonic roll which is a device

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.379 
is the harmonic roll which is a device
that<00:00:07.020> I<00:00:07.350> sort<00:00:07.710> of<00:00:07.799> discovered<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.550> there<00:00:09.300> have

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
that I sort of discovered and there have

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.820 
that I sort of discovered and there have
been<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.510> lot<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.809> questions<00:00:10.200> about<00:00:10.320> this<00:00:10.650> I

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
been a lot of questions about this I

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.200 
been a lot of questions about this I
guess<00:00:10.950> people<00:00:11.219> were<00:00:11.370> wondering<00:00:11.700> how<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.880> do<00:00:12.059> it

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
guess people were wondering how to do it

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.999 
guess people were wondering how to do it
what<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.509> sounds<00:00:12.870> like

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
what it sounds like

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.220 
what it sounds like
I've<00:00:14.340> tried<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.700> describe<00:00:14.880> it<00:00:15.240> on<00:00:15.360> some<00:00:15.599> lists

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
I've tried to describe it on some lists

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.529 
I've tried to describe it on some lists
and<00:00:16.440> haven't<00:00:17.250> been<00:00:17.310> entirely<00:00:17.760> successful<00:00:18.060> at

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
and haven't been entirely successful at

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.519 
and haven't been entirely successful at
it

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
it

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.990 
it
so<00:00:19.920> first<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.310> all<00:00:20.400> I'll<00:00:20.520> just<00:00:20.550> point<00:00:20.760> out<00:00:20.880> this

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
so first of all I'll just point out this

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.550 
so first of all I'll just point out this
is<00:00:21.060> going<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.330> be<00:00:21.420> pretty<00:00:21.600> boring<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.350> think

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
is going to be pretty boring I think

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.109 
is going to be pretty boring I think
because<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.920> really<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.250> an<00:00:23.400> exercise<00:00:23.820> it's

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
because it really is an exercise it's

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.400 
because it really is an exercise it's
not<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> piece<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.720> music<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:26.539> actually<00:00:27.539> devised

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
not a piece of music I actually devised

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.609 
not a piece of music I actually devised
this<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.920> response<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:30.260> listening<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.380> John

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
this in response to listening to John

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.920 
this in response to listening to John
Coltrane<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.399> an<00:00:32.520> effect<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.969> he<00:00:33.390> uses<00:00:33.600> in

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
Coltrane it's an effect that he uses in

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.750 
Coltrane it's an effect that he uses in
his<00:00:33.960> playing<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.950> was<00:00:35.070> trying<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.340> mimic<00:00:35.520> it

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
his playing and I was trying to mimic it

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.760 
his playing and I was trying to mimic it
on<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.149> flute<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.230> course<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.559> doing

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
on the flute and in the course of doing

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.100 
on the flute and in the course of doing
so<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.309> actually<00:00:38.670> found<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.809> was

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
so I actually found that it was

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.220 
so I actually found that it was
improving<00:00:40.860> my<00:00:40.980> sound<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.730> strange<00:00:42.030> way<00:00:42.300> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
improving my sound in a strange way and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.410 
improving my sound in a strange way and
it<00:00:43.649> eventually<00:00:44.100> evolved<00:00:44.670> into<00:00:44.850> an<00:00:44.940> exercise

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
it eventually evolved into an exercise

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.380 
it eventually evolved into an exercise
that<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.989> now<00:00:46.200> do<00:00:46.890> periodically<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.090> what<00:00:48.239> I'll

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
that I now do periodically and what I'll

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.950 
that I now do periodically and what I'll
do<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:49.489> it<00:00:50.489> only<00:00:50.610> works<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.300> certain<00:00:51.629> range

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
do is it only works on a certain range

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.250 
do is it only works on a certain range
of<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> instrument<00:00:53.000> namely<00:00:54.000> from<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
of the instrument namely from a in the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.799 
of the instrument namely from a in the
second<00:00:55.620> octave<00:00:57.350> -<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.649> think<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.070> G<00:00:59.359> minor<00:01:00.359> 7th

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
second octave - I think it's G minor 7th

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.830 
second octave - I think it's G minor 7th
up<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> third<00:01:01.710> minister<00:01:02.510> so<00:01:03.510> I'm<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
up in the third minister so I'm going to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.789 
up in the third minister so I'm going to
show<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.470> each<00:01:04.860> degree<00:01:05.630> I'm<00:01:06.630> gonna<00:01:06.869> do<00:01:07.680> it

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
show you on each degree I'm gonna do it

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.380 
show you on each degree I'm gonna do it
much<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.220> would<00:01:08.369> practice<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.060> happen<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
much as I would practice it I happen to

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.660 
much as I would practice it I happen to
practice<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.049> at<00:01:10.580> 92<00:01:11.580> -<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> triplet<00:01:13.340> acted<00:01:14.340> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
practice it at 92 - the triplet acted to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.429 
practice it at 92 - the triplet acted to
trip<00:01:15.000> us<00:01:15.150> actually<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.869> sing<00:01:16.020> listen<00:01:16.140> you'll

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
trip us actually to sing listen you'll

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.830 
trip us actually to sing listen you'll
see<00:01:16.590> you'll<00:01:16.799> hear<00:01:18.500> and<00:01:20.180> this<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.299> much<00:01:21.420> faster

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
see you'll hear and this is much faster

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.080 
see you'll hear and this is much faster
than<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.290> should<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:23.400> fact<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:23.970> I

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
than you should do it in fact if I

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.749 
than you should do it in fact if I
performing<00:01:24.540> I'll<00:01:24.840> perform<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.229> very<00:01:25.530> fast<00:01:25.830> for

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
performing I'll perform it very fast for

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.399 
performing I'll perform it very fast for
you<00:01:26.880> you'll<00:01:27.090> want<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.330> take<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.900> very<00:01:28.080> slowly

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
you you'll want to take it very slowly

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.560 
you you'll want to take it very slowly
to<00:01:28.680> learn<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> fingerings<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.000> get<00:01:30.479> it

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
to learn in the fingerings and get it

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.450 
to learn in the fingerings and get it
reasonably<00:01:30.960> even<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:31.619> eventually<00:01:31.860> it'll

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
reasonably even but eventually it'll

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.530 
reasonably even but eventually it'll
sound<00:01:32.640> something<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:33.150> this

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
sound something like this

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.330 
sound something like this
so<00:01:33.960> I'll<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.170> advise<00:01:34.680> -<00:01:34.829> I'll<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.220> this

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
so I'll just advise - I'll just on this

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.249 
so I'll just advise - I'll just on this
maybe<00:01:35.579> with<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.909> metronome<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.689> with<00:01:36.840> that

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
maybe with the metronome and with that

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:49.250 
maybe with the metronome and with that
so<00:01:37.650> we'll<00:01:38.009> start<00:01:38.250> Kendall

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.330 

not<00:01:50.260> bad<00:01:50.470> very<00:01:50.980> bad<00:01:51.040> p.m.<00:01:51.490> there<00:01:53.010> as<00:01:54.010> you<00:01:54.190> can

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
not bad very bad p.m. there as you can

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.910 
not bad very bad p.m. there as you can
hear<00:01:54.520> some<00:01:54.730> of<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:54.880> fingerings<00:01:55.270> are<00:01:55.390> false

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
hear some of the fingerings are false

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.680 
hear some of the fingerings are false
but<00:01:56.920> that's<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.250> first<00:01:57.490> note<00:01:57.730> that's<00:01:58.150> a<00:01:58.450> now

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
but that's the first note that's a now

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:11.040 
but that's the first note that's a now
we'll<00:01:58.840> do<00:01:58.930> b-flat<00:02:09.210> I'll<00:02:10.210> take<00:02:10.390> them<00:02:10.509> short

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
we'll do b-flat I'll take them short

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:22.530 
we'll do b-flat I'll take them short
that's<00:02:11.290> b-flat<00:02:11.770> known<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.250> be<00:02:20.190> not<00:02:21.190> very<00:02:21.220> good

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
that's b-flat known to be not very good

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.240

to each other as possible and if the
pitcher<00:02:32.050> is<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.260> little<00:02:32.470> walking<00:02:32.800> don't<00:02:32.920> worry

pitcher is a little walking don't worry
about<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.459> that's<00:02:33.610> not<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.790> point<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.090> the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
about it that's not the point of the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:03:14.009 
about it that's not the point of the
exercise<00:02:34.240> here<00:02:35.170> we<00:02:35.260> go<00:02:35.350> again<00:02:35.410> with<00:03:12.870> B's<00:03:13.870> in

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
exercise here we go again with B's in

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:14.820 
exercise here we go again with B's in
there<00:03:14.170> that's<00:03:14.320> what<00:03:14.440> we're<00:03:14.530> trying<00:03:14.739> to

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
there that's what we're trying to

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.100 
there that's what we're trying to
eliminate<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:15.880> might<00:03:16.300> not<00:03:16.450> get<00:03:16.600> it<00:03:16.690> perfect<00:03:17.049> and

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
eliminate I might not get it perfect and

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.750 
eliminate I might not get it perfect and
all<00:03:17.230> day<00:03:17.350> long<00:03:17.380> but<00:03:17.739> I'll<00:03:18.100> try<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.310> see<00:03:18.489> Europe

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
all day long but I'll try to see Europe

00:03:18.760 --> 00:04:45.650 
all day long but I'll try to see Europe
again

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:05:03.260 

I<00:05:00.650> think<00:05:01.650> I'll<00:05:01.770> just<00:05:01.920> start<00:05:02.520> with<00:05:02.610> that<00:05:02.760> so

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
I think I'll just start with that so

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.030 
I think I'll just start with that so
basically<00:05:04.020> what<00:05:04.290> the<00:05:04.380> idea<00:05:04.410> of<00:05:04.800> what<00:05:04.980> it

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
basically what the idea of what it

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.840 
basically what the idea of what it
sounds<00:05:05.250> like

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
sounds like

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.030 
sounds like
recognizes<00:05:06.690> known<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:06.900> piece<00:05:07.140> of<00:05:07.290> music<00:05:07.380> it's

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
recognizes known a piece of music it's

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.880 
recognizes known a piece of music it's
an<00:05:08.160> exercise<00:05:08.840> and<00:05:09.840> it's<00:05:10.020> based<00:05:10.290> on<00:05:10.470> an<00:05:10.590> effect

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
an exercise and it's based on an effect

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:20.390 
an exercise and it's based on an effect
that<00:05:12.950> Coltrane<00:05:13.950> has<00:05:18.890> based<00:05:19.890> on<00:05:20.040> the<00:05:20.130> culture

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
that Coltrane has based on the culture

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.590 
that Coltrane has based on the culture
and<00:05:20.460> exercise<00:05:20.910> so<00:05:21.060> I<00:05:21.120> encourage<00:05:21.420> you<00:05:21.570> to

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
and exercise so I encourage you to

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.960 
and exercise so I encourage you to
practice<00:05:22.020> it<00:05:22.380> at<00:05:22.590> a<00:05:22.680> slow<00:05:22.980> tempo<00:05:23.010> just<00:05:23.730> to<00:05:23.820> get

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
practice it at a slow tempo just to get

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.760 
practice it at a slow tempo just to get
the<00:05:24.060> fingerings<00:05:24.450> under<00:05:24.720> control<00:05:25.110> with<00:05:25.740> a

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
the fingerings under control with a

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:26.480 
the fingerings under control with a
metronome

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
metronome

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.740 
metronome
don't<00:05:26.940> worry<00:05:27.120> about<00:05:27.330> it<00:05:27.420> if<00:05:27.510> it's<00:05:27.630> not

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
don't worry about it if it's not

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.390 
don't worry about it if it's not
absolutely<00:05:28.440> even<00:05:28.950> because<00:05:29.190> all<00:05:29.310> these

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
absolutely even because all these

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.010 
absolutely even because all these
fingers<00:05:29.790> are<00:05:30.000> Fork<00:05:30.300> anyway<00:05:30.660> and<00:05:30.810> it's<00:05:30.930> an

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
fingers are Fork anyway and it's an

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.540 
fingers are Fork anyway and it's an
effect<00:05:31.350> it's<00:05:31.530> not<00:05:31.590> designed<00:05:32.100> to<00:05:32.160> be<00:05:32.250> a<00:05:32.340> perfect

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
effect it's not designed to be a perfect

effect it's not designed to be a perfect
piece<00:05:32.910> of<00:05:32.940> music<00:05:34.100> I'm<00:05:35.100> not<00:05:35.340> sure<00:05:35.580> why<00:05:35.760> this

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
piece of music I'm not sure why this

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.550 
piece of music I'm not sure why this
works<00:05:36.420> an<00:05:36.810> embouchure<00:05:37.530> wise<00:05:37.860> I<00:05:38.100> think<00:05:38.370> the

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
works an embouchure wise I think the

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.750 
works an embouchure wise I think the
effort<00:05:40.560> involved<00:05:40.710> in<00:05:41.130> trying<00:05:41.340> to<00:05:41.430> get<00:05:41.610> those

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
effort involved in trying to get those

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.070 
effort involved in trying to get those
notes<00:05:42.060> close<00:05:42.480> together<00:05:42.870> as<00:05:43.080> possible

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
notes close together as possible

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.240 
notes close together as possible
encourages<00:05:46.080> you<00:05:46.230> to<00:05:46.260> focus<00:05:46.590> your<00:05:46.800> embouchure

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
encourages you to focus your embouchure

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.390 
encourages you to focus your embouchure
in<00:05:47.730> a<00:05:47.850> strange<00:05:48.180> way<00:05:48.450> and<00:05:49.010> and<00:05:50.010> it<00:05:50.160> kind<00:05:50.370> of

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
in a strange way and and it kind of

00:05:50.400 --> 00:06:14.500 
in a strange way and and it kind of
stabilizes<00:05:51.150> the<00:05:51.270> sound

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.070 

now<00:06:15.510> that's<00:06:15.690> a<00:06:15.750> lot<00:06:15.900> of<00:06:15.930> nonsense<00:06:16.170> but<00:06:17.810> at<00:06:18.810> some

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
now that's a lot of nonsense but at some

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.450 
now that's a lot of nonsense but at some
point<00:06:19.110> hopefully<00:06:19.650> it<00:06:19.980> will<00:06:20.040> help<00:06:20.190> you<00:06:20.310> do

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
point hopefully it will help you do

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.810 
point hopefully it will help you do
something<00:06:20.910> like<00:06:20.940> that<00:06:21.090> and<00:06:22.490> perhaps<00:06:23.490> in<00:06:23.760> a

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
something like that and perhaps in a

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.480 
something like that and perhaps in a
more<00:06:24.000> musical<00:06:24.150> way<00:06:24.540> and<00:06:25.200> by<00:06:26.190> the<00:06:26.220> way<00:06:26.370> I'm

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
more musical way and by the way I'm

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.770 
more musical way and by the way I'm
something<00:06:26.700> of<00:06:26.850> a<00:06:26.940> disciple<00:06:27.300> of<00:06:27.360> Hubert<00:06:27.660> laws

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
something of a disciple of Hubert laws

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.690 
something of a disciple of Hubert laws
and<00:06:28.110> I<00:06:28.830> have<00:06:29.130> heard<00:06:29.340> them<00:06:29.460> do<00:06:29.580> that<00:06:29.730> so<00:06:31.580> I'm<00:06:32.580> not

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:32.700 
and I have heard them do that so I'm not

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.190 
and I have heard them do that so I'm not
alone<00:06:32.910> I<00:06:33.120> like<00:06:33.270> to<00:06:33.360> think<00:06:33.540> I'm<00:06:33.630> a<00:06:33.720> good<00:06:33.870> company

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200 
alone I like to think I'm a good company

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.660 
alone I like to think I'm a good company
and<00:06:34.500> that's<00:06:35.070> it<00:06:35.190> for<00:06:35.310> now

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.670 
and that's it for now

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.210 
and that's it for now
that's<00:06:36.060> a<00:06:36.150> harmonic<00:06:36.540> roll<00:06:36.860> it's<00:06:37.860> a<00:06:37.950> back<00:06:38.100> to

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
that's a harmonic roll it's a back to

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.640 
that's a harmonic roll it's a back to
practicing
