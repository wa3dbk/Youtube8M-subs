00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
born around 1993 1994 I think a majority

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.859 
born around 1993 1994 I think a majority
of<00:00:28.650> us<00:00:28.859> didn't<00:00:29.369> start<00:00:29.670> really<00:00:29.910> going<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.599> there

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
of us didn't start really going on there

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.630 
of us didn't start really going on there
until<00:00:31.349> 1995

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
until 1995

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.330

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
giving her spoilers on TV wasn't really

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.490 
giving her spoilers on TV wasn't really
been<00:05:42.210> a<00:05:42.240> big<00:05:42.450> fuckin<00:05:42.870> deal<00:05:42.900> with<00:05:43.200> a<00:05:43.260> bit<00:05:43.380> like

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
been a big fuckin deal with a bit like

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.260 
been a big fuckin deal with a bit like
yeah<00:05:43.680> we<00:05:43.860> knew<00:05:43.979> that<00:05:44.010> already<00:05:44.280> you<00:05:45.000> know<00:05:45.090> there

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
yeah we knew that already you know there

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.290 
yeah we knew that already you know there
we've<00:05:45.390> been<00:05:45.540> a<00:05:45.570> lot<00:05:45.930> of<00:05:45.960> things<00:05:46.740> going<00:05:47.130> on<00:05:47.340> I

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
we've been a lot of things going on I

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.730 
we've been a lot of things going on I
think<00:05:48.960> it<00:05:49.020> would<00:05:49.140> have<00:05:49.229> been<00:05:49.260> a<00:05:49.350> lot<00:05:49.560> more

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
think it would have been a lot more

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.270 
think it would have been a lot more
difficult<00:05:50.250> to<00:05:50.460> get<00:05:50.669> away<00:05:50.880> with<00:05:51.060> stuff
