some people like a longer tail but when
I'm<00:00:57.300> doing<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.660> puppy<00:00:57.989> cut<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.800> tail

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
I'm doing a puppy cut I like the tail

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.060 
I'm doing a puppy cut I like the tail
not<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.489> look<00:00:59.670> shaggy<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:01.140> what<00:01:01.320> I'll<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.680> I

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
not to look shaggy so what I'll do is I

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.399 
not to look shaggy so what I'll do is I
will<00:01:02.100> pull<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.760> tail<00:01:02.969> up<00:01:03.270> I'll<00:01:04.019> brush<00:01:04.350> it

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
will pull the tail up I'll brush it

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.039 
will pull the tail up I'll brush it
straight<00:01:04.619> down<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.610> then<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.630> will<00:01:06.780> literally

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
straight down and then I will literally

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.210 
straight down and then I will literally
just<00:01:07.200> trim<00:01:07.680> off<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.189> very<00:01:08.430> tips<00:01:09.590> like<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.860> so

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
just trim off the very tips like that so

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.679 
just trim off the very tips like that so
it<00:01:11.310> gives<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.729> nice<00:01:12.080> fresh<00:01:13.159> okay<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.689> it's

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
it gives it a nice fresh okay and it's

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.980 
it gives it a nice fresh okay and it's
not<00:01:15.960> shortening<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> tail<00:01:17.070> too<00:01:17.369> much<00:01:17.990> but

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
not shortening the tail too much but

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.870 
not shortening the tail too much but
that<00:01:19.439> way<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.680> tail<00:01:19.979> doesn't<00:01:20.189> look<00:01:20.520> shaggy

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that way the tail doesn't look shaggy

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.770 
that way the tail doesn't look shaggy
and<00:01:22.220> you<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> same<00:01:23.939> thing<00:01:24.210> by<00:01:24.330> pulling<00:01:24.659> out

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
and you do the same thing by pulling out

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.969 
and you do the same thing by pulling out
on<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.110> sides<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.850> same<00:01:27.060> way<00:01:28.070> used

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
on the sides the same way used

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.300 
on the sides the same way used
the<00:01:30.159> under<00:01:30.640> part<00:01:30.820> is<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.149> guide<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:33.070> then<00:01:33.219> you

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
the under part is the guide and then you

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.270 
the under part is the guide and then you
did<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.579> same<00:01:33.759> thing<00:01:34.090> like<00:01:34.270> this<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.979> tail

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
did the same thing like this so the tail

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:46.789 
did the same thing like this so the tail
doesn't<00:01:36.759> have<00:01:37.030> any<00:01:37.299> of<00:01:37.329> these<00:01:37.450> long<00:01:37.810> stride

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.779 

wherever<00:01:47.799> you<00:01:48.039> see<00:01:48.369> long<00:01:49.979> hair<00:01:50.979> you<00:01:51.310> can<00:01:51.490> trim

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
wherever you see long hair you can trim

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.059 
wherever you see long hair you can trim
so<00:01:52.210> now<00:01:52.329> she<00:01:52.420> has<00:01:52.659> a<00:01:52.689> nice<00:01:53.069> healthy-looking

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
so now she has a nice healthy-looking

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.309 
so now she has a nice healthy-looking
tail<00:01:54.670> without<00:01:54.880> those<00:01:55.299> tips<00:01:55.750> that<00:01:56.020> were<00:01:56.170> going

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
tail without those tips that were going

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.160 
tail without those tips that were going
to<00:01:56.409> be<00:01:56.560> coming<00:01:56.799> off<00:01:57.069> anyway<00:01:57.659> with<00:01:58.659> brushing

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
to be coming off anyway with brushing

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.429 
to be coming off anyway with brushing
I'm<00:01:59.890> saving<00:02:00.399> a<00:02:00.429> lot<00:02:00.759> of<00:02:00.819> time<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:02.979> owner

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
I'm saving a lot of time for the owner

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.230 
I'm saving a lot of time for the owner
and<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:05.560> top<00:02:05.860> he<00:02:06.159> would<00:02:06.340> do<00:02:06.490> similar<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:07.090> her

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
and the top he would do similar to her

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.539 
and the top he would do similar to her
back<00:02:07.479> you<00:02:07.780> just<00:02:07.990> brushed<00:02:08.709> it<00:02:08.829> out<00:02:08.920> let's<00:02:09.369> get

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.860 

that's<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.790> tail<00:02:16.970> can<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.360> stand<00:02:17.600> closer

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870
