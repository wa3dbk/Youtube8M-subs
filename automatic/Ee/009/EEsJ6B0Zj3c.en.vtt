AP tanks from these distances it

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.800 
AP tanks from these distances it
normally<00:02:43.830> isn't<00:02:44.220> very<00:02:44.400> reliable<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.420> also<00:02:45.599> want

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
normally isn't very reliable I also want

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.210 
normally isn't very reliable I also want
to<00:02:45.840> point<00:02:45.959> out<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.230> normally<00:02:46.739> joo-won<00:02:47.160> I

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
to point out that normally joo-won I

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.160 
to point out that normally joo-won I
have<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.580> high<00:02:47.760> ground<00:02:47.790> as<00:02:48.269> a<00:02:48.390> tanker<00:02:48.989> and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
have the high ground as a tanker and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.250 
have the high ground as a tanker and
this<00:02:49.739> comes<00:02:50.400> back<00:02:50.549> to<00:02:50.610> being<00:02:51.599> able<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.870> rely<00:02:52.230> on

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
this comes back to being able to rely on

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.319 
this comes back to being able to rely on
the<00:02:52.470> Splash<00:02:52.799> Damage<00:02:52.849> should<00:02:53.849> you<00:02:53.970> miss<00:02:54.150> the
