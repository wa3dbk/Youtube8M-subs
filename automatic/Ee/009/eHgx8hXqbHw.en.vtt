this to charge my blackberry torch
wouldn't<00:00:50.070> work<00:00:50.250> output<00:00:50.910> wasn't<00:00:51.510> enough<00:00:51.719> even

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
wouldn't work output wasn't enough even

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.930 
wouldn't work output wasn't enough even
with<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> cables<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.920> came<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:56.730> it

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
with the cables that came with it and it

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.880 
with the cables that came with it and it
said<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> would<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:59.100> doesn't<00:00:59.520> work

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:15.540 

so<00:01:02.890> today<00:01:03.900> this<00:01:04.900> can<00:01:12.360> see<00:01:13.360> that<00:01:13.570> I<00:01:14.550> selected

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.370 
his review and I've seen it in action
and<00:01:28.979> if<00:01:29.979> that's<00:01:30.220> not<00:01:30.400> a<00:01:30.550> legitimate<00:01:31.210> test<00:01:31.990> what

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
and if that's not a legitimate test what

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.800 
and if that's not a legitimate test what
he's<00:01:32.590> done<00:01:32.920> using<00:01:33.550> this<00:01:33.940> then<00:01:34.390> I<00:01:34.509> don't<00:01:34.690> know

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
he's done using this then I don't know

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.710 
he's done using this then I don't know
what<00:01:34.960> else<00:01:35.140> is<00:01:35.410> so<00:01:35.680> I<00:01:36.310> based<00:01:36.700> my<00:01:36.940> selection<00:01:37.540> off

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
what else is so I based my selection off

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.290 
what else is so I based my selection off
of<00:01:37.990> someone<00:01:38.920> had<00:01:39.070> truly<00:01:39.369> tested<00:01:40.060> something

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
of someone had truly tested something

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.140 
of someone had truly tested something
out<00:01:41.259> on<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.710> road<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.220> who's<00:01:42.610> taking<00:01:43.000> this

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
out on the road and who's taking this

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.700 
out on the road and who's taking this
through<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:43.420> couple<00:01:43.630> of<00:01:43.810> countries<00:01:44.140> and

through a couple of countries and

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.219 
through a couple of countries and
powered<00:01:45.490> up<00:01:45.610> everything<00:01:46.119> he's<00:01:46.330> needed<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:47.050> do

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
powered up everything he's needed to do

to charge that battery but here's the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.780 
to charge that battery but here's the
kicker<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.440> came<00:02:41.680> with<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:41.920> cable<00:02:44.730> now<00:02:45.730> the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
kicker it came with a cable now the

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.940 
kicker it came with a cable now the
cable<00:02:46.270> that<00:02:46.390> came<00:02:46.690> with<00:02:46.930> this<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.470> said<00:02:47.830> it

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
cable that came with this and said it

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.130 
cable that came with this and said it
was<00:02:48.070> specifically<00:02:48.700> designed<00:02:49.240> for<00:02:49.450> blackberry

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
was specifically designed for blackberry

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.130 
was specifically designed for blackberry
still<00:02:50.800> would<00:02:50.950> not<00:02:50.980> charge<00:02:51.310> my<00:02:51.640> blackberry<00:02:52.240> but

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
still would not charge my blackberry but

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.780 
still would not charge my blackberry but
using<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.280> cord<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:55.690> came<00:02:55.960> with<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.790> ball

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
using the cord that came with the ball

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:09.860 
using the cord that came with the ball
tack<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.450> solar<00:02:58.930> panel<00:03:08.160> does<00:03:09.160> charge<00:03:09.550> my<00:03:09.820> phone

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
tack a solar panel does charge my phone

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.310 
tack a solar panel does charge my phone
and<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:11.020> just<00:03:11.260> charged<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:13.510> fully<00:03:13.840> charged

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
and I just charged it it fully charged

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.380 
and I just charged it it fully charged
it<00:03:14.560> in<00:03:15.570> 15<00:03:16.570> minutes<00:03:16.960> from<00:03:17.320> Mike<00:03:17.740> half<00:03:18.010> charge

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
it in 15 minutes from Mike half charge

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.630 
it in 15 minutes from Mike half charge
so<00:03:19.390> pretty<00:03:20.110> much<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.470> same<00:03:20.680> as<00:03:21.010> just<00:03:21.370> plugging

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
so pretty much the same as just plugging

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.550 
so pretty much the same as just plugging
it<00:03:21.880> into<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.270> wall<00:03:22.630> charger<00:03:22.660> that<00:03:23.260> came<00:03:23.500> with

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
it into the wall charger that came with

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.880 
it into the wall charger that came with
it

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
it

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.270 
it
and<00:03:24.490> I<00:03:24.910> still<00:03:25.240> have<00:03:27.090> three<00:03:28.090> full<00:03:28.710> blue<00:03:29.710> bars<00:03:29.980> on

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
and I still have three full blue bars on

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.360 
and I still have three full blue bars on
this<00:03:30.460> thing<00:03:31.410> 16,000<00:03:32.410> milliamps<00:03:32.890> you<00:03:33.040> do<00:03:33.250> the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
this thing 16,000 milliamps you do the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.220 
this thing 16,000 milliamps you do the
math<00:03:33.550> that's<00:03:33.850> a<00:03:33.970> lot<00:03:34.120> of<00:03:34.150> recharges<00:03:34.870> up<00:03:35.020> all

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
math that's a lot of recharges up all

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.460 
math that's a lot of recharges up all
for<00:03:35.410> this<00:03:35.500> little<00:03:35.710> thing<00:03:36.300> now<00:03:37.320> that<00:03:38.320> was

it out there you could see this little

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.790 
it out there you could see this little
red<00:05:15.599> light<00:05:15.840> on<00:05:16.020> top<00:05:16.289> I<00:05:16.440> don't<00:05:16.500> know<00:05:16.620> if<00:05:16.740> you

working this is the battery pack from
the<00:06:36.450> solar<00:06:36.900> panel<00:06:37.350> and<00:06:37.920> I<00:06:38.790> just<00:06:39.000> forgot<00:06:39.270> to

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
the solar panel and I just forgot to

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.000 
the solar panel and I just forgot to
mention<00:06:39.570> but<00:06:39.900> I'll<00:06:39.960> show<00:06:40.230> you<00:06:40.260> it's<00:06:40.560> charging

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
mention but I'll show you it's charging

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.250 
mention but I'll show you it's charging
up<00:06:41.100> now<00:06:41.280> off<00:06:41.790> USB<00:06:42.390> port<00:06:42.690> plugged<00:06:42.960> into<00:06:43.140> my

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
up now off USB port plugged into my

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.680 
up now off USB port plugged into my
computer<00:06:44.000> so<00:06:45.000> you<00:06:45.060> can<00:06:45.210> charge<00:06:45.420> this<00:06:45.630> battery

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
computer so you can charge this battery

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.040 
computer so you can charge this battery
pack<00:06:46.170> off<00:06:46.770> of<00:06:47.010> any<00:06:47.190> computer<00:06:47.640> as<00:06:48.090> well<00:06:48.780> as

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
pack off of any computer as well as

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.130 
pack off of any computer as well as
through<00:06:49.650> the<00:06:49.800> solar<00:06:50.040> panel<00:06:50.490> so<00:06:50.610> you<00:06:50.760> have<00:06:51.140> two

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:52.140 
through the solar panel so you have two

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.480 
through the solar panel so you have two
ways<00:06:52.320> to<00:06:52.560> charge<00:06:52.830> this<00:06:53.100> battery<00:06:53.160> and<00:06:55.490> from

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.490 
ways to charge this battery and from

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.310 
ways to charge this battery and from
what<00:06:56.670> I've<00:06:56.790> read<00:06:57.030> in<00:06:57.330> the<00:06:57.390> videos<00:06:57.690> I<00:06:57.900> watched

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.110 

this<00:07:01.320> will<00:07:01.530> charge<00:07:01.710> I<00:07:01.950> think<00:07:02.220> an<00:07:02.370> iPhone<00:07:02.850> maybe

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
this will charge I think an iPhone maybe

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.420 
this will charge I think an iPhone maybe
three<00:07:03.450> times<00:07:03.660> give<00:07:04.350> it<00:07:04.440> a<00:07:04.500> full<00:07:04.710> charge<00:07:04.980> off<00:07:05.250> of

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.430 
three times give it a full charge off of

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.430 
three times give it a full charge off of
this<00:07:06.470> so<00:07:07.470> there<00:07:07.980> you<00:07:08.100> have<00:07:08.160> it
