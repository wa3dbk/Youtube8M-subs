00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.710 

I'm<00:00:22.960> not<00:00:23.730> trying<00:00:24.730> to<00:00:24.880> represent<00:00:25.540> the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
I'm not trying to represent the

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.700 
I'm not trying to represent the
landscape<00:00:27.330> directly<00:00:28.330> or<00:00:28.480> literally<00:00:28.930> don't

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
landscape directly or literally don't

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.280 
landscape directly or literally don't
paint<00:00:30.490> the<00:00:30.730> shapes<00:00:31.060> of<00:00:31.300> the<00:00:31.420> hills<00:00:31.660> directly

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
paint the shapes of the hills directly

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.380 
paint the shapes of the hills directly
onto<00:00:32.410> my<00:00:32.529> ports<00:00:32.950> or<00:00:33.070> anything<00:00:33.370> like<00:00:33.670> that<00:00:33.730> it's

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
onto my ports or anything like that it's

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.990 
onto my ports or anything like that it's
almost<00:00:34.570> like<00:00:34.780> a<00:00:35.070> infusion<00:00:36.070> into<00:00:36.250> my<00:00:36.460> work<00:00:36.700> of

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
almost like a infusion into my work of

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.540 
almost like a infusion into my work of
my<00:00:37.500> relationship<00:00:38.500> with<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.830> landscape<00:00:39.370> in

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
my relationship with the landscape in

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.530 
my relationship with the landscape in
the<00:00:40.379> details<00:00:41.379> that<00:00:41.850> inspire<00:00:42.850> me<00:00:43.030> and<00:00:43.150> interest

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
the details that inspire me and interest

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.100 
the details that inspire me and interest
me<00:00:43.690> you<00:00:44.050> know<00:00:44.170> like<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.559> way<00:00:45.270> perhaps<00:00:46.270> a<00:00:46.750> rock

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
me you know like the way perhaps a rock

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.640 
me you know like the way perhaps a rock
has<00:00:47.379> been<00:00:47.410> formed<00:00:48.340> and<00:00:48.520> then<00:00:48.900> bolted<00:00:49.900> or<00:00:50.379> how<00:00:50.620> a

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
has been formed and then bolted or how a

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.360 
has been formed and then bolted or how a
path<00:00:51.300> winds<00:00:52.300> its<00:00:52.420> way<00:00:52.510> across<00:00:52.780> a<00:00:53.440> field<00:00:53.949> or<00:00:54.340> a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
path winds its way across a field or a

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.430 
path winds its way across a field or a
hillside<00:00:54.820> those<00:00:55.360> sort<00:00:55.629> of<00:00:55.690> elements<00:00:56.379> that

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
hillside those sort of elements that

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:08.430 
hillside those sort of elements that
somehow<00:00:57.159> find<00:00:57.970> their<00:00:58.210> way<00:00:58.360> into<00:00:58.540> my<00:00:58.720> work

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.950 

a<00:01:08.500> bar<00:01:09.370> I<00:01:09.430> these<00:01:09.580> are<00:01:09.730> black<00:01:09.940> sand<00:01:10.300> beach<00:01:10.600> and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
a bar I these are black sand beach and

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.140 
a bar I these are black sand beach and
all<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.380> rock<00:01:11.620> there<00:01:11.890> is<00:01:12.040> very<00:01:12.310> dark<00:01:12.670> it<00:01:12.970> used

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
all the rock there is very dark it used

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.590 
all the rock there is very dark it used
to<00:01:13.240> be<00:01:13.330> used<00:01:13.450> as<00:01:13.660> a<00:01:13.690> slate<00:01:14.050> mine<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:15.430> chose<00:01:16.330> a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
to be used as a slate mine and I chose a

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.130 
to be used as a slate mine and I chose a
variety<00:01:17.820> partly<00:01:18.820> because<00:01:19.080> supporting<00:01:20.080> the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
variety partly because supporting the

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.840 
variety partly because supporting the
beaches<00:01:20.500> I<00:01:20.650> spent<00:01:20.980> time<00:01:21.370> on<00:01:21.550> when<00:01:21.700> I<00:01:21.760> was

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
beaches I spent time on when I was

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.720 
beaches I spent time on when I was
little<00:01:22.150> but<00:01:22.300> also<00:01:22.510> because<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:23.800> had<00:01:24.040> slate<00:01:24.430> and

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
little but also because it had slate and

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.480 
little but also because it had slate and
I<00:01:24.790> knew<00:01:24.970> that<00:01:25.150> slate<00:01:25.510> worked<00:01:26.470> well<00:01:26.860> within<00:01:27.190> the

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
I knew that slate worked well within the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.900 
I knew that slate worked well within the
ceramic<00:01:28.500> process<00:01:29.500> at<00:01:30.040> low<00:01:30.280> tide<00:01:30.550> there's

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
ceramic process at low tide there's

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.110 
ceramic process at low tide there's
proper<00:01:31.600> black<00:01:31.870> sand<00:01:32.230> but<00:01:32.550> above<00:01:33.550> that<00:01:33.580> is<00:01:33.940> sort

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
proper black sand but above that is sort

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.720 
proper black sand but above that is sort
of<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.270> storm<00:01:34.570> beach<00:01:34.750> of<00:01:34.990> pebbles<00:01:35.320> and<00:01:35.890> where

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
of a storm beach of pebbles and where

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.970 
of a storm beach of pebbles and where
the<00:01:36.880> waves<00:01:37.090> have<00:01:37.420> moved<00:01:38.230> in<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:38.530> out<00:01:38.680> it's

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
the waves have moved in and out it's

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.530 
the waves have moved in and out it's
graded<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:40.260> stone<00:01:41.340> right<00:01:42.340> from<00:01:42.640> large

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
graded the stone right from large

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.210 
graded the stone right from large
pebbles<00:01:43.840> like<00:01:44.140> this<00:01:44.320> right<00:01:44.560> now<00:01:44.710> insisted<00:01:45.130> a

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
pebbles like this right now insisted a

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.850 
pebbles like this right now insisted a
very<00:01:45.730> fine<00:01:46.090> grained<00:01:46.450> it's<00:01:47.080> not<00:01:47.260> as<00:01:47.380> fine<00:01:47.650> as

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
very fine grained it's not as fine as

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.640 
very fine grained it's not as fine as
sand<00:01:48.160> but<00:01:48.580> it's<00:01:48.700> sort<00:01:48.970> of<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.150> grade<00:01:49.480> up<00:01:49.720> the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
sand but it's sort of a grade up the

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.680 
sand but it's sort of a grade up the
sand<00:01:50.950> is<00:01:51.130> almost<00:01:51.340> too<00:01:51.550> fine<00:01:51.850> for<00:01:51.880> works<00:01:52.420> which

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
sand is almost too fine for works which

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.370 
sand is almost too fine for works which
it's<00:01:53.020> just<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.560> little<00:01:54.520> bit<00:01:54.700> bigger<00:01:55.479> and<00:01:55.840> I<00:01:56.080> use

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
it's just a little bit bigger and I use

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.920 
it's just a little bit bigger and I use
that<00:01:56.620> I<00:01:56.650> put<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:57.070> in<00:01:57.220> search<00:01:57.610> into<00:01:58.450> my<00:01:58.600> clay

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
that I put that in search into my clay

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.710 
that I put that in search into my clay
when<00:01:59.440> it's<00:01:59.590> fired<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.280> stone<00:02:00.640> actually<00:02:00.880> melts

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
when it's fired the stone actually melts

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.840 
when it's fired the stone actually melts
and<00:02:02.310> boils<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:03.520> bubbles<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.270> creates

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
and boils and bubbles and creates

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:18.710 
and boils and bubbles and creates
texture<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.060> bleeds<00:02:07.390> within<00:02:07.870> the<00:02:08.050> glazes

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.600 

Albemarle<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.930> beach<00:02:20.350> of<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.250> coast<00:02:21.460> from

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
Albemarle is a beach of the coast from

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.790 
Albemarle is a beach of the coast from
here<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.870> was<00:02:23.050> quite<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.290> large<00:02:23.530> beach

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
here so it was quite a large beach

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.460 
here so it was quite a large beach
backed<00:02:24.280> by<00:02:24.550> pebbles<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.960> northern<00:02:26.320> end

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
backed by pebbles the northern end

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.800 
backed by pebbles the northern end
there's<00:02:26.740> a<00:02:26.800> clay<00:02:27.190> deposit<00:02:27.220> which<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:28.660> me

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
there's a clay deposit which to me

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.170 
there's a clay deposit which to me
almost<00:02:29.020> look<00:02:29.290> like<00:02:29.410> mud<00:02:29.740> stone<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.400> also<00:02:30.880> use<00:02:31.150> it

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
almost look like mud stone I also use it

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
almost look like mud stone I also use it
as<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.470> glaze<00:02:32.470> just<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:33.040> one<00:02:33.160> material<00:02:33.490> a<00:02:34.200> fire

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
as a glaze just the one material a fire

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.070 
as a glaze just the one material a fire
very<00:02:35.440> high<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.360> many<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.510> clays<00:02:37.750> that<00:02:37.780> I

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
very high so many of the clays that I

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.160 
very high so many of the clays that I
dig<00:02:38.320> up<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.880> molten<00:02:39.880> at<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.330> temperature<00:02:40.630> so

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
dig up a molten at that temperature so

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.320 
dig up a molten at that temperature so
what<00:02:41.740> I<00:02:41.770> do<00:02:41.890> is<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.340> use<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.730> lot<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.090> Claire's

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
what I do is I use a lot of the Claire's

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.820 
what I do is I use a lot of the Claire's
detail<00:02:43.960> within<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.380> work<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.830> find<00:02:45.580> that

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
detail within the work I find that

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.140 
detail within the work I find that
almost<00:02:47.830> better<00:02:48.160> in<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.460> way<00:02:48.610> because<00:02:48.940> it

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
almost better in a way because it

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.950 
almost better in a way because it
reflects<00:02:50.080> my<00:02:50.550> interest<00:02:51.550> in<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.970> subtleties

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
reflects my interest in the subtleties

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:10.150 
reflects my interest in the subtleties
and<00:02:53.170> details<00:02:53.770> in<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.040> landscape

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.940 

one<00:03:10.610> of<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:11.290> terminologies<00:03:12.290> in<00:03:12.470> geology<00:03:12.650> is

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
one of the terminologies in geology is

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.520 
one of the terminologies in geology is
massive<00:03:13.460> and<00:03:13.640> I've<00:03:13.820> been<00:03:14.180> like<00:03:14.360> that<00:03:14.630> in<00:03:15.320> order

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
massive and I've been like that in order

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.710 
massive and I've been like that in order
to<00:03:15.710> talk<00:03:16.430> about<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:16.820> landscape<00:03:17.300> you<00:03:17.480> got<00:03:17.630> to

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
to talk about the landscape you got to

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.960 
to talk about the landscape you got to
have<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.840> certain<00:03:18.230> amount<00:03:18.380> of<00:03:18.500> scale<00:03:18.970> small

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
have a certain amount of scale small

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.610 
have a certain amount of scale small
things<00:03:20.210> can<00:03:20.540> have<00:03:20.780> presence<00:03:21.290> but<00:03:21.440> there's

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
things can have presence but there's

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.410 
things can have presence but there's
definitely<00:03:21.740> more<00:03:22.310> presence<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.120> a<00:03:23.150> large

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
definitely more presence to a large

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:31.460 
definitely more presence to a large
object

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:04:14.500 

you

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.870 

throwing<00:04:15.510> or<00:04:15.780> repetition<00:04:16.470> throwing<00:04:17.070> is<00:04:17.220> quite

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
throwing or repetition throwing is quite

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.580 
throwing or repetition throwing is quite
a<00:04:17.910> quick<00:04:18.450> process<00:04:18.780> it's<00:04:19.139> almost<00:04:19.380> an

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
a quick process it's almost an

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.129 
a quick process it's almost an
industrial<00:04:20.070> process<00:04:20.250> at<00:04:20.820> a<00:04:20.880> relatively<00:04:21.810> small

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
industrial process at a relatively small

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.230 
industrial process at a relatively small
scale<00:04:22.530> you<00:04:22.950> can<00:04:23.100> produce<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.490> lot<00:04:23.639> of<00:04:23.669> work<00:04:23.940> in<00:04:24.150> a

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
scale you can produce a lot of work in a

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.270 
scale you can produce a lot of work in a
very<00:04:24.270> short<00:04:24.690> amount<00:04:24.900> of<00:04:25.169> time<00:04:25.230> one<00:04:26.100> of<00:04:26.190> the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
very short amount of time one of the

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.090 
very short amount of time one of the
things<00:04:26.520> I<00:04:26.730> like<00:04:27.720> about<00:04:27.750> throwing<00:04:28.380> large<00:04:28.710> scale

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
things I like about throwing large scale

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.890 
things I like about throwing large scale
is<00:04:29.280> that<00:04:29.490> that<00:04:29.669> is<00:04:29.850> completely<00:04:30.690> different

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
is that that is completely different

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.010 
is that that is completely different
because<00:04:31.320> it's<00:04:31.620> it's<00:04:32.280> a<00:04:32.520> slow<00:04:33.240> process<00:04:33.480> you

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
because it's it's a slow process you

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.750 
because it's it's a slow process you
have<00:04:34.139> to<00:04:34.260> be<00:04:34.350> centered<00:04:34.860> you<00:04:35.070> have<00:04:35.220> to<00:04:35.340> be<00:04:35.430> calm

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
have to be centered you have to be calm

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.620 
have to be centered you have to be calm
you<00:04:35.790> have<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.889> it's<00:04:37.889> not<00:04:38.010> about<00:04:38.340> strength<00:04:39.240> it's

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
you have to it's not about strength it's

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.490 
you have to it's not about strength it's
about<00:04:39.950> applying<00:04:40.950> yourself<00:04:41.460> in<00:04:41.610> a<00:04:42.500> considered

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
about applying yourself in a considered

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.150 
about applying yourself in a considered
way<00:04:43.710> and<00:04:43.980> working<00:04:44.910> with<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.360> material<00:04:45.900> to

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
way and working with the material to

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.580 
way and working with the material to
finish<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.370> piece<00:04:47.550> I<00:04:48.050> think<00:04:49.050> ultimately<00:04:49.230> I

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
finish the piece I think ultimately I

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.520 
finish the piece I think ultimately I
make<00:04:49.890> what<00:04:50.220> I<00:04:50.250> like<00:04:50.610> what<00:04:50.940> I<00:04:50.970> enjoy<00:04:51.900> making<00:04:52.110> and

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
make what I like what I enjoy making and

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.650 
make what I like what I enjoy making and
what<00:04:52.620> I<00:04:52.800> think<00:04:53.100> brings<00:04:53.400> aesthetic<00:04:54.090> value<00:04:54.510> to

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
what I think brings aesthetic value to

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.450 
what I think brings aesthetic value to
my<00:04:54.780> work<00:04:55.020> I<00:04:56.270> hope<00:04:57.270> that<00:04:57.780> by<00:04:58.500> working<00:04:58.919> in<00:04:59.250> that

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
my work I hope that by working in that

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.870 
my work I hope that by working in that
sort<00:04:59.790> of<00:04:59.930> natural<00:05:00.930> way<00:05:00.960> in<00:05:01.560> an<00:05:01.770> honest<00:05:02.760> way

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
sort of natural way in an honest way

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.640 
sort of natural way in an honest way
that<00:05:03.300> my<00:05:04.400> experience<00:05:05.400> of<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.700> landscape

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
that my experience of the landscape

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:35.690 
that my experience of the landscape
comes<00:05:07.650> through<00:05:08.040> in<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.250> work

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.760
