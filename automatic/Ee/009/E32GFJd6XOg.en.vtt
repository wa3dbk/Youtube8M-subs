00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.770
 to make a gradient in watercolor 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.770
 you have several solutions 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:14.940
 with a brush , get some of the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:21.840
 pure color that we extend in a thin 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:24.090
 strip of color on the paper then with 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.090
 a lot of water we are going to get up 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.060
 the color so as to degrade it 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.730
 naturally by being so great 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.410
 water surface that we read again 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.410
 gradually to pure color 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:44.040
 if you have large areas to 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.770
 paint favorite brushes to tipped 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.820
 square 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.820
 it will make your job easier 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.710
 so we see that the color chart 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:01.219
 gradually we help a little bit 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:04.199
 with the brush to realize to degrade 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.170
 try to gauge your water well 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.210
 so as not to put too much 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.189
 In any case, it will be possible to 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.210
 remove with a cloth or 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.210
 small towel 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:26.790
 with a brush admits square dish see 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.760
 that it is much easier to 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.680
 realize our degrade color 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.750
 spreads very easily more 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.910
 to always watch the tip of your 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.910
 brush and its moisture content 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.110
 in this way you will be able to remove the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.110
 color if there is too much 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.539
 or else and go in hand external
