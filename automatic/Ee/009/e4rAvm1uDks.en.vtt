crap so today I'm going to ring some
what<00:01:49.619> pledge<00:01:50.250> which<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.060> wood

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
what pledge which is just a wood

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.740 
what pledge which is just a wood
furniture<00:01:51.960> or<00:01:52.560> polisher<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.540> wood

furniture or polisher and this is wood
so<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.290> works<00:01:55.439> even<00:01:55.770> better<00:01:55.890> than<00:01:57.079> than<00:01:58.079> a

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
so it works even better than than a

don't know if you guys know that if you

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
how much the college student I don't

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.369 
how much the college student I don't
really<00:02:09.300> know<00:02:09.420> what<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:09.629> called<00:02:09.750> put<00:02:10.259> those

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
really know what it's called put those

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.430 
really know what it's called put those
things<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.709> take<00:02:10.890> shots<00:02:11.069> off<00:02:11.450> when<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.540> put

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
things to take shots off when you put

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.800 
things to take shots off when you put
would<00:02:13.770> polish<00:02:13.980> on<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.340> what<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.360> does<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.720> it

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
would polish on it what it does is it

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.540 
would polish on it what it does is it
makes<00:02:15.960> it<00:02:16.110> much<00:02:16.230> more<00:02:16.440> slippier<00:02:16.830> slippery

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
makes it much more slippier slippery

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.060 
makes it much more slippier slippery
here<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.570> makes<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:19.230> guess<00:02:19.650> easier<00:02:19.920> to

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
here so it makes it I guess easier to

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.550 
here so it makes it I guess easier to
shoot<00:02:20.250> not<00:02:20.610> easier<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:20.970> shoot<00:02:21.120> but<00:02:21.270> it<00:02:22.260> doesn't

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
shoot not easier to shoot but it doesn't

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.630 
shoot not easier to shoot but it doesn't
stick<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.860> board<00:02:23.040> as<00:02:23.190> much<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.490> puck
