of the box here you can have a closer
look<00:00:22.630> alright<00:00:23.630> so<00:00:23.870> I'll<00:00:24.020> just<00:00:24.200> zoom<00:00:24.410> in<00:00:24.680> here

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
look alright so I'll just zoom in here

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.730 
look alright so I'll just zoom in here
now<00:00:25.520> first<00:00:26.030> look<00:00:26.390> is<00:00:26.630> that<00:00:26.690> this<00:00:27.140> watch<00:00:27.410> is

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
now first look is that this watch is

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.070 
now first look is that this watch is
really<00:00:28.180> industrial<00:00:29.180> in<00:00:29.330> nature<00:00:29.690> it's<00:00:29.900> got

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
really industrial in nature it's got

really industrial in nature it's got
this<00:00:30.290> cool<00:00:31.029> rugged<00:00:32.029> finish<00:00:32.480> on<00:00:32.719> the<00:00:32.839> top<00:00:33.050> dial

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
this cool rugged finish on the top dial

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.549 
this cool rugged finish on the top dial
and<00:00:33.999> it<00:00:34.999> adds<00:00:35.149> a<00:00:35.269> nice<00:00:35.390> texture<00:00:35.929> to<00:00:36.199> the<00:00:36.320> feel

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
and it adds a nice texture to the feel

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.169 
and it adds a nice texture to the feel
of<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:36.890> watch<00:00:37.039> I'm<00:00:37.280> just<00:00:37.460> running<00:00:37.760> my<00:00:37.850> finger

00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:38.179 
of the watch I'm just running my finger

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:39.810 
of the watch I'm just running my finger
along<00:00:38.420> it<00:00:38.629> here<00:00:38.809> and<00:00:38.960> it<00:00:39.019> has<00:00:39.170> sort<00:00:39.440> of<00:00:39.499> a

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
along it here and it has sort of a

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.130 
along it here and it has sort of a
jagged-edged<00:00:40.820> feel<00:00:41.269> which<00:00:41.539> is<00:00:41.570> which<00:00:42.019> is

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
jagged-edged feel which is which is

now<00:00:55.839> here's<00:00:56.839> the<00:00:57.019> interesting<00:00:57.109> thing<00:00:57.649> take<00:00:57.859> a

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
now here's the interesting thing take a

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.549 
now here's the interesting thing take a
close<00:00:58.339> look<00:00:58.489> here<00:00:58.940> at<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.120> dial<00:00:59.389> it<00:01:00.109> looks

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
close look here at the dial it looks

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.060 
close look here at the dial it looks
like<00:01:00.949> an<00:01:01.219> exhibition<00:01:01.999> front<00:01:02.960> showing<00:01:03.859> you<00:01:03.979> an

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
like an exhibition front showing you an

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.880 
like an exhibition front showing you an
automatic<00:01:04.309> movement<00:01:05.000> doesn't<00:01:05.239> it<00:01:05.479> but<00:01:06.079> don't

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
automatic movement doesn't it but don't

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.520 
automatic movement doesn't it but don't
be<00:01:07.040> fooled<00:01:07.070> it's<00:01:07.880> actually<00:01:08.450> powered<00:01:09.320> by<00:01:09.500> a

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
be fooled it's actually powered by a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.749 
be fooled it's actually powered by a
quartz<00:01:10.100> movement

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
quartz movement

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.719 
quartz movement
it's<00:01:11.270> just<00:01:11.659> aesthetically<00:01:12.439> designed<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:13.549> look

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
it's just aesthetically designed to look

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.240 
it's just aesthetically designed to look
like<00:01:14.049> there's<00:01:15.049> some<00:01:15.229> automatic<00:01:15.560> movement<00:01:16.159> in

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
like there's some automatic movement in

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.950 
like there's some automatic movement in
there<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:16.759> you<00:01:17.360> know<00:01:17.450> that's<00:01:17.659> that's

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
there so you know that's that's

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.359 
there so you know that's that's
interesting<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:18.680> of<00:01:18.770> course<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.130> quartz

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
interesting and of course the quartz

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:20.889 
interesting and of course the quartz
movement<00:01:19.729> helps<00:01:19.969> to<00:01:20.060> keep<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.360> cost<00:01:20.570> a<00:01:20.750> bit

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
movement helps to keep the cost a bit

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.740 
movement helps to keep the cost a bit
lower<00:01:21.369> but<00:01:22.369> yeah<00:01:22.610> this<00:01:22.759> is<00:01:22.880> not<00:01:23.060> an<00:01:23.270> automatic

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
lower but yeah this is not an automatic

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.499 
lower but yeah this is not an automatic
movement<00:01:23.960> it's<00:01:24.380> a<00:01:24.560> quartz<00:01:24.829> movement<00:01:25.360> you<00:01:26.360> can

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
movement it's a quartz movement you can

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.020 
movement it's a quartz movement you can
use<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:26.810> crown<00:01:27.079> here<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.740> change<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.789> time

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
use the crown here to change the time

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.690 
use the crown here to change the time
obviously<00:01:29.659> a<00:01:30.049> simple<00:01:30.469> push<00:01:30.770> pull<00:01:31.039> feature<00:01:31.310> and

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
obviously a simple push pull feature and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.819 
obviously a simple push pull feature and
then<00:01:32.240> you've<00:01:32.420> got<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:32.600> second<00:01:33.079> style<00:01:33.289> down<00:01:33.710> at

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
then you've got a second style down at

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.690 
then you've got a second style down at
the<00:01:33.920> bottom<00:01:34.250> at<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.430> six<00:01:34.700> o'clock<00:01:34.820> position

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
the bottom at the six o'clock position

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.550 
the bottom at the six o'clock position
the<00:01:37.700> case<00:01:37.939> back<00:01:38.270> is<00:01:38.630> comparatively<00:01:39.350> less

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
the case back is comparatively less

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.219 
the case back is comparatively less
exciting<00:01:40.119> really<00:01:41.119> not<00:01:41.299> much<00:01:41.479> to<00:01:41.689> see<00:01:41.869> there<00:01:42.049> at

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
exciting really not much to see there at

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.819 
exciting really not much to see there at
all<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:43.869> you<00:01:44.869> know<00:01:44.899> in<00:01:45.109> keeping<00:01:45.469> with<00:01:45.500> its

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
all and you know in keeping with its

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.279 
all and you know in keeping with its
industrial<00:01:46.130> design<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:47.450> watch<00:01:47.630> is<00:01:47.929> equipped

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
industrial design the watch is equipped

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.480 
industrial design the watch is equipped
with<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.530> 50<00:01:48.950> meter<00:01:49.460> water<00:01:49.939> resistance<00:01:50.539> rating

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
with a 50 meter water resistance rating

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.560 
with a 50 meter water resistance rating
so<00:01:52.490> now<00:01:52.640> what<00:01:52.789> I'll<00:01:52.880> do<00:01:53.000> is<00:01:53.030> I'll<00:01:53.240> show<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.479> a

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
so now what I'll do is I'll show you a

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.569 
so now what I'll do is I'll show you a
shot<00:01:53.869> of<00:01:54.020> this<00:01:54.170> watch<00:01:54.409> in<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.859> dark<00:01:55.100> as<00:01:55.250> you

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
shot of this watch in the dark as you

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.459 
shot of this watch in the dark as you
can<00:01:55.880> see<00:01:56.090> this<00:01:56.329> watch<00:01:56.570> does<00:01:56.899> have<00:01:57.109> some

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
can see this watch does have some

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.679 
can see this watch does have some
low-light<00:01:58.179> capabilities<00:01:59.179> however<00:01:59.509> it's

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
low-light capabilities however it's

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.410 
low-light capabilities however it's
actually<00:02:00.020> just<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.380> sub<00:02:00.649> dial<00:02:00.979> that<00:02:01.759> has<00:02:01.999> any

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
actually just the sub dial that has any

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.739 
actually just the sub dial that has any
sort<00:02:02.869> of<00:02:02.960> luminescence<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:04.460> overall<00:02:04.939> it's<00:02:05.539> a

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
sort of luminescence so overall it's a

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.749 
sort of luminescence so overall it's a
it's<00:02:06.020> an<00:02:06.109> attractive<00:02:06.439> watch<00:02:06.829> I'll<00:02:07.310> just<00:02:07.609> slip

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
it's an attractive watch I'll just slip

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.149 
it's an attractive watch I'll just slip
it<00:02:07.909> on<00:02:07.999> my<00:02:08.119> wrist<00:02:08.330> here<00:02:08.509> so<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.780> can<00:02:08.959> see<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:09.289> it

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.159 
it on my wrist here so you can see it it

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:11.830 
it on my wrist here so you can see it it
has<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.459> look<00:02:10.789> of<00:02:11.060> an<00:02:11.150> automatic<00:02:11.659> movement

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
has that look of an automatic movement

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.790 
has that look of an automatic movement
but<00:02:12.200> if<00:02:12.349> you<00:02:12.440> watch<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.860> second<00:02:13.190> hand<00:02:13.370> clothes

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
but if you watch the second hand clothes

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.590 
but if you watch the second hand clothes
you'll<00:02:14.010> see<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.730> not<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.390> nice

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
you'll see that it is not that nice

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.440 
you'll see that it is not that nice
sweeping<00:02:16.320> movement<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.100> get<00:02:17.310> with<00:02:18.300> an

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
sweeping movement that you get with an

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.910 
sweeping movement that you get with an
automatic<00:02:18.900> movement<00:02:19.050> rather<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:19.770> the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
automatic movement rather it's the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.040 
automatic movement rather it's the
tick-tock<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.360> tell-tale<00:02:21.570> of<00:02:21.960> the

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
tick-tock that is the tell-tale of the

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.800 
tick-tock that is the tell-tale of the
quartz<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.880> fossil<00:02:24.270> mechanical

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
quartz so this is the fossil mechanical

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.200 
quartz so this is the fossil mechanical
twist<00:02:25.110> me1<00:02:25.830> one<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.310> zero<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.910> if<00:02:27.060> you're

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
twist me1 one to zero and if you're

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.970 
twist me1 one to zero and if you're
