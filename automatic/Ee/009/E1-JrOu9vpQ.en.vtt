around<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.649> because<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.040> all<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:41.700> you

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
around you because it all is just you

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.330

know produced from your own head so
that's<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.670> basic<00:00:44.940> idea<00:00:45.210> here<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.570> really

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
that's the basic idea here it's really

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.360 
that's the basic idea here it's really
hard<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> set<00:00:46.710> attempts<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.280> make

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
hard to do but the set attempts to make

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.369 
hard to do but the set attempts to make
it<00:00:47.550> very<00:00:47.730> easy<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.450> comes<00:00:48.719> with<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.899> very<00:00:49.110> simple

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
it very easy it comes with a very simple

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.860 
it very easy it comes with a very simple
you<00:00:50.100> know<00:00:50.250> process<00:00:50.969> that's<00:00:51.270> explained<00:00:51.690> in

beam<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> ultimate<00:00:56.070> dream<00:00:56.250> inducing<00:00:56.730> tool

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
beam is a ultimate dream inducing tool

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.590 
beam is a ultimate dream inducing tool
and<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.949> uses<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.820> iphone's<00:01:00.149> motion

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
and it uses the the iphone's motion

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.000 
and it uses the the iphone's motion
sensors<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.109> detect<00:01:01.350> when<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.620> actually<00:01:01.770> go

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
sensors to detect when you actually go

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.889 
sensors to detect when you actually go
into<00:01:02.160> RM<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.730> put<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.059> under<00:01:03.570> your<00:01:03.629> pillow

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
into RM you put this under your pillow

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.649 
into RM you put this under your pillow
face<00:01:04.199> down<00:01:04.850> and<00:01:05.850> then<00:01:05.880> when<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.210> enter<00:01:06.450> REM

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
face down and then when you enter REM

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.410 
face down and then when you enter REM
you<00:01:06.960> move<00:01:07.110> around<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.470> lot<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.640> iphone<00:01:09.180> can

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
you move around a lot and the iphone can

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.060 
you move around a lot and the iphone can
supposedly<00:01:09.750> since<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.590> know<00:01:10.799> what<00:01:10.920> it

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
supposedly since this I you know what it

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.520 
supposedly since this I you know what it
works<00:01:11.310> fairly<00:01:12.240> well<00:01:12.450> depending<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
works fairly well depending on the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.140 
works fairly well depending on the
person<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.979> may<00:01:14.100> get<00:01:14.280> more<00:01:14.430> results<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:15.000> of

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
person you may get more results out of

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.100 
person you may get more results out of
this<00:01:15.240> than<00:01:15.479> say<00:01:16.049> other<00:01:16.259> people<00:01:16.700> um<00:01:18.110> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
this than say other people um and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.660 
this than say other people um and
obviously<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.740> only<00:01:19.920> idea<00:01:20.040> behind<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.549> is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
obviously the only idea behind that is

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.730 
obviously the only idea behind that is
just<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.420> know<00:01:21.509> you're<00:01:21.780> using<00:01:22.020> an<00:01:22.200> iphone<00:01:22.530> to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
just you know you're using an iphone to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.289 
just you know you're using an iphone to
attempt<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.189> sense<00:01:23.759> when<00:01:23.939> you're<00:01:24.030> asleep

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
attempt to sense when you're asleep

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.020 
attempt to sense when you're asleep

today telepathy is next to impossible so
you<00:01:31.770> know<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.189> creative<00:01:32.400> idea<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.820> use<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
you know it's a creative idea to use the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.179 
you know it's a creative idea to use the
motion<00:01:33.360> sensors<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:33.810> again<00:01:34.049> actual<00:01:34.320> results

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.280 
that you get out of this largely
dependent<00:01:36.509> how<00:01:36.630> much<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.869> actually<00:01:36.990> move

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
dependent how much you actually move

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.289 
dependent how much you actually move
around<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.619> your<00:01:37.650> REM<00:01:38.100> stage<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.729> sleep<00:01:38.790> etc

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
around in your REM stage of sleep etc

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.679 
around in your REM stage of sleep etc
but<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.439> how<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.619> works<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:42.360> then<00:01:42.570> you

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
but that is how that works and then you

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.240 
but that is how that works and then you
know<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.930> uses<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.259> special<00:01:43.680> dream<00:01:43.890> theme

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
know it uses the special dream theme

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.130 
know it uses the special dream theme
which<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.939> soundtrack<00:01:45.270> that's<00:01:45.570> supposed

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
which is the soundtrack that's supposed

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.899 
which is the soundtrack that's supposed
to<00:01:46.320> induce<00:01:46.710> specific<00:01:47.220> dream<00:01:47.460> moods<00:01:47.700> with

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
to induce specific dream moods with

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.910 
to induce specific dream moods with
inside<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.409> kind<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.649> keep<00:01:49.829> you

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
inside you and to just kind of keep you

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.020 
inside you and to just kind of keep you
aware<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.369> fact<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.640> you're<00:01:50.820> dreaming

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
aware of the fact that you're dreaming

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.020 
aware of the fact that you're dreaming
etc<00:01:51.979> that's<00:01:52.979> how<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.220> works<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.729> start

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
etc that's how that works and you start

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.260 
etc that's how that works and you start
out<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.299> app<00:01:55.070> by<00:01:56.070> watching<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.939> short<00:01:57.149> little

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
out the app by watching a short little

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.520 
out the app by watching a short little
instructional<00:01:57.750> video<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.049> guess<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.380> would<00:01:58.500> call

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
instructional video I guess I would call

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.380 
instructional video I guess I would call
it<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:59.130> short<00:01:59.549> little<00:01:59.640> animation<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.210> since

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
it a short little animation that since

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.120 
it a short little animation that since
need<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.689> relax<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.350> sort<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.649> get<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.070> the

which we tend to rail against but they

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.530 
which we tend to rail against but they
come<00:02:25.019> with<00:02:25.200> custom<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:26.069> know<00:02:26.239> images<00:02:27.239> so

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
for this we had a couple different links

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.940 
for this we had a couple different links
get<00:02:30.870> instructions<00:02:31.379> that<00:02:31.500> was<00:02:31.590> just<00:02:31.799> dead

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
get instructions that was just dead

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.339 
get instructions that was just dead
you've<00:02:32.099> also<00:02:32.250> got<00:02:32.519> terms<00:02:33.049> which<00:02:34.049> is<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.319> course

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
you've also got terms which is of course

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.140 
you've also got terms which is of course
terms<00:02:34.799> of<00:02:34.950> service<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.519> agreements<00:02:36.030> that

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
terms of service and agreements that

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.210 
terms of service and agreements that
nobody<00:02:36.420> reads<00:02:36.599> and<00:02:37.019> you<00:02:37.590> actually<00:02:37.769> choose<00:02:38.040> the

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
nobody reads and you actually choose the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.539 
nobody reads and you actually choose the
dream<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.900> there's<00:02:40.440> an<00:02:40.590> option<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.920> buy<00:02:41.010> dream

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
dream and there's an option to buy dream

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.819 
dream and there's an option to buy dream
so<00:02:41.790> essentially<00:02:42.360> as<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.079> SAP<00:02:43.260> gains<00:02:43.530> more

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
so essentially as the SAP gains more

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.729 
so essentially as the SAP gains more
popularity<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.579> gains<00:02:44.790> more<00:02:44.970> traction

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
popularity and gains more traction

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.740 
popularity and gains more traction
hopefully<00:02:46.739> they<00:02:46.920> will<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:48.239> know<00:02:48.299> come<00:02:48.629> out

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.920 
and there is a soundtrack playing whoops
that<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.769> just<00:03:08.760> skipped<00:03:09.060> essentially<00:03:09.780> it's<00:03:09.900> a

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
that I just skipped essentially it's a

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.550 
that I just skipped essentially it's a
video<00:03:10.620> animation<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:12.420> know<00:03:12.540> let's<00:03:13.049> go<00:03:13.230> and

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
video animation you know let's go and

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.619 
video animation you know let's go and
let's<00:03:13.620> go<00:03:13.799> back<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.370> feel<00:03:14.549> bad<00:03:14.760> for<00:03:15.030> a

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
let's go back to that I feel bad for a

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.890 
let's go back to that I feel bad for a
first<00:03:16.319> screen<00:03:16.620> app<00:03:16.799> so<00:03:16.980> let's<00:03:17.129> let's<00:03:17.250> redo<00:03:17.609> it

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
first screen app so let's let's redo it

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.780 
first screen app so let's let's redo it
so<00:03:18.900> again<00:03:19.139> set<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.410> alarm<00:03:19.590> clock<00:03:19.739> and<00:03:20.099> we<00:03:20.639> go

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
so again set the alarm clock and we go

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.789 
so again set the alarm clock and we go
so<00:03:21.690> there's<00:03:21.840> your<00:03:21.900> nice<00:03:22.109> sound<00:03:22.410> effects<00:03:22.709> and

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
so there's your nice sound effects and

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:23.930 
so there's your nice sound effects and
you've<00:03:22.950> got<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.099> animation<00:03:23.579> going<00:03:23.700> on<00:03:23.880> the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
you've got the animation going on the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.430 
you've got the animation going on the
background<00:03:24.150> see<00:03:24.690> imagery<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.169> kind<00:03:25.319> of<00:03:25.349> get

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
background see imagery to kind of get

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.309 
background see imagery to kind of get
you<00:03:25.590> in<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.739> mood<00:03:26.359> etc<00:03:27.359> etc<00:03:27.450> on<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.079> place

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
you in the mood etc etc on this place

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.259 
you in the mood etc etc on this place
for<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.650> while<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:29.040> then<00:03:29.220> when<00:03:29.489> it's<00:03:29.639> done<00:03:29.940> you

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
for a while and then when it's done you

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.180 
for a while and then when it's done you
know<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.840> says<00:03:31.079> go<00:03:31.319> to<00:03:31.380> sleep<00:03:31.739> so<00:03:31.769> obviously

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
know it says go to sleep so obviously

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.259 
know it says go to sleep so obviously
you're<00:03:32.280> supposed<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.609> do<00:03:32.730> this<00:03:32.880> right<00:03:33.090> before

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
you're supposed to do this right before

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.580 
you're supposed to do this right before
you<00:03:33.540> go<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.690> sleep<00:03:33.780> when<00:03:34.109> you're<00:03:34.230> just<00:03:34.380> kind<00:03:34.560> of

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
you go to sleep when you're just kind of

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.470 
you go to sleep when you're just kind of
sitting<00:03:34.829> around<00:03:34.950> in<00:03:35.160> bed<00:03:35.430> which<00:03:36.030> most<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.359> us

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
sitting around in bed which most of us

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.220 
sitting around in bed which most of us
do<00:03:36.690> we're<00:03:37.079> going<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.290> skip<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:38.480> here<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.750> the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
do we're going to skip it here is the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.080 
do we're going to skip it here is the
good<00:03:40.440> night<00:03:40.709> screen<00:03:41.099> where<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.400> simply<00:03:41.639> go<00:03:42.030> to

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
good night screen where you simply go to

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.580 
good night screen where you simply go to
sleep<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.510> then<00:03:42.569> essentially<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.200> app<00:03:43.349> will

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
sleep and then essentially the app will

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.300 
sleep and then essentially the app will
wake<00:03:44.579> up<00:03:44.790> when<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:45.900> go<00:03:46.410> into<00:03:46.560> REM<00:03:46.799> sleep<00:03:47.040> and

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
wake up when you go into REM sleep and

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.710 
wake up when you go into REM sleep and
again<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.730> functionality<00:03:48.269> of<00:03:48.299> that<00:03:48.450> largely

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
again the functionality of that largely

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.759 
again the functionality of that largely
depends<00:03:49.049> on<00:03:49.169> the<00:03:49.230> person<00:03:49.500> we're<00:03:49.590> going<00:03:49.709> to

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
depends on the person we're going to

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.080 
depends on the person we're going to
head<00:03:49.859> and<00:03:49.950> stop<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.340> dream<00:03:50.519> as<00:03:50.669> if<00:03:50.700> we<00:03:50.910> just

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
head and stop the dream as if we just

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.089 
head and stop the dream as if we just
woken<00:03:51.359> up<00:03:51.569> you<00:03:52.230> can<00:03:52.380> actually<00:03:52.470> input<00:03:52.980> your

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
woken up you can actually input your

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.589 
woken up you can actually input your
dream<00:03:53.310> experience<00:03:53.579> which<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.120> awesome<00:03:54.299> you

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
dream experience which is awesome you

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:55.879 
dream experience which is awesome you
tend<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.840> remember<00:03:54.959> your<00:03:55.230> dreams<00:03:55.440> immediately

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
tend to remember your dreams immediately

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.349 
tend to remember your dreams immediately
after<00:03:56.099> waking<00:03:56.250> up<00:03:56.519> so<00:03:56.669> joining<00:03:56.940> them<00:03:57.120> down<00:03:57.269> is

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
after waking up so joining them down is

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.699 
after waking up so joining them down is
a<00:03:57.450> good<00:03:57.569> way<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:57.750> get<00:03:57.959> your<00:03:58.139> dream<00:03:58.410> memory

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
a good way to get your dream memory

a good way to get your dream memory
going<00:03:59.129> so<00:03:59.760> we<00:03:59.879> really<00:03:59.970> like<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.209> fact<00:04:00.389> that

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
going so we really like the fact that

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.089 
going so we really like the fact that
that's<00:04:00.629> there<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:00.989> can<00:04:01.109> send<00:04:01.410> this<00:04:01.560> through<00:04:02.040> a

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
that's there you can send this through a

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.860 
that's there you can send this through a
variety<00:04:02.310> of<00:04:02.459> different<00:04:02.519> methods<00:04:03.180> including

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
variety of different methods including

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.659 
variety of different methods including
Facebook<00:04:04.139> but<00:04:04.980> we're<00:04:05.129> just<00:04:05.160> going<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.459> cancel

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
Facebook but we're just going to cancel

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.059 
Facebook but we're just going to cancel
out<00:04:05.910> of<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.120> for<00:04:06.329> now<00:04:06.359> so<00:04:07.200> that<00:04:07.349> is<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.650> basics

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
out of it for now so that is the basics

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.280 
out of it for now so that is the basics

of dream beam it as a indeed a dream
induction<00:04:10.560> tool<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.370> like<00:04:11.819> we<00:04:11.940> said<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.239> you

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
induction tool and like we said it you

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.970 
induction tool and like we said it you
might<00:04:12.569> have<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.870> lot<00:04:13.139> of<00:04:13.169> success<00:04:13.650> with<00:04:13.680> this

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
might have a lot of success with this

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.650 
might have a lot of success with this
some<00:04:14.220> people<00:04:14.459> may<00:04:14.579> not<00:04:14.699> experience<00:04:15.030> much<00:04:15.359> but

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
some people may not experience much but

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.729 
some people may not experience much but
we<00:04:15.720> have<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:15.870> feeling<00:04:16.169> that<00:04:16.199> most<00:04:16.440> people<00:04:16.650> be

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
we have a feeling that most people be

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.050 
we have a feeling that most people be
kind<00:04:16.919> of<00:04:16.979> somewhere<00:04:17.220> in<00:04:17.340> between<00:04:17.400> some<00:04:17.880> nights

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
kind of somewhere in between some nights

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.360 
kind of somewhere in between some nights
at<00:04:18.209> work<00:04:18.359> some<00:04:18.630> nights<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:19.109> doesn't<00:04:19.530> but<00:04:20.250> even

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
at work some nights it doesn't but even

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.219 
at work some nights it doesn't but even
just<00:04:20.609> for<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.180> dog<00:04:21.390> does<00:04:21.690> happen<00:04:21.930> you

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
just for that the dog does happen you

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.990 
just for that the dog does happen you
know<00:04:22.409> that<00:04:22.590> this<00:04:22.680> app<00:04:22.890> costs<00:04:23.250> makes<00:04:23.669> it<00:04:23.849> quite

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
know that this app costs makes it quite

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.969 
know that this app costs makes it quite
an<00:04:24.180> incredible<00:04:24.900> value<00:04:25.050> so<00:04:25.469> with<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:25.830> in<00:04:25.950> mind

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
an incredible value so with that in mind

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:26.420 
an incredible value so with that in mind
we

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
we

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.040 
we
are<00:04:26.520> going<00:04:26.850> to<00:04:26.910> give<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.120> a<00:04:27.150> 4<00:04:27.360> out<00:04:27.419> of<00:04:27.539> 5<00:04:27.750> star

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
are going to give it a 4 out of 5 star

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.050 
are going to give it a 4 out of 5 star
rating<00:04:28.130> it<00:04:29.130> does<00:04:29.310> come<00:04:29.490> recommended<00:04:29.729> if<00:04:30.000> you
