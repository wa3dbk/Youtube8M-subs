a chain saw after me but you know what
I'm<00:02:27.560> just<00:02:27.800> gonna<00:02:27.920> not<00:02:28.580> say<00:02:28.910> that<00:02:29.090> because<00:02:29.330> it

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
I'm just gonna not say that because it

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.140 
I'm just gonna not say that because it
always<00:02:29.930> happened<00:02:30.440> if<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.650> say<00:02:30.860> that<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.970> he

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
always happened if I say that so he

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.870 
always happened if I say that so he
started<00:02:32.450> torpedo<00:02:32.960> on<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.440> wall<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:33.920> heard

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
started torpedo on the wall I heard

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.820 
started torpedo on the wall I heard
something<00:02:35.800> that<00:02:36.800> wasn't<00:02:37.040> here<00:02:37.430> before<00:02:38.830> that's

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
something that wasn't here before that's

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.460 
something that wasn't here before that's
such<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.610> quick<00:02:40.940> change<00:02:41.390> anyway<00:02:41.900> let's<00:02:42.140> pick<00:02:42.380> up

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
such a quick change anyway let's pick up

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.890 
such a quick change anyway let's pick up
the<00:02:42.620> key<00:02:42.800> because<00:02:43.130> I<00:02:43.250> I<00:02:43.550> actually<00:02:44.330> didn't<00:02:44.780> sigh

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
the key because I I actually didn't sigh

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.870 
the key because I I actually didn't sigh
I<00:02:45.140> thought<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:45.830> myself<00:02:45.860> maybe<00:02:46.190> there<00:02:46.490> is<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.610> key

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
I thought to myself maybe there is a key

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.710 
I thought to myself maybe there is a key
over<00:02:47.060> there<00:02:47.270> but<00:02:47.720> anyway<00:02:48.050> my<00:02:49.000> intuition<00:02:50.000> or<00:02:50.420> in

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
over there but anyway my intuition or in

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.140 
over there but anyway my intuition or in
creation<00:02:51.140> is<00:02:51.410> it's<00:02:52.130> bad<00:02:52.459> it's<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.790> note<00:02:52.940> it's

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
creation is it's bad it's a note it's

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.270 
creation is it's bad it's a note it's
bad<00:02:53.390> it's<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.690> note<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.140> how<00:02:54.709> about<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:55.100> fucking

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
bad it's a note the how about is fucking

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.540 
bad it's a note the how about is fucking
decide<00:02:55.840> ok<00:02:56.840> when<00:02:57.350> I<00:02:57.380> look<00:02:57.620> at<00:02:57.740> the<00:02:57.800> little<00:02:58.160> I

game was this a whole game actually in

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.020 
game was this a whole game actually in
my<00:07:18.020> opinion<00:07:18.050> that<00:07:18.530> game<00:07:18.770> was<00:07:18.980> good<00:07:19.340> may

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.650 
my opinion that game was good may
probably<00:07:20.330> there<00:07:20.660> was<00:07:20.870> no<00:07:21.169> jump<00:07:21.500> scares<00:07:21.740> and

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:22.660 
probably there was no jump scares and

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.600 
probably there was no jump scares and
i'm<00:07:23.660> not<00:07:23.870> sure<00:07:24.080> if<00:07:24.200> there<00:07:24.380> was<00:07:24.560> music<00:07:24.830> but<00:07:25.370> i

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.610 
i'm not sure if there was music but i

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.120 
i'm not sure if there was music but i
don't<00:07:26.419> remember<00:07:26.660> having<00:07:27.110> music<00:07:27.530> and<00:07:27.710> not
