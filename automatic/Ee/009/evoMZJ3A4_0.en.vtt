00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.289
 it will be great certain tooth we will do 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.670
 a chocolate sauce is very easy to 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:29.710
 do I have boiling water I'm going to put 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.649
 cocoa is a chocolate sauce 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.350
 what turned color I have true that they vote 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.600
 and philip and the truth 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.660
 This beautiful my Filipina is from my new 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:45.050
 line of philippines I also am is 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.960
 ayayay oyes 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.610
 the sessions because I do not know why 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.610
 we can see the pepillo mixture 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.360
 it's starting to get thick 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.430
 because the cocoa 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.710
 when you take consistency and right now 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.440
 I'm going to add a little more water, 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.540
 worry if this happens I will put 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.720
 sugar 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:15.540
 and in the blender my cream is ready 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.540
 beaten no good thank you 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.420
 let's add the sugar if you 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.799
 wants to make more of diet look very 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.799
 well what are you going to do these 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.520
 Sweeteners are sugar substitutes 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.520
 that are very good 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.100
 let's put this sugar a sauce 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.229
 of chocolate to bathe any ice cream 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.509
 any pose you can have the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.330
 refrigerator and it will last many 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.440
 many many days look here it was not 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.320
 need to add more 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.860
 water our sauce was perfectly made 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.200
 of chocolate is ready ok now that 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.950
 I know how complicated I am, I have to 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.920
 let cool 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.550
 I have here a list I will start 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.920
 to beat cream until smooth peaks 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.170
 and then when what I have peaks a 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.360
 once I will add the vanilla is a 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.860
 whipped cream is not a chantilly cream 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.620
 what is the difference of the cream 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.490
 Chantilly is already on the cream 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.950
 whipped is nothing more with some flavoring 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.250
 there we are going to put everything to 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:27.050
 integrate air they are already very seated 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.790
 in a periquera like periquita what 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.180

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.519

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.980

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.770
 background at one time 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.440
 I'll put three balls of ice cream I have 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.410
 to be very aware of my cream 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.120
 beaten because if it happens we can do 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.650

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.000

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.320

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.470

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.770

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.770

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:27.140

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.140

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.290
 and how about decorating it 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:32.420

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.680
