 Hi, I hope that your 9 years old is great 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.080
 and today I will be very 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.900
 interesting video because i got 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.940
 question from my very lovely followers and 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.029
 she asks me very much 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.490
 so that you tell about how you learned 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.670
 english or how to learn english and 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.619
 how and how to learn hebrew how you taught him 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.349
 you know of course what is the best 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.150
 the way to learn a language is to be in that 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.669
 same environment where they speak this language 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.309
 daily you you come let's say us 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.520
 you will see how in a week you are already 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.170
 will push in this language because 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.360
 all day you will hear 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.920
 English and you so learned 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.730
 talk when we were little we 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.379
 heard our mom telling us something we 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.280
 repeating Denmark and we heard it again 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.969
 we memorized 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.300
 and so we started talking so learn the language 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.260
 they teach him at school using textbooks 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.780
 but of course there is a better way to learn 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.659
 English if you are not in that 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.880
 environment and you can learn it yourself not 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.210
 have to pay a ton of money for some 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.990
 course we took all the movies on 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.140
 English Anis Subtitled Here 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.270
 subtitled 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.430
 as it is heard the country where something 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.009
 speak Russian and when you grow up and 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.799
 you always see a movie in english and 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.560
 read the subtitles on the growth of a Jew 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.900
 you understand that this word is associated with 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.340
 this word is easier for you to learn, I know 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.869
 that in Ukraine let's say we wanted to go and 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.930
 watch a movie in english because 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.400
 that my companion does not know Russian and 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.100
 we will be told that there is no such movie 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.229
 English and this is a pity because 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.210
 it would help so much so if you 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.130
 can watch as much movie as possible 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.829
 mean from cartoon because in 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.430
 cartoons words brighter than in movies 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.100
 maybe for adults and read books 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.719
 were not you just once Harry Potter 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.920
 or what is take any 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.320
 a very long time 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.210
 I will read the book read this book 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.530
 com we meet two shopaholic something very 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.319
 interesting and this 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.840
 easy book because there itself is not 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.120
 difficult it is not dostoevsky have expert 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.480
 so take some light 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.120
 the book 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.910
 even a children's book, whichever you have 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.760
 English and you start to read 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.950
 every day 10 minutes half an hour two 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.220
 hours what longer will you read 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.150
 so more your brains will attract to 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.660
 English language 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.370
 and so you will memorize more 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.620
 when you read a book of course there will be 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.900
 words you don't know i need them 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.640
 immediately translate first read all my 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.519
 you can be with markers only or 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.170
 write period words that you do not 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.870
 know if you don't want to experience and 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.690
 book just write them next but they 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.030
 interrupted those supplies immediately you finish 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.560
 read these 10 minutes half an hour or an hour you 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.209
 understand what you read before you 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.489
 because we can understand even if we 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.890
 don't know a few words should not only 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.709
 be careful and then you go and 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.450
 digest these words and teach them and how 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.500
 learn these words better not translate 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.209
 from English to Russian 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.220
 and from English to English so to you 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.079
 it will be much easier because when you 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.850
 will speak English and 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.380
 translate these words into Russian 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.150
 before you transfer them to 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.260
 English, it will take you a lot 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.510
 time and 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.370
 that's the wrong way so 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.590
 try to translate it to us english 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.810
 on let's say at the university of course on 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.739
 the place is taught in English and neither 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:35.239
 words in hebrew but even my girlfriend on 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:38.100
 she teaches her Chinese will sit and and 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.340
 teach it in Chinese yes it is very 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.109
 difficult but I learned spanish and 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.910
 the teacher only spoke spanish we 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.320
 understood because it was me in full 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.180
 say what and what language we do not 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.310
 translated here we always have subtitles and 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.420
 even when you were little you were watching 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.170
 checks feed if you know such or traffic rules 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.680
 way 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:02.700
 all these argentinian tv shows then we 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.480
 there were subtitles and so 90 percent 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.920
 teens of israel know spanish without 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.880
 eliminate it so this is the best 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.910
 way for the movie and the first thing you need 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.340
 to learn a language is thirst you must 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.150
 crave it 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.690
 Vika because I study English with 1 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.669
 class 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.550
 then I learned English psychometry 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.949
 Now I study English at university 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.330
 anyway i can't say my 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.630
 English, he is excellent 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.699
 he is even smaller than the Russian hitman 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.910
 loads get better and better and 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.900
 better and better why and harm I learned for 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.830
 half a year I had to for a few 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.570
 months and english me so many years 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.790
 It must be taught because I have not longed to 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:51.410
 English once now I give him 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.630
 gazebos and because I realized that the language 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.850
 you yourself asked for the thing that is in it 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.340
 the world and I really, really want 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.889
 thick minus perfect my 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.710
 English but when you have thirst 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.080
 tell me i must know this 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.780
 I am obliged to language and nothing interests 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.030
 apart from this language and then you start 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.780
 learn this language when i arrived in israel 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:18.229
 i was ten years old twelve say and 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:20.240
 when she came for and that was my 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:23.090
 how would you say cheeks because 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.310
 suddenly understood nothing around her 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:29.110
 so I started I was very sorry 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:32.300
 great thirst to learn hebrew i learned it 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.310
 very very fast and like irradiated 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.590
 brick I went 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.560
 of course when you turned into israel 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.500
 that is, something called alpine is 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.050
 There is in Russia when you want to come 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.300
 in israel then you have a tulip you 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.110
 can go there and learn hebrew hebrew 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:54.349
 it is a very different language non latin languages 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.910
 it is not related to the Russian of which the letters do 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:59.750
 it seems like anything else and writes on the other 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:01.520
 sides with this one they are with this how 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.240
 Russian English Spanish all these 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.099
 languages ​​and when we came but at our place 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.979
 there is a tulip instead of being on 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:11.960
 history and biology lessons and listen 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:15.320
 teachers i then he speaks chinese 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:18.289
 we go pulp we are taught by the teacher 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.200
 my Hebrew and teacher who teaches 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:21.690
 she will not find us 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.130
 and this is Russian it helps a lot with this 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.810
 you talk to a man explain 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.280
 to you with those words that you do not 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.210
 do you understand because that's how you start 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.890
 think in Hebrew 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.360
 I very often time because it was 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.770
 first thing that wanted first and 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.740
 the only thing i needed was 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.940
 to live a normal life , and I 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.760
 started reading books 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.590
 children kofejku revered these books 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.350
 very very very many books and watched 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.760
 on all sorts of children's shows so I learned 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.800
 Hebrew 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:50.160
 so read talk and hear 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.550
 all this you have to do to learn 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.540
 tongue 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.910
 I hope that I could go and there is nothing 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.920
 no longer that you can't do it with 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.740
 They did it in front of you it will be done 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:04.650

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.910
