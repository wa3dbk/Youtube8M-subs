00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
a few sorbitol last year and when I've

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.040 
a few sorbitol last year and when I've
done<00:00:22.460> some<00:00:22.790> of<00:00:22.880> my<00:00:22.970> thought<00:00:23.180> but<00:00:23.210> it<00:00:23.480> was<00:00:23.570> a<00:00:23.840> lot

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
done some of my thought but it was a lot

pastor so I thought I'd short and roll
out<00:00:28.460> of<00:00:28.490> unit<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.119> shoot<00:00:29.539> you<00:00:29.660> think<00:00:29.840> so<00:00:30.769> this

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
out of unit and shoot you think so this

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.890 
out of unit and shoot you think so this
is<00:00:31.699> a<00:00:31.730> setup<00:00:32.059> here<00:00:32.330> and<00:00:32.629> an<00:00:32.720> a-frame

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
is a setup here and an a-frame

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.330 
is a setup here and an a-frame
configuration<00:00:34.330> and<00:00:36.040> hopefully<00:00:37.040> I'll<00:00:37.160> be<00:00:37.190> able

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
configuration and hopefully I'll be able

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.420 
configuration and hopefully I'll be able

tend not you another unique feature is

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.539 
tend not you another unique feature is
if<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.780> see<00:03:12.959> here<00:03:13.260> it's<00:03:13.799> got<00:03:13.920> some<00:03:14.220> snaps

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
attachment to an olive top so my friend

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.680 
attachment to an olive top so my friend
has<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:22.920> same<00:03:23.100> top<00:03:23.280> as<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.480> eaves

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
has the same top as I and the eaves

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.390 
has the same top as I and the eaves
drained<00:03:25.049> them<00:03:25.170> together<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.739> essentially

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
drained them together to essentially

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.160 
drained them together to essentially
double<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.730> size<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.090> shelter<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.660> it's

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
double the size of the shelter and it's

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.000 
double the size of the shelter and it's
a<00:03:28.260> great<00:03:28.500> idea

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
a great idea

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.410 
a great idea

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
you know these D shell is a very

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.789 
you know these D shell is a very
versatile<00:03:30.870> create<00:03:31.170> for<00:03:31.320> out<00:03:31.410> in<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.560> woods

versatile create for out in the woods

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.250 
versatile create for out in the woods
whether<00:03:32.100> have<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:33.000> also<00:03:33.120> used<00:03:33.480> them<00:03:33.630> for<00:03:33.660> for

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
whether have you also used them for for

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.509 
whether have you also used them for for

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
when you're working on the car if it

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.360 
when you're working on the car if it
happens<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.910> be<00:03:35.940> R<00:03:36.060> in<00:03:36.209> South<00:03:37.049> Korea<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.709> could

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
happens to be R in South Korea I could

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.590 
happens to be R in South Korea I could
feature<00:03:38.579> so<00:03:38.820> you<00:03:38.910> can<00:03:39.030> see<00:03:39.180> all<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.360> snaps

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
feature so you can see all the snaps

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.960 
feature so you can see all the snaps
going<00:03:39.900> along<00:03:40.079> now<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.560> that's<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:41.010> opposite

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
going along now and that's the opposite

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.250 
going along now and that's the opposite
we<00:03:42.120> often<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.480> other<00:03:42.510> side

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:53.119 

right<00:03:49.819> so<00:03:50.819> overall<00:03:51.120> really<00:03:51.870> really<00:03:52.440> nice<00:03:52.590> top

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
right so overall really really nice top

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.509 
right so overall really really nice top
I<00:03:53.159> have<00:03:53.370> not<00:03:53.580> recorded<00:03:54.000> up<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:55.739> there<00:03:56.280> isn't

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
I have not recorded up and there isn't

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.080 
I have not recorded up and there isn't
many<00:03:56.640> seams<00:03:57.650> on<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.950> start<00:03:59.250> only<00:03:59.549> seems<00:03:59.879> it'll

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
many seams on the start only seems it'll

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.619 
many seams on the start only seems it'll
no<00:04:00.299> say<00:04:00.569> but<00:04:00.750> it's<00:04:00.900> folded<00:04:01.230> over<00:04:01.319> and<00:04:02.599> sawed<00:04:03.599> up

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
no say but it's folded over and sawed up

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.330 
no say but it's folded over and sawed up
so<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.230> would<00:04:04.349> be<00:04:04.470> only<00:04:04.620> thing<00:04:05.069> that<00:04:05.250> would

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
so that would be only thing that would

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.920 
so that would be only thing that would
move<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.549> person<00:04:05.760> seems<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.269> are<00:04:06.510> never<00:04:06.750> that
