glad<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.489> they<00:02:43.610> made<00:02:43.849> it<00:02:44.030> it's<00:02:44.989> better<00:02:45.170> than

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
glad that they made it it's better than

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.720 
glad that they made it it's better than
not<00:02:45.530> having<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:46.069> at<00:02:46.190> all<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.879> know<00:02:47.060> seriously

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
not having it at all you know seriously

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.729 
not having it at all you know seriously
so<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:50.750> only<00:02:50.900> way<00:02:51.049> you<00:02:51.109> can<00:02:51.290> get<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.590> other

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
so the only way you can get the other

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.360 
so the only way you can get the other
version<00:02:51.920> from<00:02:52.280> psyche<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:52.819> with<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:53.359> figure

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
version from psyche is with this figure

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.460 
version from psyche is with this figure
let's<00:02:55.370> go<00:02:55.489> over<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.730> articulation<00:02:56.510> it's<00:02:57.290> got

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
let's go over the articulation it's got

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.860 
let's go over the articulation it's got
this<00:02:57.560> very<00:02:57.739> cool<00:02:58.010> gold<00:02:58.250> color<00:02:58.690> wasn't<00:02:59.690> always

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
this very cool gold color wasn't always

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.940 
this very cool gold color wasn't always
my<00:03:00.049> favorite<00:03:00.379> but<00:03:00.470> I'm<00:03:00.590> starting<00:03:00.890> to

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
my favorite but I'm starting to

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.940 
my favorite but I'm starting to
appreciate<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.989> see<00:03:02.989> all<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.170> regular

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
appreciate it and see all the regular

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.130 
appreciate it and see all the regular
details<00:03:04.459> are<00:03:04.730> their<00:03:05.170> wings<00:03:06.170> go<00:03:06.739> that<00:03:06.980> far<00:03:07.190> up

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
details are their wings go that far up

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.020 
details are their wings go that far up
have<00:03:09.140> quite<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:09.470> bit<00:03:09.560> of<00:03:09.709> flexibility<00:03:10.459> so<00:03:10.940> you

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
have quite a bit of flexibility so you

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.000 
have quite a bit of flexibility so you
can<00:03:11.239> see<00:03:13.750> 360<00:03:14.750> degrees<00:03:14.989> it's<00:03:15.349> like<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.650> peons

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
can see 360 degrees it's like a peons

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.270 
can see 360 degrees it's like a peons
wings<00:03:16.310> only<00:03:17.030> kind<00:03:17.989> of<00:03:18.079> more<00:03:18.349> advanced<00:03:21.280> the

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
wings only kind of more advanced the

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.589 
wings only kind of more advanced the
head<00:03:22.489> turns<00:03:23.389> 360<00:03:24.319> degrees<00:03:24.889> the<00:03:25.880> arms<00:03:26.299> the

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
head turns 360 degrees the arms the

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.159 
head turns 360 degrees the arms the
shoulders<00:03:26.630> are<00:03:27.169> part<00:03:27.470> of<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.709> arm<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:29.169> your

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:30.169 
shoulders are part of the arm so your

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.900 
shoulders are part of the arm so your
shoulders<00:03:30.560> don't<00:03:30.680> move<00:03:30.889> separately<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.669> arms

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
shoulders don't move separately the arms

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.849 
shoulders don't move separately the arms
have<00:03:32.030> quite<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.540> range<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:33.019> flexibility<00:03:33.620> you

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
have quite a range of flexibility you

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.349 
have quite a range of flexibility you
will<00:03:34.010> have<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.220> hard<00:03:34.400> time<00:03:34.549> finding<00:03:34.910> an<00:03:35.000> MSA

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
will have a hard time finding an MSA

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.229 
will have a hard time finding an MSA
with<00:03:35.660> that<00:03:35.959> much<00:03:36.260> you<00:03:37.160> know<00:03:37.190> movement<00:03:38.030> for

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
with that much you know movement for

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:47.610 
with that much you know movement for
their<00:03:38.329> arm<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:40.700> waist<00:03:41.530> can<00:03:42.530> turn<00:03:42.970> 360<00:03:43.970> degrees

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.949 

legs<00:03:48.760> see<00:03:49.760> how<00:03:49.849> those<00:03:49.970> little<00:03:50.269> slits<00:03:50.480> so<00:03:50.870> it

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
legs see how those little slits so it

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.409 
legs see how those little slits so it
has<00:03:51.109> nice<00:03:51.380> flexibility<00:03:52.220> there<00:03:52.849> it's<00:03:53.299> gone

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
has nice flexibility there it's gone

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.319 
has nice flexibility there it's gone
knee<00:03:53.690> joint<00:03:54.160> like<00:03:55.160> goes<00:03:55.340> back<00:03:55.609> pretty<00:03:55.849> far<00:03:56.150> as

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
knee joint like goes back pretty far as

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.900 
knee joint like goes back pretty far as
well<00:03:56.590> foots<00:03:57.590> on<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:57.829> ball<00:03:58.040> joint<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:58.669> I<00:03:58.700> can

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
well foots on the ball joint so I can

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.699 
well foots on the ball joint so I can
move<00:03:59.919> the<00:04:00.919> arm<00:04:01.129> does<00:04:01.849> turn<00:04:02.180> 360<00:04:03.049> degrees<00:04:03.230> there

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
move the arm does turn 360 degrees there

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.849 
move the arm does turn 360 degrees there
in<00:04:03.859> the<00:04:03.950> hand<00:04:04.190> get<00:04:04.459> turn<00:04:04.639> 300<00:04:05.209> now<00:04:06.169> not<00:04:06.829> just

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
in the hand get turn 300 now not just

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.220 
in the hand get turn 300 now not just
quite<00:04:07.400> because<00:04:08.209> this<00:04:08.389> little<00:04:08.690> part<00:04:08.870> gets<00:04:09.049> in

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
quite because this little part gets in

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.770 
quite because this little part gets in
the<00:04:09.290> way<00:04:09.760> right<00:04:10.760> here<00:04:11.709> in<00:04:12.709> case<00:04:12.919> I<00:04:13.540> you<00:04:14.540> already

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
the way right here in case I you already

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.250 
the way right here in case I you already
saw<00:04:15.849> believe<00:04:16.849> that<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:17.539> has<00:04:17.690> alternate<00:04:18.139> our

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
saw believe that it has alternate our

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.279 
saw believe that it has alternate our
arms<00:04:18.709> that<00:04:18.889> can<00:04:19.010> go<00:04:19.160> on<00:04:19.310> there<00:04:19.750> they<00:04:20.750> just<00:04:20.780> you

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
arms that can go on there they just you

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:22.870 
arms that can go on there they just you
know<00:04:21.320> pop<00:04:21.829> right<00:04:22.070> on<00:04:22.219> and<00:04:22.370> pop<00:04:22.580> right<00:04:22.849> off

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
know pop right on and pop right off

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.430 
know pop right on and pop right off
that's<00:04:23.390> one<00:04:23.570> of<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.719> things<00:04:23.780> I<00:04:24.050> really<00:04:24.080> liked

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
that's one of the things I really liked

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.879 
that's one of the things I really liked
about<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.770> MSA<00:04:25.070> a

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
about the MSA a

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.950 
about the MSA a
was<00:04:26.009> that<00:04:26.520> they<00:04:26.669> could<00:04:26.849> do<00:04:26.999> that<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:27.569> it<00:04:27.930> makes

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
was that they could do that and it makes

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.230 
was that they could do that and it makes
for<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:29.039> ability<00:04:29.400> to<00:04:29.520> make<00:04:29.669> some<00:04:29.849> very<00:04:29.969> cool

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
for the ability to make some very cool

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.499 
for the ability to make some very cool
customs<00:04:30.749> that<00:04:30.870> way<00:04:31.229> too<00:04:32.240> it's<00:04:33.240> going<00:04:33.360> to<00:04:33.389> be<00:04:33.479> a

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
customs that way too it's going to be a

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:35.450 
customs that way too it's going to be a
pretty<00:04:33.719> hard<00:04:34.229> to<00:04:34.469> find<00:04:34.770> figure<00:04:35.069> it's<00:04:35.249> one<00:04:35.400> of

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
pretty hard to find figure it's one of

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.820 
pretty hard to find figure it's one of

the last runs of Gundam msia here in the
