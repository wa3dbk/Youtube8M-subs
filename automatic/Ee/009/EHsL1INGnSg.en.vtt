 difficult for those next hours 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.639
 with this disruption that goes back 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.260

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.330

 with a lot of snow wind 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.590
 obviously on all the reliefs 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.690

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.860
 look a little sweeter that happen 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.470

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.470
