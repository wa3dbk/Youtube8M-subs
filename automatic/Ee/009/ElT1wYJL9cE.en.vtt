00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 the block just listened I'm going to teach you 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.190
 will use a remorse behind and two flights 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:18.949
 and eight by the internal and a 2008 flashlight 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.949
 another fault 501 b and c 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:31.699
 first we must do is remove this 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.699
 ring that 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.000
 and you 're using something that 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.000
 do not risk 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:06.960
 You can see that much is being charged there. 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.960
 so it does not allow 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.570
 the thread in the bottom it has 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.390
 2.1 feeling or intimate millimeters of 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:00.390
 diameter 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:04.140
 this first thread here has a 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:14.480
 mm to plus or 22 centimeters 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:14.480
 no milan at work 501 b own 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.780
 2.1 link means I read one feeling 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.000
 that would be 20 minutes 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:32.840
 it is for that internal thread 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.840
 So how do I use it? 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:03:06.950
 taking this piece for this or I can 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:03:06.950
 also only by removing this part and 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.830
 making it easier later 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.230
 if you can buy a remote one right 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.040
 your matter better but if you can not 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.040
 make the adjustment 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.400
 I took this ring is different 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:49.570
 the remote is not seen in my land back 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:57.120
 the other thing that you must pay attention to 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:57.120
 is this future here makes a suite 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.420
 Let's see tomorrow. 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:25.350
 this personal hole it has 1.3 more 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:32.850
 1.4 centimeters or 14 millimeters of 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:35.360
 14 mm straight to this remote 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.360
 It has 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.099
 thirteen and a half tone will fit right 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.150
 ok let's return it 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:07.279
 before he used this now I'm going 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:09.669
 replace with original flashlight 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:14.240
 the problem in this way that do not work 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:17.529
 They are the earth itself is that you will have 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:31.029
 to stop using this time 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:34.509
 doing this you will not have problem 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:34.509
 let's put 

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:45.300
 a little more work because it's there in the 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:45.300
 background you need to put it right 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:59.060
 now you can observe and you can see 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.060
 well the first thread 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:11.460
 the second mother search in the background now gives 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:15.740
 to be service remembering that this part 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.740
 Lantern and has to be on the menu 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:27.790
 15 millimeters of an inch and a half 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:33.400
 because it gives depth of attain 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:07:01.320
 that second bag did not give 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:07:14.620
 But I know that I am the Lord. 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:20.940
 using white 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:20.940
 earth how much memory in a 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:37.530
 Now I'm going to show you lands only. 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:39.420
 to show you that look this is the 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:46.680
 kind of a pity that will not work for me 

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:51.120
 I know that this one is smaller than 

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:57.300
 The minimum measure for you here is 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:59.310
 only one centimeter in diameter 

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:02.100
 so it's no use trying to get a low 

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:04.700
 here because it will not fit you need to 

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.700
 at least
