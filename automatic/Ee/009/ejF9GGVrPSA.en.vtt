00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.080
 Oh, mammy! Take them off me! 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.480
 What was I thinking about! Here spiders tuyeva hucha! 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.480
 Why did I even come here ?!

00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:27.437
 [WITH STEN LEE'S PARTICIPATION] 

00:00:27.437 --> 00:00:28.646
 [SERIOUSLY!] 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.360
 So, Peter ... In short ... 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.280
 Responsibility ... And the choice, and ... 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.720
 Importance... 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.000
 And all such things ... 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.480
 Do you understand what I mean? 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.560
 You mean to say that with great power comes great responsibility? 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.640
 For sure! Here it is! 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.680
 Exactly. Thank you. 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.280
 Better not tell. 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.560
 Great job. Well said Pete! 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.920
 Will someone bring me eggs already at last ?! 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.960
 You saved my little son. 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.080
 Thank you. 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.000
 Who are you? 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.320
 I am Spiderman. 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.400
 So now you come down and save the guys in those cars or what? 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.000
 Actually, I have ... 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 As if suddenly there were cases. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.720
 But I am sure they will not be lost. 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.640
 ... and this will trigger my evil plan. 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.840
 Now I will just put it on repeat if someone accidentally 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.960
 he will come here and he will be curious to know what all this is. 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.200
 What you said? 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.720
 And you are right ... 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.160
 I guess I should not leave it in front of everyone. 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.680
 Thank you, little friend. 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.880
 I am so glad that I have hundreds of people like you and you are everywhere 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.320
 run after me and say such useful things to me. 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.000
 How cool that all these taps are so perfectly lined up here especially for me! 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.520
 About the best and not about ... 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.400
 Ah well ... the web is over. 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.080
 Promise me something ... 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.320
 Don't get Gwyn in this. 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.400
 That she was safe ... 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.600
 Ladushki. I promise. 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.840
 Do not make promises that you can not keep. 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.160
 Yeah, but they are the best. 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.960
 What?! 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.640
 You didn't say that. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.320
 What are you laughing at, people? 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.800
 Well damn. 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.840
 Enough. 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.920
 Good. I promise I will not laugh. 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.280
 Do not make promises ... 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.400
 who can not hold back. 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.440
 And what? They are the best. 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.640
 Man, if everything was so simple, it would all get away with it. 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.640
 - Here I am about the same. - Here you are, people ... 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.960
 Always behave nice to my girlfriend. 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.560
 Yeah. After you made her suffer because of the death of her father alone. 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.480
 Yeah, you screwed up, dude. 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.320
 Yes, but ... She'll be fine, is it the same? 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.320
 - Of course. - Good luck. 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.520
 Here is an ambush ... 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.800
 You know what I would do? 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.120
 Threw a betarang into it? 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.000
 Probably. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.720
 And I would immediately give an antidote to Dr. Connor. 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.440
 while he was freezing. 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.840
 Then Father Gwyn wouldn't have to die at all. 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.320
 Well ... What about those other cops who turned into lizards? 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.720
 They would still turn into people the next day, right? 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.840
 You also had this lizard formula before Captain Stacy died. 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.000
 Why didn't you give him a dose? 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.880
 Could her healing abilities have healed his wounds? 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.920
 Wow. I did not think about it. 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.200
 You're right. 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.520
 Well yes. 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.920
 Well I'm Batman. 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.320
 I would just go back in time and save everyone. 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.880
 I can not believe ... 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.560
 So ashamed. 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.800
 Don't worry, kid. It could be worse. 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.800
 It could be much worse. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.840
 What the... 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.720
 Who, your mother, made this pogrom in my library? 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.160
 It was you? 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.680
 Stark? Thor? 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.720
 Hulk? How to drink to give you! 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.880
 We were not even in the plot, Generalissimo. 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.480
 I won't take my eyes off you. 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.000
 Healthy people! Thanks to everyone who watched and commented on the video, 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.280
 everyone who helped write the script and thank you so much to the inimitable Stan Lee. 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.160
 Help us thank him by subscribing to his channel, The World of Stan Lee's Heroes. 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.800
 It was very cool that they became part of this project. 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.200
 And I think you people will like what they do there. Be sure to check it out. 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.680
 Lada. Thank you all for watching and ... 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.000
 I do not understand... 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 You hang out in a cafe, you have cool chairs from the web, and the real Stan Lee, and hot blonde ... 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.680
 It's not fair! 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.640
 Okay, well ... 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.960
 I'll go deal with this comrade, and you, the people, all the best. 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.280
 I am Spiderman! 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.720
 Bye everyone
