we<00:00:35.600> played<00:00:35.810> at<00:00:35.960> every<00:00:36.500> single<00:00:36.830> night<00:00:37.370> for<00:00:37.670> one

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
we played at every single night for one

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.020 
we played at every single night for one
year<00:00:38.890> we<00:00:39.890> actually<00:00:40.280> kind<00:00:40.430> of<00:00:40.520> went<00:00:40.730> out<00:00:40.820> on<00:00:41.000> a

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
year we actually kind of went out on a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.570 
year we actually kind of went out on a
limb<00:00:41.300> with<00:00:41.330> Halo<00:00:41.750> to<00:00:42.080> design<00:00:43.070> each<00:00:43.190> one<00:00:43.400> of<00:00:43.489> our

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
limb with Halo to design each one of our

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.160 
limb with Halo to design each one of our
multiplayer<00:00:44.030> maps<00:00:44.239> so<00:00:44.420> they<00:00:44.540> fit<00:00:44.750> within<00:00:44.960> the

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
multiplayer maps so they fit within the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.320 
multiplayer maps so they fit within the

at any of our maps and you could say

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:57.510 
at any of our maps and you could say
wait<00:00:49.489> I<00:00:49.670> know<00:00:50.030> that<00:00:50.239> location

we're<00:01:01.670> on<00:01:01.760> almost<00:01:02.120> every<00:01:02.480> Halo<00:01:02.720> one<00:01:02.960> map<00:01:03.230> we

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
we're on almost every Halo one map we

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.859 
we're on almost every Halo one map we
had<00:01:03.739> two<00:01:04.250> bases<00:01:04.760> that<00:01:05.030> were<00:01:05.180> pretty<00:01:05.449> identical

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
had two bases that were pretty identical

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.040 
had two bases that were pretty identical
and<00:01:06.440> at<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.460> beginning<00:01:07.790> of<00:01:07.970> Halo<00:01:08.240> 2<00:01:08.420> we<00:01:08.960> were

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
and at the beginning of Halo 2 we were

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.390 
and at the beginning of Halo 2 we were
trying<00:01:09.290> to<00:01:09.320> think<00:01:09.530> of<00:01:09.619> different<00:01:09.740> ways<00:01:09.950> or<00:01:10.310> we

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
trying to think of different ways or we

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.640 
trying to think of different ways or we
can<00:01:10.550> make<00:01:10.640> her<00:01:10.790> maps<00:01:11.000> more<00:01:11.240> asymmetrical<00:01:11.720> it's

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
can make her maps more asymmetrical it's

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.130 
can make her maps more asymmetrical it's
fun<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:13.490> play<00:01:13.640> as<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.150> attacker<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:14.780> it's<00:01:14.990> fun

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
fun to play as the attacker and it's fun

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.930 
fun to play as the attacker and it's fun
to<00:01:15.259> play<00:01:15.440> as<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.800> defender<00:01:16.310> you<00:01:16.610> can<00:01:16.790> never

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
to play as the defender you can never

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.240 
to play as the defender you can never
completely<00:01:17.600> defend<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.320> base<00:01:18.470> maybe<00:01:18.979> there's

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
completely defend the base maybe there's

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.590 
completely defend the base maybe there's
two<00:01:19.400> guys<00:01:19.550> defending<00:01:20.090> but<00:01:20.270> there's<00:01:20.420> three

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
two guys defending but there's three

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.270 
two guys defending but there's three
ways<00:01:20.840> in<00:01:20.869> you<00:01:21.590> always<00:01:21.740> haven't<00:01:22.009> make<00:01:22.130> these

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
ways in you always haven't make these

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.080 
ways in you always haven't make these
choices<00:01:23.710> so<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.860> attackers<00:01:25.400> start<00:01:25.700> on<00:01:25.909> the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
choices so the attackers start on the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.920 
choices so the attackers start on the
beach<00:01:26.890> and<00:01:27.890> we<00:01:28.580> give<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:28.850> attacker<00:01:29.180> a<00:01:29.420> warthog

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
beach and we give the attacker a warthog

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.580 
beach and we give the attacker a warthog
and<00:01:30.410> two<00:01:30.860> ghosts<00:01:32.140> then<00:01:33.140> we<00:01:33.229> don't<00:01:33.289> get<00:01:33.470> the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
and two ghosts then we don't get the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.380 
and two ghosts then we don't get the
defender<00:01:34.009> anything<00:01:34.460> except<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.000> rocket

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
defender anything except the rocket

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.969 
defender anything except the rocket
launcher

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.100 

and<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.369> beach<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.759> separated<00:01:39.330> from<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.020> main

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
and the beach is separated from the main

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.950 
and the beach is separated from the main
complex<00:01:40.830> by<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.159> seawall<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.689> gives<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
complex by the seawall so it gives the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.870 
complex by the seawall so it gives the
attackers<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> home<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.130> then<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.430> defenders

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
attackers a home and then the defenders

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.700 
attackers a home and then the defenders
also<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.390> their<00:01:45.600> base<00:01:45.810> which<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.229> their<00:01:46.439> home

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
also have their base which is their home

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.230 
also have their base which is their home
and<00:01:48.830> then<00:01:48.980> the<00:01:49.100> vehicles<00:01:49.550> have<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:49.940> come<00:01:50.120> in

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
and then the vehicles have to come in

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.200 
and then the vehicles have to come in
through<00:01:50.420> this<00:01:50.510> one<00:01:50.780> gate<00:01:52.060> launcher<00:01:53.060> guy

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
through this one gate launcher guy

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.360 
through this one gate launcher guy
usually<00:01:53.810> likes<00:01:54.050> to<00:01:54.260> get<00:01:54.350> into<00:01:54.590> position<00:01:54.740> to

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
usually likes to get into position to

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:02.700 
usually likes to get into position to
attack<00:01:56.300> that<00:01:56.480> gate<00:02:00.850> is<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.060> heads-up<00:02:02.479> display

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
attack that gate is the heads-up display

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.900 
attack that gate is the heads-up display
let's<00:02:03.710> say<00:02:03.890> I'm<00:02:04.070> in<00:02:04.190> a<00:02:04.250> firefight<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.880> I

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
let's say I'm in a firefight and I

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.120 
let's say I'm in a firefight and I
firing<00:02:05.270> my<00:02:05.390> weapon<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:06.110> I'm<00:02:06.500> taking<00:02:06.890> damage
