00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.430
 The paradise reflected before me, 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:54.950
 little by little it disappears and soon it will vanish. 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.940
 I wonder if my voice will reach you. 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.740
 Surely an echo can not be heard. 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.770
 Do not worry. 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.140
 I will trace an orbit; time is dyed silver. 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.050
 All light can be stopped. 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.480
 Even the shadows of the flames will rest. 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.510
 Even the murmur of the voices will rest. 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.900
 I will create a dream that will blossom in the silver night. 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.790
 From now on I will finish everything. 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.200
 Even the shadows of the future will rest. 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.280
 Even everything I've seen will rest. 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.920
 I will trace an orbit; time is dyed silver. 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.800
 All light can be stopped. 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.210
 Even the shadows of the flames will rest. 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.200
 Even the murmur of the voices will rest. 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.650
 I will trace an orbit; dreams on a silver night. 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.540
 From now on, let me finish everything. 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.910
 Even in the shadows of tomorrow, I will rest. 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.170
 With these hands that support me, I will rest. 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.350
 I will make an orbit in the darkness of the silver night. 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.200
 Until I've finished with everything and so on. 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.640
 Even if my tears flow, I'll rest. 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.660
 Even if my voice makes you mutter hatred, I'll rest. 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.090
 I will draw an orbit that will divide the brightness of the night. 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.940
 Until I've finished with everything and so on. 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.330
 Even if my world disappears, I will rest. 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.900
 With these hands that support me, I will rest. 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.180
 Hereinafter, 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.980
 help me to sleep
