00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
design you're going to start with a long

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.109 
design you're going to start with a long
flowing<00:00:27.480> stem<00:00:28.109> kind<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.650> shape<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.760> want<00:00:29.880> to

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
flowing stem kind of shape you want to

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.460 
flowing stem kind of shape you want to
just<00:00:30.300> kind<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.510> wiggle<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.080> curve<00:00:31.289> this

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
just kind of wiggle and curve this

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.620 
just kind of wiggle and curve this
around<00:00:31.859> however<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.850> want<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.239> look<00:00:33.420> on

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
around however you want it to look on

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.780 
around however you want it to look on
the<00:00:33.660> surface<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.200> your<00:00:34.350> quilt<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.640> going

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the surface of your quilt this is going

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.930 
the surface of your quilt this is going
to<00:00:35.880> stand<00:00:36.120> out<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:37.170> lot<00:00:37.860> more<00:00:38.160> than<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
to stand out a lot more than the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.910 
to stand out a lot more than the
feathers<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:40.110> kind<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.350> make<00:00:40.530> sure<00:00:40.770> that

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
feathers so just kind of make sure that

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.160 
feathers so just kind of make sure that
it<00:00:41.460> looks<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.940> way<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.120> want<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.629> look<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
it looks the way you want it to look and

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.959 
it looks the way you want it to look and
it's<00:00:44.160> not<00:00:44.430> turkey<00:00:45.420> or<00:00:45.809> blocky<00:00:46.430> okay<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.850> now

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
it's not turkey or blocky okay so now

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.970 
it's not turkey or blocky okay so now
the<00:00:48.030> second<00:00:48.600> step<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.379> set<00:00:49.559> your<00:00:49.770> moon

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the second step is to set your moon

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.950 
the second step is to set your moon
feathers<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.760> moon<00:00:51.149> feathers<00:00:51.510> are<00:00:51.690> very

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
feathers and moon feathers are very

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.840 
feathers and moon feathers are very
different<00:00:52.260> from<00:00:52.620> traditional<00:00:53.070> feathers

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
different from traditional feathers

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.819 
different from traditional feathers
because<00:00:54.210> you're<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.840> stitching<00:00:55.079> out<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
because you're just stitching out and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.810 
because you're just stitching out and
back<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:57.360> making<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.230> smooth<00:00:58.680> curving<00:00:59.520> arch

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
back just making the smooth curving arch

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.470 
back just making the smooth curving arch
shape<00:01:00.440> it's<00:01:01.440> not<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.129> traditional<00:01:02.480> teardrop

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
shape it's not a traditional teardrop

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.469 
shape it's not a traditional teardrop
shape<00:01:03.780> feather<00:01:04.049> I'm<00:01:04.290> not<00:01:04.489> curling<00:01:05.489> around<00:01:05.729> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
shape feather I'm not curling around and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.260 
shape feather I'm not curling around and
under<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.290> create<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> teardrop<00:01:08.310> I'm<00:01:08.580> just

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
under to create a teardrop I'm just

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.230 
under to create a teardrop I'm just
simply<00:01:09.510> bouncing<00:01:10.290> back<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.830> forth<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.880> create

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
simply bouncing back and forth to create

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.770 
simply bouncing back and forth to create
a<00:01:12.270> Halfmoon<00:01:12.720> shape<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:14.040> much<00:01:14.430> simpler<00:01:14.939> it's

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
a Halfmoon shape it's much simpler it's

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.530 
a Halfmoon shape it's much simpler it's
a<00:01:15.930> great<00:01:16.170> way<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> practice<00:01:17.400> feathering<00:01:18.299> in

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
a great way to practice feathering in

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.300 
a great way to practice feathering in
general<00:01:19.049> because<00:01:19.290> you're<00:01:19.740> stitching<00:01:19.979> off

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
general because you're stitching off

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.310 
general because you're stitching off
that<00:01:20.520> stem<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.119> you're<00:01:21.600> stitching<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.140> nice

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
that stem and you're stitching a nice

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.830 
that stem and you're stitching a nice
smooth<00:01:22.680> curve<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.430> think<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.240> wanted<00:01:24.659> to

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
smooth curve I think if you wanted to

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.960 
smooth curve I think if you wanted to
learn<00:01:24.990> feathers<00:01:25.500> really<00:01:25.860> badly<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.820> we're

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
learn feathers really badly but we're

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.600 
learn feathers really badly but we're
struggling<00:01:27.390> with<00:01:28.080> how<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> stitch<00:01:28.950> them<00:01:29.159> this

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
struggling with how to stitch them this

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.340 
struggling with how to stitch them this
would<00:01:29.790> be<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.970> great<00:01:30.329> way<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:31.079> really

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
would be a great way to really

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.350 
would be a great way to really
experiment<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.100> give<00:01:32.250> yourself<00:01:32.670> some

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
experiment and give yourself some

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.510 
experiment and give yourself some
practice<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:35.040> see<00:01:35.189> I'm<00:01:35.310> kind<00:01:35.490> of

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
practice so you can see I'm kind of

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.030 
practice so you can see I'm kind of
curving<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.119> over<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.780> around<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.560> then

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
curving this over and around and then

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.499 
curving this over and around and then
now<00:01:38.250> I'm<00:01:38.400> going<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.640> travel<00:01:38.909> stitch<00:01:39.270> all<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
now I'm going to travel stitch all the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.630 
now I'm going to travel stitch all the
way<00:01:39.600> back<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.110> beginning<00:01:40.229> because<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:41.040> want

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
way back to the beginning because I want

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.130 
way back to the beginning because I want
my<00:01:41.790> feathers<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.329> curve<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> same

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
my feathers to curve in the same

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.109 
my feathers to curve in the same
direction<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.100> easiest<00:01:44.430> way<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:44.970> it

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
direction and the easiest way to do it

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.569 
direction and the easiest way to do it
is<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.390> stitch<00:01:46.229> from<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.829> beginning<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
is to stitch from the beginning in the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.539 
is to stitch from the beginning in the
same<00:01:48.360> direction<00:01:48.570> as<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:48.990> first<00:01:49.320> set<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.340> now

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
same direction as the first set so now

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.389 
same direction as the first set so now
I'm<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.060> continue<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.570> branch<00:01:51.899> out

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
I'm just going to continue to branch out

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.520 
I'm just going to continue to branch out
bouncing<00:01:53.399> back<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.820> forth<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:55.020> really<00:01:55.380> all

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
bouncing back and forth and really all

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.319 
bouncing back and forth and really all
you<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.920> concentrate<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.549> it's<00:01:56.969> just

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
you have to concentrate on it's just

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.539 
you have to concentrate on it's just
simply<00:01:57.719> stitching<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.380> arch<00:01:58.710> kind<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.280> U

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
simply stitching that arch kind of U

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.770 
simply stitching that arch kind of U
shape<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.710> bounce<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.219> connect<00:02:02.969> with<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
shape and bounce it and connect with the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.980 
shape and bounce it and connect with the
feather<00:02:04.680> before<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.310> it's<00:02:06.030> very<00:02:06.390> very<00:02:06.689> simple

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
feather before it it's very very simple

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.589 
feather before it it's very very simple
but<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.740> produces<00:02:08.190> an<00:02:08.340> amazing<00:02:08.819> texture<00:02:09.209> and

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
but it produces an amazing texture and

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.330 
but it produces an amazing texture and
you<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.869> see<00:02:10.110> how<00:02:10.319> this<00:02:10.500> texture<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.009> starting

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
you can see how this texture is starting

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.600 
you can see how this texture is starting
to<00:02:11.430> take<00:02:11.459> shape

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
to take shape

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.400 
to take shape
in<00:02:12.700> this<00:02:12.970> situation<00:02:13.180> I<00:02:13.600> started<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.020> play<00:02:14.200> with

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
in this situation I started to play with

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.790 
in this situation I started to play with
widening<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:15.670> vine<00:02:16.090> line<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.990> starting<00:02:17.470> stem

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
widening the vine line the starting stem

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.860 
widening the vine line the starting stem
and<00:02:18.190> that<00:02:18.730> really<00:02:18.970> produces<00:02:19.660> some

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
and that really produces some

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.690 
and that really produces some
interesting<00:02:20.410> results<00:02:20.530> because<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.280> can<00:02:21.460> see

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
interesting results because you can see

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.960 
interesting results because you can see
how<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.360> stems<00:02:22.810> are<00:02:23.350> going<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:23.890> stand<00:02:24.250> out<00:02:24.520> so

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
how the stems are going to stand out so

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.550 
how the stems are going to stand out so
much<00:02:25.000> more<00:02:25.510> on<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.750> surface<00:02:26.080> of<00:02:26.200> your<00:02:26.320> quote

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
much more on the surface of your quote

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.160 
much more on the surface of your quote
because<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:27.280> moon<00:02:27.880> feathers<00:02:28.420> are<00:02:28.660> really

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
because the moon feathers are really

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.040 
because the moon feathers are really
close<00:02:29.410> together<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:30.280> dense<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.150> so<00:02:31.870> this

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
close together and dense and so this

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.500 
close together and dense and so this
stands<00:02:32.500> out<00:02:32.710> nicely<00:02:33.130> so<00:02:33.820> you<00:02:33.880> can<00:02:34.120> really

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
stands out nicely so you can really

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.080 
stands out nicely so you can really
experiment<00:02:35.050> with<00:02:35.350> some<00:02:35.620> funky<00:02:36.550> shapes<00:02:36.790> of

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
experiment with some funky shapes of

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.699 
experiment with some funky shapes of
your<00:02:37.240> stem<00:02:37.570> and<00:02:37.750> that's<00:02:37.900> going<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.200> stand<00:02:38.440> out

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
your stem and that's going to stand out

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.920 
your stem and that's going to stand out
and<00:02:38.890> really<00:02:39.220> show<00:02:39.430> off<00:02:39.480> now<00:02:40.480> I've<00:02:40.630> kind<00:02:40.900> of

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
and really show off now I've kind of

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.780 
and really show off now I've kind of
created<00:02:41.350> this<00:02:41.470> little<00:02:41.650> hook<00:02:42.040> here<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.520> I<00:02:42.580> want

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
created this little hook here and I want

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.120 
created this little hook here and I want
to<00:02:42.880> go<00:02:43.000> in<00:02:43.180> there<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.600> fill<00:02:44.380> that<00:02:44.410> with<00:02:44.830> some

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
to go in there and fill that with some

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.910 
to go in there and fill that with some
tighter<00:02:45.430> smaller<00:02:45.970> moon<00:02:46.360> feathers<00:02:46.920> it's

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
tighter smaller moon feathers it's

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.490 
tighter smaller moon feathers it's
really<00:02:48.580> fun<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:49.120> just<00:02:49.360> play<00:02:49.720> an<00:02:49.930> experiment

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
really fun to just play an experiment

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.650 
really fun to just play an experiment
with<00:02:50.680> this<00:02:50.830> design<00:02:51.280> it's<00:02:51.700> really<00:02:52.390> not<00:02:52.600> that

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
with this design it's really not that

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.500 
with this design it's really not that
difficult<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.920> just<00:02:54.070> looks<00:02:54.550> intense<00:02:55.120> because

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
difficult it just looks intense because

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.810 
difficult it just looks intense because
the<00:02:56.050> texture<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.680> so<00:02:56.709> overwhelming<00:02:57.670> and

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
the texture is so overwhelming and

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.540 
the texture is so overwhelming and
beautiful<00:02:58.540> I'm<00:02:59.530> going<00:02:59.800> to<00:02:59.860> travel<00:03:00.160> stitch

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
beautiful I'm going to travel stitch

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.510 
beautiful I'm going to travel stitch
back<00:03:00.850> again<00:03:01.270> I'm<00:03:01.930> just<00:03:02.470> of<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.860> mindset<00:03:03.489> that

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
back again I'm just of the mindset that

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.710 
back again I'm just of the mindset that
it's<00:03:03.910> much<00:03:04.390> easier<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:05.110> create<00:03:05.950> this<00:03:06.280> from<00:03:07.150> the

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
it's much easier to create this from the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.900 
it's much easier to create this from the
kind<00:03:07.989> of<00:03:08.050> starting<00:03:08.590> point<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.160> branching

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
kind of starting point and branching

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.660 
kind of starting point and branching
towards<00:03:10.360> yourself<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:11.890> want<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.160> play<00:03:12.520> with

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
towards yourself you want to play with

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.610 
towards yourself you want to play with
it<00:03:12.820> and<00:03:12.910> see<00:03:13.000> what<00:03:13.209> way<00:03:13.390> is<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.750> easiest<00:03:14.290> for

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
it and see what way is the easiest for

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.229 
it and see what way is the easiest for
you<00:03:14.800> and<00:03:15.190> if<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.430> don't<00:03:15.610> really<00:03:15.760> care<00:03:16.090> which

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
you and if you don't really care which

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.479 
you and if you don't really care which
way<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.750> feathers<00:03:17.080> are<00:03:17.290> bending<00:03:17.860> or<00:03:18.010> twisting

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
way the feathers are bending or twisting

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.920 
way the feathers are bending or twisting
then<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:18.760> can<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.030> course<00:03:19.269> just<00:03:19.480> keep<00:03:19.780> on

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
then you can of course just keep on

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.199 
then you can of course just keep on
stitching<00:03:20.350> all<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.590> way<00:03:20.680> around<00:03:21.180> but<00:03:22.180> I

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
stitching all the way around but I

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.150 
stitching all the way around but I
always<00:03:22.480> like<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.780> travel<00:03:23.170> stitch<00:03:23.530> back<00:03:23.799> to<00:03:24.010> my

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
always like to travel stitch back to my

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.340 
always like to travel stitch back to my
starting<00:03:24.610> point<00:03:24.640> and<00:03:25.090> stitch<00:03:25.720> towards<00:03:26.140> myself

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
starting point and stitch towards myself

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.620 
starting point and stitch towards myself
arching<00:03:27.220> them<00:03:27.430> so<00:03:28.000> that<00:03:28.030> they're<00:03:28.360> kind<00:03:28.600> of

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
arching them so that they're kind of

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.280 
arching them so that they're kind of
curling<00:03:29.170> in<00:03:29.320> the<00:03:29.410> same<00:03:29.709> general<00:03:30.130> direction

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
curling in the same general direction

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.350 
curling in the same general direction
any<00:03:32.290> weird<00:03:32.739> areas<00:03:33.280> just<00:03:33.580> fill<00:03:33.880> those<00:03:34.090> in<00:03:34.150> with

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
any weird areas just fill those in with

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.660 
any weird areas just fill those in with
just<00:03:34.930> some<00:03:35.110> back<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:35.650> forth<00:03:35.739> arching<00:03:36.400> lines

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
just some back and forth arching lines

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.270 
just some back and forth arching lines
and<00:03:37.030> that<00:03:37.150> will<00:03:37.299> fill<00:03:37.510> them<00:03:37.690> in<00:03:37.840> evenly<00:03:38.830> and

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
and that will fill them in evenly and

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.100 
and that will fill them in evenly and
keep<00:03:39.730> it<00:03:39.880> consistent<00:03:40.180> with<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:40.660> rest<00:03:40.840> of<00:03:40.989> the

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
keep it consistent with the rest of the

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.039 
keep it consistent with the rest of the
design<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.910> neat<00:03:43.120> thing<00:03:43.150> is<00:03:43.360> you<00:03:43.660> can<00:03:43.810> also

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
design the neat thing is you can also

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.440 
design the neat thing is you can also
kind<00:03:44.590> of<00:03:44.709> slightly<00:03:45.010> expand<00:03:45.820> those<00:03:46.150> last
