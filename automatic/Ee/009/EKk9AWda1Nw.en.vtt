regular XLR mic in there for line level
headphone<00:02:25.489> jack<00:02:25.670> yep<00:02:26.120> right<00:02:26.510> on<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.720> far<00:02:26.930> left

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
headphone jack yep right on the far left

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.960 
headphone jack yep right on the far left
it's<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.349> quarter-inch<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:28.489> then<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.819> can

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
it's a quarter-inch and then you can

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.699 
it's a quarter-inch and then you can
also<00:02:29.090> get<00:02:29.270> monitor<00:02:29.720> out<00:02:29.900> as<00:02:30.080> well<00:02:30.260> on<00:02:30.410> set<00:02:30.620> so

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
also get monitor out as well on set so

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:31.870 
also get monitor out as well on set so
if<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:30.890> have<00:02:30.980> speakers<00:02:31.340> sitting<00:02:31.670> on<00:02:31.760> your

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
if you have speakers sitting on your

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.699 
if you have speakers sitting on your
console<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.569> can<00:02:32.599> you<00:02:33.230> know<00:02:33.319> because<00:02:33.500> if<00:02:33.620> you

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
console you can you know because if you

going on that kind of nice thing too is
that<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.950> multi-view<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.550> get<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.700> couple

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
that the multi-view you get a couple

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.729 
that the multi-view you get a couple
ways<00:02:41.120> to<00:02:41.180> get<00:02:41.420> access<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.200> okay<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.560> can

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
ways to get access to it okay you can

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.220 
ways to get access to it okay you can
use<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:43.010> DVI<00:02:43.310> out<00:02:43.640> as<00:02:44.450> for<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.750> multi<00:02:45.020> view<00:02:45.140> so

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
use the DVI out as for a multi view so

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.660 
use the DVI out as for a multi view so
you<00:02:45.319> can<00:02:45.440> just<00:02:45.590> use<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:45.770> computer<00:02:46.190> monitor<00:02:46.340> if

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
you can just use a computer monitor if

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.759 
you can just use a computer monitor if
you<00:02:46.790> want<00:02:47.000> or<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:47.840> can<00:02:47.959> actually<00:02:48.140> we<00:02:48.620> have<00:02:48.739> a

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
you want or you can actually we have a

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.670 
you want or you can actually we have a
dedicated<00:02:49.090> SDI<00:02:50.090> spigot<00:02:50.989> for<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.290> multi<00:02:51.530> view

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
dedicated SDI spigot for the multi view

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.140 
dedicated SDI spigot for the multi view
as<00:02:51.769> well<00:02:51.890> if<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.040> have<00:02:52.130> an<00:02:52.220> SDI<00:02:52.459> monitor<00:02:52.880> all

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
as well if you have an SDI monitor all

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.550 
as well if you have an SDI monitor all
right<00:02:53.300> but<00:02:53.600> one<00:02:53.720> of<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.870> big<00:02:54.050> things<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:54.470> you

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
right but one of the big things that you

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.320 
right but one of the big things that you
run<00:02:54.769> into<00:02:54.980> it's<00:02:55.250> small<00:02:55.519> switches<00:02:55.819> is<00:02:56.090> just<00:02:56.239> you

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
run into it's small switches is just you

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.420 
run into it's small switches is just you
never<00:02:56.510> really<00:02:56.750> have<00:02:56.870> enough<00:02:57.110> outputs<00:02:57.560> yes

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
never really have enough outputs yes

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.430 
never really have enough outputs yes
inputs<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.090> can<00:02:59.239> kind<00:02:59.450> of<00:02:59.569> get<00:02:59.810> around<00:02:59.959> or

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
inputs you can kind of get around or

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.229 
inputs you can kind of get around or
fake<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:01.040> know<00:03:01.130> if<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:01.310> really<00:03:01.580> need<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.970> get

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
fake you know if you really need to get

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.150 
fake you know if you really need to get
another<00:03:02.420> switch<00:03:02.690> get<00:03:02.959> another<00:03:03.170> switch<00:03:03.410> we'd

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
another switch get another switch we'd

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.250 
another switch get another switch we'd
love<00:03:04.340> for<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:04.489> to<00:03:04.580> spend<00:03:04.730> more<00:03:04.880> money<00:03:05.260> but

what we did here was that we have two

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.289 
what we did here was that we have two
auxes<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.440> program<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.580> other<00:03:10.760> multi-view

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
auxes a program and the other multi-view

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.390 
auxes a program and the other multi-view
out<00:03:11.480> that's<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.810> SDI<00:03:12.170> spigot<00:03:12.650> those<00:03:13.100> can<00:03:13.280> all

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
out that's the SDI spigot those can all

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.400 
out that's the SDI spigot those can all
be<00:03:13.519> made<00:03:13.640> programs<00:03:14.120> if<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.780> want<00:03:14.989> can<00:03:15.290> they

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
be made programs if you want can they

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.350 
be made programs if you want can they
can<00:03:15.680> they<00:03:15.709> all<00:03:15.890> be<00:03:15.920> oxes<00:03:16.430> can<00:03:16.549> I<00:03:16.640> yeah<00:03:17.030> sign

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
can they all be oxes can I yeah sign

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.880 
can they all be oxes can I yeah sign
difference<00:03:17.720> yeah<00:03:17.810> those<00:03:18.019> canyou<00:03:18.350> can<00:03:18.410> mix<00:03:18.709> and
