00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.740
 Hello everyone, as always, I am Mikhail 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.719
 and it's all about tea on the box today we will 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.429
 unpack a small parcel 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.430
 in which there must be something that I am very 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.529
 I waited a long time Well I hope it is 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.900
 what I expect to see and should be in it 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.510
 be a bunch of a bunch of stickers and different and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.160
 some even certain so let's say i 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.640
 asked the seller to put it 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.710
 more youtube logo stickers 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.300
 there should be fifty stickers 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.700
 they are all from some specific 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.410
 materials and do not really understand what is there 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.320
 it was written by the Chinese so now we 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.780
 you touch them see and understand 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.030
 what it is for what it is and where are they 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.920
 You can glue all such stickers, I already 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.039
 ordered were listed and they are like stickers 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.920
 for my car they have enough 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.360
 a lot of water can bring near 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.070
 liquids that is, it seems to me that 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.930
 touch at least wash them off easily 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.820
 show you a sticker chapman yes I have 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.890
 when jeans were also from this company 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.510
 the only thing I have is upsetting me 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.790
 never saw a single sticker with 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.189
 youtube and they were in the lot 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.780
 that is, in pictures and everywhere and in 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.810
 I specifically asked the seller 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.729
 message put me more such in 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.710
 General picture yes I do not melt because 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.110
 I love different stickers here 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.540
 characters I love it at home it 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.640
 characters of street fighter characters from 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.590
 different games like this ordered these 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.979
 all notebook stickers i mean i 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.810
 planned to remove part of the body pasted 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.549
 it must have been set back 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.220
 give cool by the way see what u 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.820
 port and sticker some code in a suit 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.790
 Mario and rear monkey well, let Chinese 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.579
 much on fiction but this is very much 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.009
 strange strange company some here 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.200
 Felix the cat is very cool I think 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.990
 so here I am not told exactly about 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.030
 laptop i have about the computer and in 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.729
 In general, the system itself is not very acute for me 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.100
 Exactly you look quite normal but not 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.049
 cool so glue all the walls like 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.830
 I donâ€™t really want this one 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.530
 try 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.080
 grafon what glue for you and we will see 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.820
 Actually by the way I will say so 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.070
 there to the touch it seems like this to this 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.690
 paper usually when you take stick sticks he 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.720
 as if covered yet on top of some 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.540
 film and since the laminate that ice is not 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.880
 I know how to say it correctly, but here 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.540
 These stickers they somehow more paper 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.640
 whether 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.200
 and very unusual to the touch but at the same time I 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.360
 I really hope that they will not 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.130
 rinse because because like me 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.560
 Now I will paste over anything 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.990
 paste over a mug and did not buy them 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.480
 by the way on the aliexpress member and only 12 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.280
 days their cost is there 100 or 150 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.040
 rubles in general is quite inexpensive 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.230
 I advise you to take them well rather advise 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.360
 what is not the only thing that I do not really 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.490
 liked what the seller did not put 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.740
 me yutubovsky stickers ie stickers 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.440
 with the youtube logo it's not so scary 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:59.310
 and I think if I want I will order either 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.050
 I will say print out because well, figs with her 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.570
 I have a reason to send a new year after all 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.060
 parcel received almost in the new 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.650
 year and in general it makes me happy 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.830
 because I did not expect that there will be so much 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.450
 characters I can recognize by 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.310
 assurance seller by the way with these 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.350
 Stickers can do almost anything 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.489
 please pasted over your car with them 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.470
 computer anywhere glue here 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.650
 the only doubt I have is just 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.800
 about the fact that here these stickers with 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.019
 water conflict will be but judging because 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.110
 The seller writes that this is a sticker then 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.060
 I think they will be principle do not care but 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.430
 the only thing I know is that 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.130
 cars I honestly say no fan at all in 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.110
 cars are overlaid with special machines 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.360
 such already blanks on which 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.050
 printed out a bunch of glued stickers 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.690
 they glue the stickers one by one 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.250
 This is also a dubious offer, but I 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.950
 I think it is quite in 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.270
 for this business, they stick next from easy here 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.480
 how will they bully 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.070
 I do not know, but in time we will know, but for now 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.320
 that I am satisfied with everything and the seller 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.360
 gets a solid fours worth me 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.400
 the lamp that is creating now has come 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.980
 such a warm atmosphere but she 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.720
 For some reason, I have glitches constantly 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.520
 apparently somewhere she is carotid i will 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.720
 soon to deal with it now 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.850
 such are dear friends all in 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.560
