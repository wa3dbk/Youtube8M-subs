00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:08.349
 The Isley Ocha is here to introduce this time 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:11.889
 Plex mini break gunner Yes The handle and door location of the same plex last time 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:15.099
 I introduced it, but it would be nice if both were great 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:20.370
 Front side corde back is always how to play 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.370
 We will review if we bought for around 800 yen this time 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:31.780
 Yes then let's open that package is compact but 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:35.350
 Yes Nappa actually contains two and porridge 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.940
 Painted beautiful break gunner body and 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:44.149
 In the case of chaser spider Where Oh 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:52.010
 Let's take a look at Blake Gunner First of all, it looks like this 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:57.710
 Metallic purple color is insanely beautiful Yes in front of the upper and lower side 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.960
 There is also a trust mark and the color coding of this area is also fine 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.409
 so 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:10.950
 The mold that goes to the manufacturer of the grip part is also firmly designed 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.670
 I feel that has in it there is also a place where the shift car is quite compact with three fingers quarrel 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.290
 is not it 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:21.100
 The trigger can be played properly and compared to deluxe 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:26.440
 I ca n't come, I guess this is ugly 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:30.880
 I thought it was a bit small, but because the deluxe board is a 4 finger batch 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:35.920
 If you think so , rex number is not compact to feel good 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.280
 Yes , it feels like it's really small as compared 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.479
 And switch 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:47.930
 High insanely recall to contains a spring part 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:49.070
 No, this is no more complaints compared to 300 yen Blake Gunner. 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.310
 About the size difference 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:57.869
 I know this, but the plex version is all 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:04.320
 Shipping and body so it looks like this 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:05.220
 Most of the colors are viewed as silver compared to the upper and lower sides, but the feeling of color is great 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.259
 it's close 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:13.300
 Because there is no run around four wheels but there is a part here 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:19.570
 Liver be set to as break Gunner of the Deluxe Edition 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:24.490
 Because this is also a sukasuka by pressing the switch of the child again firmly 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:30.790
 6 I can not get it even if I get down or pull 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.810
 Of course, the sound it must But also quality high this time since the switch-related feel great 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.290

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:39.980
 1 series door child 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.909
 It's a bit more compact compared to this much Polyam de Haan d'Or in comparison 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.420
 of course 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:49.060
 Soil power to remove it 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:52.110
 You can also chat to other toys and 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.560
 It is also ok for shift breath 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:02.400
 It introduced the mini-break Gunner yes good toilet plex 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:08.910
 There is no dissatisfaction in the design part and the feel of switches etc. 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:11.280
 Plexes dropped without the meat urinal Toka true even compared to Yoroibu-related play Kusuga 6 ultra 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.100
