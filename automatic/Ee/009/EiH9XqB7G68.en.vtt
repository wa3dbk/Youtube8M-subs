00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.370 

this<00:00:03.060> comes<00:00:03.300> from<00:00:03.449> free-handing<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.170> little

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
this comes from free-handing a little

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.470 
this comes from free-handing a little
bit<00:00:04.500> of<00:00:04.589> this<00:00:04.680> in<00:00:04.859> here<00:00:05.040> it's<00:00:05.250> not<00:00:05.480> exactly

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
bit of this in here it's not exactly

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.310 
bit of this in here it's not exactly
like<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:07.109> reference<00:00:07.620> but<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.849> then<00:00:09.230> then<00:00:10.230> I

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
like the reference but and then then I

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.839 
like the reference but and then then I
look<00:00:10.530> at<00:00:10.679> how<00:00:10.860> long<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.490> look<00:00:11.730> at<00:00:11.790> how

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
look at how long this is look at how

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.169 
look at how long this is look at how
short<00:00:12.330> my<00:00:12.540> Nia's<00:00:12.809> here<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.530> how<00:00:14.099> long<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.880> is

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
short my Nia's here and how long this is

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.400 
short my Nia's here and how long this is
well<00:00:16.080> let's<00:00:16.770> drag<00:00:17.369> out<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.880> old<00:00:20.600> divider<00:00:21.600> and

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
well let's drag out the old divider and

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.620 
well let's drag out the old divider and
we'll<00:00:23.130> take<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> look<00:00:23.760> at<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.240> distance

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
we'll take a look at the distance

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.220 
we'll take a look at the distance
between<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:25.199> thumb<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.449> this<00:00:27.449> finger<00:00:27.779> at

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
between this thumb and this finger at

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.259 
between this thumb and this finger at
the<00:00:28.529> ring<00:00:28.740> anywhere<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.699> think<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.090> can

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the ring anywhere you think you can

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.010 
the ring anywhere you think you can
identify<00:00:30.630> well<00:00:31.460> take<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.850> then<00:00:33.660> look<00:00:33.840> for

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
identify well take it and then look for

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.930 
identify well take it and then look for
an<00:00:34.079> equivalent<00:00:34.380> where<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.130> an<00:00:35.250> equivalent<00:00:35.760> oh

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
an equivalent where is an equivalent oh

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.170 
an equivalent where is an equivalent oh
look<00:00:36.630> at<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.780> right<00:00:37.530> there<00:00:37.640> so<00:00:38.640> if<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.969> have

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
look at that right there so if I have

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.229 
look at that right there so if I have
this<00:00:39.410> structured<00:00:40.410> properly<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.160> should<00:00:42.149> be

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
this structured properly I should be

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.549 
this structured properly I should be
able<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.510> come<00:00:42.690> up<00:00:42.719> from<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.110> edge<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
able to come up from that edge of the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.490 
able to come up from that edge of the
finger<00:00:44.390> and<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.510> should<00:00:45.719> now<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:46.079> able<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.320> come

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
finger and I should now be able to come

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.680 
finger and I should now be able to come
over<00:00:46.530> here<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.340> look<00:00:47.550> at<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.879> look<00:00:48.420> at<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
over here and look at that look at the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.439 
over here and look at that look at the
distance<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.739> different<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:51.300> found

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
distance that is different I just found

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.600 
distance that is different I just found
out<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> real<00:00:51.960> key<00:00:52.230> element<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.070> now<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:53.489> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
out a real key element so now I have to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.119 
out a real key element so now I have to
figure<00:00:53.730> out<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.420> know<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:55.050> well<00:00:55.800> what

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
figure out you know I can well what

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.700 
figure out you know I can well what
happened<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.960> too<00:00:58.140> long<00:00:58.410> that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
happened is that this is too long that

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.430 
happened is that this is too long that
fingers<00:00:59.100> too<00:00:59.250> long<00:00:59.489> or<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.719> one's<00:01:00.930> too<00:01:01.170> long

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
fingers too long or this one's too long

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.230 
fingers too long or this one's too long
well<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.699> very<00:01:02.969> possible<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:03.870> both

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
well it's very possible that it's both

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.920 
well it's very possible that it's both
so<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> often<00:01:07.110> will<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.830> oh<00:01:08.100> shoot<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
so I often will do this oh shoot a

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.810 
so I often will do this oh shoot a
little<00:01:09.930> dark<00:01:10.189> part<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.570> often<00:01:12.570> do<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:13.820> it's

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
little dark part I often do this it's

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.020 
little dark part I often do this it's
very<00:01:14.939> easy<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:16.110> miss<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.400> edge<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.790> something

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
very easy to miss the edge of something

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.280 
very easy to miss the edge of something
by<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.420> width<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.259> pencil<00:01:19.290> line<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:22.020> so

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
by the width of a pencil line and so

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.880 
by the width of a pencil line and so
I'll<00:01:22.560> take<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.240> good<00:01:24.240> width<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.200> pencil<00:01:25.229> off

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
I'll take a good width of a pencil off

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:47.929 
I'll take a good width of a pencil off
here<00:01:26.869> shorten<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:27.990> up

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.020 

and<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.960> will<00:01:49.170> shorten<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.680> one<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:50.030> and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and I will shorten this one up and

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.969 
and I will shorten this one up and
that's<00:01:51.329> probably<00:01:51.719> how<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.350> got<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.560> little<00:01:52.829> too

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
that's probably how it got a little too

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:01.190 
that's probably how it got a little too
much<00:01:58.070> it's<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.789> little<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:01.079> know

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
much it's just a little on this you know

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.529 
much it's just a little on this you know
a<00:02:01.229> little<00:02:01.470> on<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:04.789> probably<00:02:05.789> and

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
a little on that so this is probably and

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.540 
a little on that so this is probably and
then<00:02:06.929> I<00:02:07.380> have<00:02:07.590> maybe<00:02:07.740> have<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.039> clue<00:02:08.220> well<00:02:08.399> this

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
then I have maybe have a clue well this

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.180 
then I have maybe have a clue well this
is<00:02:08.700> I'm<00:02:09.030> bulging<00:02:09.599> way<00:02:09.720> out<00:02:09.899> here<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.380> this<00:02:10.920> is

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
is I'm bulging way out here this this is

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.520 
is I'm bulging way out here this this is
the<00:02:11.430> most<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.480> left<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.019> looking<00:02:13.380> at

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
the most to the left is that looking at

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.130 
the most to the left is that looking at
this<00:02:13.739> right<00:02:14.430> there<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:14.880> they're<00:02:15.599> here<00:02:15.989> on

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
this right there and they're here on

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.680 
this right there and they're here on
this<00:02:16.650> one<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.610> most<00:02:17.819> of<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> left<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.540> right

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
this one the most of the left is right

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.960 
this one the most of the left is right
there<00:02:18.930> at<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.140> toe<00:02:20.030> at<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.299> place<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
there at that toe at that place that the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.220 
there at that toe at that place that the
that<00:02:23.970> space<00:02:24.269> starts<00:02:26.480> well<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.510> think<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:28.049> may

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
that space starts well I think I may

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.670 
that space starts well I think I may
have<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:29.180> solved<00:02:30.180> my<00:02:30.299> problem<00:02:30.750> or<00:02:31.200> at<00:02:31.410> least

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
have just solved my problem or at least

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.050 
have just solved my problem or at least
I<00:02:31.890> will<00:02:32.099> minimize<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:34.489> maybe<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:35.610> don't<00:02:35.700> want<00:02:36.000> to

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
I will minimize it maybe I don't want to

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.830 
I will minimize it maybe I don't want to
do<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.209> wholesale<00:02:37.819> renovation<00:02:38.819> what<00:02:39.720> I'm

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
do a wholesale renovation what I'm

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.699 
do a wholesale renovation what I'm
drawing<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.630> some<00:02:43.079> of<00:02:43.110> my<00:02:43.200> angles<00:02:43.620> are

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
drawing and so some of my angles are

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.289 
drawing and so some of my angles are
changing<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.190> little<00:02:44.250> bit<00:02:44.489> here<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.000> can<00:02:45.150> go

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
changing a little bit here and I can go

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.530 
changing a little bit here and I can go
ahead<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.630> tweak<00:02:45.870> those<00:02:46.140> as<00:02:46.319> well<00:02:47.540> making

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
ahead and tweak those as well making

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.530 
ahead and tweak those as well making
sure<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.019> still<00:02:49.380> have<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.769> same<00:02:51.859> angle

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
sure that I still have the same angle

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.759 
sure that I still have the same angle
okay<00:02:54.540> let's<00:02:54.810> see<00:02:54.989> where<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.350> comes<00:02:55.650> from

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
okay let's see where this comes from

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.630 
okay let's see where this comes from
them<00:02:57.530> know<00:02:58.530> they're<00:02:59.069> almost<00:02:59.220> out<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.519> the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
them know they're almost out of the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.930 
them know they're almost out of the
picture<00:02:59.880> but<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.060> think<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.269> can<00:03:00.420> see<00:03:00.720> whatever

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.660 

okay<00:03:08.450> look<00:03:09.450> at<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:10.040> pretty<00:03:11.040> much<00:03:11.340> took<00:03:11.609> care

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
okay look at that pretty much took care

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.100 
okay look at that pretty much took care
of<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.329> think<00:03:13.170> that's<00:03:13.500> pretty<00:03:13.680> exciting
