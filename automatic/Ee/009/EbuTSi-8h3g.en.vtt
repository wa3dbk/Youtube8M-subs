 modified the skin and the modeling of 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.650

 trading with them okay there's no 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.379

 that they are pretty enough villagers

 complicated to kill worth good we're going to 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:04.070
 to give chicha to the oven, let's put 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:07.570
 some spiders we are going to put some zombies and 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:12.170
 some slides I think I line them I do not know if 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.750
 they do something they do not attack them they just attack me 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.900
 they only touch me because they are 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.790
 evil the slams well we have some 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.690
 spider the spider so set yourself like me 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:29.800
 get everyone joins together the 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.240
 villagers to to make the 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.020
 your good we're going to make it from 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.860
 guarded night guarded majos 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.510
 we have already finished the eyebrow men 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.720
 with this good protection out there 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.720
 they start to come out of all the bugs 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.470
 all the colors is worth seeing this 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.450
 happens here and what's happening is good 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.030
 let's in principle they should get 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.790
 everyone in their houses yes yes they are already 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.430
 all under the roof and good here 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.870
 we have the first one we are going to put some 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.470
 how many 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:09.780
 and here we have the first one who is 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.780
 going on let's make some noise 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:18.810
 we are going to pay no or are two against one what 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.020
 they are going to kill they have killed him or they have 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.510
 have converted it to see a 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.940
 did with good three well I think that 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.420
 they have understood it well in principle 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:35.220
 with this protection should not 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:38.070
 get to kill the villagers today we go 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.710
 to get these villagers out of here 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.340
 low to which defend defend 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.530
 defend 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.069
 no but these villagers do not have skin 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.970
 they are going to kill them they are going to kill 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.920
 mother via or plan have transformed it 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.019
 well let's go to do 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.970
 my mother but you are if we are 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.790
 eating this is not how you have to 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.160
 work wrong is that they are many are 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.690
 many malignant but in principle when 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.690
 these people are away from home 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.380
 it's worth it in many ways that there 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.750
 set to protect the principle well 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.590
 does not have that nothing should happen 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.380
 although I am being commissioned 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.220
 population of villagers but good here in 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.890
 little by little, my 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.520

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.990

 to take your rotten meat well then 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.290
 this is what the mod already brings 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.690
 You can see the planting and everything goes to 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.120
 to do exactly the same is worth this 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.800
 generated automatically is compatible 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.960

 where you put version for 1.5 point 1 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.280
 We opened in a new tab and we were 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.720
 open a mediafire tab and what 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.500
 we download vale we leave it in the 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.590
 desk 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.500
 now we will leave 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.940
 let's see what it costs a bit 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.490
 we go 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.320

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.390
 desk I have it here what we're going 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.600
 to do is going to be decompress this 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:47.620
 file and is a must 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.080
 that you download forge we return 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.169
 here the mod does not specify that we have 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.840
 have a version of forge 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.270
 in a version of forge installed to 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.490
 from 6 to 22, that is , if you have 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.870
 a version of forge installed 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.759
 previously it is recommended that 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.789
 let's delete your point folder 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:09.379
 minecraft and explode the new forge 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.029
 ok you have a video tutorial right here 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.740
 above that tells us how to make way for 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:16.909
 step if you want to go through them 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.099
 you know well how it is done and well what 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:20.449
 said we also unpack the forge 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.039
 that you have it in the link in the 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.800
 description we go to our folder 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:26.749
 from minecraft to the bin folder and in the 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.120
 minecraft file minecraft dot hard 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:30.740
 we open it with winrar with wifi with 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.779
 the seven cit with the one you want is worth 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.610
 the decompressor that you want we copy 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:39.680
 first all the contents of the folder 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.860
 forge and then copied the 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.419
 content of the defense folder 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.939
 we finally deleted the meta folder and 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.249
 pnv and close we can run 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:52.180

 in the mods tab it will not appear 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.849
 nothing we have to enter the game is worth and 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.249
 here in the game is where we're going to see the 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.159

 and millions of villagers who feast that 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.090
 feast welcome to the installation of 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.220
 defensive villagers for minecraft the 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.260
 version 1.5 point one for multiplayer 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.139
 we go to the point minecraft page 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.000
 net and the download tab for the 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.710
 server download voucher bat 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.830
 we download this file we give to 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.990
 save keeps it on the desk 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:42.120
 here we have it and we are going to create a 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:44.520
 folder with the server name here 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.190
 server 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.990
 bill ayers well I'm afraid so how do you 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.539
 pronounce we put the minecraft server 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.490
 we execute it here and what it does 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:56.580
 right now this little screen is to create us 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.690
 a server until it puts us down a 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.180
 Once you have put us in , we can do it 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.250
 close if you notice we have created many 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.169
 more files worth this would be the map the 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.360
 uai list server properties 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:07.530
 to be ope et cetera et cetera if os 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.180
 you want to learn a little more about how 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.620
 create a server you have a video here 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.470
 the left above that tells us how 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.169
 do it right and to play with you 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.240
 friends in the machi and such and ready once 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:19.590
 that we already have it with the file that 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.389
 let's work is going to be with this one with 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.680
 the minecraft server the same thing we're going to 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:25.710
 do the same process as before 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.690
 open with a decompressor and dump 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.480
 all the content 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:33.470
 the first of forge 

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:35.210
 and second of the way we dump it here 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.890
 inside as it is a server there is no 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.460
 delete the folder me times' 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:42.350
 so we close and execute now it 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.510
 create a series of folders and a series 

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.010
 of files after installation 

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.350
 ok that are necessary this is very 

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.900
 necessary to have it for him for the server 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.550
 it's worth it if you want to install some other 

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.110
 way and good it costs a little bit 

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.970
 start now the same will come out here 

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.560
 screen that has come out before but you 

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.880
 it costs there already we have it costs it a 

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.800
 little start but once you 

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.360
 jazz vale starts already we have it already 

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.250
 put tone we have it ready 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.810
 riot installed on our server and 

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.160
 well, you only need to give the ip to 

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.720
