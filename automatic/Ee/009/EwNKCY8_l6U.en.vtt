00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.629
 Now we will prepare hot sandwiches 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.570
 with ham for breakfast that us 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.759
 need we need a loaf 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.679
 better not to take that already sliced and 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.929
 it is better to take a whole and cut yourself 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.750
 should which are sold cut it 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:25.199
 very thin pieces 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:27.590
 ham cheese i already rubbed on and mayonnaise and 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.580
 any ketchup tomato sauce doesn't matter 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.099
 the only thing is that it was not 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.360
 fasting and vegetable oil in order 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.690
 to put a piece on a griddle 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.030
 loaf grease it 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.030
 anzhi you have in this case adjika 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:54.800
 you can even order power burl 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:58.010
 meanings that you like more you put 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.500
 smeared again thickness 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:07.710
 adzhiki cage all depends on your 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:11.010
 taste put so here I have such 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:17.280
 immediately cut into large pieces to 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.590
 almost completely closed on i'm 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.549
 poured mayonnaise because i'm filming not 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:28.619
 comfortable with one hand 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:32.450
 smearing this mayonnaise over the ham so 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:37.970
 here we form evenly I left 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.970
 evenly spread and sprinkle with cheese 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.770
 will cook the pan at all 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.250
 There are of course many ways 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.950
 cooking one way is in the oven 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.510
 but I do not know who is hunting 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.810
 reheat the oven and if you still something 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:00.190
 lies it all get out to me personally 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.000
 laziness can then be done in the microwave 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.950
 oven to melt cheese but again 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.500
 then the bread will not be toasted here in 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.520
 my case will be bread and toasted cheese 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.680
 will melt and I will still use 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.120
 Here is such a seasoning 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.950
 sprinkle on top of cheese and I'll pepper 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.050
 generally generally use seasoning for 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.930
 pizza on it and written seasoning for 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.230
 pizza basically the ingredients are all the same 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.490
 the most sense is almost the same it turns out 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.750
 ok I made two more sandwiches 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.640
 now we are laying on the pan 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.000
 yes where we already have one 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:48.430
 I made three because it's not here anymore. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.070
 fit in here and now main 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.760
 when not a little fried we need 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.080
 it will be a little to pour boiled water 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.239
 frying pan on the shoulder this case is covered 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.170
 then they will be both crisp and 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:06.090
 melted cheese here take a kettle now 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.090
 and pour some water 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.730
 here we are 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:30.590
 sandwiches as you see cheese melted 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.340
 there is no water left in the pan now 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.000
 will be 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.000
 lay out 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.960
 it feels so tight 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.960
 I'll try to show you 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.390
 I think if anything 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.620
 some of 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.160
 such
