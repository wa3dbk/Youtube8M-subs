00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.159 
hoping that if I put it over the hot
pink<00:04:16.919> bedspread<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:18.000> it<00:04:18.209> will<00:04:18.449> not<00:04:19.109> show

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
pink bedspread that it will not show

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.600 
pink bedspread that it will not show
through<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:21.440> then<00:04:22.440> i'd<00:04:22.860> like<00:04:23.099> to<00:04:23.250> get<00:04:23.370> either

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.520 
through and then i'd like to get either
purple<00:04:24.120> sheets<00:04:24.360> or<00:04:24.630> gray<00:04:24.840> sheets<00:04:25.200> or

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
purple sheets or gray sheets or

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.520 
purple sheets or gray sheets or
black<00:04:25.740> sheets<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:27.450> bedspread<00:04:27.930> has<00:04:28.170> kind<00:04:28.500> of

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
black sheets the bedspread has kind of

black sheets the bedspread has kind of
those<00:04:28.740> tones<00:04:29.160> so<00:04:29.610> any<00:04:30.000> of<00:04:30.210> those<00:04:30.330> would<00:04:30.570> be

seemed<00:06:00.570> to<00:06:00.660> do<00:06:00.870> it<00:06:01.050> so<00:06:01.410> my<00:06:02.310> next<00:06:02.580> plan<00:06:02.850> of

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
seemed to do it so my next plan of

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:09.020 
seemed to do it so my next plan of
action<00:06:03.419> is<00:06:03.750> to<00:06:03.890> buy<00:06:04.890> a<00:06:06.530> weightlifting<00:06:07.530> DVD<00:06:08.039> so

action is to buy a weightlifting DVD so

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.150 
action is to buy a weightlifting DVD so
I'm<00:06:09.390> thinking<00:06:09.810> with<00:06:09.990> the<00:06:10.140> DVD<00:06:10.560> at<00:06:10.740> least<00:06:10.950> it'll

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
I'm thinking with the DVD at least it'll

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.700 
I'm thinking with the DVD at least it'll
be<00:06:11.220> interactive<00:06:11.940> and<00:06:12.240> timed<00:06:13.080> and<00:06:14.690> so<00:06:15.710> that's

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
be interactive and timed and so that's

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.040 
be interactive and timed and so that's
my<00:06:16.950> next<00:06:17.130> goal<00:06:17.400> so<00:06:18.090> while<00:06:18.510> I'm<00:06:18.630> out<00:06:18.750> about<00:06:18.990> I
