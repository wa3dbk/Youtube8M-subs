like right-click the ground and you'll

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.490 
like right-click the ground and you'll
make<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.660> marshmallow<00:02:15.110> block<00:02:15.650> so

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500

the candy cane takes damage like any
other<00:02:20.070> tool<00:02:20.370> would<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:21.480> think<00:02:22.020> goes<00:02:22.260> pretty

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
other tool would I think goes pretty

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.250 
other tool would I think goes pretty
quickly<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:22.980> let's<00:02:23.940> just<00:02:24.120> make<00:02:24.240> us<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:24.900> four

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
quickly so let's just make us like four

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.920 
quickly so let's just make us like four
marshmallow<00:02:25.710> blocks<00:02:26.010> here<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:27.480> then<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:27.780> can
