fpv quad first run since we've upgraded
the<00:00:11.039> camera<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:12.530> 600<00:00:13.530> million<00:00:13.680> wat

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
the camera and the 600 million wat

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.540 
the camera and the 600 million wat
immersion<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.959> TX<00:00:16.760> so<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.600> fat<00:00:19.020> shark

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
immersion is TX so this is the fat shark

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.870 
immersion is TX so this is the fat shark

HD pilot or pilot h usually say
so<00:00:24.539> as<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.960> can<00:00:25.050> tell<00:00:25.109> with<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.560> footage<00:00:25.890> not

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
so as you can tell with the footage not

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.490 
so as you can tell with the footage not
all<00:00:26.669> plagues<00:00:27.060> can't<00:00:27.509> tell<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.109> can<00:00:28.289> see

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
all plagues can't tell what you can see

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.140 
all plagues can't tell what you can see
it's<00:00:28.890> not<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.220> best<00:00:29.340> footage<00:00:29.640> I'm<00:00:29.880> not

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
it's not the best footage I'm not

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.740 
it's not the best footage I'm not
exactly<00:00:30.869> happy<00:00:31.109> with<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:32.449> after<00:00:33.449> i<00:00:33.480> got<00:00:33.690> home

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
exactly happy with it after i got home

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.720 
exactly happy with it after i got home
when<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.260> did<00:00:34.470> it<00:00:34.559> once<00:00:34.710> over<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.129> things<00:00:35.399> i

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
when I did it once over on things i

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.750 
when I did it once over on things i
think<00:00:36.300> i<00:00:36.570> got<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.350> good<00:00:37.800> fifty<00:00:38.280> percent<00:00:38.519> of<00:00:38.670> it

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
think i got a good fifty percent of it

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.100 
think i got a good fifty percent of it
fixed<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.719> lens<00:00:40.019> itself<00:00:40.290> wasn't<00:00:40.769> focused<00:00:41.309> in

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
fixed the lens itself wasn't focused in

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.329 
fixed the lens itself wasn't focused in
so<00:00:43.110> i<00:00:43.140> just<00:00:43.409> do<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.829> never<00:00:44.040> thought<00:00:44.309> nothing

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
so i just do it in never thought nothing

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.460 
so i just do it in never thought nothing
of<00:00:44.760> its<00:00:44.970> first<00:00:45.300> time<00:00:45.449> i've<00:00:45.600> ever<00:00:45.629> had<00:00:45.839> a<00:00:45.900> ccd

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
of its first time i've ever had a ccd

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.530 
of its first time i've ever had a ccd
camera<00:00:46.829> like<00:00:46.949> this<00:00:47.750> so<00:00:49.640> once<00:00:50.640> i<00:00:50.790> got<00:00:50.940> home<00:00:51.000> a

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
camera like this so once i got home a

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.530 
camera like this so once i got home a
couple<00:00:51.949> twists<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.339> we're<00:00:53.640> back<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.059> focused

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
couple twists and we're back and focused

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.259 
couple twists and we're back and focused
so<00:00:54.750> now<00:00:54.930> yes<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.100> vibration<00:00:56.580> but<00:00:56.879> that

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
so now yes there is vibration but that

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.899 
so now yes there is vibration but that
is<00:00:57.420> not<00:00:57.540> focused<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.170> helped<00:00:58.650> either<00:00:58.909> and

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
is not focused that helped either and

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.880 
is not focused that helped either and
when<00:01:00.330> it<00:01:00.449> comes<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.720> the<00:01:00.809> vibration<00:01:01.500> given

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
when it comes to the vibration given

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.469 
when it comes to the vibration given
that<00:01:02.009> I<00:01:02.070> wasn't<00:01:02.280> running<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.640> GoPro<00:01:03.089> I<00:01:03.210> tried

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
that I wasn't running the GoPro I tried

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.270 
that I wasn't running the GoPro I tried
to<00:01:03.600> move<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:03.780> battery<00:01:04.199> more<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> front<00:01:04.979> of

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
to move the battery more to the front of

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.160 
to move the battery more to the front of
the<00:01:05.369> chassis<00:01:05.610> versus<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.509> the<00:01:06.630> rear<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:07.110> a

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
the chassis versus to the rear with a

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.710 
the chassis versus to the rear with a
GoPro<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> counteract<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.520> weight<00:01:08.720> that

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
GoPro to counteract with the weight that

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.510 
GoPro to counteract with the weight that
being<00:01:10.020> said<00:01:10.229> when<00:01:10.770> i<00:01:10.799> move<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> battery<00:01:11.400> up

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
being said when i move the battery up

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.950 
being said when i move the battery up
front<00:01:11.759> i<00:01:11.820> think<00:01:12.000> i<00:01:12.060> moved<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.390> up<00:01:12.509> a<00:01:12.659> little<00:01:12.810> bit

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
front i think i moved it up a little bit

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.319 
front i think i moved it up a little bit
too<00:01:13.110> close<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.890> little<00:01:14.700> plate<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
too close so a little plate with the

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:16.969 
too close so a little plate with the
little<00:01:15.630> rubber<00:01:15.780> grommets<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.619> supposed<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
little rubber grommets it's supposed to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.830 
little rubber grommets it's supposed to
take<00:01:17.159> some<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.490> vibrational<00:01:18.150> well<00:01:18.390> wasn't

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
take some that vibrational well wasn't

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.899 
take some that vibrational well wasn't
able<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.140> work<00:01:19.290> as<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.680> had<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.280> battery

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
able to work as I had the battery

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.080 
able to work as I had the battery
matched<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.890> and<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:23.280> that's<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.670> what<00:01:23.970> it

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
matched on it and if that's not what it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.910 
matched on it and if that's not what it
is<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.540> might<00:01:24.720> have<00:01:24.840> developed<00:01:24.960> some<00:01:25.350> vibration

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
is I might have developed some vibration

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.620 
is I might have developed some vibration
somewhere<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.460> quad<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.759> again<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:27.600> that

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
somewhere in the quad and again if that

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.870 
somewhere in the quad and again if that
may<00:01:28.020> not<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.319> it<00:01:28.619> could<00:01:29.009> potentially<00:01:29.130> be<00:01:29.640> that

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
may not be it could potentially be that

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.929 
may not be it could potentially be that
the<00:01:30.149> plate<00:01:30.869> itself<00:01:31.249> needs<00:01:32.249> a<00:01:32.490> little<00:01:32.609> bit<00:01:32.759> more

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the plate itself needs a little bit more

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.179 
the plate itself needs a little bit more
weight<00:01:33.179> so<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.539> GoPro<00:01:33.929> itself<00:01:34.350> with<00:01:34.679> vibrate

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
weight so the GoPro itself with vibrate

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.209 
weight so the GoPro itself with vibrate
by<00:01:35.429> side<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.030> side<00:01:36.439> which<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:38.009> rubber

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
by side to side which the rubber

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.250 
by side to side which the rubber
grommets<00:01:38.700> would<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> reactant

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
grommets would a reactant

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.660 
grommets would a reactant
eat<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.770> vibration<00:01:41.340> where's<00:01:41.520> this

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
eat up that vibration where's this

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.670 
eat up that vibration where's this
camera<00:01:42.060> being<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.390> small<00:01:42.690> maybe<00:01:43.050> that<00:01:43.440> you

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
camera being so small maybe that you

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.880 
camera being so small maybe that you
know<00:01:43.830> it<00:01:43.920> doesn't<00:01:44.810> give<00:01:45.810> much<00:01:46.080> side-to-side

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
know it doesn't give much side-to-side

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.710 
know it doesn't give much side-to-side
Lee<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.340> don't<00:01:47.640> know<00:01:47.700> that's<00:01:47.880> my<00:01:48.090> conclusion<00:01:48.300> on

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
Lee I don't know that's my conclusion on

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.800 
Lee I don't know that's my conclusion on
it<00:01:48.900> I<00:01:49.370> got<00:01:50.370> that<00:01:50.580> figured<00:01:50.790> out<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.210> now<00:01:51.390> we'll

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
it I got that figured out for now we'll

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.180 
it I got that figured out for now we'll
take<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.110> out<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:52.350> another<00:01:52.470> flight<00:01:52.830> tomorrow

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
take it out for another flight tomorrow

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.430
