00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
did know make a week on the week that it

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.059 
did know make a week on the week that it
was<00:03:08.599> supposed<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:08.900> be<00:03:08.989> done<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.410> that<00:03:09.739> was

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
was supposed to be done and that was

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.330 
was supposed to be done and that was
Bruce<00:03:10.630> Michael<00:03:11.630> did<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.900> next<00:03:12.079> week<00:03:12.319> so<00:03:12.709> that's

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
Bruce Michael did it next week so that's

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.699 
Bruce Michael did it next week so that's
fair<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:13.790> him<00:03:13.940> but<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.870> rest<00:03:15.079> of<00:03:15.230> us<00:03:15.290> didn't<00:03:15.590> do

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
fair to him but the rest of us didn't do

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.050 
fair to him but the rest of us didn't do
it<00:03:15.829> so<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.010> don't<00:03:16.340> think<00:03:16.519> it's<00:03:16.640> really<00:03:16.849> fair<00:03:16.880> to

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
it so I don't think it's really fair to

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.270 
it so I don't think it's really fair to
just<00:03:17.329> call<00:03:17.540> me<00:03:17.720> out<00:03:17.750> for<00:03:17.870> not<00:03:18.200> doing<00:03:18.560> that<00:03:18.590> the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
length video on it you can look it up

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.390 
length video on it you can look it up
I'll<00:03:30.079> put<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.290> link<00:03:30.440> down<00:03:30.500> there<00:03:30.799> if<00:03:30.920> I<00:03:31.010> can<00:03:31.220> find

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
I'll put a link down there if I can find

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.860 
I'll put a link down there if I can find
it<00:03:31.609> but<00:03:31.790> it's<00:03:31.940> definitely<00:03:32.180> there<00:03:32.480> I

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
it but it's definitely there I

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.660 
it but it's definitely there I
definitely<00:03:33.350> did<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.280> reason<00:03:34.430> why<00:03:34.639> I

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
definitely did it and the reason why I

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.539 
definitely did it and the reason why I
didn't<00:03:34.910> booty<00:03:35.120> shake<00:03:35.359> is<00:03:35.980> probably<00:03:36.980> because<00:03:37.220> I

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
didn't booty shake is probably because I

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.940 
didn't booty shake is probably because I
might<00:03:38.000> be<00:03:38.180> 16<00:03:38.630> years<00:03:38.810> old<00:03:39.049> and<00:03:39.319> I<00:03:39.380> might<00:03:39.769> or

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
might be 16 years old and I might or

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.860 
might be 16 years old and I might or
might<00:03:39.980> not<00:03:40.250> have<00:03:40.819> my<00:03:41.030> school<00:03:41.239> administrators

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.229 
might not have my school administrators
watching<00:03:42.680> these<00:03:42.829> videos<00:03:43.010> so<00:03:43.730> i<00:03:43.790> might<00:03:43.940> have<00:03:44.180> to

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
watching these videos so i might have to

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
sort of leads me to believe that there's

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.570 
sort of leads me to believe that there's
other<00:05:46.110> reasons<00:05:46.379> why<00:05:47.129> people<00:05:47.310> want<00:05:47.520> to
