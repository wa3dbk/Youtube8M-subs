00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
the N trig pen it's oh the other thing

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.509 
the N trig pen it's oh the other thing
you're<00:02:14.739> asking<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.370> see<00:02:16.200> where<00:02:17.200> did<00:02:17.650> my<00:02:17.980> marker

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
you're asking to see where did my marker

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
go I must have turned it off

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.500 
go I must have turned it off
sorry<00:02:22.989> pen<00:02:23.830> settings<00:02:24.150> here<00:02:25.150> we'll<00:02:25.299> put<00:02:25.420> the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
sorry pen settings here we'll put the

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.650 
sorry pen settings here we'll put the
pressure<00:02:25.690> sensitivity<00:02:26.260> on<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.769> you<00:02:26.830> can<00:02:27.010> see

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
pressure sensitivity on and you can see

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.830 
pressure sensitivity on and you can see
going<00:02:28.660> from<00:02:29.080> thin<00:02:29.380> lines<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:30.489> thicker<00:02:30.730> so<00:02:31.569> that

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
going from thin lines to thicker so that

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.570 
going from thin lines to thicker so that
is<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:33.580> pressure<00:02:33.850> sensitivity<00:02:34.299> of<00:02:34.720> this<00:02:34.900> pen

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
is the pressure sensitivity of this pen

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.150 
is the pressure sensitivity of this pen
in<00:02:36.580> Windows<00:02:37.000> Journal<00:02:37.830> another<00:02:38.830> neat<00:02:39.130> thing

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
in Windows Journal another neat thing

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.410 
in Windows Journal another neat thing
this<00:02:39.459> one<00:02:39.670> comes<00:02:39.880> with<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.150> take<00:02:40.299> advantage

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
this one comes with the take advantage

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.289 
this one comes with the take advantage
of<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.019> touch<00:02:41.470> capabilities<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.580> is<00:02:42.730> right

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
of the touch capabilities of it is right

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.059 
of the touch capabilities of it is right
now<00:02:43.510> they<00:02:43.750> have<00:02:44.019> it<00:02:44.170> loaded<00:02:44.440> with<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.250> EXO<00:02:45.849> PC

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
now they have it loaded with the EXO PC

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.160 
now they have it loaded with the EXO PC
overlay<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:49.360> we<00:02:49.510> get<00:02:49.630> all<00:02:49.750> our<00:02:49.780> nice<00:02:50.019> little

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
overlay so we get all our nice little

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.960 
overlay so we get all our nice little
dots<00:02:50.500> of<00:02:50.709> things<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.040> this<00:02:51.099> is<00:02:51.160> multitasking

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
dots of things and this is multitasking

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.150 
dots of things and this is multitasking
if<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.180> open<00:02:52.450> something<00:02:52.690> new<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:53.590> opens<00:02:53.890> up<00:02:54.010> on

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
if I open something new it opens up on

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.449 
if I open something new it opens up on
the<00:02:54.280> side<00:02:54.489> and<00:02:55.239> everything<00:02:55.510> I<00:02:55.870> had<00:02:56.079> before<00:02:56.459> is

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
the side and everything I had before is

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.949 
the side and everything I had before is
still<00:02:57.760> right<00:02:57.940> there<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.180> can<00:02:58.420> flip<00:02:58.630> easily

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
still right there I can flip easily

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.140 
still right there I can flip easily
between<00:02:59.320> them<00:02:59.500> close<00:03:00.340> them<00:03:00.519> just<00:03:00.700> by<00:03:00.790> dragging

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
between them close them just by dragging

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.380 
between them close them just by dragging
them<00:03:01.209> off<00:03:01.359> the<00:03:01.540> side<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:03.070> something<00:03:03.310> new<00:03:03.609> very

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
them off the side and something new very

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.940 
them off the side and something new very
responsive<00:03:04.959> touch<00:03:05.109> even<00:03:05.380> for<00:03:05.530> pre-production

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
responsive touch even for pre-production

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.890 
responsive touch even for pre-production
this<00:03:06.459> is<00:03:06.609> still<00:03:06.850> just<00:03:06.880> pre-production<00:03:07.780> and

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
this is still just pre-production and

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.330 
this is still just pre-production and
they<00:03:07.959> tell<00:03:08.200> me<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.590> touch<00:03:08.769> will<00:03:08.980> improve

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
they tell me that the touch will improve

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.520 
they tell me that the touch will improve
even<00:03:09.819> more<00:03:10.030> from<00:03:10.930> what<00:03:11.049> you're<00:03:11.200> seeing<00:03:11.440> here

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
even more from what you're seeing here

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.440 
even more from what you're seeing here
the<00:03:11.799> calibrations<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.430> little<00:03:12.640> off<00:03:12.730> which<00:03:13.329> is

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
the calibrations a little off which is

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.780 
the calibrations a little off which is
why<00:03:13.569> I'm<00:03:13.660> missing<00:03:13.959> buttons<00:03:14.290> but<00:03:14.980> look<00:03:15.609> for

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
why I'm missing buttons but look for

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.030 
why I'm missing buttons but look for
this<00:03:15.940> touch<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.870> get<00:03:16.989> even<00:03:17.319> better<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.980> then

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
this touch to get even better and then

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:26.849 
this touch to get even better and then
this<00:03:18.940> is<00:03:20.069> a<00:03:23.519> four<00:03:24.519> point<00:03:24.989> multi-touch<00:03:25.989> capable

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
this is a four point multi-touch capable

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.120 
this is a four point multi-touch capable
so<00:03:27.549> all<00:03:28.150> four<00:03:28.480> fingers<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.680> will<00:03:29.799> see<00:03:29.950> them

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
so all four fingers and it will see them

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.550 
so all four fingers and it will see them
that<00:03:31.060> was<00:03:31.180> interesting<00:03:31.600> right<00:03:31.630> let's<00:03:32.410> try

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
that was interesting right let's try

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.280 
that was interesting right let's try
that<00:03:32.650> again<00:03:32.910> all<00:03:33.910> four<00:03:34.269> fingers<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:37.630> will<00:03:37.810> see

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
that again all four fingers it will see

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.500 
that again all four fingers it will see
oh<00:03:38.370> that's<00:03:39.370> just<00:03:39.519> not<00:03:39.730> gonna<00:03:39.910> cooperate<00:03:40.030> we'll

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
oh that's just not gonna cooperate we'll

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.930 
oh that's just not gonna cooperate we'll
play<00:03:40.660> with<00:03:40.780> that<00:03:40.900> some<00:03:41.079> other<00:03:41.230> time<00:03:41.940> don't

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
play with that some other time don't

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.390 
play with that some other time don't
save

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
save

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.949 
save
and<00:03:45.400> follow<00:03:45.819> they<00:03:45.939> also<00:03:46.090> we<00:03:46.330> dropped<00:03:46.599> a<00:03:46.689> video

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
and follow they also we dropped a video

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.839 
and follow they also we dropped a video
on<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:47.200> screen<00:03:47.379> so<00:03:47.620> you<00:03:47.709> can<00:03:47.739> see<00:03:48.010> video

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
on the screen so you can see video

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:56.059

playback on this is solid there they go

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.770 
playback on this is solid there they go
