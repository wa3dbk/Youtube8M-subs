00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
okay John here making this video I made

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.200 
okay John here making this video I made
another<00:00:04.560> cell<00:00:04.950> here<00:00:05.250> and<00:00:05.430> see<00:00:05.609> I<00:00:05.640> stuck<00:00:05.970> it<00:00:06.120> to

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
another cell here and see I stuck it to

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.940 
another cell here and see I stuck it to
the<00:00:06.359> piece<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:07.040> copper<00:00:08.040> circuit<00:00:08.610> board<00:00:08.820> here

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
the piece of copper circuit board here

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.499 
the piece of copper circuit board here
and<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:11.340> put<00:00:11.550> these<00:00:11.759> two<00:00:11.969> in<00:00:12.000> series<00:00:13.759> and<00:00:14.759> here's

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
and I put these two in series and here's

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.420 
and I put these two in series and here's
a<00:00:15.630> test<00:00:15.960> sample<00:00:17.060> of<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.300> material<00:00:18.980> and<00:00:19.980> then

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
a test sample of the material and then

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.529 
a test sample of the material and then
here<00:00:20.960> are<00:00:21.960> these<00:00:22.140> two<00:00:22.199> your<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.590> series<00:00:23.100> now<00:00:23.539> no

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
here are these two your in series now no

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.410 
here are these two your in series now no
matter<00:00:24.750> where<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.050> slide<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:29.060> you<00:00:30.060> can<00:00:30.240> just

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
matter where I slide this you can just

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.280 
matter where I slide this you can just
move<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.720> wherever<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.289> want<00:00:32.719> as<00:00:33.719> long<00:00:33.989> as<00:00:34.170> it

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
move it wherever I want as long as it

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.410 
move it wherever I want as long as it
touches<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.829> copper<00:00:35.510> why<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.840> power<00:00:38.420> it's

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
touches the copper why I have power it's

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.110 
touches the copper why I have power it's
just<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.809> solid-state<00:00:40.410> crystal<00:00:41.899> there<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.050> is

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
just a solid-state crystal there it is

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.270 
just a solid-state crystal there it is
you<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.239> see<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:45.710> after<00:00:46.710> Prague<00:00:46.980> Gene's

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
you can see it's after Prague Gene's

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.540 
you can see it's after Prague Gene's
work<00:00:48.230> with<00:00:49.230> all<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> stress<00:00:49.920> cracks<00:00:50.309> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
work with all the stress cracks and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.810 
work with all the stress cracks and
everything<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:52.100> set<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.219> down<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.520> there

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.740 

and<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.350> go<00:01:01.130> you<00:01:02.130> have<00:01:02.160> your<00:01:02.370> power<00:01:02.790> so

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and there you go you have your power so

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.260 
and there you go you have your power so
I<00:01:03.810> thought<00:01:04.050> I<00:01:04.080> would<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.350> share<00:01:04.800> the<00:01:05.790> second

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
I thought I would just share the second

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.230 
I thought I would just share the second
crystal<00:01:06.750> here<00:01:08.450> working<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.280> thing<00:01:11.280> and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
crystal here working on the thing and

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.130 
crystal here working on the thing and
they're<00:01:13.080> they're<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> same<00:01:14.190> they're<00:01:15.140> exactly

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
they're they're the same they're exactly

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.100 
they're they're the same they're exactly
done<00:01:16.410> the<00:01:16.590> same<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:19.110> they<00:01:20.100> seem<00:01:20.370> to<00:01:20.750> it<00:01:21.750> seems

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
done the same and they seem to it seems

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.790 
done the same and they seem to it seems
like<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.470> stack<00:01:22.979> them<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:25.470> no<00:01:25.620> matter

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
like you stack them up so no matter

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.800 
like you stack them up so no matter
where<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.070> put<00:01:26.370> this

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.200 

you<00:01:32.380> know<00:01:32.530> providing<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.189> Cobbers<00:01:33.670> clean<00:01:34.000> I

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
you know providing the Cobbers clean I

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.520 
you know providing the Cobbers clean I
mean<00:01:34.479> this<00:01:34.630> is<00:01:34.840> pretty<00:01:35.350> well<00:01:36.930> oxidized<00:01:40.530> there

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
mean this is pretty well oxidized there

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.350 
mean this is pretty well oxidized there
you<00:01:41.619> go

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.609 

get<00:01:45.140> over<00:01:45.320> here

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.740 

and<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.640> about<00:01:50.939> put<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.540> any

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
and so I can just about put it on any

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.959 
and so I can just about put it on any
copper<00:01:53.119> and<00:01:54.119> they'll<00:01:54.540> do<00:01:54.720> that

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.409 

so<00:02:00.539> thanks<00:02:00.899> for<00:02:01.020> watching
