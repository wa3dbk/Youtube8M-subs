brakes are big theme as we have a lot of
big<00:01:02.129> breaking<00:01:02.370> events<00:01:02.820> here<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.239> what<00:01:03.780> is

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
big breaking events here and what is

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.359 
big breaking events here and what is
also<00:01:03.989> interesting<00:01:04.140> from<00:01:04.680> driving<00:01:04.949> point<00:01:05.189> of

came before the finish the drivers
approached<00:01:15.940> it<00:01:16.150> at<00:01:16.270> over<00:01:16.510> 300<00:01:16.780> km/h<00:01:17.620> and<00:01:18.190> have

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
approached it at over 300 km/h and have

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.640 
approached it at over 300 km/h and have
to<00:01:18.700> break<00:01:18.940> heavily<00:01:19.450> go<00:01:19.870> into<00:01:20.140> it<00:01:20.290> with<00:01:20.320> too

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
to break heavily go into it with too

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.500 
to break heavily go into it with too
much<00:01:20.800> momentum<00:01:21.010> and<00:01:21.520> you<00:01:21.580> can<00:01:22.030> hit<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.330> wall

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
much momentum and you can hit the wall

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.020 
much momentum and you can hit the wall
at<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.720> end<00:01:22.990> as<00:01:23.230> many<00:01:23.710> champions<00:01:24.340> before<00:01:24.790> have

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
at the end as many champions before have

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.580 
at the end as many champions before have
done<00:01:25.300> hence<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.990> name

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
done hence the name

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.289 
done hence the name
although<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.460> circuit<00:01:28.850> is<00:01:28.909> one<00:01:29.119> of<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.270> very
