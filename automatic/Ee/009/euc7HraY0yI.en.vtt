00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
these little ridges here on the tops of

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.900 
these little ridges here on the tops of
the<00:00:24.280> packs

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
the packs

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.960 
the packs
yeah<00:00:25.810> real<00:00:26.050> packs<00:00:26.350> do<00:00:26.770> not<00:00:26.920> have<00:00:27.160> that<00:00:27.460> and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
yeah real packs do not have that and

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.550 
yeah real packs do not have that and
also<00:00:28.119> the<00:00:28.360> shading<00:00:28.810> for<00:00:28.990> a<00:00:29.050> lot<00:00:29.230> of<00:00:29.350> them<00:00:29.470> is

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
also the shading for a lot of them is

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.299 
also the shading for a lot of them is
just<00:00:29.590> way<00:00:30.190> off<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:32.349> a<00:00:32.469> little<00:00:32.710> harder<00:00:32.980> to<00:00:33.129> see

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
just way off it's a little harder to see

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:34.979 
just way off it's a little harder to see
on<00:00:33.339> camera<00:00:33.489> but<00:00:33.909> in<00:00:34.149> person<00:00:34.179> you<00:00:34.659> can<00:00:34.690> tell

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
on camera but in person you can tell

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.660 
on camera but in person you can tell
that<00:00:35.140> this<00:00:35.260> is<00:00:35.440> really<00:00:35.920> really<00:00:36.129> light<00:00:36.460> the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
that this is really really light the

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.419 
that this is really really light the
shading<00:00:37.120> on<00:00:37.269> this<00:00:37.539> pack<00:00:37.780> and<00:00:38.219> they<00:00:39.219> look

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:39.429 
shading on this pack and they look

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:41.369 
shading on this pack and they look
pretty<00:00:39.609> fake<00:00:39.909> the<00:00:40.539> one<00:00:40.719> that's<00:00:40.899> probably

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
pretty fake the one that's probably

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.860
