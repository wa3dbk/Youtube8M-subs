enough<00:01:43.350> now<00:01:43.620> that<00:01:43.650> everyone<00:01:44.160> knows<00:01:44.190> all<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
enough now that everyone knows all the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.980 
enough now that everyone knows all the
tricks<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.450> mean<00:01:45.600> with<00:01:45.750> their<00:01:45.870> own

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
tricks and I mean with their own

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.470 
tricks and I mean with their own
characters<00:01:46.380> at<00:01:46.500> least<00:01:47.210> training<00:01:48.210> mode<00:01:48.330> is

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
characters at least training mode is

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.180 
characters at least training mode is
accessible<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:48.990> anyone<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.710> don't<00:01:49.980> think

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
accessible to anyone so I don't think

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.430 
accessible to anyone so I don't think
that<00:01:50.370> I<00:01:50.400> have<00:01:50.580> an<00:01:50.700> advantage<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.300> to<00:01:51.360> speak<00:01:51.630> I

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
that I have an advantage so to speak I

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.410 
that I have an advantage so to speak I
think<00:01:53.160> people<00:01:53.310> who<00:01:53.490> live<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.730> more<00:01:54.060> built-up

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
think people who live in more built-up

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.790 
think people who live in more built-up
communities<00:01:54.900> like<00:01:55.080> if<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.290> live<00:01:55.410> in<00:01:55.470> Japan

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
communities like if you live in Japan

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.190 
communities like if you live in Japan
where<00:01:56.490> they<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.820> game<00:01:57.030> centers<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.630> really

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
where they have game centers and really

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.140 
where they have game centers and really
really<00:01:58.440> good<00:01:58.620> online<00:01:58.800> connection<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.910> you

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
really good online connection then you

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.340 
really good online connection then you
could<00:02:00.330> have<00:02:00.480> an<00:02:00.570> advantage<00:02:00.840> if<00:02:01.080> you<00:02:01.170> play<00:02:01.320> it

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
could have an advantage if you play it

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.870 
could have an advantage if you play it
online<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.680> lot<00:02:01.800> or<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:02.190> you<00:02:02.280> went<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.490> arcades

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
online a lot or if you went to arcades

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.980 
online a lot or if you went to arcades
because<00:02:03.150> you're<00:02:03.300> getting<00:02:03.510> really<00:02:03.630> high<00:02:03.870> level

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
because you're getting really high level

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.750 
because you're getting really high level
play<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.800> you're<00:02:04.950> getting<00:02:05.100> your<00:02:05.250> regular<00:02:05.580> so

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
play and you're getting your regular so

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.610 
play and you're getting your regular so
you're<00:02:05.910> getting<00:02:06.120> fed<00:02:06.300> that<00:02:06.480> regular<00:02:06.930> whereas

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
you're getting fed that regular whereas

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.229 
you're getting fed that regular whereas
in<00:02:07.830> other<00:02:07.920> places<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.640> know<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.910> UK<00:02:09.090> for

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
in other places you know in the UK for

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.449 
in other places you know in the UK for
example<00:02:09.360> we<00:02:09.690> have<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:10.140> good<00:02:10.470> community<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.129> we

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
example we have a good community but we

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.770 
example we have a good community but we
don't<00:02:11.610> have<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.970> many<00:02:12.120> really<00:02:12.510> high<00:02:12.629> level

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
don't have that many really high level

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.869 
don't have that many really high level
players<00:02:13.019> so<00:02:13.349> it's<00:02:13.499> quite<00:02:13.620> hard<00:02:13.829> to<00:02:13.980> level<00:02:14.760> up

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
players so it's quite hard to level up

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.550 
players so it's quite hard to level up
to<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.180> evo<00:02:15.629> level<00:02:15.959> where<00:02:16.079> you<00:02:16.109> need<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.409> come

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
to that evo level where you need to come

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.140 
to that evo level where you need to come
and<00:02:16.709> compete<00:02:16.890> at<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:17.159> this<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.730> know

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
and compete at this this you know

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.899 
and compete at this this you know
on<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.420> main<00:02:18.540> stage<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:18.989> stuff<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:19.879> yeah<00:02:20.879> I

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
on the main stage and stuff so yeah I

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.850 
on the main stage and stuff so yeah I
think<00:02:21.180> we<00:02:21.840> have<00:02:21.870> your<00:02:22.140> communities<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.829> know

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
think we have your communities you know

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.399 
think we have your communities you know
in<00:02:23.040> Europe<00:02:23.370> in<00:02:23.579> the<00:02:23.760> UK<00:02:24.030> in<00:02:24.239> France<00:02:24.569> I'm<00:02:24.989> in

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
in Europe in the UK in France I'm in

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.800 
in Europe in the UK in France I'm in
Sweden<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.370> know<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:26.610> Belgium<00:02:27.060> they<00:02:27.540> do<00:02:27.599> have

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
Sweden you know in Belgium they do have

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.240 
Sweden you know in Belgium they do have
good<00:02:27.930> communities<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:28.739> they're<00:02:29.069> always

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
good communities but they're always

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.030 
good communities but they're always
quite<00:02:29.579> small<00:02:29.819> and<00:02:30.439> so<00:02:31.439> I<00:02:31.470> thought<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.739> wouldn't

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
quite small and so I thought I wouldn't

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.160 
quite small and so I thought I wouldn't
say<00:02:32.159> we<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.459> an<00:02:32.549> advantage<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.870> know<00:02:33.900> being

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
say we have an advantage you know being

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.750 
say we have an advantage you know being

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
it being an international player doesn't

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.640 
it being an international player doesn't
get<00:02:35.849> me<00:02:35.939> an<00:02:36.000> advantage<00:02:36.209> at<00:02:36.659> all<00:02:36.870> well<00:02:37.530> you

important<00:04:46.570> as<00:04:46.690> well<00:04:46.810> but<00:04:47.290> if<00:04:47.410> you're

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
important as well but if you're

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.840 
important as well but if you're
attacking<00:04:48.040> if<00:04:48.130> you're<00:04:48.250> being<00:04:48.340> aggressive<00:04:48.760> in

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
attacking if you're being aggressive in

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.460 
attacking if you're being aggressive in
rushing<00:04:49.120> someone<00:04:49.390> down<00:04:49.570> you<00:04:50.110> need<00:04:50.260> to<00:04:50.350> have

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
rushing someone down you need to have

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.260 
rushing someone down you need to have
quicker<00:04:50.740> reactions<00:04:51.310> to<00:04:51.460> react<00:04:51.670> to<00:04:51.790> what<00:04:51.970> to

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
quicker reactions to react to what to

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.940 
quicker reactions to react to what to
how<00:04:52.360> they're<00:04:52.540> trying<00:04:52.690> to<00:04:52.840> defend<00:04:53.140> to<00:04:53.650> counter

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
how they're trying to defend to counter

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.160 
how they're trying to defend to counter
that<00:04:54.070> to<00:04:54.220> keep<00:04:54.400> their<00:04:54.550> defense<00:04:54.790> open<00:04:55.150> so<00:04:55.390> iris

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
that to keep their defense open so iris
