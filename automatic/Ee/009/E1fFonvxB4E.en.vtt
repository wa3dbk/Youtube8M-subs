00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:14.000
 we need wax that has an odor and will be 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.400
 no color and no smell 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.750
 two 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.750
 also crayons 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.429
 cardboard cups 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.500
 wicks for candles 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.379
 and I'm going to recycle these carts that 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.040
 had for a long time the first thing that 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:38.060
 I'm going to do is put the wax in the 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.970
 cups 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.980
 I'm scraping the sidewalk with a grater 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.540
 of cheese is easier 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:50.470
 grate it with a cheese carver that 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.470
 cut it with the knife 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.220
 It's a little complicated to take the paper 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.210
 to try waves then what I did 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:05.300
 it's nothing more to cut with a small 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.620
 razor very carefully try not to 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.620
 cut our fingers 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.060
 and now nothing else 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.060
 I open it like this 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.240
 since I finished removing the paper 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.759
 I will cut the street lamps 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.400
 bits and every crayola I'm going to put 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.720
 in a glass 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.720
 court action 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.720
 Now I'm going to put the sidewalk 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.070
 already once we finish putting the 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:30.350
 wax with the crayons inside and these 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:33.380
 are the cubes of wax with color 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.660
 each of these I'm going to put in the 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.840
 microwave for about two 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.840
 minutes 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.210
 already here he made me is completely 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.230
 liquid be very careful in not 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:51.060
 burn because it's too hot 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.000
 if it falls on your hands you can burn 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:00.320
 horrible so that the wick does not move 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.320
 I'm going to put a little bit of d 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:16.770
 we help each other with a wooden stick 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.770
 so you can paste 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.890
 I will pour the waxes very carefully 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.599
 Now I have to wait for it to dry 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:40.970
 completely and already once dry I'll 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:43.460
 continue with the other colors 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:49.340
 I decided to heat the wax in this 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:52.220
 little frying pan what happens that he what 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.000
 happens that my microwave was 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:59.110
 for taking too long to be 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.430
 will melt everything then 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.430
 this was the best option 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.269
 now again I have to wait for 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:22.019
 dry that color and when it's finished 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.500
 to dry I will melt again others 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.500
 colors 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.050
 let's dry again 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.050
 approximately 20 minutes 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.400
 already once the wax is 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.960
 completely dry I will cut the 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.960
 excess of the wicks 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.569
 so that it looks a little prettier I 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.379
 I'm decorating with 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:28.429
 with a bit of rescue I'm also going to 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:28.429
 decorate with the story 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:37.000
 and that's how I left my sails 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:39.610
 final I put different strips and 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.599
 some buttons 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.509
 this candle inspired me in these sweets that 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:50.900
 They are very popular in this autumn season 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:54.050
 they are called candy with in Spanish it would be 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.570
 sweet corn and in this nothing else I put myself 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.419
 a little flower and here I hit nothing else 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.830
 two candy corn and a small button 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:04.670
 as well 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.920
 this was the first candle I made but 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:10.790
 as you can see here it was a total 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:14.600
 failure because do not let it dry 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:17.720
 enough the color orange moment 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.090
 of pouring the red color melted everything 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:24.720
 and all the sidewalk spilled as they can 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:28.200
 see then I recommend you a lot 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.060
 let them wait at least 30 or 40 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.980
 minutes 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.910
 or if they do not touch with a wooden stick 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.900
 the wax 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:40.060
 to check if it is completely dry 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.360
 because if it's not going to happen to me 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.820
 I hope you are inspired and that you 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.460
 also do these candles are very 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:51.250
 easy to do but have a lot 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:54.040
 Be careful when you are investing your wax 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.630
 because they can burn very ugly then 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.460
 be very careful when you are 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.430
 making these candles 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:04.890
 thank you very much for watching my video and we 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.890
 we see until the next goodbye
