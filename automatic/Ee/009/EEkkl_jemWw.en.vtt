that<00:01:33.300> guy<00:01:33.480> I'm<00:01:34.140> not<00:01:34.260> that<00:01:36.680> each<00:01:37.680> one<00:01:37.920> but

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
that guy I'm not that each one but

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.490 
that guy I'm not that each one but
sometimes<00:01:38.580> they'll<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.420> ones<00:01:39.960> like<00:01:40.230> this

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
sometimes they'll be ones like this

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.230

through<00:01:41.010> these<00:01:41.160> triangles<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.120> you<00:01:42.210> just

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
through these triangles here so you just

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.640 
through these triangles here so you just
come<00:01:42.540> over<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.870> hit<00:01:42.990> all<00:01:43.140> three<00:01:43.320> triangles

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
come over and hit all three triangles

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.530 
come over and hit all three triangles
these<00:01:44.070> actually<00:01:44.430> don't<00:01:44.760> count<00:01:45.060> towards<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
these actually don't count towards the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:02:39.070 
these actually don't count towards the
sea<00:01:50.180> yes<00:01:51.830> yeah

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.200 

and<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.560> don't<00:02:39.650> get<00:02:39.830> dragged<00:02:40.490> relocation

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
and you don't get dragged relocation

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.600 
and you don't get dragged relocation
