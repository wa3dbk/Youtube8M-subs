kind<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.920> explore<00:00:17.820> both<00:00:18.060> sides<00:00:18.390> here<00:00:18.660> because

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
kind of explore both sides here because

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.720 
kind of explore both sides here because
Charlie's<00:00:19.320> camp<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.770> definitely<00:00:20.160> saying<00:00:20.400> this

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
Charlie's camp is definitely saying this

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.150 
Charlie's camp is definitely saying this
did<00:00:20.939> not<00:00:20.970> happen<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.840> first<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.230> foremost<00:00:22.289> TMZ

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
did not happen so first and foremost TMZ

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.009 
did not happen so first and foremost TMZ
and<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.490> guess<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.910> dentist<00:00:24.420> technician<00:00:24.900> is

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
and I guess the dentist technician is

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.870 
and I guess the dentist technician is
reporting<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.650> Charlie<00:00:26.250> flipped<00:00:26.609> out<00:00:26.849> when

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
reporting that Charlie flipped out when

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.439 
reporting that Charlie flipped out when
he<00:00:27.330> was<00:00:27.480> given<00:00:28.140> nitrous<00:00:29.039> oxide<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.330> what

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
he was given nitrous oxide is that what

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.150 
he was given nitrous oxide is that what
it<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.599> nitrous<00:00:30.929> oxide<00:00:31.289> because<00:00:31.859> he<00:00:31.980> had<00:00:32.070> an

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
it is nitrous oxide because he had an

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.069 
it is nitrous oxide because he had an
abscess<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:32.790> he<00:00:32.910> went<00:00:33.030> into<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> dentist<00:00:33.809> they

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
abscess so he went into the dentist they

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.389 
abscess so he went into the dentist they
were<00:00:34.140> working<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.649> him<00:00:34.829> they<00:00:35.010> gave<00:00:35.190> him<00:00:35.309> the

were working on him they gave him the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.069 
were working on him they gave him the
nitrous<00:00:35.730> oxide<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.270> then<00:00:36.450> apparently<00:00:36.960> that's

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
nitrous oxide and then apparently that's

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.930 
nitrous oxide and then apparently that's
when<00:00:37.320> he<00:00:37.380> pulled<00:00:37.410> out<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.800> knife<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.550> the

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.740 
had a bad reaction what do you think
that<00:03:23.140> bad<00:03:23.380> reaction<00:03:24.010> means<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.550> mean<00:03:25.270> it<00:03:25.480> seems

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
that bad reaction means I mean it seems

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.570 
that bad reaction means I mean it seems
like<00:03:25.959> when<00:03:26.320> you<00:03:26.440> have<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.620> bad<00:03:26.890> reaction<00:03:27.100> you

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
like when you have a bad reaction you

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.310 
like when you have a bad reaction you
just<00:03:27.790> start<00:03:28.000> hallucinating<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:28.989> think<00:03:29.230> a

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
just start hallucinating and you think a

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.050 
just start hallucinating and you think a
lot<00:03:29.470> of<00:03:29.500> things<00:03:29.800> are<00:03:29.980> happening<00:03:30.520> that<00:03:30.550> aren't

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
lot of things are happening that aren't

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.120 
lot of things are happening that aren't
and<00:03:31.270> so<00:03:31.570> whatever<00:03:31.870> your<00:03:32.080> reaction<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.739> that<00:03:32.770> is

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
and so whatever your reaction to that is

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.160 
and so whatever your reaction to that is
is<00:03:33.459> Jiri<00:03:33.610> actually<00:03:33.940> if<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.090> had<00:03:34.239> a<00:03:34.270> good<00:03:34.810> base

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
is Jiri actually if you had a good base

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.710 
is Jiri actually if you had a good base
of<00:03:35.410> coke<00:03:35.650> going<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.910> add<00:03:37.000> laughing<00:03:37.570> gas

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
of coke going and you add laughing gas

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.400 
of coke going and you add laughing gas
who<00:03:37.930> knows<00:03:40.769> yo<00:03:41.769> face<00:03:42.340> is<00:03:42.610> changed<00:03:43.269> so<00:03:44.140> if<00:03:44.380> that
