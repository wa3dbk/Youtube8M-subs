00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
really smart move and they decided to

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.369 
really smart move and they decided to
develop<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.190> global<00:00:50.489> subcompact<00:00:51.449> car<00:00:51.899> what

develop a global subcompact car what

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.810 
develop a global subcompact car what
that<00:00:52.559> means<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:52.980> they<00:00:53.219> sell<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.610> car

all around the world the benefit of that

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.910 
all around the world the benefit of that
is<00:00:56.039> they<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:57.090> develop<00:00:57.329> more<00:00:58.230> expensive

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
is they can develop more expensive

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
in this segment I mean this sonic you

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.520 
in this segment I mean this sonic you
can<00:03:16.579> get<00:03:16.700> it<00:03:16.790> with<00:03:16.940> as<00:03:17.510> I<00:03:17.750> said<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.109> six-speed

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
can get it with as I said the six-speed

can get it with as I said the six-speed
automatic<00:03:18.980> transmission<00:03:19.010> would<00:03:19.639> actually

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
automatic transmission would actually

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.339 
automatic transmission would actually
which<00:03:20.060> actually<00:03:20.359> has<00:03:20.480> a<00:03:20.510> little<00:03:20.720> tap<00:03:21.079> shift

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
which actually has a little tap shift

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:22.660 
which actually has a little tap shift
feature<00:03:21.650> so<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:21.980> could<00:03:22.190> control<00:03:22.489> the

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
feature so you could control the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.430 
feature so you could control the
shifting<00:03:23.090> you<00:03:23.690> can<00:03:23.810> get<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:24.019> with<00:03:24.109> heated

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
shifting you can get it with heated

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.180 
shifting you can get it with heated

that's okay because the RS is the

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.259 
that's okay because the RS is the

when<00:04:12.920> you<00:04:13.040> accelerate

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.720 

like<00:04:16.720> that<00:04:18.390> and<00:04:19.390> you<00:04:20.320> know<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:21.130> reminds<00:04:21.670> you

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
like that and you know it reminds you

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.960 
like that and you know it reminds you
that<00:04:21.790> you're<00:04:22.090> in<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.390> small<00:04:22.660> car<00:04:22.960> often<00:04:23.730> the<00:04:24.730> fit

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
that you're in a small car often the fit

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.750 
that you're in a small car often the fit
has<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.210> little<00:04:25.510> 1.5<00:04:26.140> liter<00:04:26.410> engine<00:04:26.830> that<00:04:27.520> feels

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
has a little 1.5 liter engine that feels

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.240 
has a little 1.5 liter engine that feels
nice<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:28.060> responsive<00:04:28.540> it's<00:04:28.930> got<00:04:29.110> only<00:04:29.380> 117

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
nice and responsive it's got only 117

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.820 
nice and responsive it's got only 117
horsepower<00:04:30.760> and<00:04:31.150> so<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:31.990> gearbox<00:04:32.320> does<00:04:32.620> like

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
horsepower and so the gearbox does like

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.360 
horsepower and so the gearbox does like
the<00:04:33.010> Rev<00:04:33.220> but<00:04:33.670> it's<00:04:34.120> plenty<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:35.800> Sonics<00:04:36.160> got

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
the Rev but it's plenty the Sonics got

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.610 
the Rev but it's plenty the Sonics got
these<00:04:36.520> this<00:04:36.880> great<00:04:37.300> long<00:04:37.660> windshield<00:04:38.290> and<00:04:38.410> big

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
these this great long windshield and big

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.870 
these this great long windshield and big
dashboard<00:04:39.130> so<00:04:39.220> even<00:04:39.400> though<00:04:39.460> it's<00:04:39.610> a<00:04:39.640> small

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
dashboard so even though it's a small

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.610 
dashboard so even though it's a small
car<00:04:40.090> you've<00:04:40.210> got<00:04:40.330> this<00:04:40.420> great<00:04:40.690> panoramic<00:04:41.380> view

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
car you've got this great panoramic view

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
of the road ahead the build quality of

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.520 
of the road ahead the build quality of
the<00:04:43.420> car<00:04:43.570> is<00:04:43.660> actually<00:04:43.750> really<00:04:44.020> quite<00:04:44.230> good<00:04:44.500> I

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
the car is actually really quite good I

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.900 
the car is actually really quite good I
mean<00:04:44.710> I'm<00:04:44.830> going<00:04:45.010> over<00:04:45.160> some<00:04:45.340> railway<00:04:45.550> tracks

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
mean I'm going over some railway tracks

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.640 
mean I'm going over some railway tracks
right<00:04:46.120> now<00:04:46.270> and<00:04:46.480> a<00:04:46.540> lot<00:04:46.720> of<00:04:46.840> you<00:04:47.350> know

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
right now and a lot of you know

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.350 
right now and a lot of you know
Toronto's<00:04:47.980> notoriously<00:04:48.490> broken<00:04:48.940> up<00:04:49.060> street

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
Toronto's notoriously broken up street

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.990 
Toronto's notoriously broken up street
and<00:04:49.600> it's<00:04:50.170> very<00:04:50.770> much<00:04:51.010> holding<00:04:51.370> together<00:04:51.520> well

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
and it's very much holding together well

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.240 
and it's very much holding together well
out<00:04:52.600> of<00:04:52.780> these<00:04:52.930> three<00:04:53.080> I<00:04:53.350> think<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.740> fit<00:04:54.040> is

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
out of these three I think the fit is

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.100 
out of these three I think the fit is
still<00:04:54.610> our<00:04:54.790> favorite<00:04:55.360> that's<00:04:55.570> because<00:04:55.960> it's

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
still our favorite that's because it's

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.530 
still our favorite that's because it's
the<00:04:56.290> the<00:04:56.590> most<00:04:56.800> complete<00:04:57.400> all-around<00:04:57.970> package

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
the the most complete all-around package

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.500 
the the most complete all-around package
it<00:04:58.960> handles<00:04:59.500> great<00:04:59.830> it's<00:05:00.400> got<00:05:00.550> lots<00:05:01.360> of

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
it handles great it's got lots of

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.480 
it handles great it's got lots of
practicality<00:05:02.050> lots<00:05:02.560> of<00:05:02.680> functionality<00:05:03.070> lots

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
practicality lots of functionality lots

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.020 
practicality lots of functionality lots
of<00:05:03.640> storage<00:05:03.910> space<00:05:04.060> so<00:05:04.980> if<00:05:05.980> we<00:05:06.730> were<00:05:06.820> going<00:05:06.940> to

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
of storage space so if we were going to

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.270 
of storage space so if we were going to
buy<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.480> subcompact<00:05:08.169> we'd<00:05:08.680> be<00:05:08.800> spending<00:05:09.160> our

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
buy a subcompact we'd be spending our

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.400 
buy a subcompact we'd be spending our
own<00:05:09.310> money
