is<00:01:34.320> what<00:01:34.500> I'm<00:01:34.650> packing<00:01:35.100> right<00:01:35.250> now<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.579> think

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
is what I'm packing right now I think

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.010 
is what I'm packing right now I think
the<00:01:35.820> microphone<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.329> actually<00:01:36.630> better<00:01:36.780> when

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
the microphone is actually better when

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.539 
the microphone is actually better when
you<00:01:37.110> hold<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> camera<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.310> it

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
you hold the camera like this so it

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.160 
you hold the camera like this so it
should<00:01:39.119> be<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.299> little<00:01:39.600> bit<00:01:39.750> better<00:01:39.869> sound

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
should be a little bit better sound

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.080 
should be a little bit better sound
