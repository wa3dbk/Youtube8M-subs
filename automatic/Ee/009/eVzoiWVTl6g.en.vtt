00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.429
 two years ago in the winter days began 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.059
 release for addition for battlefield 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.890
 3 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.170
 each of which had some 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.240
 characteristic features in the beginning gave us 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.920
 opportunity to play again on the most 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.080
 popular maps from the second part 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.470
 Battlefield remaking them under features 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.750
 frost bike 20 then appeared more than 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.669
 decent class boat with its dynamic 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.450
 contact shooting in closed 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.790
 the premises 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.129
 The third supplement, on the contrary, brought in 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.090
 the game is big open spaces and the most huge 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.230
 map for the time of the series 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.570
 the last one was of the mouse 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.789
 who stood out except that good 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.920
 terrain design but if earlier everything 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.020
 these two axes could interest players 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.629
 mostly only in size or design 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.879
 card then completing the chain addition 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.340
 The end game is captured with gaming 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.049
 modes and so it turned out to be the most 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.700
 a successful representative of this line 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:08.189
 traditionally start by parsing 4 new 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.320
 card operation ashore it is relatively 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.180
 a small map with a lot of springboards 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.880
 to move quickly between shores 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.189
 The shallow river is the most interesting and part 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.960
 are the mountainous area where skirmishes 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.360
 turn into some sort of 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.000
 hide and seek games next in line is worth 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.619
 map of kaz az orsk and paths with spacious 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.020
 forest area in the center of which 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.820
 stretched railway design 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.110
 she strongly resembles the valley of death 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.610
 ice armor hill 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.170
 but there are numerous bases 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.570
 power plants replaced 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.820
 small fox sawdust and multiple 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.460
 tree trunks between which is convenient 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.259
 hide from opponents are not ban dons 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.299
 plains are generally large 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.759
 desert fields in the center of which 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.860
 there is a huge hangar and the most 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.140
 fierce battles lead precisely for him 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.540
 all three cards turned out surprisingly 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.060
 beautiful but on and more capture 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.280
 winter clogs lanske oil wire che 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.630
 snow covered trees and the road truly 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.610
 cause a feeling of deep winter 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.560
 the map is not very big but it is all 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.149
 riddled with oil pipes which 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.489
 lead to the central tower with 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.319
 tiered bases in addition to the factor 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.900
 close contact in such places 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.150
 Numerous elevations or cranes give 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.959
 sniper opportunity to occupy comfortable 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.090
 positions only in the normal capture mode 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.830
 all these cards are pretty boring from what 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.260
 immediately recommended to move to the new 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.269
 the script in them you not only enjoy 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.099
 interesting gameplay but you will find 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.860
 completely different impression of 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.170
 the above locations the first mode is 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.269
 air superiority in which us 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.430
 throw in the remote corners of the cards and 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.739
 arrange a fight for three airships 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.290
 hanging in the air turns sort of 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.599
 capture points only on fighters 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.940
 after the announcement of this mode me as 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.980
 bad pilot scared the fact that here 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.959
 like any other card will be on 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.730
 dominate players with high skills 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.340
 pilots who are just waiting 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.590
 clubs like me so cruel to them 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.049
 destroy in the air actually 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.480
 that's exactly what happened but with less 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.040
 least tragic there is no such thing 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.109
 you will be raped regularly 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.049
 same players since in mode 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.090
 They are going to a lot of tankers and why force 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.829
 correctly distributed and even possible 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.109
 fly at your pleasure 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.549
 besides this game sessions with great 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.290
 the number of participants sometimes 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.600
 turn into a real spectacle 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.850
 take part in which one 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.859
 pleasure but there is a problem here 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.139
 its essence is that 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.340
 air superiority hidden yet 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.470
 one game mode 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.840
 in it you will need to be in the lobby 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.930
 choose aircraft for rebirth before 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.889
 how will other partners do it 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.660
 developers on servers with large 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.850
 number of players not added 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.220
 additional aircraft why 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.500
 continue the game can only the most agile 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.569
 it's great annoying so how to wait 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.690
 rebirth can be up to five minutes 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.579
 the next mode is called flag capture 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.170
 just do not confuse with the capture of several 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.040
 points on the map here are all much 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.680
 more interesting 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.390
 this mode is very straightforward to you 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.579
 on stealing enemy bases their lacquer and 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.560
 drag him to my base but at the same time 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.430
 do not let the opponent do the same with 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.560
 your team 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.810
 the interestingness of this script is in strong 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.090
 tension received from what is happening 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.010
 but to more or less fully give you 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.560
 we will model it 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.079
 Now imagine a situation waded 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.579
 you broke into the enemy base 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.860
 you go there at great speed or 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.650
 crept to the flag quietly taken away 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.410
 his and here the fun begins 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.240
 returning home with this banner after all in 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.310
 most cases all enemy forces 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.470
 will be thrown to return 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.440
 stolen property home from what 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.509
 a merry chase begins to catch us 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.699
 everything starts from infantry with 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.590
 rocket launchers and finishing tanks with 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.690
 helicopters in such moments head 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.820
 cover just one thought on how you can 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.340
 return home soon to 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.110
 find there some support but 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.539
 since on foot complete similar 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.610
 operation is almost impossible by developers 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.080
 opportunity was added 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.630
 transport the vial equipment and in 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.729
 surrounded by comrades most appropriate 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.380
 option is an armored tank 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.720
 but it is not as interesting as new 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.970
 motorcycles they are incredibly fast 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.280
 maneuverable and riding them causes one 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.840
 only the whip effect first needs a little 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.120
 get used to very sensitive 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.789
 management but if you handle it 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.159
 then believe hardly in all dlc from this 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.289
 ruler there is something more drayvovye 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:25.419
 than escaping with a flag under fire seated on 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:28.360
 helicopter tail with a faithful companion 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.250
 shooting back seat plus 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.199
 to all this maps designed 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.389
 specifically for the new transport paternal 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:36.820
 everywhere is a bunch of springboards or 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.740
 unusual ways to achieve the goal so 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.960
 boring and small shore operation 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.570
 turns into a platform for three qualities 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.000
 on bikes that just fly by 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.210
 all kinds of springboard and slides on 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.259
 Kosovo ways in flag capture mode 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.300
 opposing sides are on 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.520
 both ends of the straight section of the iron 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.020
 where the roads between the players 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.060
 try to slip on the nimble 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.979
 motorcycles tanks steadily occupy 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.870
 comfortable position for their heavy shelling 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.360
 infantry hiding in cars 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.159
 and on top also the pilots of the choppers are trying 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.180
 finally establish control over 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:09.639
 this zone 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.979
 all describe is too long and after all 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:14.199
 there is another important argument in 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.860
 the side of the purchase of the supplement about which we 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.259
 didn't say 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.509
 completely unexpected but on new maps 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:22.000
 just amazingly manifested itself 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:24.130
 team scrum mode it turned out that 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.259
 key buildings are perfect for 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.509
 contact shootouts in limited 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:30.490
 space why in one minute you 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:33.310
 you will shoot between trucks 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.979
 containers and multi-storey building and in 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.900
 another you will be thrown into a power station where 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:39.960
 between the my unit is convenient to lead and 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.639
 secretive war and empty beyond its borders 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.120
 can always hide a couple of enemy 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:45.550
 snipers 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.770
 less worthy were added to the game 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.990
 innovations such as a jeep with powerful 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.789
 rocket launcher and landing aircraft 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.919
 which can not be controlled but from it 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:55.720
 you can throw in us 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:58.599
 point on the map or sometimes 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.940
 paratroop right at the BTR and or tanks 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:03.009
 which almost always becomes very 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.139
 easy prey for enemies at the end 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:05.680
 I want to say that the end game was far away 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:08.380
 not so 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.090
 as expected too like Armand kilt 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.340
 but in the end she was the most 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.300
 an interesting and exciting addition 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.370
 out of all five 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.440
 we were again given a beautiful and 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.180
 in Hollywood impressive action 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:23.940
 which adequately completed the series 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.940
 downloadable content for battlefield 3
