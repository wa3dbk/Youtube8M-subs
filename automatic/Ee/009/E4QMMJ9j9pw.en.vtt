00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.109
 welcome to another day the project 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.310
 accessibility and such technology for 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:07.110
 all of the foundation we can all 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.540
 help on this occasion can see these 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.790
 tender hairs and cough that really make 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.670
 part of our teaching project 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.740
 of braille that we call in this case 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.659
 more Braille learning pets 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.819
 then they are stuffed animals that we are 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:23.460
 adapting with a 6 point system 

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:25.619
 to make it easier to teach 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.390
 braille we will do the demonstration of how 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.189
 one of them adapts then we take 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.220
 a simple stuffed animal in this case 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.860
 has the great advantage that 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.540
 to strip to dreams then they will 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.790
 teach the Pharisees was encouraged to adapt 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.739
 your dogs in braille with their toys 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.910
 anything and then we send them 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.379
 this primer by mail if you wish in 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.600
 the description of the video is the mail 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.400
 we are contacted by some seek foundation 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.250
 we can all help on facebook or in 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.769
 youtube and digital access channel 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.600
 remember to subscribe here and then 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.360
 there we are going to teach you how to do this 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.579
 and we send them the good document that 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.830
 we need then this case we 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.930
 we are using some eyes the 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.240
 Ojitos of your clients for dolls or 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.820
 for toys can use any 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.159
 thing or a button any texture 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.820
 jewelery adornment is whatever it is 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.229
 a size similar to magnets 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.950
 then we will show here also 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.950
 the apple trees 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.110
 these are the magnets we have magnets 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.530
 rounds also cost 50 pesos each 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.540
 one so we'll be needing 2 and 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.060
 6 to place on the belly in the 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.190
 doll's belly and another 6 for 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.840
 hit your eyes start with those who 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.119
 let's stick in the pancita of fear 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.870
 we can have for the eyes 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.550
 sorry here we have the little eyes 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.560
 they have to take into account something the 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.270
 polarity that is when they are going to paste the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.920
 magnets and keeps on one side or for the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.320
 another one if I put a magnet backwards it 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.760
 they repel forgiveness to you what you quite 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.320
 in his wine that is what I was 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.770
 hitting with all the others that 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.750
 simply be empty with certain 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.090
 that we need that is called putting a 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.329
 in the belly when we go to 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.729
 hit the little boy to put logic on him 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.190
 that is in this case repeats cenesex and 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.170
 we need to put the magnet upside down towards 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.540
 this side so that it sticks ready 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.370
 then there we have already then we have 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.379
 than to know the polarity so that 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.090
 magnets are always pegaditos is here 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.620
 the bottom side this side is the one that 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.280
 glue running so that this 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.819
 eyes and stick to and possibly 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.610
 we take glue and stick crazy we call 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.319
 here in colombia we are going to rectify 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.790
 because do not make mistakes suddenly and do not 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:42.720
 is stuck upside down and repels the 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.720
 ojito let's say it shows back 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.520
 do not throw much not too much but if 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.240
 it is similar then good gift for all 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.770
 the area and we are the magnet 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.060
 and we are going to paste it 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.410
 we need to paste 6 points as they can 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.300
 see in the other dolls then 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.350
 we look at the center of the belly and what 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.350
 stick to the side 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.290
 we are going to take another magnet and we do 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.040
 Exactly the same thing we do 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.040
 polarity test 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.520
 so the glue back here 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.090
 and so on we will continue with the 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.159
 other magnets we hope it will dry out 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.739
 We will continue with the following good 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.599
 as you can see we already have the 6 magnets 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.830
 stuck now what we need is 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.690
 paste the eyes 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.520
 but then another one we need to do the 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.260
 try polarity because because suddenly 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.110
 it can happen to us that we are going to put a 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.170
 magnet an eye is put to the magnet upside down 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.050
 and who respects it then we do 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.480
 exactly the same test we put to 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.390
 dissolve the hairline with the magnet and that 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.700
 attract so you can see it 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.070
 here enzymes that you have to paste the eye or 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.410
 be when I eat the ojito how to put it 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.620
 here on top and they stick it behind us 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:10.930
 it would be the other way around simply 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.930
 we take the we apply the glue 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.000
 we put the ojito on it and leave it 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.490
 dry off 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.260
 over and let it dry for a moment 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.000
 we will do the same with the 6 little eyes 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.690
 doing the polarity test and that's the 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.690
 next step 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.100
 good as you can see here we already have 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.290
 the 6 little eyes already stuck we have the 6 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.880
 magnets and we can just 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.340
 put to make then proof that yes 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.650
 stick is that if they correspond is when 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.139
 they approach right there they are going to bring 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.240
 Another advantage is that I do not know if they can 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.080
 listen here while doing it but the eyes 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.210
 they have sounds 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.860
 alomar 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.860
 make like a little rattlesnake 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.230
 when the eggs move when the 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.780
 stuffed animal is not going to give us a sound 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.210
 then it also has that part then of 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.330
 the sensory 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.400
 but here we already have in this case the 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:12.830
 little horse that sounds 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.880
 and that also allows us then 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.039
 then that also allow us 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.139
 practice braille then already 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.199
 we can simply practice here all 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.789
 the letters based on the primer 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:25.889
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.630
 tutorial see here all the members of 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.340
 the family I think that more than one wants 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:33.169
 listen to them true we take out the 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.169
 different sounds of the horse 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.940
 the lion 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.000
 well here we have the elephant 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:51.940
 good 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.940
 in my com 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.250
 the toad the twig 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.539
 and finally the patico 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:14.110
 remember to request the guide if you 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.000
 interesting is another project the hc idea 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.190
 digital a foundation project 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.479
 we can all help thank you very much 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.020
