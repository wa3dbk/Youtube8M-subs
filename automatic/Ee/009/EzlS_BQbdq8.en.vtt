radiation<00:03:01.480> is<00:03:01.630> causing<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.230> growth<00:03:02.470> but

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
radiation is causing the growth but

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.950 
radiation is causing the growth but
there's<00:03:03.340> no<00:03:03.520> known<00:03:03.850> sources<00:03:04.390> of<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.750> type<00:03:04.930> of

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
there's no known sources of the type of

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.930 
there's no known sources of the type of
radiation<00:03:05.590> on<00:03:05.710> the<00:03:05.800> ship<00:03:06.100> so<00:03:06.130> they're<00:03:06.610> kind<00:03:06.880> of

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
radiation on the ship so they're kind of

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.990 
radiation on the ship so they're kind of
helpless<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.570> figure<00:03:07.810> out<00:03:07.900> what<00:03:08.050> to<00:03:08.200> do<00:03:08.850> now<00:03:09.850> in

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
helpless to figure out what to do now in

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.960 
helpless to figure out what to do now in
troy's<00:03:10.300> quarters<00:03:10.930> ian<00:03:11.560> states<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.250> he<00:03:12.670> is

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
troy's quarters ian states that he is

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.960 
troy's quarters ian states that he is
the<00:03:13.180> cause<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.930> distress<00:03:14.290> on<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.620> ship

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
the cause of the distress on the ship

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.820 
the cause of the distress on the ship
and<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:16.270> he<00:03:16.450> says<00:03:16.720> that<00:03:16.750> he<00:03:17.230> has<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:17.440> leave

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
and so he says that he has to leave

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.830 
and so he says that he has to leave
because<00:03:18.190> he<00:03:18.460> knows<00:03:18.670> that<00:03:18.700> he<00:03:19.180> is<00:03:19.210> the<00:03:19.330> reason

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
because he knows that he is the reason

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.950 
because he knows that he is the reason
so<00:03:20.050> he<00:03:20.740> begins<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.250> die<00:03:21.580> much<00:03:22.330> too

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
so he begins to die much too

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.780 
so he begins to die much too
Troy's<00:03:24.720> Troy's<00:03:25.720> grief<00:03:26.080> obviously<00:03:26.800> so<00:03:27.640> the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
Troy's Troy's grief obviously so the

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.420 
Troy's Troy's grief obviously so the
Troi<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:29.050> child's<00:03:29.410> body<00:03:29.680> then<00:03:30.160> D

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
Troi the child's body then D

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.640 
Troi the child's body then D
materializes<00:03:31.360> into<00:03:31.540> an<00:03:31.780> energy<00:03:31.930> ball<00:03:32.320> and

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
materializes into an energy ball and

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.550 
materializes into an energy ball and
tells<00:03:33.460> Troy<00:03:33.850> goodbye<00:03:34.240> and<00:03:34.630> leaves<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.500> ship

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
tells Troy goodbye and leaves the ship

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.610 
tells Troy goodbye and leaves the ship
and<00:03:36.250> immediately<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.420> radiation<00:03:37.990> disappears

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
and immediately the radiation disappears

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.300

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
idea that that was actually the case but

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.560 
idea that that was actually the case but
doing<00:05:00.280> a<00:05:00.370> little<00:05:00.550> research<00:05:00.970> I<00:05:01.210> found<00:05:01.360> out

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
doing a little research I found out

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.170 
doing a little research I found out
that's<00:05:01.840> what<00:05:02.020> happened<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:03.370> they<00:05:03.550> also<00:05:03.699> hired

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
that's what happened and they also hired

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.510 
that's what happened and they also hired

Whoopi Goldberg to play Garnon which I
think<00:05:06.759> probably<00:05:07.210> gave<00:05:07.360> quite<00:05:07.930> a<00:05:07.960> bit<00:05:08.320> of<00:05:08.530> a

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
think probably gave quite a bit of a

actually not completely original it was

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:23.550 
actually not completely original it was
actually<00:05:20.919> an<00:05:21.070> old<00:05:21.370> episode<00:05:22.210> from<00:05:22.690> Star<00:05:23.259> Trek

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
actually an old episode from Star Trek

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.670 
actually an old episode from Star Trek
phase<00:05:23.949> 2<00:05:24.460> which<00:05:24.849> was<00:05:25.090> a<00:05:25.479> proposed<00:05:26.199> series

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
phase 2 which was a proposed series

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.409 
phase 2 which was a proposed series
after<00:05:26.949> the<00:05:27.099> original<00:05:27.430> series<00:05:27.699> that<00:05:28.240> just

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
after the original series that just

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.070 
after the original series that just
never<00:05:28.630> happened

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
never happened

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.750 
never happened
the<00:05:30.350> reason<00:05:30.650> why<00:05:30.800> they<00:05:31.070> pulled<00:05:31.310> this<00:05:31.490> one<00:05:31.700> out

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
the reason why they pulled this one out

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.510 
the reason why they pulled this one out
was<00:05:32.150> because<00:05:32.740> there<00:05:33.740> was<00:05:33.860> a<00:05:33.920> writer<00:05:34.190> strike

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
was because there was a writer strike

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.750 
was because there was a writer strike
going<00:05:34.910> on<00:05:35.060> and<00:05:35.750> they<00:05:36.320> needed<00:05:36.740> some<00:05:37.100> material

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
going on and they needed some material

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.180 
going on and they needed some material
but<00:05:37.970> there<00:05:38.090> were<00:05:38.150> no<00:05:38.270> writers<00:05:38.600> to<00:05:38.780> do<00:05:38.900> it<00:05:39.050> so<00:05:39.950> at

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
but there were no writers to do it so at

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.460 
but there were no writers to do it so at
the<00:05:40.310> last<00:05:40.460> moment<00:05:40.940> Maurice<00:05:41.150> Hurley<00:05:41.540> did<00:05:42.440> a

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
the last moment Maurice Hurley did a

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.770 
the last moment Maurice Hurley did a
little<00:05:42.800> rewrite<00:05:43.190> on<00:05:43.370> this<00:05:43.550> just<00:05:43.820> to<00:05:44.060> fit<00:05:44.540> it<00:05:44.660> to

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
little rewrite on this just to fit it to

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.780 
little rewrite on this just to fit it to
the<00:05:44.810> next<00:05:45.050> generation<00:05:45.310> but<00:05:46.310> they<00:05:46.430> didn't<00:05:46.670> have

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
the next generation but they didn't have

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.550 
the next generation but they didn't have
to<00:05:46.850> do<00:05:47.000> much<00:05:47.030> because<00:05:48.020> the<00:05:48.620> character<00:05:49.220> of<00:05:49.460> Ilia

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
to do much because the character of Ilia

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.910 
to do much because the character of Ilia
from<00:05:51.560> phase<00:05:51.830> 2<00:05:52.160> was<00:05:52.370> very<00:05:52.610> similar<00:05:52.970> to<00:05:53.180> Troy<00:05:53.920> so

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
from phase 2 was very similar to Troy so

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.780 
from phase 2 was very similar to Troy so
this<00:05:55.400> worked<00:05:55.670> out<00:05:55.790> very<00:05:55.850> well<00:05:56.740> and<00:05:57.790> this

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
this worked out very well and this

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.720 
this worked out very well and this
episode<00:05:59.300> I<00:05:59.530> liked<00:06:00.530> I<00:06:00.710> thought<00:06:00.920> it<00:06:01.070> was<00:06:01.220> a<00:06:01.250> good

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
episode I liked I thought it was a good

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.280 
episode I liked I thought it was a good
opener<00:06:02.300> and<00:06:02.690> I<00:06:03.230> enjoyed<00:06:03.860> it<00:06:04.240> I<00:06:05.240> think<00:06:06.080> there

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.290 
opener and I enjoyed it I think there

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.440 
opener and I enjoyed it I think there
are<00:06:06.320> as<00:06:06.620> the<00:06:06.920> season<00:06:07.370> moves<00:06:07.400> along<00:06:07.910> the

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
are as the season moves along the

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.200 
are as the season moves along the
episodes<00:06:09.350> get<00:06:09.590> certainly<00:06:10.040> a<00:06:10.070> lot<00:06:10.280> better<00:06:10.580> this

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
episodes get certainly a lot better this

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.180 
episodes get certainly a lot better this
one<00:06:11.450> does<00:06:11.780> suffer<00:06:12.110> from<00:06:12.290> being<00:06:12.950> the<00:06:13.070> very

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
one does suffer from being the very

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.310 
one does suffer from being the very
first<00:06:13.340> episode<00:06:14.150> so<00:06:14.480> they're<00:06:14.660> still<00:06:14.900> trying<00:06:15.170> to

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
first episode so they're still trying to

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.000 
first episode so they're still trying to
find<00:06:16.160> the<00:06:16.430> beginnings<00:06:17.030> of<00:06:17.420> the<00:06:17.860> second<00:06:18.860> season

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
find the beginnings of the second season

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.640 
find the beginnings of the second season
and<00:06:19.340> what<00:06:19.460> that<00:06:19.640> will<00:06:19.760> look<00:06:19.820> like<00:06:20.200> but<00:06:21.200> it<00:06:21.380> does

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
and what that will look like but it does
