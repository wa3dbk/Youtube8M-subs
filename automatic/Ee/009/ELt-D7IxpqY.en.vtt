00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.349
 elsewhere 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.150
 my dog ​​is very nice but I hesitate to 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.200
 let go in the woods as he returns from 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.700
 less and less when I call it 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.140
 I have the impression that they make fun of 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.420
 me when I try to make them come 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.050
 he jumps and run around me I 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.640
 can not catch it 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.660
 how to teach him the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.220
 recalls hello did it like you from 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.560
 many owners learn from their 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.480
 dogs do not have to come but to flee 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.589
 when he calls simply because 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.619
 that from the moment they say the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.710
 word comes he's running behind he's looking to 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.540
 catch where he gets angry when he 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.460
 recover it by or or be the three 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.170
 simply understand that 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.580
 the dog does not understand the meaning of the word 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.040
 comes from the little ones all we 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.110
 do after pronouncing it for 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.520

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.590
 behind your dog for the crap and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.060
 after calling him simply 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.650
 because dogs that have twice 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:42.900

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.380
 and a medal with your number 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.570
 phone and possibly and even 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.680
 especially of a lanyard adapted to its size 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.640
 do you have a lanyard then I 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.410

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.950
 put a lanyard on your bitch and 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.500
 you 're going to pretend to leave 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.600

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.610
 current during this direction of accor 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.900

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.550

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.020
 as soon as she passed right or left 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.700
 you have gone the other way and 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.500
