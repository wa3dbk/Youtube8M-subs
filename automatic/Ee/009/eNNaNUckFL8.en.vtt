00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
anything that we did in the States there

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.779 
anything that we did in the States there
we<00:02:03.229> had<00:02:03.409> pony<00:02:03.740> shows<00:02:04.069> and<00:02:04.340> that<00:02:04.429> was<00:02:04.609> more

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
we had pony shows and that was more

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.489 
we had pony shows and that was more
jumping<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.479> dressage<00:02:05.659> and<00:02:06.109> that<00:02:06.200> sort<00:02:06.439> of

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:06.499 
jumping and dressage and that sort of

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:08.380 
jumping and dressage and that sort of
thing<00:02:06.709> and<00:02:06.859> the<00:02:07.189> sport<00:02:07.459> side<00:02:07.669> of<00:02:07.819> things<00:02:08.030> where

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
thing and the sport side of things where

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.300 
thing and the sport side of things where
you're<00:02:08.869> not<00:02:08.990> doing<00:02:09.050> anything<00:02:09.500> fancy<00:02:09.920> and

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
you're not doing anything fancy and

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.370 
you're not doing anything fancy and
there's<00:02:10.459> actually<00:02:10.880> some<00:02:11.020> practicality<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.200> it

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
there's actually some practicality to it

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.080 
there's actually some practicality to it
it's<00:02:13.340> actually<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.640> lot<00:02:13.730> more<00:02:13.940> fun

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
it's actually a lot more fun

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.809 
it's actually a lot more fun
but<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.959> is's<00:02:16.349> events<00:02:17.099> like<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.489> ohanga

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
but and is's events like the ohanga

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.949 
but and is's events like the ohanga
whole<00:02:18.120> sports<00:02:18.420> are<00:02:18.690> becoming<00:02:19.080> rarer<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:21.780> look

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
whole sports are becoming rarer you look

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.720 
whole sports are becoming rarer you look
at<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.080> station<00:02:22.620> like<00:02:22.769> castle<00:02:23.160> point<00:02:23.370> where<00:02:23.700> I

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
at a station like castle point where I

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.070 
at a station like castle point where I
mean<00:02:23.940> at<00:02:24.000> one<00:02:24.150> point<00:02:24.180> they<00:02:24.510> probably<00:02:24.690> had<00:02:24.930> 15

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
mean at one point they probably had 15

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.500 
mean at one point they probably had 15
people<00:02:25.530> on<00:02:25.800> staff<00:02:26.069> we've<00:02:26.370> only<00:02:26.519> only<00:02:26.819> got<00:02:27.090> five

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
people on staff we've only only got five

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.530 
people on staff we've only only got five
now<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:29.400> amount<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.790> manpower<00:02:30.000> that's

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
now so the amount of manpower that's

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.000 
now so the amount of manpower that's
around<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:31.019> much<00:02:31.200> less<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.739> then<00:02:31.830> for

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
around is much less and then for

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.140 
around is much less and then for
something<00:02:32.250> like<00:02:32.400> horse<00:02:32.610> sports

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
something like horse sports

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.150 
something like horse sports
not<00:02:33.629> everybody's<00:02:34.140> riding<00:02:34.530> all<00:02:34.680> day<00:02:34.890> every<00:02:35.129> day

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
not everybody's riding all day every day

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.630 
not everybody's riding all day every day
so<00:02:35.480> it's<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.569> mix<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:37.110> some<00:02:38.069> of<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.220> people<00:02:38.489> have

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
so it's a mix of some of the people have

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.890 
so it's a mix of some of the people have
workhorses<00:02:39.180> but<00:02:39.599> many<00:02:40.530> times<00:02:40.769> it's<00:02:41.069> a<00:02:41.160> lot<00:02:41.280> of

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
workhorses but many times it's a lot of

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.420 
workhorses but many times it's a lot of
ponies<00:02:42.900> but<00:02:43.620> there's<00:02:43.799> just<00:02:43.950> there's<00:02:44.220> not<00:02:44.280> as

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
ponies but there's just there's not as

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.729 
ponies but there's just there's not as
many<00:02:44.519> horses<00:02:44.940> around<00:02:45.150> everybody<00:02:45.540> uses<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.530> pod

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
many horses around everybody uses a pod

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.690 
many horses around everybody uses a pod
these<00:02:47.160> days<00:02:48.530> Anderson<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.680> family<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.190> Kiwis

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
these days Anderson is family a Kiwis

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.910 
these days Anderson is family a Kiwis
now<00:02:50.910> but<00:02:51.569> he's<00:02:51.690> always<00:02:51.959> aware<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.470> his<00:02:52.769> own

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
now but he's always aware of his own

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.370 
now but he's always aware of his own
background<00:02:53.480> foreign<00:02:54.480> ownership<00:02:54.810> seems<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.290> be

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
background foreign ownership seems to be

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.780 
background foreign ownership seems to be
something<00:02:55.560> we<00:02:55.769> get<00:02:55.920> dragged<00:02:56.250> into<00:02:56.459> on<00:02:56.760> a

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
something we get dragged into on a

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.960 
something we get dragged into on a
regular<00:02:57.480> basis<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.590> we're<00:02:58.829> pretty<00:02:59.370> staunch

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
regular basis and we're pretty staunch

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.569 
regular basis and we're pretty staunch
about<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.680> even<00:03:01.680> though<00:03:01.980> we're<00:03:02.190> now<00:03:02.310> New

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
about it even though we're now New

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.509 
about it even though we're now New
Zealanders<00:03:03.260> we<00:03:04.260> still<00:03:04.680> probably<00:03:05.010> take<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.310> bit

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
Zealanders we still probably take a bit

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.130 
Zealanders we still probably take a bit
of<00:03:05.549> offense<00:03:05.879> at<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.269> when<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.569> comes<00:03:06.900> up

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
of offense at it when it comes up

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.170 
of offense at it when it comes up
because<00:03:07.620> basically<00:03:08.250> all<00:03:08.459> Kiwis<00:03:09.030> were

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
because basically all Kiwis were

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.410 
because basically all Kiwis were
immigrants<00:03:09.660> at<00:03:09.959> one<00:03:10.110> point<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:11.269> it's<00:03:12.269> not

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
immigrants at one point and it's not

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.449 
immigrants at one point and it's not
like<00:03:12.660> people<00:03:12.810> are<00:03:13.079> actually<00:03:13.110> going<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.680> pick

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
like people are actually going to pick

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.240

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
the land up and take it away and if you

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.940 
the land up and take it away and if you
look<00:03:17.640> at<00:03:17.819> most<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.299> overseas<00:03:18.950> investment
