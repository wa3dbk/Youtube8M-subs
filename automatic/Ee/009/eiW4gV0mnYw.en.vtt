00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
feel strange at all the biggest

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.400 
feel strange at all the biggest
difference<00:01:06.850> is<00:01:07.150> we<00:01:07.479> have<00:01:07.690> on<00:01:07.869> this<00:01:07.990> car<00:01:08.259> we

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
difference is we have on this car we

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.140 
difference is we have on this car we
have<00:01:08.590> now<00:01:08.770> paddle<00:01:09.160> shift<00:01:09.430> on<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.700> gearbox

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
have now paddle shift on the gearbox

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.930 
have now paddle shift on the gearbox
rather<00:01:10.270> than<00:01:10.630> a<00:01:10.690> stick<00:01:11.350> shift<00:01:11.759> gastic<00:01:12.759> so

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
rather than a stick shift gastic so

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.100 
rather than a stick shift gastic so
that's<00:01:13.119> the<00:01:13.330> biggest<00:01:13.509> difference<00:01:13.780> when

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
that's the biggest difference when

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.770 
that's the biggest difference when
you're<00:01:14.229> driving<00:01:14.440> it<00:01:14.710> and<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:16.240> know<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.570> car
