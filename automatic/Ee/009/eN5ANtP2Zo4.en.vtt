 the work ever just buy a matter of coach points the code used m 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.730
 yourself for 5 percent off your columns the way the ns and had to 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.490
 with that at an opening that and you think 50 the back up plan started is profit through 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.709
 let's doiktas open the first place 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.199
 later hope for a team on the syrian and peel 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.100
 messi 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.880
 or ronaldo really cool your shit if you get ten ppe and we get that was the 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.880
 best there was also how it is certainly not wrong 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.349
 86 know it 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.079
 We were beautiful club as idiots have other games I can see the moss 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.480
 but does not yield anything for loans and the real money there either 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 but certainly not fss wrong he knows in the first 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.470
 I can certainly live my life so let's hope we are in second place 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.590
 get something better than fakking tbs ers yes we are now going to see choir that is hot 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.280
 believe me that one sees the tenth or this you do not see them 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.470
 and we already get to do it 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.470
 that is very unfortunate if you want something tering opinion 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.270
 we still get bojan from rossy 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.800
 and the other if you also just a moment 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.080
 not a wrong place where your job was not really returned in the last year 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.900
 similarly there are 58 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.009
 transocean feedback 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.910
 which does not take away the founders of tomtom 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:20.940
 team leader 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.940
 question 5 no crazy rising 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.680
 view that 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.080
 the president reads crosses 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.390
 but at least with the population and team on the syrian limited finnbogason 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.680
 enters for Jan Cock 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.300
 you know what i'm going to do i go the past we go a lot of bogeys on the 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.130
 Beyond seven in the comments from Fatah why you should actually win 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.960
