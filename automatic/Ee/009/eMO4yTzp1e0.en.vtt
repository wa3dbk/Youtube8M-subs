00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.209
 hello you love if you want to know 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.860
 how this wonderful cake was made 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:11.840
 then remains just off the 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.619
 first broken for you 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.020
 spoon biscuits gelatin 500 grams 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.200
 Quark then I have 500 grams 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.110
 oskar polak 1 200 grams whipped the 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.119
 160 grams of sugar are two packs 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.280
 Vanilla sugar then I have her 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.560
 cream cheese with blue beer taste if 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.750
 you can not find the blueberry 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.819
 also take all the most played and 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:43.729
 of course our blackberries and writes 

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:48.370
 that half through and put 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:48.370
 this is so small times 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.920
 I'll do that until I jumpform you 

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:05.000
 but they are not holding up yet 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.830
 Of course they will get through soon 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.830
 the floor bit to the side really 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.119
 that's how it looks when you're done 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.270
 are now we dress it again inside 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.850
 complete a 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.420
 First of all here are streets 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.420
 run 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:47.630
 that is with 26 springform bring and 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.560
 then it's just about it 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:02:02.810
 to fill in the gaps 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:02:05.840
 as it does not look like that then 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.280
 form lined out and now you can 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.560
 we start with the cream 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.420
 So as I said you have to look at each other 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.890
 we fly you together that is 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.660
 not nice now but the cream will 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.240
 Keep everything completely together 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.760
 that's important and that's right here 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.390
 so a bit in the series 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.660
 otherwise below 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.810
 they can then we can get everything in 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:32.090
 pack a bowl out of there the gelatin 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.630
 and the cream as or company 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.630
 mascarpone 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:16.700
 is expensive people then the sugar and 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.120
 Vanilla sugar I have now together 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.120
 mixed 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.160
 that's just what I mean 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.470
 only I have that only because of it 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.150
 the color bought so that so 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.730
 bit of purple will be without me there 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.770
 now dye must change rhine and 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.700
 I'll see, I'll test it right away 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:40.310
 I'll tell if I really do that now 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.410
 take both packs or just one 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:49.070
 I have to do that together and then 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:50.510
 I'll do the tasting 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.480
 I've never seen anything like this before 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.510
 I bought this now at edeka 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:02.060
 must watch their times whether we also 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:04.990
 I find the tasting 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.990
 lives 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:17.049
 yes it is delicious but I think so 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:31.350
 it is still a little bit brighter the 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:38.590
 other very fresh just right 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:41.140
 5 summer this is now an avalanche 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.530
 to pour in whipped cream 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.140
 yes, I can watch first I have now 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.000
 at edeka only those found 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.210
 if you have another team like Blatt 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.770
 gelatin or something just after 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.050
 Do not prepare the package instructions 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.700
 that this does not work for you and if you 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.080
 the gelatine but omits 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:04.170
 then I do not know if the crowd is stuck 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.370
 Enough is that after that 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:10.919
 Otherwise it can be that 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:13.930
 you ost the running out of shape out 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.640
 So I prepare this story once 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.540
 stop the fruits now 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.540
 fold 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.120
 and then you can do that on yours 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.120
 advantages 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:06:00.900
 then you can do that with fruits 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:02.100
 decorate and yes it has to be at least 56 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.440
 hours in any case in the 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.400
 fridge if you have time too 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.400
 like over night 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.380
 delicious 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.990
 so i have fun for the video 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.790
 I'm glad if you can 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.530
 make pie and not your pictures 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.310
 send and see you next 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.310
