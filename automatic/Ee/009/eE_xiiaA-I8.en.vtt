00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
of 85 and most of the time it just flies

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.260 
of 85 and most of the time it just flies
out<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:42.230> scrapes<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:43.280> bottom<00:04:43.639> of<00:04:43.820> the

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.670 
out and scrapes the bottom of the
stadium<00:04:44.690> so<00:04:45.650> I<00:04:46.040> might<00:04:46.280> do<00:04:46.460> that<00:04:46.610> but<00:04:47.680> yeah

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
stadium so I might do that but yeah

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.659 
stadium so I might do that but yeah
let's<00:04:48.919> try<00:04:49.430> it

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.180 

yeah<00:04:55.669> that's<00:04:55.970> what<00:04:56.210> I<00:04:56.240> mean<00:04:56.570> so<00:04:56.840> let's<00:04:57.800> try

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
yeah that's what I mean so let's try

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:05.650 
yeah that's what I mean so let's try
just<00:04:58.910> doing<00:04:59.300> it<00:04:59.419> from<00:04:59.570> the<00:04:59.660> middle<00:05:04.540> so<00:05:05.540> when

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
just doing it from the middle so when

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:12.190 
just doing it from the middle so when
you<00:05:05.750> do<00:05:05.870> a<00:05:05.900> sliding<00:05:06.380> shoot<00:05:10.630> it<00:05:11.630> kind<00:05:11.900> of<00:05:11.960> just

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
you do a sliding shoot it kind of just

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:19.570 
you do a sliding shoot it kind of just
scrapes<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:12.800> bottom<00:05:17.800> but<00:05:18.800> yeah<00:05:18.919> because<00:05:19.160> of

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
scrapes the bottom but yeah because of

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.050 
scrapes the bottom but yeah because of
its<00:05:19.729> 85<00:05:20.300> track<00:05:20.960> and<00:05:21.350> very<00:05:21.770> flat<00:05:22.460> extreme

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
its 85 track and very flat extreme

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.560 
its 85 track and very flat extreme
bottom<00:05:23.450> it<00:05:23.690> scrapes<00:05:24.620> a<00:05:24.830> lot<00:05:25.240> when<00:05:26.240> you<00:05:26.270> launch

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
bottom it scrapes a lot when you launch

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.480
