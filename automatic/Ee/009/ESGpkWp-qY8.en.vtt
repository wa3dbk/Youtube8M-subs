and if I saw one derelict somewhere I
would<00:00:56.460> buy<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.969> probably<00:00:57.750> use<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.079> for<00:00:58.109> parts

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
would buy and probably use it for parts

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.400 
would buy and probably use it for parts
yeah<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.520> one<00:00:59.789> was<00:01:00.239> was<00:01:00.899> behind<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
and that was it well she basically

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.480 
and that was it well she basically
chanced<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:42.869> almost<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.220> lucky

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
chanced on this almost it's just lucky

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.450 
chanced on this almost it's just lucky
and<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.970> didn't<00:01:45.390> know<00:01:45.450> what<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.689> was<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.460> but

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and I didn't know what it was and but

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.609 
and I didn't know what it was and but
once<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.880> knew<00:01:48.060> what<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.390> was<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:49.200> realized

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
once I knew what it was and I realized

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.679 
once I knew what it was and I realized
at<00:01:49.920> some<00:01:49.979> point<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.700> needed<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.210> restored

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
at some point it needed to be restored

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.530 
at some point it needed to be restored
properly<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.610> selected<00:01:53.610> parts<00:01:54.000> believe<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.450> or

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
properly so selected parts believe it or

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.300 
properly so selected parts believe it or
not<00:01:54.689> for<00:01:54.960> over<00:01:55.350> 30<00:01:55.770> years

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
not for over 30 years

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.459 
not for over 30 years
and<00:01:57.619> anyway<00:01:58.619> eventually<00:01:59.340> got<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.700> stage<00:02:00.000> where

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
and anyway eventually got to stage where

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.740 
and anyway eventually got to stage where
I<00:02:01.469> thought<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.130> was<00:02:02.310> time<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.360> and

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
I thought it was time to do it and

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.350 
I thought it was time to do it and
so<00:02:04.990> luckily<00:02:05.410> the<00:02:05.740> humans<00:02:06.130> agreed<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.700> do<00:02:06.850> well

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
so luckily the humans agreed to do well

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.200 
so luckily the humans agreed to do well
but<00:02:07.930> it's<00:02:08.350> really<00:02:09.070> turned<00:02:09.399> out<00:02:09.580> very<00:02:09.640> well

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
but it's really turned out very well

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.920 
but it's really turned out very well
they<00:02:10.450> are<00:02:10.740> miraculous<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:13.060> didn't<00:02:13.690> doubt

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
they are miraculous and I didn't doubt

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.080 
they are miraculous and I didn't doubt
that<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:14.470> would<00:02:14.650> end<00:02:14.800> up<00:02:14.950> like<00:02:15.160> if<00:02:15.880> they<00:02:16.030> were

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
that it would end up like if they were

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.350 
that it would end up like if they were
doing<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:16.660> very<00:02:17.410> pleased<00:02:17.710> what<00:02:18.580> are<00:02:18.730> some

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
doing it so very pleased what are some

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.610 
doing it so very pleased what are some
of<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.540> differences<00:02:19.900> between<00:02:20.080> a

that<00:03:31.150> that's<00:03:31.450> a<00:03:31.540> bonus<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.200> even<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.739> lot<00:03:33.640> of

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
that that's a bonus so even a lot of

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.729 
that that's a bonus so even a lot of
these<00:03:33.820> vehicles<00:03:34.060> though<00:03:34.870> -<00:03:34.930> really<00:03:35.620> are<00:03:35.650> a

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
these vehicles though - really are a

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.560 
these vehicles though - really are a
liar<00:03:36.070> because<00:03:36.910> they<00:03:37.030> were<00:03:37.090> trying<00:03:37.269> different

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
liar because they were trying different

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.479 
liar because they were trying different
things<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.320> refining<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.950> design<00:03:39.070> and

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
things and refining the design and

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.250 
things and refining the design and
that's<00:03:39.580> what<00:03:39.940> made<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.299> even<00:03:40.450> more<00:03:40.600> difficult

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
that's what made it even more difficult

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.199 
that's what made it even more difficult
to<00:03:41.320> restore<00:03:41.769> because<00:03:42.070> you<00:03:42.400> didn't<00:03:42.670> know<00:03:42.820> what

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
to restore because you didn't know what

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.060 
to restore because you didn't know what
was<00:03:43.510> original<00:03:44.049> or<00:03:44.170> what<00:03:44.320> should<00:03:44.560> be<00:03:44.739> there<00:03:44.950> and

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
was original or what should be there and

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.370 
was original or what should be there and
what<00:03:45.220> wasn't<00:03:45.459> there<00:03:45.670> luckily<00:03:46.360> I<00:03:46.840> did<00:03:47.200> have

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
what wasn't there luckily I did have

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.680 
what wasn't there luckily I did have
photographs<00:03:48.130> from<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.549> factory<00:03:49.000> when<00:03:49.570> it

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
photographs from the factory when it

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.810 
photographs from the factory when it
left<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.989> factory<00:03:50.080> so<00:03:50.709> we<00:03:50.739> got<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.400> pretty<00:03:51.610> good

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
left the factory so we got a pretty good

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.060 
left the factory so we got a pretty good
idea<00:03:52.000> from<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.540> other<00:03:52.660> side<00:03:52.900> what<00:03:53.769> it<00:03:53.920> was

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
idea from the other side what it was

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.220 
idea from the other side what it was
like

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
like

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.670 
like
a<00:03:55.290> luckily<00:03:56.099> this<00:03:56.280> vehicle<00:03:56.819> because<00:03:57.530> it<00:03:58.530> was

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
a luckily this vehicle because it was

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.910 
a luckily this vehicle because it was
rebuilt<00:03:59.250> by<00:03:59.610> that<00:04:00.000> garage<00:04:00.269> in<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.650> sort<00:04:01.890> of

rebuilt by that garage in the sort of

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
rebuilt by that garage in the sort of
late<00:04:02.099> 60s<00:04:03.530> they<00:04:04.530> didn't<00:04:04.799> throw<00:04:05.010> anything<00:04:05.250> away

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
late 60s they didn't throw anything away

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.820 
late 60s they didn't throw anything away
you<00:04:06.450> know<00:04:06.569> if<00:04:06.659> the<00:04:06.780> engine<00:04:07.080> wasn't<00:04:07.260> working

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
you know if the engine wasn't working

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.259 
you know if the engine wasn't working
normally<00:04:08.069> they<00:04:08.340> were<00:04:08.400> just<00:04:08.670> plunk<00:04:08.909> another

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
normally they were just plunk another

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.600 
normally they were just plunk another
engine<00:04:09.659> in<00:04:09.810> well<00:04:10.019> they<00:04:10.379> rebuilt<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.220> original

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
engine in well they rebuilt the original

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.030 
engine in well they rebuilt the original
engine<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:12.060> was<00:04:12.180> fortunate<00:04:12.420> so<00:04:13.170> I'm<00:04:13.349> very<00:04:13.590> lucky
