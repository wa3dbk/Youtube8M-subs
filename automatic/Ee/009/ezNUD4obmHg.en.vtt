00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.870
 how about spartan spartan fans 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:21.090
 that their dragon friend speaks to them again 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:25.150
 this time we are going to talk about the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.880
 preferences of this month in videogames 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.660
 we are in the middle of summer and the truth is 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.150
 I want to think the least 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.670
 can that's why it's no wonder they're 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.970
 so successful dovetail movies 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.020
 full of action shots and explosions in 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.120
 the cinemas 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.070
 so why not try this approach 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.040
 video games is something that can be 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.140
 think of a drug terror the new 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.230
 downloadable title published by deep 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.140
 silver which is more basic than the 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.500
 mechanism of a bic pen for those 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.140
 based on the slang of the games is 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.110
 it's about a perspective shooter 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.350
 overhead or this means that all 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.990
 the perspective is double stick aerial 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.850
 using the left hosting or they can 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.430
 use your keys to move us from 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.940
 right to left and you know how to shoot 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.860
 those and bullets to what of the game in the 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.710
 skin of a tough agent we have to do 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.869
 in front of a dangerous drug trafficker 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.810
 stop your shipments and rescue our 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.020
 dear daughter kidnapped the story is 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.990
 a truly 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.210
 bot bothered of the eighties 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.189
 typical of action heroes of 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.110
 those years for those who do not want me 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.990
 believe or those who already have enough 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:48.479
 time in all this they will remember the 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.610
 rambo comedy movies and who else 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.380
 who else nothing more and that can be 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.240
 boast throughout the adventure end 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.310
 everything that moves based on using 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.990
 grenades the four main weapons 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.869
 that can be improved that are gun 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.299
 shotgun submachine gun and gas link las 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.520
 occasional special flamethrower rays 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.130
 laser and grenade launcher you can do 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.319
 air attacks or fixed turrets to the other 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.150
 side of the bullets thousands of enemies without 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.980
 a pinch of brain that will vary in 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.349
 armament and armor to make them 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.069
 vary slightly weapon we use 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.780
 but not too much 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.519
 The truth is that during the first 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.340
 games were happening to me super 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.719
 super sweet pretty good as I was going 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.760
 getting different types of 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:33.939
 ammunition since they reminded me those 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.040
 those games called cons and cary 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:38.950
 that were a sensation there for the 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.840
 80s, there were lots of explosions 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.879
 of that there will be here too 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.189
 very much explosion however the 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.620
 fun was diluting quickly 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.780
 to get bored pretty well 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.410
 to be clearer the numbers of failures 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.360
 that they have 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.270
 it's good we're in games really 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.250
 I recommend them both a lot for 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.720
 those of us who were fans in a 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.000
 given moment of this type of video game 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.920
 It is a way to return to 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.840
 recoil to the retro version so the 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.210
 technical match is also not to throw 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.950
 rockets with frequent frame drops 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.910
 having many explosions that was 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.880
 scenarios 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.240
 and detailed and repetitive characters 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.830
 chronic embarrassing animations what 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.110
 better are the explosions that look 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.260
 pretty good and they make it at least be 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.420
 slightly entertaining overcome the 3 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.030
 hours of the game are 12 missions of the 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.060
 music is not beyond the medias 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.000
 very basic melodies and it seems that 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.390
 they are in a loop with voices in 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.280
 very unbeatable english 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.830
 well, now he dredges talking about 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.900
 English and how do not you have a super 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.500
 excellent English surely you will be able to 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.260
 to say no, what happens is that I'm 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.850
 looking in hindsight this game if you 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.040
 we can catalog for the games 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.230
 current at this time 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.120
 obviously it is not an option in 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.490
 conclusion to with terror can reach 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.040
 be entertained thanks to the show 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.620
 that always means blowing heaps 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.860
 of things and bastards in the air and 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.709
 be alone or accompanied since you have the 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.840
 cooperative system in which then 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.290
 well you can invite to play online a 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.130
 partner so they can disrupt what 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.890
 to be crossed 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.360
 that the many interests in the 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.370
 market of course it has its 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.580
 failures but that's not an excellent 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.330
 option so you can entertain and 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.030
 remember or you can ask yourself in 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.690
 historian's way what was played in 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:47.110
 the eighties and nineties is a game 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.280
 pretty short and its peak of difficulty 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.290
 they are too adjustable 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.970
 Well, that's the recommendation that 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.990
 we do them if they really want action 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.820
 explosions butchers fly everything 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.700
 they meet and remember those 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.660
 super games of the 80s is like 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:10.620
 against oy darling this is your best 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:14.850
 option for this summer I speak to you drac and 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.860
 he recommends them again to play the 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.760
 old games that are going to 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.090
 entertain 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:26.100
 little hands up we hope you subscribe 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.900
 with us and we will be in constant 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.800
 improvement 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.800
 Thank you
