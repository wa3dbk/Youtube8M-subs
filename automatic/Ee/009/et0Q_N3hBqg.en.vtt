techniques today of how to play scales
and<00:00:12.990> double<00:00:13.349> stops<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:14.269> start<00:00:15.269> with<00:00:15.480> thirds

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
and double stops and start with thirds

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.310 
and double stops and start with thirds
when<00:00:17.550> starting<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.029> practice<00:00:18.180> thirds<00:00:18.630> there's

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
when starting to practice thirds there's

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.519 
when starting to practice thirds there's
two<00:00:19.590> main<00:00:19.800> challenges<00:00:20.359> one<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.170> shift

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
two main challenges one is the shift

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.550 
two main challenges one is the shift
that<00:00:23.400> involves<00:00:26.180> going<00:00:27.180> from<00:00:27.599> from<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> third<00:00:28.439> in

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
that involves going from from a third in

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.779 
that involves going from from a third in
one<00:00:28.590> position<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> third<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.580> next

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
one position to a third in the next

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.420 
one position to a third in the next
position<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.779> next<00:00:31.109> challenge<00:00:31.470> or<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
position the next challenge or the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.549 
position the next challenge or the
second<00:00:32.850> challenge<00:00:33.000> excuse<00:00:33.510> me<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.410> find

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
second challenge excuse me is to find

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.310 
second challenge excuse me is to find
the<00:00:34.770> correct<00:00:35.100> hand<00:00:35.489> frame<00:00:35.790> when<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:36.989> 1/3

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
the correct hand frame when you have 1/3

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.500 
the correct hand frame when you have 1/3
or<00:00:37.860> 2/3<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.579> same<00:00:38.760> position<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.360> like<00:00:41.510> like

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
or 2/3 in the same position so like like

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.220 
or 2/3 in the same position so like like
that<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.860> let's<00:00:44.129> start<00:00:44.550> by<00:00:45.090> by<00:00:45.570> figuring<00:00:46.079> out

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
that so let's start by by figuring out

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.529 
that so let's start by by figuring out
some<00:00:46.530> good<00:00:46.649> exercises<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.940> really<00:00:48.270> solidify

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
some good exercises to really solidify

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.360 
some good exercises to really solidify
hand<00:00:49.500> positions<00:00:50.660> for<00:00:51.660> thirds<00:00:52.340> what<00:00:53.340> I

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
hand positions for thirds what I

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.830 
hand positions for thirds what I
recommend<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> following

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
recommend is to do is the following

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.740 
recommend is to do is the following
start<00:00:55.379> by<00:00:55.500> playing<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.160> third<00:00:56.370> C<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.600> g

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
start by playing the third C on the g

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.829 
start by playing the third C on the g
string<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.199> E<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> D<00:00:59.160> string<00:00:59.190> like<00:00:59.550> this

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.860 

until<00:01:04.839> that<00:01:04.960> feels<00:01:05.199> really<00:01:05.470> nicely<00:01:06.100> in<00:01:06.370> tune

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
until that feels really nicely in tune

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.600 
until that feels really nicely in tune
then<00:01:07.870> let's<00:01:08.500> take<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.740> second<00:01:09.220> finger<00:01:09.430> and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
then let's take the second finger and

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.440 
then let's take the second finger and
put<00:01:10.030> it<00:01:10.060> down<00:01:10.240> on<00:01:10.300> F<00:01:11.909> alternating<00:01:12.909> between<00:01:13.090> E

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
put it down on F alternating between E

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.600 
put it down on F alternating between E
and<00:01:13.540> F<00:01:13.810> making<00:01:14.500> sure<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.860> C<00:01:15.040> and<00:01:15.159> the<00:01:15.190> FF

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
and F making sure the C and the FF

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:24.920 
and F making sure the C and the FF
fourth<00:01:15.850> is<00:01:15.970> really<00:01:16.180> in<00:01:16.300> tune

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.660 

so<00:01:25.930> do<00:01:26.080> that<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.260> few<00:01:26.500> times<00:01:26.530> until<00:01:27.040> you<00:01:27.490> are

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
so do that a few times until you are

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.190 
so do that a few times until you are
really<00:01:27.970> able<00:01:28.120> to<00:01:28.330> land<00:01:28.480> consistent

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
really able to land consistent

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.640 
really able to land consistent
consistently<00:01:30.010> on<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.910> perfect<00:01:31.240> 4th<00:01:31.650> then

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
consistently on the perfect 4th then

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.070 
consistently on the perfect 4th then
let's<00:01:32.860> do<00:01:33.010> the<00:01:33.130> same<00:01:33.730> exercise<00:01:34.300> but<00:01:34.690> with<00:01:34.960> the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
let's do the same exercise but with the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.080 
let's do the same exercise but with the
fourth<00:01:35.350> finger<00:01:35.560> alternating<00:01:36.550> between<00:01:36.670> three

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
fourth finger alternating between three

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.870 
fourth finger alternating between three
and<00:01:37.120> four<00:01:37.510> on<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.470> g<00:01:38.830> string<00:01:38.860> so<00:01:39.550> you<00:01:39.610> get<00:01:39.850> a

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
and four on the g string so you get a

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:50.570 
and four on the g string so you get a
major<00:01:40.210> second<00:01:40.720> between<00:01:40.930> D<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.200> E

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.940 

the<00:01:51.580> next<00:01:51.940> step<00:01:52.150> is<00:01:52.420> that<00:01:53.080> I<00:01:53.380> recommend

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
the next step is that I recommend

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.880 
the next step is that I recommend
alternating<00:01:54.640> then<00:01:55.120> between<00:01:55.420> for<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.140> between

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
alternating then between for and between

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.010 
alternating then between for and between
two<00:01:57.160> so<00:01:58.120> we're<00:01:58.270> going<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.420> take<00:01:58.660> turns<00:01:58.810> we're

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
two so we're going to take turns we're

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.270 
two so we're going to take turns we're
going<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.200> start<00:01:59.440> by<00:01:59.590> putting<00:01:59.800> the<00:02:00.010> fourth

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
going to start by putting the fourth

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.730 
going to start by putting the fourth
finger<00:02:00.640> on<00:02:00.900> then<00:02:01.900> we're<00:02:02.080> gonna<00:02:02.170> put<00:02:02.650> the

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
finger on then we're gonna put the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.590 
finger on then we're gonna put the
second<00:02:03.100> finger<00:02:03.370> on<00:02:03.400> and<00:02:04.090> we're<00:02:04.180> gonna<00:02:04.270> lift

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
second finger on and we're gonna lift

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.330 
second finger on and we're gonna lift
fourth<00:02:04.930> finger<00:02:05.229> off<00:02:05.410> and<00:02:05.710> then<00:02:06.130> we're<00:02:06.220> going

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
fourth finger off and then we're going

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.609 
fourth finger off and then we're going
to<00:02:06.370> lift<00:02:06.550> second<00:02:07.090> finger<00:02:07.330> off<00:02:07.479> so<00:02:08.440> we're<00:02:08.530> going

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
to lift second finger off so we're going

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.510 
to lift second finger off so we're going
to<00:02:08.709> get<00:02:08.830> intervals<00:02:09.250> of<00:02:09.490> 4/3<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.690> seconds<00:02:11.520> by

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
to get intervals of 4/3 and seconds by

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.060 
to get intervals of 4/3 and seconds by
doing<00:02:12.790> this<00:02:12.880> exercise<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:14.260> just<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.709> repeat<00:02:14.830> it

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
doing this exercise so just to repeat it

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.350 
doing this exercise so just to repeat it
one<00:02:15.190> more<00:02:15.250> time<00:02:15.459> we're<00:02:15.760> gonna<00:02:15.850> put<00:02:16.090> fourth

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
one more time we're gonna put fourth

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.199 
one more time we're gonna put fourth
finger<00:02:16.630> down<00:02:16.810> then<00:02:17.740> second<00:02:18.160> finger<00:02:18.400> down<00:02:18.550> then

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
finger down then second finger down then

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.240 
finger down then second finger down then
lift<00:02:19.510> fourth<00:02:19.810> finger<00:02:20.140> then<00:02:20.680> lips<00:02:20.890> second

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
lift fourth finger then lips second

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:34.589 
lift fourth finger then lips second

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
until that feels really solid then for

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.610 
until that feels really solid then for
the<00:03:04.120> development<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.660> facility<00:03:05.170> independence

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
the development of facility independence

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.470 
the development of facility independence
of<00:03:05.710> the<00:03:05.800> fingers<00:03:06.100> we<00:03:06.760> can<00:03:06.790> also<00:03:07.060> try<00:03:07.300> that

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
of the fingers we can also try that

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
of the fingers we can also try that
twice<00:03:07.720> as<00:03:07.930> fast

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
twice as fast

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.110 
twice as fast
starting<00:03:09.070> with<00:03:09.190> putting<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.760> fourth<00:03:09.970> finger

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
starting with putting the fourth finger

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.210 
starting with putting the fourth finger
down<00:03:10.330> second<00:03:11.080> finger<00:03:11.260> down<00:03:11.410> lifting<00:03:11.980> for

down second finger down lifting for

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.290 
down second finger down lifting for
lifting<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:17.130> an<00:03:18.130> opposite

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
lifting to an opposite
