00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 then this I put it here perfect and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.059
 this is where I put it here 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.469
 great tomorrow it touches little cuddles 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.080
 then tomorrow I make a video I'm super 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:32.000
 defense that this law certainly 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:34.290
 undoubtedly all will be boys I am 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.710
 dearest girls today we are here with a 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.410
 video a little bit special a little different 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.379
 let's talk about the spit-eating defense of 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.219
 bumblebee guys because because I have them 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.710
 try all guys that is then two 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.420
 points are no when one is level 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.789
 maximum is another matter 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.489
 also because I'll show you now if 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.800
 we go on the global no the first to the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.160
 world that took three stars for that 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.300
 occupies the first position for 41 days 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:09.659
 the only way he has to defend itself and 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:13.290
 that is 123456 two of them are missing 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.500
 Statues do not know where he put if 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.500
 I'm not wrong 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.689
 ok , there are still six statues here 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.250
 defense enjoy the only way to 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.830
 defend yourself and this to stay in 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.299
 summit that then surely sometimes 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.900
 the year also asphalted every and today 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.990
 spit and but let's get back to us 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.390
 no we are not at the maximum level e 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.189
 we must also defend ourselves for by 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.310
 keep resources no 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.880
 and one says but how many times you defend yourself 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.780
 let's see 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.450
 come on let's go, here it is then 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.340
 I try all the omitted and changed 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.810
 after saying it in my opinion which is the only one 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.180
 way to defend yourself but let's get back here 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.909
 then it rises 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.140
 no dear at level 11 this has lost 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.450
 one has lost a rising base wagon ie 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.079
 granatire level 3 not even to say well 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.250
 are strong , however, even say oh well 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.340
 tanks all'undici this has not 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.629
 lost not one 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:19.019
 this thing he had is viduka riflemen 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:21.090
 a bit of a mix of all basic ascent ok 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.239
 from sit dear to 6 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.940
 now I tell myself wagons at 6 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.160
 they are not all this strong but basic 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.970
 assault the carrier 6 because why 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.819
 perhaps because there is no more double damage 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.489
 perhaps because they are now immortal but 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.489
 see let's go ahead and why baselitz 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:45.180
 chalks level xvi is fine bay climb 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.880
 dear to the 10 and ok wagons a behold ok 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.190
 this level 45 of two levels almost 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.579
 three levels less than me attacked me 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.680
 with a slight to 19 of pumpkin the 17 I have 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.860
 level 47 nearly four decades oliver 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.140
 17 so mild heavy Students 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.129
 who did not know this the level here 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:08.549
 49 level 20 of veil 20 maximum level 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:11.250
 this here level 22 19 level 47 for 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.660
 do well easy level 8 here base 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.220
 defense but this has deployed the troops 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.769
 he retired as you can see he has none 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.660
 lost not one 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.549
 ok this attacked me with i 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.690
 flaming at level 8 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.459
 now it's true 52 11 1 can buy them i 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.139
 diamonds rightly not 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.690
 but then I want to ask something but 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:37.200
 because they don't change the match making not 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:39.389
 more on points but on something there 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.650
 they have to invent something else 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:47.730
 12 level 18 lost 0 lost 0 is way 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.590
 basic defense this escaped well had 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.220
 four tanks at eight maybe 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.200
 at least I can afford this 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.880
 level 16 this paved me and there 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.720
 there was one who had attacked with him 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.120
 also the warriors at 18 to 17 sorry that 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.680
 I think it's at its best but it's gone 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.510
 however as you can see and I think that 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.099
 this is not just my register 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.280
 activity I think it's life list of 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.730
 many of us are not many many people 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.989
 that they don't buy diamonds then 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.370
 they go on normally no and therefore 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.729
 I say but because they don't change the match 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.260
 making and don't know how 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.440
 based 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.240
 at the level of your troops or why 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.940
 if our point is so good that I now 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.030
 which put us on the beach 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.370
 I'll have you destroyed so they come back 250 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.470
 points wins and then me 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.270
 puts people against level 30 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.250
 and then yes there after asphalt them all e 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.480
 I say to see to match making that works 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.640
 so however the other point is this 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.660
 guys now i found out how to do the 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.410
 perfect base 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.000
 do not you take the base as you like 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.370
 no as you like it then take the 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.660
 cousin rometti right here 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.680
 here you put it here or there perfect wait 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.460
 wait wait 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.290
 Here, no, now we are building here 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.170
 and the platform let's see if they succeed 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.480
 attack it anyway let's get back to us 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.830
 guys and the point is this 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.110
 the defense has become useless 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.690
 mainly because why the tanks 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.760
 not not so much for her even not so much 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.990
 for for aircraft sorry not so much 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.680
 the pumpkin and maybe a bit for the match 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.920
 making 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.230
 but more than anything else boys because the carts 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.450
 armed have become impossible to 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.980
 pull down if I level up here with i 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.710
 tanks level 4 because they don't 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.590
 powers because I hate them, Mr. Cremati 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.470
 level 4 I take them to the level I can 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.750
 to excuse down the bases that 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.300
 they are practically a little less strong than me 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.620
 then level 44 43 the trigger pulls down 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.290
 with tanks at 4 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.670
 because because there is no more double 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.440
 damage from explosive mines from cannons 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.180
 I think of explosive dogs then 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.450
 people who level tanks 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.130
 10 veil 11 against people like me like 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.960
 many orient surpassing people who do not 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.360
 use the lovers because they are closed in front of who 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.710
 buy the diamonds to make the attack 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.920
 to defend it is excluded from 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.660
 speech but for those like us who do not want 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.880
 spend alone and go on normally 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.740
 I say, but how does one then 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.800
 to defend oneself later became impossible 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.970
 in fact I hope I hope this video 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.800
 see the super sel even if I don't think so 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.060
 however in the next update that 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.470
 they will do soon 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.540
 I sincerely hope that the tanks 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.730
 remit double damage at least from 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.760
 I do n't say the least explosive cannons but 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.290
 at least from the cannons because if not 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.390
 they become impossible to throw down 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.920
 so guys I hope you have a video 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.690
 liked if you share my idea 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.850
 left a nice thumb there 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.850
 see you guys peace out next time
