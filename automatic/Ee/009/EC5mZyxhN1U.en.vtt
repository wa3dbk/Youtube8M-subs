other reason is that water provides

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.780 
other reason is that water provides
buoyancy<00:01:03.120> which<00:01:03.780> helps<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.470> body<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.979> float

and<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> wonderful<00:01:07.590> floating<00:01:08.400> we<00:01:09.119> can

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
and with the wonderful floating we can

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.370 
and with the wonderful floating we can
get<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.900> beautiful<00:01:10.670> gentle<00:01:11.720> stretching<00:01:12.720> that

get the beautiful gentle stretching that

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.120 
get the beautiful gentle stretching that
the<00:01:13.530> water<00:01:14.180> allows<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.659> body<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.020> do<00:01:16.439> without

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
the water allows the body to do without

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.200 
the water allows the body to do without
much<00:01:17.549> effort<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:19.229> water<00:01:19.470> also<00:01:20.000> offers<00:01:21.000> us

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
much effort the water also offers us

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.740 
much effort the water also offers us
resistance<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.920> more<00:01:23.220> difficult<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:24.180> move

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
resistance it's more difficult to move

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.789 
resistance it's more difficult to move
and<00:01:25.259> control<00:01:25.770> our<00:01:26.009> body<00:01:26.390> movements<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.799> water

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
and control our body movements in water

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.380 
and control our body movements in water
as<00:01:29.250> opposed<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.240> air<00:01:30.979> also<00:01:31.979> moving<00:01:32.430> through

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
as opposed to air also moving through

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.510 
as opposed to air also moving through
water<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:34.700> very<00:01:35.960> relaxing<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.590> relaxes<00:01:38.369> the

water is very relaxing it relaxes the
muscles<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.320> relaxes<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.350> joints<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.280> when

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
muscles it relaxes the joints and when

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.899 
muscles it relaxes the joints and when
we<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:42.000> relaxed<00:01:42.720> muscles<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.799> joints<00:01:44.009> we

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
we have relaxed muscles and joints we

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.370 
we have relaxed muscles and joints we
can<00:01:45.240> have<00:01:45.810> more<00:01:47.540> flexible<00:01:48.799> movements

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
can have more flexible movements

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.510 
can have more flexible movements
when<00:01:52.040> doing<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.670> water<00:01:52.939> Taichi<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:55.280> water

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
when doing the water Taichi the water

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.410 
when doing the water Taichi the water
temperature<00:01:56.240> should<00:01:56.540> be<00:01:56.600> warm<00:01:57.790> from<00:01:58.790> 88<00:01:59.390> to
