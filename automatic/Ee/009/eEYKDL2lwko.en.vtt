 Hello dear friends today tell 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.900
 how to use your laptop and 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.690
 phone when synchronizing exclusively 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.299
 by wi-fi without any wires 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.880
 here since it is already late 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.109
 connect it to the dog to disconnect it from 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.710
 charge here to rush to look for it all the more 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:30.210
 what numerous cable uses 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.610
 it leads to their deformation and so that's 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.280
 avoid it can be used in 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.239
 principle when synchronizing in the family 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.210
 device on exclusively by wifi up 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:47.789
 the speed will be a little slower 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:52.920
 and yet the result of you is not in principle 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.750
 cause not wait that long and so to 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.600
 this need to connect now 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:05.060
 on the wire now we will do it in 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:11.030
 In principle, everything is ready but still 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:13.860
 I show you here we are connected 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.280
 we go and now look, I just 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.040
 Why does everything work for development ? 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.810
 would 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.000
 already prepare everything did see 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.520
 iphone decided on the device 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.520
 definitely go to the overview tab 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:38.150
 programs go to the review Daria means 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.340
 we go down put a tick 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:46.280
 synchronized by this and pump wi fi 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:49.030
 fay fay and further means we press 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.030
 apply 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.080
 apply and sync 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.579
 year 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:14.910
 here 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:22.850
 but all of you look good options and how you 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:28.739
 see the device remained in place 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:32.390
 now we can say look here it is 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.390
 in my notes 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:46.410
 the rest just synced that's all 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.569
