00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
don't have to use one you can use a

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.170 
don't have to use one you can use a
one-third<00:00:46.530> cup<00:00:46.800> measure<00:00:47.070> which<00:00:47.340> I'll<00:00:47.520> use<00:00:47.760> in

potential cakes I use a knife to cut the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.219 
potential cakes I use a knife to cut the
plastic<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.920> half<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.850> take<00:01:12.060> one<00:01:12.390> corner<00:01:12.900> I

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
plastic in half and I take one corner I

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.890 
plastic in half and I take one corner I
just<00:01:13.799> want<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.010> move<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.760> side<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.840> I

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
just want to move this to the side so I

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.969 
just want to move this to the side so I
can<00:01:15.930> separate<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.560> one<00:01:17.369> corner<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.979> push

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
can separate it one corner and I push

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.940 
can separate it one corner and I push
down<00:01:20.400> from<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> top<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.960> from<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> sides

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
down from the top and in from the sides

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.870 
down from the top and in from the sides
and<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:24.360> start<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.229> form<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.710> into<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.520> little

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
and I start to form it into a little

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.880 
and I start to form it into a little
patty<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.869> i'm<00:01:28.290> looking<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.710> something

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
patty and i'm looking for something

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
that's about three inches in diameter

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.399 
that's about three inches in diameter
and<00:01:31.920> maybe<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.549> half-inch<00:01:33.240> thick<00:01:33.420> or<00:01:33.960> two

and maybe a half-inch thick or two

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.469 
and maybe a half-inch thick or two
thirds<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.860> an<00:01:34.979> inch<00:01:35.130> thick<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.549> as<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.360> could

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
thirds of an inch thick and as you could

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.480 
thirds of an inch thick and as you could
see<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.840> was<00:01:36.900> pushing<00:01:37.320> down<00:01:37.680> from<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> top<00:01:38.189> and

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
see I was pushing down from the top and

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.310 
see I was pushing down from the top and
in<00:01:38.970> from<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> sides<00:01:39.600> because<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.990> want<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.259> to

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
in from the sides because you want it to

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.620 
in from the sides because you want it to
be<00:01:40.409> very<00:01:40.500> compact<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.150> doesn't<00:01:42.329> fall

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
be very compact so that it doesn't fall

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.300 
be very compact so that it doesn't fall
apart<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.409> that's<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.770> first<00:01:43.920> one<00:01:46.040> now<00:01:47.040> for

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
apart so that's the first one now for

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.300 
apart so that's the first one now for
