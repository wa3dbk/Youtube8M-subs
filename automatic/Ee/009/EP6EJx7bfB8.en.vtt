00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
and they get aggressive reacting to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.960 
and they get aggressive reacting to
being<00:01:46.350> scared<00:01:46.619> by<00:01:46.680> aggression<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.430> it's

years you've been lied to

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.690 
years you've been lied to
there's<00:02:16.740> so<00:02:16.890> many<00:02:16.980> things<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.370> life<00:02:17.490> that<00:02:17.520> I've

been lied to about but this is probably
the<00:02:19.830> most<00:02:19.920> hurtful<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:20.580> turns<00:02:20.880> out<00:02:21.120> that

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
the most hurtful so it turns out that

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330 
the most hurtful so it turns out that

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
huh there's actually a better formula to

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.720 
huh there's actually a better formula to
figure<00:02:34.350> out<00:02:34.500> your<00:02:34.620> dog's<00:02:34.800> human<00:02:35.100> age<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.580> take

figure out your dog's human age you take

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.150 
figure out your dog's human age you take
10.5<00:02:36.420> dog<00:02:36.630> years<00:02:36.840> per<00:02:37.410> human<00:02:37.770> year<00:02:37.920> for<00:02:38.100> the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
10.5 dog years per human year for the

10.5 dog years per human year for the
first<00:02:38.340> two<00:02:38.580> years<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.180> then<00:02:39.240> four<00:02:39.960> dog<00:02:40.260> years

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
first two years and then four dog years

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.980 
first two years and then four dog years
per<00:02:41.160> human<00:02:41.550> year<00:02:41.730> for<00:02:42.030> every<00:02:42.330> year<00:02:42.510> after<00:02:42.960> that

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
per human year for every year after that

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.320 
per human year for every year after that
actually<00:02:43.590> not<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:43.980> simple<00:02:44.670> because<00:02:45.030> every

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
actually not that simple because every

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.580 
actually not that simple because every
breed<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.630> dog<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:45.930> different<00:02:46.080> just<00:02:46.500> like

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
breed of dog is different just like

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.810 
breed of dog is different just like
people<00:02:46.860> are<00:02:47.160> different<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.520> we're<00:02:47.670> not

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
people are different and we're not

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.750 
people are different and we're not
racist<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.540> for<00:02:48.750> example<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.410> Great<00:02:49.709> Dane<00:02:50.040> at<00:02:50.459> 10

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
racist so for example a Great Dane at 10

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.880 
racist so for example a Great Dane at 10
