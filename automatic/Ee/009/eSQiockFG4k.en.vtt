00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.170

 played in the conquest of the west 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.650

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.169
 the big comes from usa has the name of 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.800
 porta x rays is still today 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:29.169
 fastest horse on the quarter mile 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.680

 Cattle holder cowboys bred in usa around

 to afford and on the weekend even and 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.800
 quarter mile race to go 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.079
 the variety extends from riding 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.940
 drive over western sport and carriage 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.769
 to overcome obstacles 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.440
 and results from the typical 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:56.350
 Characteristics small so if 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.629
 they are curious because curiosity shows 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.519
 Do not be afraid 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.620
 horses are and that is very very 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.089
 important we have to look at the horses 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.629
 can leave just like the cowboy 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.600
 earlier 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.440
 they should be fearless and 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.580
 be resilient and mine 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.860
 Life insurance does not leave the premises 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.950
 quarter horses excite western riders 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.810
 of all kinds, the best for recreational riders 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.830
 or what is reality and that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.040
 reliability 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.740
 You really have a leisure partner 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.170
 you really have fun with the quarterback 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.080
 horse because it does not work against a 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.760
 but it really tries a 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.910
 to prepare pleasure and you can tell 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.410
 here on the meadow a brood mares 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.380
 as well as any man through the terrain 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.680
 rides it is just a walk 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.479
 save well the exterior feels one 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.190
 perfect quarter horses should 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.140
 have certain features 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:57.330
 breeder rolf-peter shows us a lot 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.979
 important that there are flowing lines of 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.030
 nodded by the rode through the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.979
 behind nice round down it 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.410
 important is a small party with one 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.030
 small wall width leggings so that 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.940
 kehlkopf beautiful course, if the 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.650
 horses gathered short fox in ears 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.640
 and beautiful big brown guard eyes of the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.550
 mirror into the character of a 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.950
 squares annoy that horse again 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.590
 strong horse and willing horse very much 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.269
 good horse he has a good field of vision 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.700
 by doing so do not need to be anxious 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.080
 the attitude is wonderful 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.910
 shoulder crack is nice and slanted 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.120
 put on the shoulder he can 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.769
 flat galloping flat tends to 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.890
 do not pick up the meeting 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.630
 the group is nice and diagonally down with 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.940
 low switzerland 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.080
 this should be good balance good 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.760
 Stability at stops 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.739
 nice to see the angles and 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.050
 the backhand left lung and the 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.530
 shoulder angle fit relatively well 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:02.200
 To each other very strong hull deep gives 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.410
 Stability is a good saddle sits 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.390
 then we want to hear very short because 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.739
 We want to have strong horses 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.379
 really many many miles 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.660
 can withstand and of course without hug 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.010
 a horse a horse always has to 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.060
 be respected that it on very 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.950
 healthy good hoven stands 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.200
 this horse breed is therefore the highest 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.819
 requirements in the leisure time as well as in the 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.450
 Sports area of â€‹â€‹the western riding school 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.450
