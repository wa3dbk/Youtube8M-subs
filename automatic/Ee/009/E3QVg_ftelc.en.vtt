00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.840
 and that's what I played 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.680
 this is the first video channel and 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.070
 probably no one will watch or is 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.710
 which in the case is a very light playing this 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.130
 Here is a round at the beginning of the callus 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.560
 hardy module and this was our first 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.550

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:56.000
 is equal to what came out with 198 then hit 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.000

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:16.130
 The carioca with people is giving up 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:16.130
 the league does not have an internal ramp for everyone 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:39.890
 I'm calling you 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:02:17.160
 it looks just their games under our 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:17.160
 I cry on all the phones, it does not go away 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:41.220
 away the best green cape 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:03:08.459
 paulo ae 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.459
