but it's not a foundation either so it's

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.330 
but it's not a foundation either so it's
like<00:01:14.509> it's<00:01:14.780> kind<00:01:15.110> of<00:01:15.140> sits<00:01:15.469> in<00:01:15.619> between<00:01:16.100> the

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
thing that I don't like about it is the

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.429 
thing that I don't like about it is the
fact<00:01:58.759> that<00:01:58.880> really<00:01:59.210> has<00:01:59.359> one<00:01:59.630> shade<00:02:00.020> so<00:02:00.289> that

kind of sucks for girls so I guess I'm

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.620

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
light to medium skin tone this will work

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.760

8:35 and this is like borderline kind of

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.180 
8:35 and this is like borderline kind of
crossing<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:17.750> path<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.320> making<00:02:18.500> me<00:02:18.860> look<00:02:19.100> a

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
I don't know I just think that poor

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.050 
I don't know I just think that poor
girls<00:02:27.200> will<00:02:27.560> just<00:02:27.590> submit<00:02:28.340> more<00:02:28.520> than<00:02:28.730> Mack<00:02:28.880> in

c35 you might not work for you it does

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.620 
c35 you might not work for you it does
come<00:02:32.060> on<00:02:32.590> Ashley<00:02:33.590> first<00:02:34.190> but<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:35.000> does<00:02:35.240> adjust

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
come on Ashley first but it does adjust

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.960 
come on Ashley first but it does adjust
your<00:02:35.960> skin<00:02:36.200> tone<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:36.890> I'm<00:02:36.980> not<00:02:37.220> sure<00:02:37.490> for<00:02:37.700> girls

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
your skin tone so I'm not sure for girls

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.430 
your skin tone so I'm not sure for girls
who<00:02:38.120> are<00:02:38.150> bit<00:02:38.660> darker

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
who are bit darker

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.980 
who are bit darker
you<00:02:39.680> might<00:02:39.950> just<00:02:40.030> adjust<00:02:41.030> your<00:02:41.180> skin<00:02:41.540> tone<00:02:41.810> but

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
you might just adjust your skin tone but

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.890 
you might just adjust your skin tone but
for<00:02:42.170> me<00:02:42.350> I<00:02:42.620> still<00:02:43.220> feel<00:02:43.520> like<00:02:43.700> it<00:02:44.270> might<00:02:44.570> be

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
for me I still feel like it might be

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.950 
for me I still feel like it might be
like<00:02:45.170> a<00:02:45.650> little<00:02:45.740> bit<00:02:46.190> too<00:02:46.490> white<00:02:46.850> but<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.660> think

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
like a little bit too white but I think

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.500 
like a little bit too white but I think
I<00:02:48.050> can<00:02:48.230> still<00:02:48.470> pull<00:02:48.770> it<00:02:48.920> off<00:02:49.510> hopefully

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
I can still pull it off hopefully

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.600 
I can still pull it off hopefully
another<00:02:51.470> thing<00:02:51.710> that<00:02:51.890> I<00:02:51.920> don't<00:02:52.100> like<00:02:52.220> about

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
another thing that I don't like about

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.240 
another thing that I don't like about
this<00:02:53.240> is<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.600> fact<00:02:53.960> that<00:02:54.320> it<00:02:54.590> doesn't<00:02:54.830> love

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
this is the fact that it doesn't love

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.600 
this is the fact that it doesn't love
you<00:02:55.970> I<00:02:56.570> guess<00:02:56.960> as<00:02:57.380> much<00:02:57.440> coverage<00:02:58.130> as

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
you I guess as much coverage as

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.090 
you I guess as much coverage as
foundation<00:02:59.330> does<00:02:59.570> for<00:03:00.320> girls<00:03:00.590> who<00:03:00.740> need<00:03:00.950> that

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
foundation does for girls who need that

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.030 
foundation does for girls who need that
extra<00:03:01.160> coverage<00:03:01.550> I<00:03:02.030> would<00:03:02.300> say<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:03.040> this

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
extra coverage I would say that this

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.360 
extra coverage I would say that this
wouldn't<00:03:04.430> do<00:03:04.880> it<00:03:05.030> for<00:03:05.240> you<00:03:05.360> I<00:03:06.350> definitely<00:03:07.160> have

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
wouldn't do it for you I definitely have

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.570 
wouldn't do it for you I definitely have
to<00:03:07.580> use<00:03:07.610> maybe<00:03:08.300> like<00:03:08.570> a<00:03:08.600> concealer<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.560> kind<00:03:10.520> of

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
to use maybe like a concealer to kind of

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.310 
to use maybe like a concealer to kind of
cover<00:03:10.820> up<00:03:11.000> all<00:03:11.150> those<00:03:11.240> kind<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.600> prominent

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
cover up all those kind of prominent

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.380 
cover up all those kind of prominent
blemishes<00:03:12.890> like<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.250> haven't<00:03:13.460> done<00:03:13.610> here<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:14.330> I

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.960 
video and but maybe four girls would
medium<00:05:21.470> to<00:05:21.590> deep<00:05:21.770> skin<00:05:22.040> turns<00:05:22.340> who<00:05:22.910> are

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
medium to deep skin turns who are

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.400 
medium to deep skin turns who are
greater<00:05:23.210> than<00:05:23.330> Mac<00:05:23.810> into<00:05:24.169> 35<00:05:24.620> I<00:05:25.040> would<00:05:25.820> say

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
greater than Mac into 35 I would say

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.230 
greater than Mac into 35 I would say
yeah<00:05:27.410> being<00:05:27.740> more<00:05:27.980> the<00:05:28.100> caution<00:05:28.520> side<00:05:28.790> I'm<00:05:29.030> not

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
yeah being more the caution side I'm not

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.450 
yeah being more the caution side I'm not
sure<00:05:29.390> how<00:05:29.600> this<00:05:29.840> would<00:05:30.110> actually<00:05:30.340> go<00:05:31.340> with

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
sure how this would actually go with

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.980 
sure how this would actually go with
your<00:05:31.610> skin<00:05:31.820> tone<00:05:32.090> but<00:05:32.330> for<00:05:32.540> girls<00:05:32.630> were

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
your skin tone but for girls were

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.080 
your skin tone but for girls were
lighter<00:05:33.380> than<00:05:33.710> that<00:05:33.740> I<00:05:34.070> think<00:05:34.729> this<00:05:34.910> would

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
lighter than that I think this would

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.110 
lighter than that I think this would
actually<00:05:35.450> work<00:05:35.570> really<00:05:35.780> well<00:05:35.960> for<00:05:36.020> you<00:05:36.260> so
