lawn tractor of all you need to find out

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.570 
lawn tractor of all you need to find out
where<00:00:08.250> your<00:00:08.370> fuel<00:00:08.639> line<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:09.800> on<00:00:10.800> some<00:00:11.160> tractors

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
where your fuel line is on some tractors

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.129 
where your fuel line is on some tractors
that<00:00:11.610> will<00:00:11.849> be<00:00:11.969> on<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.179> right<00:00:12.330> hand<00:00:12.360> side<00:00:12.690> on

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
that will be on the right hand side on

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.509 
that will be on the right hand side on
some<00:00:13.469> others<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:13.950> will<00:00:14.040> be<00:00:14.160> on<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.400> other

going to the fuel pump so I'm going to

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.960 
going to the fuel pump so I'm going to
install<00:00:21.810> my<00:00:21.869> fuel<00:00:22.590> shutoff<00:00:22.890> valve<00:00:23.250> somewhere

a bit better made out of metal that will

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.770 
a bit better made out of metal that will
do<00:00:34.530> as<00:00:34.649> well<00:00:34.860> you're<00:00:35.579> also<00:00:35.760> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> need<00:00:36.270> two

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
arrow on the fuel cutoff valve and this

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.240 
arrow on the fuel cutoff valve and this
is<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.210> arrow<00:00:45.390> pointing<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.500> flow<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
is the arrow pointing the flow of the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.150 
is the arrow pointing the flow of the
fuel<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:48.629> if<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.050> fuel<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.379> flowing<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.100> way

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
fuel so if the fuel is flowing this way

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.049 
fuel so if the fuel is flowing this way
to<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.120> fuel<00:00:51.390> pump<00:00:51.690> or<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.620> carburetor<00:00:53.129> then

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
to the fuel pump or the carburetor then

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.119 
to the fuel pump or the carburetor then
the<00:00:54.270> arrow<00:00:54.510> would<00:00:55.140> have<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.410> be<00:00:55.530> pointing<00:00:55.949> that

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the arrow would have to be pointing that

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:56.630 
the arrow would have to be pointing that
way

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640
