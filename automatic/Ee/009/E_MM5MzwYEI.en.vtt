00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.670
 name is reservista lasso and welcome 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.100
 to a new video where I'm going to show you 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.990
 how to download and install the texture of 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.970
 pokemon for a minecraft is worth 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.070
 you can see this the reason 1 point 4.7 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.900
 I have also tested it in 1.4 point 5 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.539
 I do not know if the centrals come to serve 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.309
 but good does not lose anything with removing it and 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.809
 as you can see here in this law everything is not 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.239
 worry about me right now I'm going to 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.440
 teach them how to install it, and 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.750
 well I'm going to start a world so that 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.000
 you see how is this texture and 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.850
 you can see that here at the moment of 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.190
 start mostly totally different 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.540
 to a pokemon style very well with him les 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.579
 would come in handy with what is the mode 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.400
 of pokemon 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.980
 and good 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.180
 the texture looks very good as they can 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.060
 see here I have installed the mode of 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.980
 pokemon but good those are the trees 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.230
 they change the wings they change what we have 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.620
 the apples the seeds and all change 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.970
 ok guys and well I think that with 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.020
 this is enough for them to have seen what 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.810
 it's more or less we're 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.930

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.310

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.810
