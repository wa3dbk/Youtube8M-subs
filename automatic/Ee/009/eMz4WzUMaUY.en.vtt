you they blended the shadows out so it

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.110 
you they blended the shadows out so it
was<00:01:45.440> just<00:01:45.680> a<00:01:45.770> touch<00:01:46.010> of<00:01:46.190> color<00:01:46.430> but<00:01:46.550> I<00:01:46.820> just

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
was just a touch of color but I just

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.850 
was just a touch of color but I just
wasn't<00:01:47.450> a<00:01:47.660> fan<00:01:47.840> of<00:01:47.870> that<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:48.320> I<00:01:48.350> ended<00:01:48.770> up

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
wasn't a fan of that so I ended up

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.920 
wasn't a fan of that so I ended up
making<00:01:49.040> my<00:01:49.340> look<00:01:49.580> a<00:01:49.730> little<00:01:49.910> bit<00:01:50.090> darker<00:01:50.300> just

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
making my look a little bit darker just

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.570 
making my look a little bit darker just
because<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.290> past<00:01:51.530> four<00:01:51.770> years<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:52.070> victoria
