other<00:01:14.549> game<00:01:14.759> has<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.359> level<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.229> destruction

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
other game has this level of destruction

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.249 
other game has this level of destruction
and<00:01:17.420> definitely<00:01:18.420> know<00:01:18.630> what<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> game<00:01:18.990> has

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
and definitely know what the game has

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.620 
and definitely know what the game has
this<00:01:19.500> over<00:01:19.920> network<00:01:20.340> which<00:01:20.819> has<00:01:21.179> been<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> real

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
this over network which has been a real

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.840 
this over network which has been a real
challenge<00:01:21.659> because<00:01:22.340> every<00:01:23.340> wall<00:01:23.549> every

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
challenge because every wall every

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.050 
challenge because every wall every
object<00:01:24.530> everything<00:01:25.530> all<00:01:26.069> the<00:01:26.310> effects<00:01:26.939> have

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
object everything all the effects have

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.059 
object everything all the effects have
to<00:01:27.179> play<00:01:27.390> networks<00:01:28.079> and<00:01:29.390> yeah<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.630> not<00:01:30.780> easy

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:31.069 
to play networks and yeah it's not easy

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:35.990 
to play networks and yeah it's not easy
which<00:01:32.069> is<00:01:32.219> why<00:01:32.340> we're<00:01:32.549> doing<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:34.819> so<00:01:35.819> I<00:01:35.849> mean

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
which is why we're doing this so I mean

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.649 
which is why we're doing this so I mean
the<00:01:36.990> destruction<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.770> not<00:01:38.129> only<00:01:38.579> looking<00:01:39.479> nice

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the destruction is not only looking nice

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.539 
the destruction is not only looking nice
it<00:01:39.959> actually<00:01:40.170> matters<00:01:40.530> when<00:01:41.129> you<00:01:41.250> destroy

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
it actually matters when you destroy

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.469 
it actually matters when you destroy
stuff<00:01:43.250> when<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.369> go<00:01:44.489> through<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.789> house<00:01:45.090> and

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
stuff when you go through a house and

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.690 
stuff when you go through a house and
you<00:01:45.989> see<00:01:46.229> someone<00:01:46.679> in<00:01:46.860> there<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.189> can<00:01:47.429> just

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
you see someone in there you can just

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.880 
you see someone in there you can just
blow<00:01:48.689> away<00:01:48.780> his<00:01:49.649> wall<00:01:49.890> discover<00:01:50.399> or<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.780> use<00:01:52.739> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
blow away his wall discover or I use the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.130 
blow away his wall discover or I use the
tank<00:01:53.159> running<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.569> pass<00:01:55.110> a

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
tank running for you and you pass a

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.349 
tank running for you and you pass a
bridge<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:55.950> blow<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.819> up<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.179> he'll

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
bridge you can just blow it up and he'll

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:02.539 
bridge you can just blow it up and he'll
fall<00:01:57.810> down<00:01:57.989> to<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.200> hopefully<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:01.530> all<00:02:02.219> kinds

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
fall down to it hopefully so all kinds

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.130 
fall down to it hopefully so all kinds
of<00:02:02.609> stuff<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:03.060> be<00:02:03.119> destroyed<00:02:03.569> and<00:02:03.719> most

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
of stuff can be destroyed and most

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.199 
of stuff can be destroyed and most
everything<00:02:04.769> has<00:02:05.129> partial<00:02:05.640> destruction<00:02:05.789> as

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
everything has partial destruction as

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.559 
everything has partial destruction as
well<00:02:07.489> listen<00:02:08.489> here<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.819> can<00:02:08.910> see<00:02:09.060> some<00:02:09.090> couple

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.840 

we<00:02:15.380> try<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.620> create<00:02:15.980> almost<00:02:16.310> every<00:02:16.670> object

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
we try to create almost every object

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.180 
we try to create almost every object
destructible<00:02:18.130> that's<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.280> most<00:02:20.000> fun<00:02:20.240> but<00:02:21.190> of

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
destructible that's the most fun but of

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.260 
destructible that's the most fun but of
course<00:02:22.460> we<00:02:22.550> have<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.730> keep<00:02:22.820> some<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
course we have to keep some of the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.570 
course we have to keep some of the
objects<00:02:23.540> still<00:02:24.110> indestructible<00:02:24.500> for<00:02:25.040> for<00:02:25.490> the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
objects still indestructible for for the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.790 
objects still indestructible for for the
gameplay<00:02:25.940> otherwise<00:02:26.870> we<00:02:27.080> have<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.260> totally

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
gameplay otherwise we have a totally

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.280 
gameplay otherwise we have a totally
flat<00:02:28.040> world<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.940> that's<00:02:29.060> not<00:02:29.570> so<00:02:29.750> much<00:02:29.960> fun

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.480 

but<00:02:33.290> maybe<00:02:33.470> in<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.620> usual<00:02:33.740> game<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.160> would<00:02:34.280> see

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
but maybe in a usual game you would see

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.670 
but maybe in a usual game you would see
these<00:02:35.330> sound<00:02:35.600> bags<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.020> you<00:02:36.080> can't<00:02:36.290> get<00:02:36.410> past

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
these sound bags and you can't get past

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.100 
these sound bags and you can't get past
them<00:02:36.860> why<00:02:37.040> not<00:02:37.070> shoot<00:02:37.610> them<00:02:37.850> down<00:02:38.000> instead

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.250 

oops<00:02:43.420> now<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:44.450> happen<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.780> shoot<00:02:44.990> down<00:02:45.110> the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
oops now I happen to shoot down the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.900 
oops now I happen to shoot down the
barrels<00:02:45.680> as<00:02:45.980> well<00:02:46.220> because<00:02:46.490> we<00:02:46.610> have<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.760> lot<00:02:46.880> of

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
barrels as well because we have a lot of

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.790 
barrels as well because we have a lot of
chain<00:02:47.150> reactions<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.750> chain<00:02:48.260> reactions<00:02:48.709> to

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
chain reactions and chain reactions to

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.040 
chain reactions and chain reactions to
the<00:02:48.890> game<00:02:49.070> so<00:02:49.310> if<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:50.270> shoot<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.450> barrel<00:02:50.840> it

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
the game so if you shoot a barrel it

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.479 
the game so if you shoot a barrel it
might<00:02:51.230> hear<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.500> car<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.100> car<00:02:52.250> might

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
might hear the car and the car might

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.220 
might hear the car and the car might
explode<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.120> might<00:02:53.390> hit<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.570> tree<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:54.080> falls

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
explode it might hit a tree that falls

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.530 
explode it might hit a tree that falls
down<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.770> house<00:02:55.270> that's<00:02:56.270> really<00:02:56.450> funny

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
down to the house that's really funny

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.030 
down to the house that's really funny
can<00:02:56.959> you<00:02:56.989> get<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.470> can<00:02:57.590> have<00:02:57.739> unexpected

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
can you get you can have unexpected

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.830 
can you get you can have unexpected
scenes<00:02:58.989> here<00:02:59.989> we<00:03:00.080> have<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.230> couple<00:03:00.410> of<00:03:00.590> trees

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
scenes here we have a couple of trees

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.420 
scenes here we have a couple of trees
what<00:03:02.840> happens<00:03:03.080> if<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.320> blow<00:03:03.620> draenei<00:03:03.920> beside<00:03:04.280> it

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
what happens if I blow draenei beside it

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.000 
what happens if I blow draenei beside it
the<00:03:04.690> trees<00:03:05.690> phones<00:03:07.330> yeah<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.720> that<00:03:09.530> also<00:03:09.739> goes

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
the trees phones yeah and that also goes

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.560 
the trees phones yeah and that also goes
for<00:03:10.070> if<00:03:10.550> it<00:03:10.760> falls<00:03:11.120> down<00:03:11.270> on<00:03:11.420> enemy<00:03:12.200> AI<00:03:12.459> he'll

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
for if it falls down on enemy AI he'll

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.420 
for if it falls down on enemy AI he'll
probably<00:03:14.570> die<00:03:14.870> from<00:03:15.140> it<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:18.650> let's<00:03:18.980> jump<00:03:19.280> into

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
probably die from it and let's jump into

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:30.360 
probably die from it and let's jump into
a<00:03:19.549> tank<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:19.970> see<00:03:20.120> what<00:03:20.239> happens

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.150 

there<00:03:30.940> we<00:03:31.030> go

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.830 

as<00:03:35.520> we<00:03:35.700> said<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:35.940> mean<00:03:36.210> most<00:03:36.360> objects<00:03:36.720> are

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
as we said I mean most objects are

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.780 
as we said I mean most objects are
destructible<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.710> can<00:03:38.040> also<00:03:38.190> run<00:03:38.550> down

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
destructible so you can also run down

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.100 
destructible so you can also run down
trees<00:03:39.090> with<00:03:40.020> a<00:03:40.050> tank<00:03:40.350> for<00:03:40.710> example<00:03:42.110> create

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
trees with a tank for example create

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.970 
trees with a tank for example create
some<00:03:43.260> obstacles<00:03:43.890> in<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.100> way<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:49.530> obviously

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
some obstacles in the way and obviously

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.340 
some obstacles in the way and obviously
that's<00:03:50.160> also<00:03:50.520> a<00:03:50.600> kind<00:03:51.600> of<00:03:51.720> tactical<00:03:52.110> thing

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
that's also a kind of tactical thing

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.020 
that's also a kind of tactical thing
because<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.800> can<00:03:53.010> run<00:03:53.220> through<00:03:53.460> a<00:03:53.490> entire

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
because you can run through a entire

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.360 
because you can run through a entire
forest<00:03:54.450> with<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.690> tank<00:03:54.930> if<00:03:55.050> you<00:03:55.140> want<00:03:55.320> to<00:03:55.500> and

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
forest with a tank if you want to and

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.450 
forest with a tank if you want to and
run<00:03:56.610> through<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.820> like<00:03:56.970> butter<00:03:58.010> but<00:03:59.010> with<00:03:59.430> a

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
run through it like butter but with a

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.690 
run through it like butter but with a
Humvee<00:03:59.850> you<00:04:00.150> will<00:04:00.980> smash<00:04:01.980> into<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.250> tree<00:04:02.550> and

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
Humvee you will smash into the tree and

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.860 
Humvee you will smash into the tree and
just<00:04:03.450> stop<00:04:03.900> by<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.230> I<00:04:04.880> mean<00:04:05.880> well<00:04:06.270> when<00:04:06.630> we've

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
just stop by it I mean well when we've

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.750 
just stop by it I mean well when we've
got<00:04:06.900> used<00:04:07.350> to<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.770> multiplayer<00:04:08.160> tests<00:04:08.580> now

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
got used to the multiplayer tests now

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
got used to the multiplayer tests now
here<00:04:09.590> battlefield<00:04:10.590> bad<00:04:10.740> company<00:04:10.890> it's<00:04:11.780> you

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
don't want to go back to any other game

don't want to go back to any other game
that<00:04:14.550> doesn't<00:04:14.940> have<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.210> destruction<00:04:16.140> because

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630

reaction<00:04:49.900> makes<00:04:50.290> the<00:04:50.440> trees<00:04:50.680> fall<00:04:51.010> as<00:04:51.220> well

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
reaction makes the trees fall as well

reaction makes the trees fall as well
I'll<00:04:53.860> go<00:04:53.980> see<00:04:54.130> out<00:04:54.220> like<00:04:54.370> hamster<00:04:54.850> I<00:04:55.650> always

safe and then there are effects of

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.680 
safe and then there are effects of
different<00:05:06.220> scale<00:05:06.640> of<00:05:06.850> course<00:05:07.150> we're<00:05:07.420> trying

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
different scale of course we're trying

and how far we can take it yeah we've
done<00:05:12.850> some<00:05:13.090> really<00:05:13.450> cool<00:05:13.660> testing<00:05:14.140> but<00:05:14.410> I<00:05:14.470> mean

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
done some really cool testing but I mean

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.910 
done some really cool testing but I mean
scale<00:05:15.700> wise<00:05:15.940> we<00:05:16.750> want<00:05:16.960> to<00:05:17.050> want<00:05:17.530> to<00:05:17.590> have<00:05:17.740> a

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
scale wise we want to want to have a

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.650 
scale wise we want to want to have a
destruction<00:05:18.370> that<00:05:18.610> fits<00:05:19.360> with<00:05:19.600> the

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
destruction that fits with the

everything you will see that you have
been<00:06:27.360> there<00:06:30.080> yeah<00:06:31.080> so<00:06:31.290> one<00:06:31.410> last<00:06:31.590> thing<00:06:31.830> we<00:06:31.950> can

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980 
been there yeah so one last thing we can

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.700 
been there yeah so one last thing we can
point<00:06:32.250> out<00:06:32.430> is<00:06:32.670> to<00:06:33.290> dynamic<00:06:34.290> side<00:06:34.470> of<00:06:34.590> this

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
point out is to dynamic side of this

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.050 
point out is to dynamic side of this
everything<00:06:35.580> is<00:06:35.670> dynamic<00:06:36.120> and<00:06:37.760> the<00:06:38.760> game<00:06:38.940> we

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
everything is dynamic and the game we

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.460 
everything is dynamic and the game we
can<00:06:39.210> rotate<00:06:39.330> the<00:06:39.630> Sun<00:06:39.810> here<00:06:39.990> just<00:06:40.170> to<00:06:40.260> show<00:06:40.440> off

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
can rotate the Sun here just to show off

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.590 
can rotate the Sun here just to show off
what<00:06:41.400> happens<00:06:41.760> you<00:06:41.970> know<00:06:42.060> all<00:06:42.240> the<00:06:42.360> particles

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
what happens you know all the particles

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.980 
what happens you know all the particles
are<00:06:42.960> dynamic<00:06:43.470> dynamical<00:06:44.430> it's<00:06:44.670> and<00:06:45.000> how

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
are dynamic dynamical it's and how

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.030 
are dynamic dynamical it's and how
successful<00:06:46.050> also<00:06:48.410> and<00:06:49.410> we<00:06:49.530> have<00:06:49.650> to<00:06:49.770> do<00:06:49.890> that

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
successful also and we have to do that

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.370 
successful also and we have to do that
because<00:06:50.220> everything<00:06:50.850> is<00:06:51.170> changing<00:06:52.170> all<00:06:52.320> the

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 
because everything is changing all the

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.580 
because everything is changing all the
time<00:06:52.500> so<00:06:53.250> nothing<00:06:53.580> can<00:06:53.610> be<00:06:53.880> static<00:06:54.210> and<00:06:54.420> we<00:06:55.320> try

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
time so nothing can be static and we try

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.050 
time so nothing can be static and we try
to<00:06:55.620> push<00:06:55.800> this<00:06:56.010> real<00:06:56.310> far<00:06:56.580> so<00:06:56.730> we<00:06:56.820> can<00:06:56.940> have

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 
to push this real far so we can have

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.670 
to push this real far so we can have
dynamic<00:06:57.270> weather<00:06:57.660> as<00:06:57.870> well<00:06:58.020> and<00:06:58.260> you<00:06:58.380> will<00:06:58.530> see

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
dynamic weather as well and you will see

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.920 
dynamic weather as well and you will see
the<00:06:58.830> light<00:06:58.980> change<00:06:59.340> during<00:07:00.180> gameplay<00:07:00.480> so<00:07:00.720> you

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
the light change during gameplay so you

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.740 
the light change during gameplay so you
can<00:07:01.080> start<00:07:01.290> with<00:07:01.440> the<00:07:01.500> morning<00:07:01.950> and<00:07:02.100> end<00:07:02.250> up<00:07:02.370> an

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:02.750 
can start with the morning and end up an

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.500 
can start with the morning and end up an
overcast<00:07:03.750> afternoon

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:07.510
