00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
all go get room pressure regulators like

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.450 
all go get room pressure regulators like
that<00:01:25.380> Holley<00:01:25.590> right<00:01:25.890> there<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.130> put<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.340> on

about him well the truth of the matter
is<00:01:55.950> 30<00:01:56.790> years<00:01:57.030> ago<00:01:57.240> they<00:01:57.420> had<00:01:57.570> lead<00:01:57.840> liquid

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
is 30 years ago they had lead liquid

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.069 
is 30 years ago they had lead liquid
lead<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> gas<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.479> took<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.689> lot<00:02:00.869> more

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
lead in the gas and it took a lot more

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.690 
lead in the gas and it took a lot more
pressure<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.560> pump<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.159> try<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.399> pump

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
pressure to pump it and you try to pump

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.420 
pressure to pump it and you try to pump
this<00:02:02.880> alcohol<00:02:03.329> based<00:02:03.719> up<00:02:04.020> with<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.950> LED

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
this alcohol based up with that LED

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.819 
this alcohol based up with that LED
powered<00:02:06.090> pump<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:07.259> blow<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.680> right

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
powered pump that blow the right

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.050 
powered pump that blow the right
straight<00:02:08.099> through<00:02:08.129> there<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> needles<00:02:08.879> won't

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
straight through there the needles won't

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.559 
straight through there the needles won't
hold<00:02:09.270> it

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
hold it

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.140 
hold it
the<00:02:09.959> floats<00:02:10.229> won't<00:02:10.500> hold<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
the floats won't hold it

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.750 
the floats won't hold it
so<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.209> end<00:02:12.480> up<00:02:12.510> with<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.749> flooding<00:02:13.170> mess<00:02:13.760> and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
so you end up with a flooding mess and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.009 
so you end up with a flooding mess and
of<00:02:14.909> course<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.239> blame<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.540> on<00:02:15.719> everything

turn<00:03:07.219> right<00:03:08.209> there<00:03:08.450> look<00:03:08.659> at<00:03:08.689> that<00:03:08.840> thing<00:03:09.200> this

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
turn right there look at that thing this

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.420 
turn right there look at that thing this
is<00:03:09.530> running<00:03:09.829> you

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
is running you

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.479 
is running you
now<00:03:12.239> we're<00:03:12.420> gonna<00:03:12.540> start<00:03:12.810> taking<00:03:12.989> it<00:03:13.230> up<00:03:13.409> as<00:03:13.799> we

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
now we're gonna start taking it up as we

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.390 
now we're gonna start taking it up as we
increase<00:03:14.909> it<00:03:15.170> rpm

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
increase it rpm

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:32.760 
increase it rpm
that<00:03:17.519> make<00:03:17.730> your<00:03:17.939> next<00:03:18.209> area

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.309 

now<00:03:33.770> you<00:03:33.830> see<00:03:34.459> what<00:03:34.610> it<00:03:34.730> did<00:03:34.940> at<00:03:35.330> 55<00:03:36.050> that

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
now you see what it did at 55 that

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.339 
now you see what it did at 55 that
mixture<00:03:36.620> went<00:03:36.890> to<00:03:37.040> 13<00:03:37.459> parts<00:03:37.849> the<00:03:38.750> faster<00:03:39.200> you

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
mixture went to 13 parts the faster you

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.160 
mixture went to 13 parts the faster you
go<00:03:39.560> in<00:03:39.770> the<00:03:39.860> less<00:03:40.099> global<00:03:40.360> the<00:03:41.360> less<00:03:41.569> loader<00:03:41.900> is

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
go in the less global the less loader is

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.760 
go in the less global the less loader is
on<00:03:42.410> there

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
on there

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.130 
on there
the<00:03:43.280> thinner<00:03:43.550> that<00:03:43.790> mixture<00:03:44.120> gets<00:03:44.480> because

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
the thinner that mixture gets because

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.870 
the thinner that mixture gets because
you<00:03:45.349> don't<00:03:45.530> need<00:03:45.650> liquids<00:03:46.069> much<00:03:46.310> liquid<00:03:46.700> gas

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
you don't need liquids much liquid gas

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.790 
you don't need liquids much liquid gas
now<00:03:47.690> look<00:03:47.930> this<00:03:48.230> is<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.470> beautiful<00:03:50.800> electronic

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
now look this is a beautiful electronic

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.350 
now look this is a beautiful electronic
