00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
landing gear is big but the biggest big

thing<00:00:37.620> about<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> 777<00:00:38.940> Art's<00:00:39.300> giant<00:00:39.930> engines

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
thing about the 777 Art's giant engines

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.690 
thing about the 777 Art's giant engines
there<00:00:42.899> are<00:00:43.050> only<00:00:43.230> two<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.620> them<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.129> that's

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
there are only two of them and that's

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.510 
there are only two of them and that's
it's<00:00:45.030> big<00:00:45.180> improvement<00:00:45.780> over<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.340> 747<00:00:47.340> that

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
it's big improvement over the 747 that

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.119 
it's big improvement over the 747 that
earlier<00:00:48.360> model<00:00:48.719> has<00:00:48.899> four<00:00:49.260> engines<00:00:49.469> which

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
earlier model has four engines which

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.430 
earlier model has four engines which
means<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> triple<00:00:50.850> 7<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.300> way<00:00:51.899> more<00:00:52.140> fuel

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
means the triple 7 is way more fuel

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.470 
means the triple 7 is way more fuel
efficient<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.489> world's<00:00:53.760> longest<00:00:54.000> range

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480
