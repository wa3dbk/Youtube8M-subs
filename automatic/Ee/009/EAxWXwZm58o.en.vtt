see<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.660> ruin<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.899> off<00:00:40.050> because<00:00:40.200> they're

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
see have to ruin it off because they're

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.610 
see have to ruin it off because they're
not<00:00:40.500> hit<00:00:40.760> good<00:00:41.989> these<00:00:42.989> are<00:00:43.110> hex<00:00:43.260> too<00:00:43.469> but

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
not hit good these are hex too but

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.200 
not hit good these are hex too but
they're<00:00:43.739> opposite<00:00:44.100> their<00:00:44.219> internal<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:45.059> look

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
they're opposite their internal you look

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.130 
they're opposite their internal you look
at<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> hole<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.870> see<00:00:45.960> how<00:00:46.020> they're

at the hole as you can see how they're

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.500 
at the hole as you can see how they're
getting<00:00:46.200> kind<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.469> round<00:00:46.680> look<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:47.010> him<00:00:47.510> just

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
getting kind of round look at him just

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.860 
getting kind of round look at him just
be<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> nice<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.140> sharp<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.680> these<00:00:49.890> ones<00:00:50.100> so

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
be a nice and sharp like these ones so

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.060 
be a nice and sharp like these ones so
they<00:00:51.870> start<00:00:52.110> looking<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:52.920> him

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
they start looking like that to get him

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.560 
they start looking like that to get him
down<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:53.640> here<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.879> okay<00:00:54.210> but<00:00:54.420> this

down this one here is okay but this
one's<00:00:54.719> bad<00:00:56.539> and<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:57.840> chopped<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.199> holes<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
one's bad and we chopped the holes and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.389 
one's bad and we chopped the holes and
head<00:00:58.920> up<00:00:59.129> here<00:00:59.399> deeper<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:01.230> show<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.800> you

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
head up here deeper to show it that you

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.880 
head up here deeper to show it that you
do<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.760> looking<00:01:02.969> at<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.180> don't<00:01:03.270> hill<00:01:03.680> so<00:01:04.680> now

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
do you looking at it don't hill so now

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.320 
do you looking at it don't hill so now
we<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.159> put<00:01:05.339> these<00:01:05.460> longer<00:01:05.790> bolts<00:01:06.090> here<00:01:06.210> in

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
we can put these longer bolts here in

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.050 
we can put these longer bolts here in
there<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:08.159> we're<00:01:08.310> gonna<00:01:08.400> go<00:01:08.610> ahead<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.850> see<00:01:08.970> if

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
there so we're gonna go ahead and see if

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:21.190 
there so we're gonna go ahead and see if
we<00:01:09.150> put<00:01:09.299> these<00:01:09.420> longer<00:01:09.750> ones<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.049> there<00:01:19.369> yep

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
we put these longer ones in there yep

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.690 
we put these longer ones in there yep
case<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.290> forget<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.799> flange<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.430> thick

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
case you forget the flange is this thick

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.570 
case you forget the flange is this thick
so<00:01:24.350> if<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.470> can't<00:01:25.710> put<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> wrench<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.430> there

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
so if you can't put the wrench in there

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.859 
so if you can't put the wrench in there
and<00:01:26.729> reach<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> sticker<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.390> flange<00:01:27.750> that

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
and reach the sticker the flange that

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.910 
and reach the sticker the flange that
means<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.380> must<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.590> good<00:01:30.619> so<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.770> would<00:01:31.860> be

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
means it must be good so that would be

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:40.310 
means it must be good so that would be
called<00:01:32.070> an<00:01:32.220> upgrade<00:01:38.900> obviously<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.049> will<00:01:40.140> take

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
called an upgrade obviously it will take

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.200 
called an upgrade obviously it will take
a<00:01:40.350> lot<00:01:40.619> more<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.950> strip<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.490> one<00:01:41.729> out<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.090> this

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
a lot more to strip this one out in this

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.090 
a lot more to strip this one out in this
one<00:01:42.479> these<00:01:43.259> do<00:01:43.470> strip<00:01:43.740> out<00:01:45.619> we<00:01:46.619> change<00:01:46.920> them

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.930 

we<00:02:08.679> didn't<00:02:08.860> drill<00:02:09.039> these<00:02:09.160> holes<00:02:09.220> any<00:02:09.580> deeper

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
we didn't drill these holes any deeper
