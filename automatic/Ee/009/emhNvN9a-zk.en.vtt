00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.560
 Hello everyone today, we will look at 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.339
 small passage of my composition 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.140
 You can see the compositions in this window. 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:29.089
 the passage we take with you which begin 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.570
 closer ends used elegant 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.570
 technique and + topping here we are with you 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.560
 play there is not a major or for this we will 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.030
 trailer used initially to allow for 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.239
 with you do take the length became 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.220
 at first it looks like beginners 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.770
 link and from here we will play with a beat 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.440
 go yourself who hit two strings on 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.570
 second string and first string first 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.290
 countries she first yes and with 1 folding with 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.290
 you make trills 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.540
 to make a quality third to you 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.640
 you need to practice well enough 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.450
 so she sounded you dora dora dora 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.330
 dora dora then 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.540
 so as not to be so and convert your 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.670
 attention to what's most important when you 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.600
 playing third doesn't matter even if this or 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.600
 some other three 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:31.399
 the most important thing in the game 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:34.039
 make a quality pool because 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.049
 some guys play like this for example 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.750
 start to play but let's say take to 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.550
 Example of the third string of the 7th fret 7 9 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.740
 we will face 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.920
 and pray just raise they do 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.060
 a couple of packs aren't just deals to this country 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.800
 and lift up 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.170
 pay attention when you do 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.640
 such a reception is sure to finger 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.440
 make seeing as if you are doing 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.970
 pick it up additionally that is it 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.740
 will give some sasha a dense sound that i 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.660
 I will play like that pruned two ways 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.660
 there will be a first way how not to play 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.310
 also the same notes too quickly but no 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.310
 density like the second case 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.890
 here it is yes ra dara yes because everyone 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.510
 to heard to everyone just such gives about 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.610
 the volume is such a clear sound 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.100
 mean with this and played with you did 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.620
 learned to do at this moment when you 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.510
 make three right to you this finger 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.100
 line we drowns out your other strings 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.670
 if we won't do that then 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.670
 that's what happens 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:39.850
 besides how we do this trill 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.410
 around us this background is about others 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.630
 do not clamped build because we are with you 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.090
 we can do two ways to eat first 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.680
 the way it is I already said compress it with this 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.810
 finger press the strings 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.720
 and the second way when we continue 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.540
 keep playing often show first 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.790
 we played here and slowly fasten 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.410
 truth hand here and and pushed 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.500
 and elbow begin to tilt and 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.090
 touch already this place 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.890
 elbow already to other countries because 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.310
 if you do not top of the sea 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.990
 green 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.430
 when ru is dedicated to the topic you must 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.219
 try to knock on the guitar 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.280
 we have this background so if this 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:19.019
 don't do that he is provided to you therefore in 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.500
 In this case, such passages do not play. 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.620
 Jack 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.299
 I once played in a jacket and when they do 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.250
 massage 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:30.629
 then I hooked the typewriter I have another 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.670
 guitar yamaha 821 d and hooked on the typewriter 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:36.480
 and just didn't take it out 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.969
 it was very so unpleasant that means we 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.030
 make you trill slowly hand yourself 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:44.579
 knocked down and then removed 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.579
 hand on 7 9 here we will do 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:51.620
 tapping you already holding your hand here 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.620
 no need we don't need strings 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.880
 and here we are doing this technique loschadi 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.920
 simmons workers young will be 11 will 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.950
 freck little finger play on the channel in hand 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.540
 there will be a working lobby 7 9 11 watts first 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.640
 when we will do with you tepping we 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:14.250
 we will do tapping 12 12 pieces and 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.140
 it turns out we have 12 12 topping in this 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.239
 moment little finger lies on the eleventh 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:23.900
 year and then do we arrive semi at 7 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.900
 it turns out 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.580
 apparently something like the phrase you play 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.020
 then the first finger you have of course but then he 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.670
 necessarily touches the next 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.920
 nothin whether it's the second side there or 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.300
 3 or some other well, except 6 of ours 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.120
 the country does not touch the same sixth 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.330
 on the contrary, we play another place that is 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.220
 we have a finger not a top string 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.480
 on jim this is the bottom fifth string for sure 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.310
 just like for example if we played 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.920
 third country then we will clamp 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.460
 third string plus phalanx 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:57.030
 touches up to 4 strings and up to 2 what is it 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:01.580
 gives it gives enough 4 we don't give 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.580
 and 2 tones finish husband 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.990
 gives exactly such a dense clear sound 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.990
 so on accounts through he plays 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:26.290
 will move lost a beat 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.300
 we will count down from the second finger 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:33.630
 when we come in 12 fret and 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:36.630
 do five years with us as if 1 1 2 3 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.630
 four 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.160
 then do the same thing for someone else 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:47.240
 I know the same thing, I only tolerate 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.240
 so changed by 4 chairs 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.030
 then it changes 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.150
 changed the left hand by working water 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.410
 we get nine eleven 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.250
 twelve from epic 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.250
 16 frets 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.220
 and then we do next 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.680
 a small passage which will 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:13.509
 subsequently play others on different 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:18.770
 the strings of a powerful passage in the passage and 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:21.979
 all of it turns out 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 soci 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:25.639
 9016 ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta here we are 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:29.990
 play with you start 1413 a4 with 11 12 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:35.800
 14 then do the trapping on 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:35.800
 nineteenth year and cheat 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:44.059
 on the second string is exactly the same 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.439
 type passage only other frets here 

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:46.880
 do we get in hand 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:51.020
 working moment 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:59.390
 1012 passage begins 12:09 10-12 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:07:02.420
 then goes divide by 17 then 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:07.090
 the third string we get is working 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:07.090
 frets 8 911 creed and ping for 16 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:15.619
 it turns out if we assume someone 3 strings 11 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:18.619
 8 911 tapping on the 16th, then go to 11 

00:07:15.619 --> 00:07:18.619
 98 

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.590
 our last string is a kind of left handed 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:34.020
 working water 679 link on the fourteenth and 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:35.120
 it turns out 9 frets will play 967 914 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.900
 9 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.900
 76 

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:42.699
 and a jump at 12 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:57.020
 I wish you success and repeat this 

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.910
 the passage based on he may have 

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.710
 open to yourself something new 

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.150
 to learn how to silence 

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.680
 side so she did not give too much 

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.680
 iphone sound bye
