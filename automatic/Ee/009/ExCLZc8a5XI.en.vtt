00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the game I I just got into it as well we

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.729 
the game I I just got into it as well we
played<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.600> against<00:00:39.870> each<00:00:39.930> other<00:00:40.110> one<00:00:40.440> year

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
played it against each other one year

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.470 
played it against each other one year
when<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.040> was<00:00:41.129> 16<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> Western<00:00:42.300> Hockey

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
when I was 16 in the Western Hockey

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.840 
when I was 16 in the Western Hockey
League<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:42.930> he<00:00:43.079> was<00:00:43.200> set<00:00:43.559> her<00:00:43.770> 19<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.550> believe

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
League and he was set her 19 I believe

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.910 
League and he was set her 19 I believe
we<00:00:45.270> played<00:00:45.510> one<00:00:45.750> game<00:00:45.899> against<00:00:46.350> each<00:00:46.410> other<00:00:46.649> so

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
we played one game against each other so

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.650 
we played one game against each other so
other<00:00:47.430> than<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.670> that's<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> only<00:00:48.120> game<00:00:48.539> is

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
other than that that's the only game is

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.029 
other than that that's the only game is
played<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.110> think<00:00:49.530> when<00:00:49.680> were<00:00:49.800> younger

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
played I think when were younger

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.490 
played I think when were younger
obviously<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.700> compete<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:52.079> sort<00:00:52.440> of

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
obviously you compete and just sort of

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.569 
obviously you compete and just sort of
the<00:00:52.620> ways<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.980> play<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.370> game<00:00:53.550> and

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
the ways you play the game and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.520 
the ways you play the game and
everything<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.180> once<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.780> mature<00:00:55.289> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
everything like that once you mature a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.810 
everything like that once you mature a
bit<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.860> should<00:00:55.890> sort<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.340> help<00:00:56.520> each<00:00:56.640> other

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
bit you should sort of help each other

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.299 
bit you should sort of help each other
out<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.270> get<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.289> comfort<00:00:58.890> level<00:00:59.190> with

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
out and get to that comfort level with

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.369 
out and get to that comfort level with
each<00:00:59.489> other<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.359> think<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:00.930> more<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
each other and I think it's more of a

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.030 
each other and I think it's more of a
support<00:01:02.039> system<00:01:02.190> now<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.539> year<00:01:03.780> in

thought it was great they have a great
organization<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.509> nothing<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:27.960> good

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
organization I have nothing but good

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.020 
organization I have nothing but good
things<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.500> say<00:01:28.560> about<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.280> think<00:01:29.640> just

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
things to say about it I think just

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.819 
things to say about it I think just
being<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.329> smaller<00:01:30.659> guy<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.229> was<00:01:31.380> always<00:01:31.530> told

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
being a smaller guy I was always told

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.740 
being a smaller guy I was always told
those<00:01:32.100> never<00:01:32.579> gonna<00:01:32.759> make<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.060> far<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.600> that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
those never gonna make it far in that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.270 
those never gonna make it far in that
and<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.710> use<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.860> as<00:01:35.130> motivation

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
and so I have to use it as motivation

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.850 
and so I have to use it as motivation
and<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.119> think<00:01:36.329> that's<00:01:36.509> what<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.720> did<00:01:36.990> I'd<00:01:37.140> took

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
and I think that's what I did I'd took

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.920 
and I think that's what I did I'd took
it<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.159> heart<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.520> sort<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.329> use<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.720> fuel

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
it to heart and sort of use it to fuel

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.749 
it to heart and sort of use it to fuel
my<00:01:40.079> fire<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.619> sort<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.159> learn<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
my fire you sort of have to learn the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.969 
my fire you sort of have to learn the
ropes<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> game<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> lot<00:01:43.350> quicker<00:01:43.619> when

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
ropes of the game a lot quicker when

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:44.380 
ropes of the game a lot quicker when
you're

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
you're

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.870 
you're
even<00:01:44.780> in<00:01:44.870> Bantam<00:01:45.260> I<00:01:45.350> had<00:01:45.500> to<00:01:45.680> know<00:01:46.340> where<00:01:46.610> to<00:01:46.760> be

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
even in Bantam I had to know where to be

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.520 
even in Bantam I had to know where to be
in<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.120> right<00:01:47.270> spots<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:47.810> stuff<00:01:48.050> like<00:01:48.320> that

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
in the right spots and stuff like that

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.950 
in the right spots and stuff like that
and<00:01:48.770> some<00:01:49.460> guys<00:01:49.670> who<00:01:49.850> are<00:01:49.970> bigger<00:01:50.210> they<00:01:50.479> they

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
and some guys who are bigger they they

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.140 
and some guys who are bigger they they
they're<00:01:51.470> stronger<00:01:52.040> so<00:01:52.220> they<00:01:52.340> just<00:01:52.520> go<00:01:52.880> around

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
they're stronger so they just go around

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.490 
they're stronger so they just go around
with<00:01:53.300> their<00:01:53.420> head<00:01:53.570> down<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:53.900> stuff<00:01:54.140> like<00:01:54.290> that

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
with their head down and stuff like that

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.140 
with their head down and stuff like that
and<00:01:54.650> I<00:01:54.920> think<00:01:55.220> from<00:01:55.369> an<00:01:55.520> early<00:01:55.790> age<00:01:55.820> I've

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
and I think from an early age I've

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.880 
and I think from an early age I've
learned<00:01:56.510> to<00:01:56.630> have<00:01:56.869> my<00:01:57.020> head<00:01:57.200> up<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.470> always<00:01:57.680> be

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
learned to have my head up and always be

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.890 
learned to have my head up and always be
sort<00:01:58.220> of<00:01:58.280> moving<00:01:58.520> my<00:01:58.760> head<00:01:58.970> in<00:01:59.180> my<00:01:59.330> skates<00:01:59.659> as

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
sort of moving my head in my skates as

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.719 
sort of moving my head in my skates as
well<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:00.410> I<00:02:00.619> think<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:01.130> helped<00:02:01.310> me<00:02:01.400> out<00:02:01.430> a<00:02:01.520> lot

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
well so I think it helped me out a lot

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.330 
well so I think it helped me out a lot
obviously<00:02:02.390> playing<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:03.020> six<00:02:03.320> foot<00:02:03.680> guys<00:02:03.920> for

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
obviously playing a six foot guys for

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.359 
obviously playing a six foot guys for
200<00:02:04.940> pounds<00:02:05.060> I'm<00:02:05.900> about<00:02:06.140> five<00:02:06.410> eight<00:02:06.650> 170

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
200 pounds I'm about five eight 170

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.590 
200 pounds I'm about five eight 170
pounds<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:07.820> obviously<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:08.300> need<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.509> be

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
pounds so obviously you need to be

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.590 
pounds so obviously you need to be
strong<00:02:08.899> in<00:02:08.929> that<00:02:09.200> way<00:02:09.380> so<00:02:10.300> coming<00:02:11.300> into<00:02:11.420> the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
strong in that way so coming into the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.420 
strong in that way so coming into the
gym<00:02:11.780> everyday<00:02:12.050> means<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:12.560> lot<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:13.070> me<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.310> I

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
gym everyday means a lot to me and I

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.830 
gym everyday means a lot to me and I
take<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:13.970> pretty<00:02:14.150> seriously

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
take it pretty seriously

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.290 
take it pretty seriously
I<00:02:14.870> think<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.350> first<00:02:15.590> 10<00:02:16.069> 15<00:02:16.550> games<00:02:17.030> are<00:02:17.180> sort

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
I think the first 10 15 games are sort

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.729 
I think the first 10 15 games are sort
of<00:02:17.420> in<00:02:17.570> awe<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.780> who<00:02:18.020> you're<00:02:18.200> playing<00:02:18.380> against

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
of in awe of who you're playing against

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.160 
of in awe of who you're playing against
but<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.190> think<00:02:20.180> once<00:02:20.540> you<00:02:20.600> get<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:20.900> confidence

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
but I think once you get that confidence

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.690 
but I think once you get that confidence
in<00:02:21.560> one<00:02:21.709> game<00:02:21.950> where<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.250> sort<00:02:22.489> of<00:02:22.519> make<00:02:22.670> a

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
in one game where you sort of make a

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.910 
in one game where you sort of make a
nice<00:02:22.940> pass<00:02:23.209> or<00:02:23.570> get<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.260> confidence<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:24.739> the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
nice pass or get the confidence of the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.220 
nice pass or get the confidence of the
players<00:02:25.160> as<00:02:25.340> well<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:26.150> gets<00:02:26.300> a<00:02:26.480> lot<00:02:26.660> easier<00:02:26.690> I

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
players as well it gets a lot easier I

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.229 
players as well it gets a lot easier I
think<00:02:27.590> my<00:02:28.010> first<00:02:28.190> game<00:02:28.489> here<00:02:28.970> in<00:02:29.060> Edmonton

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
think my first game here in Edmonton

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.570 
think my first game here in Edmonton
just<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.840> have<00:02:29.989> everyone<00:02:30.440> home<00:02:30.769> and<00:02:31.070> you<00:02:31.370> grow

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
just to have everyone home and you grow

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.520 
just to have everyone home and you grow
up<00:02:31.700> watching<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.300> team<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:33.050> idolize

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
up watching the team and you idolize

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.990 
up watching the team and you idolize
them<00:02:33.769> and<00:02:33.950> then<00:02:34.070> to<00:02:34.250> finally<00:02:34.489> be<00:02:34.730> playing

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
them and then to finally be playing

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.520 
them and then to finally be playing
against<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:35.450> that's<00:02:35.600> something<00:02:35.930> special<00:02:36.050> I

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
against and that's something special I

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.710 
against and that's something special I
think<00:02:37.160> they<00:02:37.400> still<00:02:37.910> cheer<00:02:38.180> for<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.450> weather's

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
think they still cheer for the weather's

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.570 
think they still cheer for the weather's
a<00:02:38.750> bit<00:02:39.019> but<00:02:39.290> when<00:02:39.830> we're<00:02:40.010> in<00:02:40.130> town<00:02:40.340> I<00:02:40.370> think

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
a bit but when we're in town I think

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.110 
a bit but when we're in town I think
they<00:02:40.850> sort<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.180> switched<00:02:41.390> sides<00:02:41.600> but<00:02:41.959> I

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
they sort of switched sides but I

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.220 
they sort of switched sides but I
haven't<00:02:44.120> talked<00:02:44.300> about<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.600> too<00:02:44.720> much<00:02:44.750> though

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
haven't talked about it too much though

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.680 
haven't talked about it too much though
I'm<00:02:45.590> not<00:02:45.769> too<00:02:45.920> worried<00:02:46.160> about<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:46.510> it's<00:02:47.510> cool

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
I'm not too worried about it it's cool

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.360 
I'm not too worried about it it's cool

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
you can from day one I think I've only

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.319 
you can from day one I think I've only
been<00:03:37.100> here<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.310> month<00:03:37.340> this<00:03:37.700> year<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.150> can

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
been here a month this year and I can

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.750 
been here a month this year and I can
feel<00:03:38.570> stronger<00:03:39.230> already<00:03:39.410> than<00:03:39.799> I<00:03:39.829> had<00:03:40.489> last

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
feel stronger already than I had last

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.670 
feel stronger already than I had last
year<00:03:40.940> so<00:03:41.299> see<00:03:41.720> when<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:41.930> come<00:03:42.079> in<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.350> gym<00:03:42.380> you

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
year so see when you come in the gym you

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.470 
year so see when you come in the gym you
don't<00:03:42.769> want<00:03:42.980> to<00:03:43.040> be<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:43.640> weakest<00:03:44.000> guy<00:03:44.180> there

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
don't want to be the weakest guy there

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.270 
don't want to be the weakest guy there
so<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:45.019> think<00:03:45.290> obviously<00:03:45.680> there's<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:45.950> friendly

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
so I think obviously there's a friendly

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.979 
so I think obviously there's a friendly
competition<00:03:46.850> but<00:03:47.269> you're<00:03:47.600> always<00:03:47.720> pushing

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
competition but you're always pushing

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.059 
competition but you're always pushing
each<00:03:48.200> other<00:03:48.440> to<00:03:48.500> be<00:03:48.709> better

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
each other to be better

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.160 
each other to be better
you<00:03:49.129> want<00:03:49.549> to<00:03:49.609> see<00:03:49.760> your<00:03:50.299> friend<00:03:50.599> succeed<00:03:51.019> in

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
you want to see your friend succeed in

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.559 
you want to see your friend succeed in
the<00:03:51.349> sport<00:03:51.620> he<00:03:51.739> wants<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.189> so<00:03:52.430> when<00:03:53.329> you're<00:03:53.480> in

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
the sport he wants to so when you're in

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:54.610 
the sport he wants to so when you're in
the<00:03:53.599> gym<00:03:53.870> together<00:03:54.019> you're<00:03:54.439> obviously

helping<00:03:55.249> each<00:03:55.370> other<00:03:55.519> out<00:03:55.670> so<00:03:55.819> I<00:03:56.409> guess<00:03:57.409> when

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
helping each other out so I guess when

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.830

I think everyone who's serious in sports
honestly<00:04:07.069> for<00:04:07.219> any<00:04:07.400> sport<00:04:07.760> that<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:08.000> need<00:04:08.180> is
