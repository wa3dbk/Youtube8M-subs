 I'm going to put them in a platter 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.180
 If you do not find them, what you do is 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.250
 cut your Arabic bread and bake it in a 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.650
 tray at a very low temperature 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.410
 for a long time so that for that 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.209

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.670

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.590
