00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.300 

for<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.240> next<00:00:12.480> medium<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.230> started<00:00:13.890> off<00:00:14.040> with

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:14.310 
for this next medium I started off with

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.980 
for this next medium I started off with
a<00:00:14.370> piece<00:00:14.850> of<00:00:14.880> paper<00:00:15.180> now<00:00:15.510> this<00:00:15.660> could<00:00:15.809> be<00:00:15.870> a

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
a piece of paper now this could be a

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.320 
a piece of paper now this could be a
piece<00:00:16.200> of<00:00:16.230> canvas<00:00:16.560> as<00:00:16.890> well<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.910> I've<00:00:18.030> put<00:00:18.300> a

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
piece of canvas as well that I've put a

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.450 
piece of canvas as well that I've put a
base<00:00:18.540> coat<00:00:18.900> on<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.290> happens<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.830> be<00:00:19.950> pimento

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
base coat on it happens to be pimento

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.260 
base coat on it happens to be pimento
read<00:00:20.790> by<00:00:21.660> Matisse<00:00:22.110> but<00:00:23.070> that's<00:00:23.369> not<00:00:23.760> really

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
read by Matisse but that's not really

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.460 
read by Matisse but that's not really
relevant<00:00:24.860> I<00:00:26.510> put<00:00:27.510> two<00:00:27.689> layers<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:28.259> here

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
relevant I put two layers on here

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.159 
relevant I put two layers on here
allowed<00:00:28.950> it<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.160> dry<00:00:29.460> thoroughly<00:00:29.869> again<00:00:30.869> I'm

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
allowed it to dry thoroughly again I'm

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:32.930 
allowed it to dry thoroughly again I'm
going<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.590> take<00:00:31.739> a<00:00:31.800> brush<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.640> time<00:00:32.910> I

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
going to take a brush and this time I

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.030 
going to take a brush and this time I
think<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.360> might<00:00:33.540> take<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> fan<00:00:34.079> brush<00:00:34.260> because

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
think I might take a fan brush because

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.819 
think I might take a fan brush because
the<00:00:35.370> stroke<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.850> important<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.720> this<00:00:36.870> one<00:00:37.079> I'm

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
the stroke is important on this one I'm

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.180 
the stroke is important on this one I'm
going<00:00:38.220> to<00:00:38.310> be<00:00:38.430> using<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:39.840> Matisse<00:00:40.260> cracking

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
going to be using the Matisse cracking

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.090 
going to be using the Matisse cracking
medium<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.790> have<00:00:42.690> my<00:00:42.870> ever-present<00:00:43.290> little<00:00:43.920> cup

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
medium I have my ever-present little cup

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.610 
medium I have my ever-present little cup
of<00:00:44.250> distilled<00:00:44.550> water<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:46.050> timer<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.469> I

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
of distilled water and a timer that I

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.209 
of distilled water and a timer that I
have<00:00:46.890> set<00:00:47.129> for<00:00:47.340> three<00:00:47.579> hours<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:49.219> cracking

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
have set for three hours the cracking

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.299 
have set for three hours the cracking
medium<00:00:50.579> will<00:00:50.820> give<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> crackle<00:00:51.510> finish<00:00:52.309> to

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
medium will give a crackle finish to

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.310 
medium will give a crackle finish to
work<00:00:53.609> and<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.899> does<00:00:55.940> become<00:00:56.940> dependent<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
work and it does become dependent on the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.189 
work and it does become dependent on the
stroke<00:00:58.679> so<00:00:59.519> again<00:01:00.120> I'm<00:01:00.329> going<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.690> wet<00:01:01.019> my

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
stroke so again I'm going to wet my

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.490 
stroke so again I'm going to wet my
brush<00:01:01.850> dry<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.910> briefly<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.719> then<00:01:03.780> I'm<00:01:04.379> going

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
brush dry it briefly and then I'm going

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.420 
brush dry it briefly and then I'm going
to<00:01:04.559> grab<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:05.190> big<00:01:06.080> brush<00:01:07.080> full<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.190> gel

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
to grab a big brush full of the gel

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.630 
to grab a big brush full of the gel
medium<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.320> I'm<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.710> apply<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.220> very

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
medium and I'm going to apply it very

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.570 
medium and I'm going to apply it very
thickly<00:01:15.560> refilling<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> brush<00:01:16.860> as<00:01:17.130> needed

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
thickly refilling the brush as needed

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.940 
thickly refilling the brush as needed
now<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.510> looks<00:01:18.690> a<00:01:18.870> little<00:01:19.050> thick<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
now it looks a little thick at the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.770 
now it looks a little thick at the
moment<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:23.720> this<00:01:24.720> is

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
moment but it really is not this is

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:36.070 
moment but it really is not this is
going<00:01:25.230> to<00:01:25.350> take<00:01:27.140> three<00:01:28.140> hours<00:01:28.410> to<00:01:28.940> dry

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.310 

make<00:01:37.080> sure<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.440> I<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.770> totally<00:01:38.010> covered

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
make sure that I have it totally covered

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.350 
make sure that I have it totally covered
put<00:01:40.320> my<00:01:40.470> brush<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.770> water<00:01:40.950> close<00:01:41.610> up<00:01:41.820> my<00:01:42.000> medium

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
put my brush in water close up my medium

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.540 
put my brush in water close up my medium
now<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.380> going<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.770> set<00:01:44.010> for<00:01:44.280> three<00:01:44.520> hours

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
now this is going to set for three hours

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.330 
now this is going to set for three hours
in<00:01:45.090> three<00:01:45.540> hours<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:46.170> will<00:01:46.740> come<00:01:46.920> back<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
in three hours I will come back and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.240 
in three hours I will come back and
we'll<00:01:47.490> start<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.940> cracking<00:01:48.390> process<00:01:48.900> so<00:01:49.590> I'm

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
we'll start the cracking process so I'm

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.990 
we'll start the cracking process so I'm
going<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.610> start<00:01:50.729> my<00:01:51.060> timer<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:52.490> I'll<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.760> back

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
going to start my timer and I'll be back

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.950 
going to start my timer and I'll be back
in<00:01:54.240> about<00:01:54.660> three<00:01:55.080> hours<00:01:55.350> or<00:01:55.800> so<00:01:56.690> when<00:01:57.690> we<00:01:57.810> can

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
in about three hours or so when we can

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.530 
in about three hours or so when we can
do<00:01:58.050> the<00:01:58.260> actual<00:01:58.530> cracking<00:02:01.520> so<00:02:02.520> here's<00:02:03.150> the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
do the actual cracking so here's the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.750 
do the actual cracking so here's the
point<00:02:03.780> where<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.350> magic<00:02:04.560> happens<00:02:05.340> i<00:02:05.550> took

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
point where the magic happens i took

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.449 
point where the magic happens i took
some<00:02:07.340> halo<00:02:08.340> turquoise<00:02:08.820> and<00:02:09.270> white<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:10.770> I've

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
some halo turquoise and white and I've

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.190 
some halo turquoise and white and I've
mixed<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:12.090> up<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.420> container<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:13.080> get

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
mixed it up in this container to get

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.100 
mixed it up in this container to get
this<00:02:13.350> nice<00:02:13.590> bright<00:02:13.920> turquoise<00:02:14.100> color<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.110> I'm

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
this nice bright turquoise color and I'm

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.690 
this nice bright turquoise color and I'm
going<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.470> do<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.830> very<00:02:17.070> fast<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.640> very

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
going to do this very fast and very

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.150 
going to do this very fast and very
deliberately<00:02:18.390> i<00:02:18.540> did<00:02:18.900> wat<00:02:19.110> rinse<00:02:19.560> my<00:02:19.860> brush<00:02:19.890> in

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
deliberately i did wat rinse my brush in

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.910 
deliberately i did wat rinse my brush in
water<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.700> get<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:20.970> started<00:02:21.330> but<00:02:22.290> i'm<00:02:22.650> going<00:02:22.830> to

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
water to get it started but i'm going to

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.420 
water to get it started but i'm going to
start<00:02:23.220> with<00:02:23.459> big<00:02:23.790> strokes<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:25.860> different

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
start with big strokes in different

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:46.100 
start with big strokes in different
directions

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.870 

and<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.770> can<00:02:46.920> see<00:02:47.100> it's<00:02:47.220> starting<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.640> crack

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
and you can see it's starting to crack

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.720 
and you can see it's starting to crack
already<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:49.110> fast<00:02:49.470> if<00:02:50.340> you'll<00:02:50.520> see

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
already it's that fast if you'll see

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.550 
already it's that fast if you'll see
down<00:02:51.120> here<00:02:51.390> is<00:02:51.540> starting<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.020> crack<00:02:52.260> very

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
down here is starting to crack very

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.730 
down here is starting to crack very
nicely<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:54.390> I'm<00:02:54.630> going<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.870> kind<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.350> zoom<00:02:55.560> in

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
nicely and I'm going to kind of zoom in

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.020 
nicely and I'm going to kind of zoom in
a<00:02:55.830> little<00:02:55.920> bit<00:02:56.070> see<00:02:56.400> if<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.550> can<00:02:56.700> get<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.820> better

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
a little bit see if I can get a better

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.440 
a little bit see if I can get a better
view<00:02:57.300> of<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:59.330> and<00:03:00.830> man<00:03:01.830> that's<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.430> look<00:03:03.300> how

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
view of this and man that's it look how

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.740 
view of this and man that's it look how
fast<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:03.930> was<00:03:04.170> now<00:03:05.160> as<00:03:05.280> this<00:03:05.460> dries<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:06.720> will

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
fast that was now as this dries it will

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.660 
fast that was now as this dries it will
crack<00:03:07.350> a<00:03:07.380> little<00:03:07.710> bit<00:03:07.830> more<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.250> cracks<00:03:08.490> will

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
crack a little bit more the cracks will

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.690 
crack a little bit more the cracks will
actually<00:03:08.910> get<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.060> little<00:03:09.330> bit<00:03:09.450> bigger<00:03:09.660> so<00:03:10.700> this

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
actually get a little bit bigger so this

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.060 
actually get a little bit bigger so this
is<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.090> final<00:03:12.450> result<00:03:12.600> for<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.140> crackle

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
is the final result for the crackle

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.000 
is the final result for the crackle
medium<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.610> has<00:03:14.910> dried<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:16.470> think<00:03:16.740> you<00:03:16.860> can

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
medium it has dried and I think you can

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.550 
medium it has dried and I think you can
see<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.550> has<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.760> nice<00:03:18.060> nice<00:03:18.900> crackle

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
see that it has a nice nice crackle

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.910 
see that it has a nice nice crackle
finish<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:21.110> very<00:03:22.110> pleased<00:03:22.410> with<00:03:22.620> how<00:03:22.740> this

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
turned out this is totally dry now and I

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.150 
turned out this is totally dry now and I
can<00:03:26.820> go<00:03:26.970> over<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.300> with<00:03:27.420> this<00:03:27.570> stain<00:03:28.560> or<00:03:28.860> with<00:03:29.130> a

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
highlights to it but I am going to leave

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.479 
highlights to it but I am going to leave
it<00:03:35.130> like<00:03:35.310> this<00:03:35.340> I<00:03:35.700> like<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.030> contrast<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:37.590> like

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
it like this I like the contrast I like

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.370 
it like this I like the contrast I like
to<00:03:38.670> see<00:03:38.850> contrast<00:03:39.360> in<00:03:39.600> this<00:03:39.780> kind<00:03:40.050> of<00:03:40.140> thing

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
to see contrast in this kind of thing

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.220 
to see contrast in this kind of thing
myself<00:03:40.620> so<00:03:41.610> that's<00:03:42.150> where<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:42.660> is<00:03:42.720> going<00:03:43.140> at

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
myself so that's where this is going at

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.380 
myself so that's where this is going at
the<00:03:43.380> moment<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.890> I'm<00:03:44.880> going<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.150> be<00:03:45.300> using

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
the moment and I'm going to be using

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.509 
the moment and I'm going to be using
this<00:03:45.660> in<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:45.989> future<00:03:46.170> painting<00:03:46.920> somewhere

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.740 

one<00:03:50.519> of<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.760> newest<00:03:51.330> things<00:03:51.540> I've<00:03:51.720> been

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
one of the newest things I've been

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.110 
one of the newest things I've been
seeing<00:03:52.140> recently<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.769> something<00:03:53.220> called

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
seeing recently is something called

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.350 
seeing recently is something called
texture<00:03:54.930> gels<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.500> these<00:03:56.010> are<00:03:56.400> happen<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.239> be

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
texture gels and these are happen to be

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.900 
texture gels and these are happen to be
made<00:03:57.570> by<00:03:57.720> windsor<00:03:58.049> Newton<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:59.340> think<00:03:59.760> they're

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
made by windsor Newton I think they're

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.030 
made by windsor Newton I think they're
sort<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.209> interesting<00:04:00.840> they<00:04:01.320> really<00:04:01.620> do<00:04:01.860> not

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
sort of interesting they really do not

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.160 
sort of interesting they really do not
have<00:04:02.100> any<00:04:02.700> acrylic<00:04:03.570> medium<00:04:04.019> in<00:04:04.170> them<00:04:04.350> so<00:04:06.170> they

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
have any acrylic medium in them so they

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.740 
have any acrylic medium in them so they
are<00:04:07.350> made<00:04:07.590> for<00:04:07.860> acrylic<00:04:08.340> mediums<00:04:08.820> and<00:04:09.030> so<00:04:09.720> I

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
are made for acrylic mediums and so I

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.009 
are made for acrylic mediums and so I
thought<00:04:10.019> maybe<00:04:10.080> I'd<00:04:10.560> do<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.739> little

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
thought maybe I'd do a little

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.020 
thought maybe I'd do a little
demonstration<00:04:13.019> with<00:04:13.620> this<00:04:13.830> I<00:04:14.040> have<00:04:14.670> a<00:04:14.700> fresh

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
demonstration with this I have a fresh

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.150 
demonstration with this I have a fresh
piece<00:04:15.269> of<00:04:15.330> paper<00:04:15.690> I'm<00:04:16.470> going<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:16.769> start<00:04:16.979> off

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
piece of paper I'm going to start off

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.480 
piece of paper I'm going to start off
with<00:04:17.220> some<00:04:17.850> heavy<00:04:18.150> gel<00:04:18.479> medium<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:22.220> I'm<00:04:23.220> not

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
with some heavy gel medium and I'm not

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.180 
with some heavy gel medium and I'm not
going<00:04:23.640> to<00:04:23.700> do<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:23.880> whole<00:04:24.120> great<00:04:24.390> big<00:04:25.640> pile<00:04:26.640> of<00:04:26.669> it

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
going to do a whole great big pile of it

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.050 
going to do a whole great big pile of it
but<00:04:30.740> this<00:04:31.740> is<00:04:31.950> what<00:04:32.220> what<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.550> like<00:04:32.760> about<00:04:32.790> this

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
but this is what what I like about this

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.390 
but this is what what I like about this
is<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:33.479> can<00:04:33.660> mix<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.140> the<00:04:34.260> way<00:04:34.410> I<00:04:34.440> want<00:04:34.890> it<00:04:35.100> not

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
is I can mix it to the way I want it not

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.360 
is I can mix it to the way I want it not
the<00:04:35.640> way<00:04:35.760> it<00:04:35.910> comes<00:04:36.120> prepackaged<00:04:37.080> so<00:04:37.890> I'm<00:04:38.160> just

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
the way it comes prepackaged so I'm just

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.940 
the way it comes prepackaged so I'm just
going<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.580> grab<00:04:38.700> a<00:04:38.790> little<00:04:39.090> bit<00:04:39.330> of<00:04:39.390> this<00:04:39.950> just

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
going to grab a little bit of this just

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.850 
going to grab a little bit of this just
a<00:04:41.070> small<00:04:41.400> dab<00:04:41.640> and<00:04:42.020> I'm<00:04:43.020> going<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.410> mix<00:04:43.590> it<00:04:43.740> in

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
a small dab and I'm going to mix it in

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.230 
a small dab and I'm going to mix it in
with<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:47.130> gel<00:04:47.370> medium<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:47.850> see<00:04:48.030> how<00:04:48.180> it

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
with the the gel medium and see how it

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.890 
with the the gel medium and see how it
sort<00:04:48.780> of<00:04:49.040> disperses<00:04:50.040> it<00:04:50.070> and<00:04:50.400> I<00:04:51.300> rather<00:04:51.570> like

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
sort of disperses it and I rather like

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.000 
sort of disperses it and I rather like
that<00:04:52.110> actually<00:04:53.990> this<00:04:54.990> is<00:04:55.200> a<00:04:55.229> sort<00:04:55.979> of

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
that actually this is a sort of

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.010 
that actually this is a sort of
interesting<00:04:56.490> it<00:04:56.580> has<00:04:56.610> a<00:04:56.789> very

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
interesting it has a very

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.409 
interesting it has a very
gritty<00:04:58.620> feel<00:04:58.919> to<00:04:59.160> it<00:04:59.190> at<00:04:59.699> the<00:04:59.849> moment<00:04:59.879> so

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
gritty feel to it at the moment so

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.070 
gritty feel to it at the moment so
here's<00:05:01.289> the<00:05:01.470> piece<00:05:02.449> I'm<00:05:03.449> just<00:05:03.750> going<00:05:03.870> to<00:05:03.900> grab

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
here's the piece I'm just going to grab

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.730 
here's the piece I'm just going to grab
scoop<00:05:04.530> up<00:05:04.710> some<00:05:04.740> of<00:05:05.069> this<00:05:05.160> and<00:05:05.490> oh<00:05:06.000> yeah<00:05:06.840> this

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
scoop up some of this and oh yeah this

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.059 
scoop up some of this and oh yeah this
is<00:05:07.800> nice<00:05:08.099> this<00:05:08.449> is<00:05:09.449> a<00:05:09.659> lot<00:05:10.349> like<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.770> black

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:11.069 
is nice this is a lot like the black

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:13.760 
is nice this is a lot like the black
lava<00:05:11.370> gel<00:05:11.699> but<00:05:12.449> the<00:05:12.659> texture<00:05:13.080> is<00:05:13.229> certainly

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
lava gel but the texture is certainly

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.749 
lava gel but the texture is certainly
hard<00:05:14.220> different<00:05:14.729> and<00:05:15.349> I<00:05:16.349> oh<00:05:16.740> I<00:05:17.069> really<00:05:17.580> like

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
hard different and I oh I really like

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.210 
hard different and I oh I really like
that<00:05:17.789> I<00:05:18.000> can't<00:05:18.599> wait<00:05:18.750> to<00:05:18.780> see<00:05:18.990> that<00:05:19.139> dry<00:05:19.379> I<00:05:19.620> see

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
that I can't wait to see that dry I see

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.740 
that I can't wait to see that dry I see
no<00:05:20.370> reason<00:05:20.400> why<00:05:20.759> this<00:05:20.879> couldn't<00:05:21.300> be<00:05:21.419> mixed

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
no reason why this couldn't be mixed

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.369 
no reason why this couldn't be mixed
with<00:05:21.780> color<00:05:22.199> either<00:05:23.780> fact<00:05:24.780> I<00:05:24.900> might<00:05:25.080> do<00:05:25.349> that

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:25.379 
with color either fact I might do that

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:31.520 
with color either fact I might do that
just<00:05:27.770> just<00:05:28.770> scrape<00:05:29.069> off<00:05:29.250> some<00:05:29.280> of<00:05:29.550> this<00:05:30.530> and

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
just just scrape off some of this and

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.930 
just just scrape off some of this and
I'm<00:05:31.979> going<00:05:32.250> to<00:05:32.310> add<00:05:32.580> just<00:05:32.610> a<00:05:32.970> little<00:05:33.000> touch<00:05:33.509> of

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
I'm going to add just a little touch of

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:46.219 
I'm going to add just a little touch of
turquoise<00:05:35.940> blue<00:05:36.360> I<00:05:44.419> think<00:05:45.419> I<00:05:45.599> might<00:05:45.810> just<00:05:46.050> add

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
turquoise blue I think I might just add

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:57.649 
turquoise blue I think I might just add
a<00:05:46.259> little<00:05:46.380> bit<00:05:46.740> more<00:05:48.289> of<00:05:49.289> the<00:05:51.199> gel<00:05:52.199> medium<00:05:56.659> to

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:57.659 
a little bit more of the gel medium to

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:58.969 
a little bit more of the gel medium to
spread<00:05:57.930> it<00:05:58.050> out<00:05:58.139> even<00:05:58.440> a<00:05:58.469> little<00:05:58.590> bit<00:05:58.710> further

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
spread it out even a little bit further

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:05.749 
spread it out even a little bit further
than<00:05:59.190> it<00:06:03.469> has<00:06:04.469> a<00:06:04.500> brick<00:06:04.860> gritty<00:06:05.159> feel<00:06:05.520> to<00:06:05.729> a

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 
than it has a brick gritty feel to a

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:09.860 
than it has a brick gritty feel to a
very<00:06:06.210> interesting<00:06:06.690> field<00:06:08.060> ok<00:06:09.060> so<00:06:09.180> here<00:06:09.659> it<00:06:09.780> is

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
very interesting field ok so here it is

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.680 
very interesting field ok so here it is
oh<00:06:10.169> yeah<00:06:10.530> this<00:06:11.520> is<00:06:11.580> going<00:06:11.819> to<00:06:11.880> be<00:06:11.969> nice<00:06:12.180> it's

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
oh yeah this is going to be nice it's

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.629 
oh yeah this is going to be nice it's
going<00:06:12.870> to<00:06:12.930> be<00:06:12.990> fun<00:06:13.169> stuff<00:06:15.080> and<00:06:16.099> you<00:06:17.099> can<00:06:17.310> mix<00:06:17.490> it

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
going to be fun stuff and you can mix it

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.480 
going to be fun stuff and you can mix it
on<00:06:17.729> the<00:06:17.880> on<00:06:18.150> the<00:06:18.210> piece<00:06:18.710> so<00:06:19.710> that's<00:06:19.949> how<00:06:20.219> that's

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
on the on the piece so that's how that's

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.809 
on the on the piece so that's how that's
going<00:06:20.699> to<00:06:20.759> look<00:06:20.849> I<00:06:21.860> am<00:06:22.860> going<00:06:23.130> to<00:06:23.310> let<00:06:23.430> this<00:06:23.580> dry

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819 
going to look I am going to let this dry

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:24.830 
going to look I am going to let this dry
and<00:06:23.969> I'm<00:06:24.029> going<00:06:24.150> to<00:06:24.210> come<00:06:24.360> back<00:06:24.389> because<00:06:24.659> I

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
and I'm going to come back because I

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.180 
and I'm going to come back because I
think<00:06:24.900> this<00:06:25.229> will<00:06:25.380> probably<00:06:25.680> drive

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
think this will probably drive

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.879 
think this will probably drive
relatively<00:06:26.849> clear<00:06:27.120> and<00:06:27.529> so<00:06:28.529> I<00:06:28.590> think<00:06:28.680> it's

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
relatively clear and so I think it's

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.980 
relatively clear and so I think it's
going<00:06:28.979> to<00:06:29.069> be<00:06:29.219> very<00:06:29.250> important<00:06:29.940> for<00:06:30.120> to<00:06:30.690> dry

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
going to be very important for to dry

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.480 
going to be very important for to dry
thoroughly<00:06:31.259> before<00:06:31.469> we<00:06:31.889> take<00:06:32.039> a<00:06:32.069> look<00:06:32.279> any

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
thoroughly before we take a look any

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.890 
thoroughly before we take a look any
further<00:06:32.699> at<00:06:33.000> it<00:06:33.150> so<00:06:33.840> that<00:06:34.830> is<00:06:35.159> the<00:06:35.849> black<00:06:36.509> Flint

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
further at it so that is the black Flint

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.589 
further at it so that is the black Flint
texture<00:06:37.560> gel<00:06:37.800> mixed<00:06:38.699> with<00:06:39.229> some<00:06:41.419> gel<00:06:42.419> medium

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 
texture gel mixed with some gel medium

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:47.059 
texture gel mixed with some gel medium
and<00:06:43.849> a<00:06:44.849> little<00:06:45.300> bit<00:06:45.389> of<00:06:45.449> halo<00:06:46.229> turquoise<00:06:46.710> paint

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:47.069 
and a little bit of halo turquoise paint

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:48.800 
and a little bit of halo turquoise paint
so<00:06:47.789> I'm<00:06:47.849> going<00:06:48.000> to<00:06:48.029> let<00:06:48.180> that<00:06:48.210> dry<00:06:48.539> and<00:06:48.719> we'll

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
so I'm going to let that dry and we'll

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.009 
so I'm going to let that dry and we'll
take<00:06:48.960> a<00:06:49.020> look<00:06:49.229> at<00:06:49.380> it<00:06:49.409> when<00:06:49.560> it's<00:06:49.800> done
