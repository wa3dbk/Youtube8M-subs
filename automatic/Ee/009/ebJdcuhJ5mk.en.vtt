00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.710
 a companion finished in 619 and for 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.730
 what I understand even for a 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.230
 official twitter of carabineros that the 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.470
 restriction applies only to 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.090
 vehicles with four more wheels but at the 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.430
 long day I've seen myself in several 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.000
 Motorcycle forums that have split 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.000
 many motorcycles 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.419
 and because they are taking part of the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.419
 motorcycles 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.540
 do not 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.410
 what worries me is that I say in case 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.010
 because now I just handed myself 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:42.339
 the restrictions until 20 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.339
 Then yes of course you call me 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.739
 and what do I say in case you do it? 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.129
 now I am in santiago center I have 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.320
 to go to the drawer of the Maipo and 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.940
 there are many carabineros controls 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.560
 what happens if they stop me and they want to leave me 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.700
 so many new acquaintances already 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.840
 they have taken out today's part 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.840
 I'll repeat it 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.990
 the interior of a single 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.570
 and a photo 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.299
 how 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:39.180
 I insist, I already understood, I already have 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.450
 screenshots of the three pages but still 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.100
 so if you like he sent you the photos of 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.590
 the parts that are cut the attended 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.590
 today to motorcycles by restriction 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.650
 Tell me who what I say is to say 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.660
 it's enough that I named him those three 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.020
 pages to an officer so they do not see the 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.020
 part 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.060
 I am asking you 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.060
 with the number of places 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.820
 with respect of course 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.970
 Y 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.970
 it would be perfect 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.000
 the paper relationship with a lighthouse 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.690
 perfect then I understand with whom 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.690
 I have the pleasure sorry 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.800
 thank you very much for your attention 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.800
 very good, see you later
