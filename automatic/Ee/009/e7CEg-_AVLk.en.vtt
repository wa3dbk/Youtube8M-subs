the<00:01:15.030> explosions<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.750> you've<00:01:15.930> got<00:01:16.080> time<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
the explosions that you've got time to

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.940 
eat and and and the environments are
actually<00:01:18.840> bigger<00:01:19.080> because<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.800> because

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
actually bigger because of that because

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.860 
actually bigger because of that because
otherwise<00:01:20.370> would<00:01:20.909> be<00:01:20.940> like<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.510> it<00:01:21.630> was<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
otherwise would be like if it was the

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.180 
otherwise would be like if it was the
same<00:01:22.080> small<00:01:22.409> environment<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.980> had<00:01:23.070> all<00:01:23.159> that

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
same small environment you had all that

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.920 
same small environment you had all that
 going<00:01:23.730> on<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.480> would<00:01:24.600> know<00:01:24.630> what

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
 going on like you would know what

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.410 
 going on like you would know what
do<00:01:25.110> what<00:01:25.560> did<00:01:25.620> I<00:01:25.740> looking<00:01:25.980> at<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.490> now<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.300> a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
do what did I looking at so now it's a

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.480 
do what did I looking at so now it's a
bigger<00:01:27.600> environment<00:01:28.440> to<00:01:28.560> how<00:01:29.100> would<00:01:29.310> that

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
bigger environment to how would that

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.040 
bigger environment to how would that
work<00:01:29.550> though<00:01:29.940> I<00:01:30.120> mean<00:01:30.300> because<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.810> figured

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
work though I mean because you figured

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.770 
work though I mean because you figured
so<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.100> means<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.030> know<00:01:33.180> even<00:01:33.450> though

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
so that means that you know even though

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.840 
so that means that you know even though
everybody<00:01:34.200> could<00:01:34.530> take<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:34.890> opponent<00:01:35.190> you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
everybody could take one opponent you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.670 
everybody could take one opponent you
can<00:01:36.030> switch<00:01:36.240> off<00:01:36.420> at<00:01:36.720> any<00:01:36.870> time<00:01:37.170> or<00:01:37.380> double

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
can switch off at any time or double

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.100 
can switch off at any time or double

this<00:03:47.670> is<00:03:47.760> going<00:03:47.849> to<00:03:47.909> go<00:03:48.030> down<00:03:48.060> differently<00:03:48.689> and

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
this is going to go down differently and

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.920 
this is going to go down differently and

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
a bunch of what-if scenarios and taking

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.679 
a bunch of what-if scenarios and taking
it<00:03:56.489> into<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:56.730> different<00:03:57.060> tangent<00:03:57.480> without

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
it into a different tangent without

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.839 
it into a different tangent without
going<00:03:57.900> off<00:03:58.139> the<00:03:58.260> deep<00:03:58.319> end<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:59.430> there's<00:03:59.700> going

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
going off the deep end and there's going

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.149 
going off the deep end and there's going
to<00:03:59.939> be<00:03:59.969> some<00:04:00.209> other<00:04:00.329> crazy<00:04:00.689> what<00:04:01.560> ifs<00:04:01.739> in<00:04:01.920> there
