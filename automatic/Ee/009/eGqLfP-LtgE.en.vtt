00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
conflicts when then when a Pavlov

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.469 
conflicts when then when a Pavlov
refused<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.490> read<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.000> said<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.270> call

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
yourself a scientist and it was a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.410 
yourself a scientist and it was a
wonderful<00:01:54.509> open<00:01:55.200> letter<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.799> then<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:57.090> week

well<00:05:23.699> um<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.419> early<00:05:24.870> lawyer<00:05:25.560> I<00:05:25.800> read<00:05:26.039> was<00:05:26.340> very

well um the early lawyer I read was very

well um the early lawyer I read was very
different<00:05:27.120> I<00:05:27.270> think<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.539> first<00:05:27.840> lawyer<00:05:28.080> I

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
different I think the first lawyer I

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.490 
different I think the first lawyer I
read<00:05:28.680> was<00:05:28.979> the<00:05:29.630> probably<00:05:30.630> in<00:05:30.750> the<00:05:30.840> late<00:05:30.990> 50s

read was the probably in the late 50s
was<00:05:31.889> the<00:05:32.130> nature<00:05:32.460> of<00:05:32.490> human<00:05:32.880> conflicts<00:05:33.450> and<00:05:33.660> in

was the nature of human conflicts and in

was the nature of human conflicts and in

constantly among my own patients but
this<00:05:51.599> was<00:05:51.750> the<00:05:51.900> first<00:05:51.930> consideration<00:05:52.860> I<00:05:53.010> had

this was the first consideration I had

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:57.409 
this was the first consideration I had
seen<00:05:53.310> and<00:05:54.060> then<00:05:54.419> in<00:05:54.630> the<00:05:55.039> mid-60s<00:05:56.419> higher

cortical functions was published and

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.650

somehow the the stultifying sort of

phonological neurology which you know

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
which I had been taught could be

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:09.980 
which I had been taught could be
replaced<00:06:08.430> by<00:06:08.699> this<00:06:08.760> wonderful<00:06:09.180> notion<00:06:09.810> of

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
replaced by this wonderful notion of

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.070 
replaced by this wonderful notion of
functional<00:06:10.590> systems<00:06:11.419> with<00:06:12.419> with<00:06:12.720> different

functional systems with with different

functional systems with with different

components and that seemed to me very

components and that seemed to me very
very<00:06:17.729> exciting<00:06:18.389> but<00:06:19.380> then<00:06:19.770> an<00:06:20.340> entirely

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
very exciting but then an entirely

very exciting but then an entirely
different<00:06:21.510> sort<00:06:21.870> of<00:06:22.020> excitement<00:06:22.680> came<00:06:22.919> in

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
different sort of excitement came in

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.810 
different sort of excitement came in
when<00:06:23.729> I<00:06:23.760> saw<00:06:24.060> the<00:06:24.150> mind<00:06:24.479> of<00:06:24.599> an<00:06:24.720> eminent<00:06:24.960> I<00:06:25.820> lit

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
when I saw the mind of an eminent I lit

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.520 
when I saw the mind of an eminent I lit
the<00:06:26.940> first<00:06:27.180> 30<00:06:27.449> pages<00:06:27.570> thinking<00:06:28.320> it<00:06:28.380> was<00:06:28.500> a

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
the first 30 pages thinking it was a

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.430 
the first 30 pages thinking it was a
novel<00:06:28.919> and<00:06:29.389> that<00:06:30.389> I<00:06:30.419> realized<00:06:30.870> it<00:06:30.990> wasn't<00:06:31.199> a

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
novel and that I realized it wasn't a

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.250 
novel and that I realized it wasn't a
novel<00:06:31.800> but<00:06:32.280> a<00:06:32.310> wonderful<00:06:32.969> case<00:06:33.180> history<00:06:33.690> with

novel but a wonderful case history with
all<00:06:34.469> the<00:06:34.620> accuracy<00:06:35.250> of<00:06:35.280> science

all the accuracy of science

all the accuracy of science

structure of a novel and I think I'm

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.230 
structure of a novel and I think I'm

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 
sort of a storyteller myself or rather I

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.540 
sort of a storyteller myself or rather I
have<00:06:47.540> a<00:06:47.570> storytelling<00:06:48.320> impulse<00:06:48.830> which

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
have a storytelling impulse which

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.120 
have a storytelling impulse which
sometimes<00:06:50.090> seems<00:06:50.210> to<00:06:50.690> compete<00:06:51.500> with<00:06:52.010> the

sometimes seems to compete with the

sometimes seems to compete with the
analytical<00:06:52.730> impulse<00:06:53.560> and<00:06:57.130> but<00:06:58.130> certainly

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:58.760 
analytical impulse and but certainly

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.300 
analytical impulse and but certainly
seeing<00:06:59.150> the<00:06:59.900> mind<00:07:00.139> of<00:07:00.350> an<00:07:00.440> eminent<00:07:00.710> I<00:07:01.070> think

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.310 
seeing the mind of an eminent I think

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.680 
seeing the mind of an eminent I think
made<00:07:02.090> me<00:07:02.200> fortified<00:07:03.200> me<00:07:03.500> in<00:07:04.040> my<00:07:05.030> own<00:07:05.180> feeling

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.690 
made me fortified me in my own feeling

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.460 
made me fortified me in my own feeling
that<00:07:05.930> I<00:07:05.960> had<00:07:06.380> to<00:07:07.060> attempt<00:07:08.060> some<00:07:08.660> similar<00:07:09.229> sort

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
that I had to attempt some similar sort

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.700 
that I had to attempt some similar sort
of<00:07:09.530> portraits<00:07:10.190> of<00:07:10.370> my<00:07:10.850> own<00:07:11.000> patients<00:07:11.660> which<00:07:12.470> is

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710 
of portraits of my own patients which is

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.420 
of portraits of my own patients which is
which<00:07:13.040> is<00:07:13.070> what<00:07:13.340> I<00:07:13.370> did<00:07:13.940> in<00:07:13.970> awakenings

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.430 
which is what I did in awakenings

which is what I did in awakenings
and<00:07:17.200> I<00:07:20.139> I<00:07:21.580> loved<00:07:23.110> Victorian<00:07:24.110> case<00:07:24.500> histories

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:25.040
