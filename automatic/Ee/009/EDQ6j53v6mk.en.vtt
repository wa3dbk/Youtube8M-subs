00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
the big breakthroughs and I think is

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.660 
the big breakthroughs and I think is
going<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.380> be<00:02:07.409> convenient<00:02:07.799> for<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.190> buyer<00:02:08.399> is

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
going to be convenient for this buyer is

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.550 
going to be convenient for this buyer is
that<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.119> vehicle<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.599> garage<00:02:10.080> able<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
that this vehicle is garage able and

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.860 
that this vehicle is garage able and
that's<00:02:10.739> true<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.310> e<00:02:11.340> el<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:11.910> well<00:02:12.150> that's

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
that's true of the e el as well that's

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.850 
that's true of the e el as well that's
going<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.140> be<00:02:13.200> met<00:02:13.470> with<00:02:13.650> all
