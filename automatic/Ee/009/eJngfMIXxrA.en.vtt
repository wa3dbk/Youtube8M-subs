could drive it to club racing events
however<00:03:56.269> it<00:03:57.269> makes<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.720> much<00:03:58.109> easier<00:03:58.170> for<00:03:58.470> club

use during his first several
high-performance<00:04:09.180> drive-ins<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:10.200> is<00:04:10.470> a

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
high-performance drive-ins it is a
