00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.069 

this<00:00:39.079> engine<00:00:39.350> made<00:00:39.739> noises<00:00:40.629> let's<00:00:41.629> figure<00:00:41.870> out

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
this engine made noises let's figure out

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.170 
this engine made noises let's figure out
what<00:00:42.140> happened<00:00:42.909> upon<00:00:43.909> further<00:00:44.179> disassembly<00:00:44.989> I

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
what happened upon further disassembly I

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.279 
what happened upon further disassembly I
start<00:00:47.180> I<00:00:47.269> took<00:00:47.329> off<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:47.690> spark<00:00:47.930> plug<00:00:48.170> in<00:00:50.289> yeah

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
start I took off the spark plug in yeah

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.609 
start I took off the spark plug in yeah
you<00:00:51.350> can<00:00:51.559> see<00:00:51.769> it<00:00:52.149> there's<00:00:53.149> little<00:00:53.449> chips<00:00:54.440> and

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:54.619 
you can see it there's little chips and

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:55.959 
you can see it there's little chips and
dents<00:00:54.829> on<00:00:55.039> the<00:00:55.070> spark<00:00:55.399> plug<00:00:55.579> that<00:00:55.729> weren't

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
dents on the spark plug that weren't

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.240 
dents on the spark plug that weren't
there<00:00:56.089> the<00:00:56.210> last<00:00:56.329> time<00:00:56.479> I<00:00:56.629> had<00:00:56.780> it<00:00:56.809> out<00:00:57.250> so

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
there the last time I had it out so

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.240 
there the last time I had it out so
there's<00:00:58.729> probably<00:00:58.850> something<00:00:59.390> inside<00:00:59.839> the

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
there's probably something inside the

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.520 
there's probably something inside the
cylinder<00:01:01.250> head<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:01.879> um<00:01:02.119> I'm<00:01:03.019> going<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:03.199> keep<00:01:03.379> on

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
cylinder head so um I'm going to keep on

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.039 
cylinder head so um I'm going to keep on
plugging<00:01:03.859> ahead<00:01:03.979> I<00:01:04.600> just<00:01:05.600> took<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:05.869> valve

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
plugging ahead I just took the valve

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.649 
plugging ahead I just took the valve
cover<00:01:06.350> off<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:06.560> everything<00:01:06.950> looks<00:01:07.659> pretty

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
cover off and everything looks pretty

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.370 
cover off and everything looks pretty
happy<00:01:08.929> um<00:01:10.569> so<00:01:11.569> I'm<00:01:11.690> gonna<00:01:11.810> go<00:01:11.990> ahead<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.200> take

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
happy um so I'm gonna go ahead and take

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.980 
happy um so I'm gonna go ahead and take
the<00:01:12.530> head<00:01:12.649> off<00:01:12.679> now<00:01:14.319> okay<00:01:15.319> so<00:01:16.240> not<00:01:17.240> as<00:01:17.450> bad<00:01:17.690> as<00:01:17.720> I

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
the head off now okay so not as bad as I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.880 
the head off now okay so not as bad as I
thought<00:01:18.310> um<00:01:19.929> there<00:01:20.929> was<00:01:21.080> a<00:01:21.140> foreign<00:01:21.530> piece<00:01:21.709> of

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
thought um there was a foreign piece of

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.110 
thought um there was a foreign piece of
metal<00:01:22.009> in<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:22.340> engine

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.430 

it<00:01:26.120> did<00:01:26.420> a<00:01:26.450> little<00:01:26.870> bit<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.320> damage<00:01:28.960> not<00:01:29.960> too

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
it did a little bit of damage not too

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.800 
it did a little bit of damage not too
bad

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.620 

it's<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.899> little<00:01:34.939> bang<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.119> bowels<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.509> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
it's a little bang the bowels up a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.649 
it's a little bang the bowels up a
little<00:01:36.840> bit<00:01:37.020> took<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> little<00:01:37.680> bit<00:01:37.890> out<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.130> here

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
little bit took a little bit out of here

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:46.060 
little bit took a little bit out of here
this<00:01:39.659> area<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.079> all<00:01:40.229> fine<00:01:40.970> intake<00:01:41.970> valves<00:01:42.329> fine

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.380 

this<00:01:47.070> thing's<00:01:47.280> pretty<00:01:47.490> good<00:01:47.820> looking

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.080 

seem<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:51.200> survive<00:01:51.590> pretty<00:01:51.860> well<00:01:53.710> see<00:01:55.060> what<00:01:56.060> a

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
seem to survive pretty well see what a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.540 
seem to survive pretty well see what a
piece<00:01:56.360> of<00:01:56.390> their<00:01:57.050> 1<00:01:57.260> i've<00:01:57.710> moved<00:01:58.010> that's<00:01:58.340> all

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
piece of their 1 i've moved that's all

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:06.160 
piece of their 1 i've moved that's all
that<00:01:58.729> was<00:01:58.850> in<00:01:58.909> there<00:02:02.650> well

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.230 

so<00:02:06.710> I<00:02:06.920> think<00:02:07.250> this<00:02:07.369> ends<00:02:07.670> in<00:02:07.759> savable

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
so I think this ends in savable

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.210 
so I think this ends in savable
I'm<00:02:09.780> gonna<00:02:10.020> get<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.230> new<00:02:10.410> head<00:02:10.620> I<00:02:10.830> probably

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
I'm gonna get a new head I probably

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.690 
I'm gonna get a new head I probably
won't<00:02:12.140> still<00:02:13.140> runs<00:02:13.380> fine<00:02:13.620> but<00:02:14.220> we'll<00:02:14.310> run<00:02:14.490> even

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
won't still runs fine but we'll run even

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.390 
won't still runs fine but we'll run even
better<00:02:14.880> now<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.270> there's<00:02:15.450> no<00:02:16.010> debris<00:02:17.010> inside

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
better now that there's no debris inside

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
better now that there's no debris inside
the<00:02:17.850> engine<00:02:20.600> yeah<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.870> cylinder<00:02:22.140> bores<00:02:22.530> fine

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
the engine yeah the cylinder bores fine

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.850 
the engine yeah the cylinder bores fine
not<00:02:24.420> scored<00:02:25.220> thankfully<00:02:27.560> still<00:02:28.560> has<00:02:28.710> good

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
not scored thankfully still has good

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.050 
not scored thankfully still has good
compression<00:02:30.110> this<00:02:31.110> engine<00:02:31.910> thankfully<00:02:32.910> will

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
compression this engine thankfully will

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.220 
compression this engine thankfully will
be<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.390> fine<00:02:33.740> thanks<00:02:34.740> for<00:02:34.770> watching
