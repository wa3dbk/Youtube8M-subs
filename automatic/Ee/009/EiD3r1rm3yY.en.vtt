00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.010 
average is 79 so we were a few degrees
below<00:01:44.130> average<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.360> did<00:01:45.509> see<00:01:45.659> plenty<00:01:45.960> of

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
below average but we did see plenty of

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.510 
below average but we did see plenty of
sunshine<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.530> was<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.829> gorgeous<00:01:47.070> looking

day<00:01:47.670> out<00:01:47.820> there<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.299> high-pressure<00:01:48.810> really

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
day out there and high-pressure really

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.679 
day out there and high-pressure really
dominated<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:49.950> was<00:01:50.159> warmer<00:01:50.579> today<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.509> as

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
dominated so it was warmer today but as

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.330

we head into the next couple of days low

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.069 
we head into the next couple of days low
pressures<00:01:53.729> gonna<00:01:53.880> move<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.390> we're<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:54.960> gonna

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
pressures gonna move in we're not gonna

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.690 
pressures gonna move in we're not gonna
feel<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.470> right<00:01:55.619> away<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:55.950> gonna<00:01:56.159> sit<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.579> our

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
feel it right away it's gonna sit to our

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.060 
feel it right away it's gonna sit to our
north<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.570> eventually<00:01:57.990> we<00:01:58.680> will<00:01:58.860> see<00:01:59.040> a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
north but eventually we will see a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.740 
north but eventually we will see a
little<00:01:59.280> bit<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.490> cooling<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.509> way<00:02:00.600> and

little bit of cooling on the way and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.789 
little bit of cooling on the way and
we'll<00:02:00.840> have<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.110> near<00:02:01.259> five-day<00:02:01.560> forecast

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799

low<00:02:41.520> pressure<00:02:41.760> sitting<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.210> our<00:02:42.330> north<00:02:42.600> you'll

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
low pressure sitting to our north you'll

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.210 
low pressure sitting to our north you'll
see<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.140> in<00:02:43.230> your<00:02:43.290> forecast<00:02:43.530> right<00:02:43.950> here

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
see that in your forecast right here

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.980 
see that in your forecast right here
eventually<00:02:44.820> that<00:02:45.420> trough<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.720> low<00:02:45.900> pressure

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
eventually that trough of low pressure

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.140 
eventually that trough of low pressure
is<00:02:46.320> gonna<00:02:46.470> dig<00:02:46.920> into<00:02:47.100> Southern<00:02:47.430> California

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
is gonna dig into Southern California

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.270 
is gonna dig into Southern California
and<00:02:48.330> we're<00:02:48.780> gonna<00:02:48.930> see<00:02:49.200> well<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.680> little<00:02:50.010> bit<00:02:50.130> of

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
and we're gonna see well a little bit of

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.949 
and we're gonna see well a little bit of
a<00:02:50.400> cool-down<00:02:50.850> we're<00:02:51.480> not<00:02:51.600> gonna<00:02:51.690> feel<00:02:51.930> it

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
a cool-down we're not gonna feel it

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.900 
a cool-down we're not gonna feel it
right<00:02:52.230> away<00:02:52.470> but<00:02:52.740> looks<00:02:53.040> like<00:02:53.160> we<00:02:53.430> could<00:02:53.670> start

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
right away but looks like we could start

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.060 
right away but looks like we could start
to<00:02:54.060> feel<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.390> as<00:02:54.510> we<00:02:54.959> head<00:02:55.170> into<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.620> later

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
to feel it as we head into the later

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.310 
to feel it as we head into the later
part<00:02:56.580> of<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:57.000> week<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.420> let's<00:02:57.810> get<00:02:57.990> a<00:02:58.020> look<00:02:58.140> at

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
part of the week so let's get a look at

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.810 
part of the week so let's get a look at
what<00:02:58.590> we're<00:02:58.709> working<00:02:58.860> with<00:02:59.040> as<00:02:59.400> we<00:02:59.550> head<00:02:59.700> to

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
what we're working with as we head to

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.190 
what we're working with as we head to
the<00:02:59.910> basin<00:03:00.240> in<00:03:00.330> Orange<00:03:00.600> County<00:03:00.780> well<00:03:01.080> you'll

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
the basin in Orange County well you'll

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.800 
the basin in Orange County well you'll
see<00:03:01.380> right<00:03:01.530> here<00:03:02.000> mid-70s<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.330> that's<00:03:03.570> really

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
see right here mid-70s and that's really

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.180 
see right here mid-70s and that's really
gonna<00:03:03.900> be<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.080> case<00:03:04.290> for<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.530> next<00:03:04.800> few<00:03:04.950> days

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
gonna be the case for the next few days

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.280 
gonna be the case for the next few days
so<00:03:05.220> for<00:03:05.520> tomorrow<00:03:05.880> mid<00:03:06.150> 70s<00:03:06.600> by<00:03:06.630> Friday<00:03:06.720> low
