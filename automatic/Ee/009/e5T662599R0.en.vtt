00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.930 
would recommend it but it's not one of
the<00:02:33.450> coolest<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.230> it's<00:02:35.099> not<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.459> course<00:02:35.700> to

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
the coolest and it's not the course to

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.000 
the coolest and it's not the course to
look<00:02:36.150> at<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:37.110> it's<00:02:37.349> not<00:02:37.530> really<00:02:37.769> something

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
look at and it's not really something

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.270 
look at and it's not really something
where<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.310> put<00:02:38.579> on<00:02:38.640> display<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.329> I<00:02:40.280> would

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
where you put on display and I would

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.479 
where you put on display and I would
rather<00:02:41.909> have<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.450> jet<00:02:42.870> than<00:02:43.319> this<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:44.010> but

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
rather have the jet than this and but

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.509 
rather have the jet than this and but
this<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.819> still<00:02:45.030> cool<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:46.019> does<00:02:46.230> look<00:02:46.440> cool<00:02:46.769> as
