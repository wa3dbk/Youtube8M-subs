 hello my name is angelina dance and 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.990
 live food and today I want with you 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.480
 share my morning recipe 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.759
 morning drink which I advise you 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.740
 necessarily 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.049
 apply your diet especially in 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.260
 winter time this drink will protect 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.600
 you and your family from any diseases and 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.779
 since there are always a few ingredients 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.599
 ginger I start with such a piece for two 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.900
 human if you are environmentally friendly 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.980
 ginger then it is not necessary to clean 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.239
 just rinse 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:49.230
 if not, you just need to quickly about 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:52.699
 scrape off the skin with a knife and take it 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.829
 ansem beretta anti 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:01.890
 inflammatory it will protect your body 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:06.379
 against any inflammation and also anti 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.379
 parasites so rinse 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:17.550
 I'll cut it a little so that it is not 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.340
 too big pieces and i attach 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.170
 it's in my blender that way now 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.390
 I need to add a little fluid this 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.430
 maybe water it could be tea 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.180
 herbal tea that you already have 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.130
 I stayed tea from yesterday's 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.520
 so I think you add quickly 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.710
 literally a little bit to cover 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.100
 ginger help blender 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:46.490
 and scroll it all into a homogeneous mass 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.490
 and I'm starting my sundae 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.710
 I think this is not enough 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:05.090
 no pieces left now for me 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:12.100
 need to do this filter the resulting 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:17.140
 mass through a bag or through se. 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.140
 to remove all remaining fibers 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.340
 again I remind you that you can 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.790
 make also through juicer like 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:33.730
 itâ€™s convenient for you 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:37.910
 homogeneous mass ginger drink 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.650
 what I add here is half a lemon you 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:53.420
 can add a price to him 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:03:02.470
 and the next ingredient is cayenne 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:02.470
 pepper literally pinch big and honey 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.130
 at this stage 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.670
 principle is enough if you 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.190
 I want to enrich your drink 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.110
 then you can add any of your favorite 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.720
 green green powder it can be 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.250
 spirulina it could be clara allo i on 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.110
 I will add this moment 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:39.040
 the shower I use to say 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.580
 so in order to enrich my 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.580
 health 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.610
 literally 2 caps enough 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:07.730
 add a little tea again and again 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.730
 a few seconds scroll my player 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:26.490
 that's enough i spill my drink 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:30.930
 I add a cup of warm water to my 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:35.130

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:40.970
