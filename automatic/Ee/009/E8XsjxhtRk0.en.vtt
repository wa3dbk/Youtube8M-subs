actually for to replace my mac 217 so I
ordered<00:00:39.360> two<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.750> those<00:00:40.050> because<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.530> thought

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
ordered two of those because I thought

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.819 
ordered two of those because I thought
they'd<00:00:40.890> get<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.100> lot<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.340> views<00:00:42.530> then<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.649> ordered

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
they'd get a lot of views then I ordered

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.459 
they'd get a lot of views then I ordered
the<00:00:44.250> crease<00:00:44.850> brush<00:00:45.059> which<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.780> really<00:00:46.110> don't

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
the crease brush which I really don't

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.959 
the crease brush which I really don't
think<00:00:46.559> as<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> crease<00:00:47.100> brush<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.550> actually<00:00:47.700> think

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
think as a crease brush I actually think

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.760 
think as a crease brush I actually think
this<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> blending<00:00:48.809> brush<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.050> those<00:00:49.469> are

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
this is a blending brush and those are

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.250 
this is a blending brush and those are
more<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> crease<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.719> my<00:00:51.870> opinion

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
more for the crease but just my opinion

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.060 
more for the crease but just my opinion
I<00:00:52.879> did<00:00:55.250> cave<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.760> optical<00:00:57.300> blurring

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
I did cave and get the optical blurring

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.750 
I did cave and get the optical blurring
foundation<00:00:59.070> brush<00:00:59.340> I<00:01:01.309> haven't<00:01:02.309> used<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.730> yet

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
foundation brush I haven't used it yet

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.179 
foundation brush I haven't used it yet
so<00:01:03.180> I'll<00:01:03.870> let<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.110> know<00:01:04.140> what<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.379> think<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:05.010> i

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
so I'll let you know what I think but i

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.380 
so I'll let you know what I think but i
think<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.909> it's<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:07.380> lot<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.950> sigma

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
think it's it's a lot like the sigma

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.560 
think it's it's a lot like the sigma
kabuki<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.500> low<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.299> got<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
kabuki that I so so low and I got the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.280 
kabuki that I so so low and I got the
powder<00:01:12.810> brush<00:01:13.229> which<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.670> soft<00:01:15.659> these<00:01:16.110> are

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
powder brush which is so soft these are

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.230 
powder brush which is so soft these are
crazy<00:01:16.650> crazy<00:01:16.799> soft<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:18.259> these<00:01:20.240> these

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
crazy crazy soft and these these

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.910 
crazy crazy soft and these these
blending<00:01:21.689> brushes<00:01:21.900> have<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> right

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
blending brushes have just the right

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.859 
blending brushes have just the right
amount<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.430> sort<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.850> stiffness<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.659> think

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
amount of sort of stiffness so I think

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.749 
amount of sort of stiffness so I think
they're<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:25.979> really<00:01:26.250> good<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.460> use
