into the description box in this video
and<00:01:08.720> download<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:10.770> SMD<00:01:11.100> exporter<00:01:12.290> now<00:01:13.290> put

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
and download the SMD exporter now put

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.880 
and download the SMD exporter now put
that<00:01:13.950> file<00:01:15.200> into<00:01:16.200> your<00:01:16.850> scripts<00:01:17.850> folder<00:01:18.890> which

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
that file into your scripts folder which

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.719 
that file into your scripts folder which
is<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.420> which<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.600> by<00:01:21.750> default<00:01:22.280> where<00:01:23.280> you've

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
is in which is by default where you've

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.149 
is in which is by default where you've
installed<00:01:24.299> blender<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.740> your<00:01:25.950> blender

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
installed blender so in your blender

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.340 
installed blender so in your blender
install<00:01:27.090> directory<00:01:27.600> there<00:01:27.900> should<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.320> a

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
install directory there should be a

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.069 
install directory there should be a
scripts<00:01:28.920> folder<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.520> that's<00:01:30.450> where<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.750> put

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
scripts folder and that's where you put

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.539 
scripts folder and that's where you put
the<00:01:32.070> SMD<00:01:32.430> exporter<00:01:33.439> a<00:01:35.030> py<00:01:36.030> file<00:01:37.100> yeah<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.369> think

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the SMD exporter a py file yeah I think

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.899 
the SMD exporter a py file yeah I think
that's<00:01:38.970> what<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.360> called<00:01:40.610> once<00:01:41.610> you've<00:01:41.790> done

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
that's what it's called once you've done

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.080 
that's what it's called once you've done
that<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.420> restart<00:01:43.020> blender<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:44.090> just

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
that you can restart blender and just

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.940 
that you can restart blender and just
press<00:01:45.390> file<00:01:46.009> export<00:01:47.119> half-life<00:01:48.119> 2's<00:01:48.390> md

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
press file export half-life 2's md

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.359 
press file export half-life 2's md
static<00:01:49.950> mesh<00:01:50.420> okay<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.799> suggest<00:01:52.799> making<00:01:53.070> your

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
static mesh okay I suggest making your

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.209 
static mesh okay I suggest making your
own<00:01:53.399> folder<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.479> smds<00:01:55.049> because<00:01:55.829> there's

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
own folder just for smds because there's

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.160 
own folder just for smds because there's
going<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.520> more<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.909> follow<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:57.630> for<00:01:57.960> this

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
going to be more to follow just for this

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.490 
going to be more to follow just for this
piece<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.619> toast<00:01:58.909> there's<00:01:59.909> more<00:02:00.270> than<00:02:00.719> one<00:02:00.930> SMD

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
piece of toast there's more than one SMD

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.990 
piece of toast there's more than one SMD
file<00:02:03.350> for<00:02:04.350> one<00:02:04.799> object<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:08.039> for<00:02:08.550> now<00:02:08.670> just

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
file for one object so but for now just

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.160 
file for one object so but for now just
export<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.899> call<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.770> toasts<00:02:11.160> dot<00:02:11.970> SMD<00:02:12.510> keep

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
export this call it toasts dot SMD keep

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.340 
export this call it toasts dot SMD keep
your<00:02:13.319> file<00:02:13.590> names<00:02:13.830> vary

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
your file names vary

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.700 
your file names vary
simple<00:02:14.710> don't<00:02:15.460> call<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:15.760> like<00:02:16.320> my<00:02:17.320> first

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
simple don't call it like my first

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.920 
simple don't call it like my first
objects<00:02:18.550> ever<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:20.070> nice<00:02:21.070> delicious<00:02:22.000> toast<00:02:22.480> or

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
objects ever a nice delicious toast or

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.140 
objects ever a nice delicious toast or
something<00:02:23.350> like<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:23.740> you<00:02:24.580> want<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.880> keep<00:02:25.000> it

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
something like that you want to keep it

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.280 
something like that you want to keep it
very<00:02:25.270> simple<00:02:25.770> because<00:02:27.270> if<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.870> have<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.020> long

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
very simple because if you have a long

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.380 
very simple because if you have a long
annoying<00:02:29.650> name<00:02:30.460> it's<00:02:30.790> going<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.060> bother<00:02:31.210> you

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
annoying name it's going to bother you

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.500 
annoying name it's going to bother you
later<00:02:32.670> once<00:02:33.670> we've<00:02:33.850> done<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:35.350> think<00:02:36.510> we

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
later once we've done that you think we

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.690 
later once we've done that you think we
were<00:02:37.660> done<00:02:37.870> in<00:02:38.020> blender<00:02:38.350> but<00:02:38.620> we<00:02:38.770> aren't<00:02:38.920> we

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
were done in blender but we aren't we

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.210 
were done in blender but we aren't we
need<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:40.090> create<00:02:40.510> what<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:40.930> called<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.620> physics

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
need to create what is called a physics

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.820 
need to create what is called a physics
object<00:02:42.400> which<00:02:43.240> is<00:02:43.450> just<00:02:45.540> which<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.690> just<00:02:47.020> a

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
object which is just which is just a

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.180 
object which is just which is just a
thing<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.820> cube<00:02:49.600> around<00:02:50.700> or<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.730> shape<00:02:52.150> around

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
thing a cube around or a shape around

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.310 
thing a cube around or a shape around
the<00:02:54.190> object<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:55.060> we<00:02:55.240> already<00:02:55.390> have<00:02:55.630> that<00:02:56.110> is

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
the object that we already have that is

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.670 
the object that we already have that is
less<00:02:56.770> detailed<00:02:57.370> than<00:02:57.880> it<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:58.690> what<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:58.960> did<00:02:59.110> is<00:02:59.260> I

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
less detailed than it so what I did is I

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.860 
less detailed than it so what I did is I
created<00:02:59.740> a<00:03:00.280> new<00:03:00.310> object<00:03:00.730> this<00:03:01.300> time<00:03:01.600> we're

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
created a new object this time we're

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.810 
created a new object this time we're
going<00:03:01.990> to<00:03:02.050> create<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.320> new<00:03:02.560> object<00:03:02.590> not<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.400> an

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
going to create a new object not a an

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.500 
going to create a new object not a an
object<00:03:04.330> within<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:05.020> other<00:03:05.140> object<00:03:06.180> I'm<00:03:07.180> going

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
object within the other object I'm going

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.210 
object within the other object I'm going
to<00:03:07.570> not<00:03:08.410> move<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.950> objects<00:03:09.400> at<00:03:10.210> all<00:03:10.740> go<00:03:11.740> into

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
to not move the objects at all go into

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.140 
to not move the objects at all go into
edit<00:03:12.520> mode<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:13.300> then<00:03:14.260> I<00:03:14.410> can<00:03:14.590> move<00:03:14.970> move<00:03:15.970> my

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
edit mode and then I can move move my

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.260 
edit mode and then I can move move my
mesh<00:03:16.360> I'm<00:03:17.290> going<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.680> just<00:03:17.890> put<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:19.030> around

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
mesh I'm going to just put this around

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:28.740 
mesh I'm going to just put this around
my<00:03:20.050> piece<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.710> toast<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:26.700> I'm<00:03:27.720> going<00:03:28.720> to

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
my piece of toast and I'm going to

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.450 
my piece of toast and I'm going to
explain<00:03:29.020> this<00:03:29.080> without<00:03:29.500> saying<00:03:29.950> outline

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
explain this without saying outline

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.240 
explain this without saying outline
because<00:03:30.700> I<00:03:30.850> say<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.300> way<00:03:31.540> too<00:03:31.600> much<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.890> just

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
because I say that way too much so just

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.190 
because I say that way too much so just
bear<00:03:33.790> with<00:03:33.820> me<00:03:35.850> so<00:03:36.850> you<00:03:37.120> just<00:03:37.270> put<00:03:37.540> this<00:03:37.900> as<00:03:38.110> on

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
bear with me so you just put this as on

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.730 
bear with me so you just put this as on
just<00:03:41.200> put<00:03:41.410> this<00:03:41.560> around<00:03:41.770> a<00:03:42.430> piece<00:03:43.120> of<00:03:43.150> toast

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
just put this around a piece of toast

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.180 
just put this around a piece of toast
you<00:03:44.740> can<00:03:45.010> add<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.870> loop<00:03:46.870> cut<00:03:47.170> here<00:03:47.650> yeah<00:03:47.890> i<00:03:47.950> think

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
you can add a loop cut here yeah i think

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.590 
you can add a loop cut here yeah i think
it's<00:03:48.900> it's<00:03:49.900> necessary<00:03:50.880> now<00:03:51.880> that<00:03:52.120> we've<00:03:52.330> got

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
it's it's necessary now that we've got

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.310 
it's it's necessary now that we've got
our<00:03:52.630> nice<00:03:53.140> little<00:03:53.640> physical<00:03:54.640> object<00:03:55.320> physics

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
our nice little physical object physics

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.350 
our nice little physical object physics
object<00:03:57.000> okay<00:03:58.620> which<00:03:59.620> is<00:03:59.800> this<00:04:00.310> newly<00:04:01.120> created

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
object okay which is this newly created

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.770 
object okay which is this newly created
object<00:04:02.170> with<00:04:03.040> a<00:04:03.420> very<00:04:04.420> low<00:04:05.110> poly<00:04:05.770> count<00:04:06.100> a<00:04:06.780> very

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
object with a very low poly count a very

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.550 
object with a very low poly count a very
low<00:04:08.310> vertice<00:04:09.310> count<00:04:09.640> I<00:04:09.880> meant<00:04:10.410> this<00:04:11.410> is

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
low vertice count I meant this is

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.440 
low vertice count I meant this is
totally<00:04:11.770> optional<00:04:12.040> but<00:04:12.550> if<00:04:12.760> you<00:04:12.880> want<00:04:13.030> to<00:04:13.180> you

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
totally optional but if you want to you

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.310 
totally optional but if you want to you
can<00:04:13.630> go<00:04:13.690> into<00:04:14.050> object<00:04:14.710> this<00:04:15.550> object<00:04:15.760> stabbed

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
can go into object this object stabbed

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.420 
can go into object this object stabbed
in<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.380> draw<00:04:17.770> menu<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.910> draw<00:04:19.600> type<00:04:20.250> submenu<00:04:21.250> I

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
in the draw menu and draw type submenu I

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.740 
in the draw menu and draw type submenu I
guess<00:04:21.760> a<00:04:22.740> presswire<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:24.419> this<00:04:25.419> might<00:04:25.600> you

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
guess a presswire and this might you

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.230 
guess a presswire and this might you
this<00:04:26.530> might<00:04:26.740> get<00:04:26.890> you<00:04:27.040> a<00:04:27.070> better<00:04:27.220> idea<00:04:27.400> of<00:04:27.610> what

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
this might get you a better idea of what

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.279 
this might get you a better idea of what
this<00:04:29.039> physics<00:04:30.039> object<00:04:30.729> really<00:04:30.970> does<00:04:31.289> it's

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
this physics object really does it's

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:39.240 
this physics object really does it's
just<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:32.940> show's<00:04:34.620> source<00:04:35.620> where<00:04:37.380> it<00:04:38.380> gives<00:04:38.860> a

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
just the show's source where it gives a

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.080 
just the show's source where it gives a
gift<00:04:39.880> source<00:04:40.180> a<00:04:40.389> less<00:04:40.569> detailed<00:04:41.080> version<00:04:42.090> to

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
gift source a less detailed version to

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.360 
gift source a less detailed version to
work<00:04:43.389> on<00:04:43.810> in<00:04:44.259> the<00:04:44.410> physics<00:04:44.860> so<00:04:45.370> if<00:04:46.150> we<00:04:46.990> were<00:04:47.199> to

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
work on in the physics so if we were to

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.550 
work on in the physics so if we were to
if<00:04:48.370> it<00:04:48.610> were<00:04:48.759> to<00:04:49.319> use<00:04:50.319> this<00:04:50.880> object<00:04:52.380> this<00:04:53.380> high

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
if it were to use this object this high

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.490 
if it were to use this object this high
detailed<00:04:54.009> object<00:04:54.759> as<00:04:54.880> a<00:04:54.910> physics<00:04:55.389> object<00:04:55.599> it

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
detailed object as a physics object it

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.529 
detailed object as a physics object it
would<00:04:56.800> get<00:04:57.039> really<00:04:57.069> laggy<00:04:57.610> we<00:04:58.060> had<00:04:58.210> a<00:04:58.240> lot<00:04:58.330> of

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
would get really laggy we had a lot of

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.800 
would get really laggy we had a lot of
pieces<00:04:59.289> of<00:04:59.500> toast<00:04:59.819> if<00:05:00.819> we<00:05:01.000> had<00:05:01.120> a<00:05:01.150> whole<00:05:01.389> bread

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
pieces of toast if we had a whole bread

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.800 
pieces of toast if we had a whole bread
of<00:05:02.229> toast<00:05:02.880> would<00:05:03.880> get<00:05:04.180> really<00:05:04.449> laggy<00:05:05.159> so

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
of toast would get really laggy so

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.920 
of toast would get really laggy so
that's<00:05:07.810> why<00:05:07.990> we<00:05:08.020> have<00:05:08.319> the<00:05:08.470> physics<00:05:08.830> object

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
that's why we have the physics object

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.879 
that's why we have the physics object
yeah<00:05:11.580> so<00:05:12.580> now<00:05:13.150> we<00:05:13.210> can<00:05:13.419> export<00:05:13.810> it<00:05:13.930> so<00:05:14.440> just

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
yeah so now we can export it so just

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.290 
yeah so now we can export it so just
select<00:05:15.340> your<00:05:15.849> newly<00:05:16.270> created<00:05:16.319> object<00:05:17.319> file

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
select your newly created object file

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.999 
select your newly created object file
export<00:05:19.300> top<00:05:19.659> left<00:05:19.870> us<00:05:20.139> md<00:05:20.500> and<00:05:20.710> yeah<00:05:20.949> you

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
export top left us md and yeah you

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.450 
export top left us md and yeah you
guessed<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:21.550> physics<00:05:22.479> mesh<00:05:22.659> so<00:05:23.259> just<00:05:23.979> put<00:05:24.220> this

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
guessed it physics mesh so just put this

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.339 
guessed it physics mesh so just put this
in<00:05:24.729> your<00:05:25.440> folder<00:05:26.440> where<00:05:26.770> you<00:05:26.889> have<00:05:27.130> your<00:05:27.159> to

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
in your folder where you have your to

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:33.420 
in your folder where you have your to
SMD<00:05:29.349> files<00:05:31.080> blender<00:05:32.080> automatically<00:05:32.919> or<00:05:33.159> the

SMD files blender automatically or the
script<00:05:33.699> automatically<00:05:34.300> calls<00:05:34.960> it<00:05:35.639> if<00:05:36.639> you

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
script automatically calls it if you

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.240 
script automatically calls it if you
called<00:05:37.389> the<00:05:37.509> other<00:05:37.570> one<00:05:37.870> toast<00:05:38.259> it<00:05:38.590> calls<00:05:38.949> the

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
called the other one toast it calls the

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.649 
called the other one toast it calls the
other<00:05:39.430> one<00:05:39.699> toast<00:05:40.000> lying<00:05:40.990> oil<00:05:41.409> screw<00:05:42.340> it<00:05:42.940> calls

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:43.659 
other one toast lying oil screw it calls

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:48.029 
other one toast lying oil screw it calls
the<00:05:43.750> other<00:05:43.840> one<00:05:44.080> toast<00:05:44.349> the<00:05:45.120> phy<00:05:46.860> which<00:05:47.860> is<00:05:48.009> a

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
the other one toast the phy which is a

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:53.100 
the other one toast the phy which is a
good<00:05:48.430> name<00:05:48.639> so<00:05:49.060> just<00:05:49.479> keep<00:05:49.630> that<00:05:49.710> so<00:05:51.120> well<00:05:52.120> it's

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
good name so just keep that so well it's

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.899 
good name so just keep that so well it's
been<00:05:53.289> a<00:05:53.320> long<00:05:53.409> journey<00:05:53.620> and<00:05:55.289> now<00:05:56.639> this<00:05:57.639> was

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:57.909 
been a long journey and now this was

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:02.909 
been a long journey and now this was
only<00:05:58.569> the<00:05:58.900> beginning<00:05:59.110> part<00:05:59.620> of<00:06:00.340> it<00:06:00.460> but<00:06:01.919> we're

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
only the beginning part of it but we're

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:06.180 
only the beginning part of it but we're
done<00:06:03.099> with<00:06:03.310> blunder<00:06:03.610> enough<00:06:03.819> for<00:06:03.969> now<00:06:05.190> we'll

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
done with blunder enough for now we'll

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.270 
done with blunder enough for now we'll
get<00:06:06.430> back<00:06:06.639> to<00:06:06.849> blender<00:06:07.180> when<00:06:07.800> when<00:06:08.800> we<00:06:08.979> want<00:06:09.190> to

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
get back to blender when when we want to

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.339 
get back to blender when when we want to
make<00:06:09.430> this<00:06:09.580> object<00:06:10.000> destructible<00:06:10.569> I'm<00:06:11.110> going

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 
make this object destructible I'm going

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:14.270 
make this object destructible I'm going
to<00:06:11.409> make<00:06:11.530> the<00:06:12.310> whole<00:06:12.490> destructible<00:06:13.180> deal<00:06:13.449> with

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
to make the whole destructible deal with

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.870 
to make the whole destructible deal with
the<00:06:15.280> destructible<00:06:15.759> part<00:06:16.090> of<00:06:16.210> it<00:06:16.330> is<00:06:16.509> of<00:06:16.930> course

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
the destructible part of it is of course

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.219 
the destructible part of it is of course
the<00:06:18.880> thing<00:06:19.120> that<00:06:19.270> sounds<00:06:19.419> most<00:06:19.780> appealing

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229 
the thing that sounds most appealing

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.200 
the thing that sounds most appealing
sounds<00:06:20.979> really<00:06:21.190> cool<00:06:21.370> that<00:06:21.520> you<00:06:21.669> can<00:06:21.819> destroy

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
sounds really cool that you can destroy

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.890 
sounds really cool that you can destroy
this<00:06:22.530> if<00:06:23.530> you<00:06:23.710> shoot<00:06:23.889> it<00:06:24.360> but<00:06:25.360> I'm<00:06:25.599> going<00:06:25.840> to

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
this if you shoot it but I'm going to

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.709 
this if you shoot it but I'm going to
make<00:06:26.110> that<00:06:26.380> part<00:06:26.710> optional<00:06:27.310> so<00:06:28.180> first<00:06:28.509> we're

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 
make that part optional so first we're

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:31.170 
make that part optional so first we're
going<00:06:28.840> to<00:06:28.930> have<00:06:29.080> this<00:06:29.469> toast<00:06:29.830> and<00:06:30.099> make<00:06:30.849> it<00:06:31.000> in

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
going to have this toast and make it in

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.430 
going to have this toast and make it in
game<00:06:31.419> and<00:06:32.880> if<00:06:33.880> you<00:06:34.120> want<00:06:34.330> to<00:06:34.479> you<00:06:35.080> can<00:06:35.229> follow

game and if you want to you can follow

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.500 
game and if you want to you can follow
along<00:06:36.750> another<00:06:37.750> tutorial<00:06:38.310> which<00:06:39.310> is<00:06:39.610> going<00:06:40.389> to

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
along another tutorial which is going to

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.999 
along another tutorial which is going to
show<00:06:41.080> you<00:06:41.139> how<00:06:41.260> to<00:06:41.440> make<00:06:41.680> it<00:06:41.830> to

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:42.009 
show you how to make it to

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:45.749 
show you how to make it to
tractable<00:06:42.719> so<00:06:44.219> so<00:06:45.219> you<00:06:45.279> have<00:06:45.550> these

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 
tractable so so you have these

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:49.079 
tractable so so you have these
short-term<00:06:46.659> goals<00:06:47.289> I<00:06:47.819> really<00:06:48.819> should<00:06:48.999> have

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:49.089 
short-term goals I really should have

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:50.850 
short-term goals I really should have
told<00:06:49.389> you<00:06:49.599> all<00:06:49.629> this<00:06:49.930> in<00:06:50.199> the<00:06:50.289> start<00:06:50.589> but<00:06:50.830> I

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
told you all this in the start but I

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:56.519 
told you all this in the start but I
think<00:06:51.339> I'm<00:06:51.490> improvising<00:06:51.879> this<00:06:52.419> now<00:06:54.809> yep<00:06:55.809> so

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:56.529 
think I'm improvising this now yep so

00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:00.299 
think I'm improvising this now yep so
I'll<00:06:57.339> get<00:06:58.059> back<00:06:58.270> to<00:06:58.330> you<00:06:58.599> in<00:06:58.839> the<00:06:59.589> next

00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:00.309 
I'll get back to you in the next

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:02.399
