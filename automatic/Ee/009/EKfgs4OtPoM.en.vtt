we<00:03:55.590> also<00:03:55.739> work<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.220> upper<00:03:56.340> portion<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.180> lower

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
we also work the upper portion the lower

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.539 
we also work the upper portion the lower
portion<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.350> answering<00:03:58.799> muscles<00:03:59.160> of<00:03:59.370> the

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.660 
external obliques simultaneous
so<00:04:02.450> it<00:04:02.569> allows<00:04:02.810> us<00:04:03.110> to<00:04:03.290> work<00:04:03.440> for<00:04:03.739> major<00:04:04.129> muscle

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
so it allows us to work for major muscle

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.550 
so it allows us to work for major muscle
