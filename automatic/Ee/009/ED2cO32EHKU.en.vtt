WrestleMania before they're actually in
thats<00:00:19.619> that's<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.189> point<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.789> these

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
thats that's the point of these

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.109 
thats that's the point of these
predictions<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.800> know<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.039> first<00:00:23.369> video<00:00:23.699> was

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
predictions you know the first video was

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.200

Cody<00:00:24.390> Rhodes<00:00:24.539> vs<00:00:24.960> Goldis<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.590> match<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.210> thought

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
Cody Rhodes vs Goldis a match I thought

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.939 
Cody Rhodes vs Goldis a match I thought
was<00:00:27.359> gonna<00:00:27.480> happen<00:00:27.570> WrestleMania<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.560> still

was gonna happen WrestleMania is still

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.730 
was gonna happen WrestleMania is still
think<00:00:29.189> there's<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.400> slight<00:00:29.910> chance<00:00:30.470> we'll<00:00:31.470> see

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
think there's a slight chance we'll see

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.740 
think there's a slight chance we'll see
if<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.890> ends<00:00:32.070> up<00:00:32.160> happening<00:00:32.399> but<00:00:33.360> now<00:00:33.540> we're

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
place because that it's no longer a

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.279 
place because that it's no longer a
