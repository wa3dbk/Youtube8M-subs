00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.040
 The 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.520
 It does not come from the 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.780

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.280
 400 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.250
 How much was 40 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.850

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:48.450
 Mine pressure all wr Blue Mica 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.810
 I put it in, but it is a little, but the color is different. 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.810
 so 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.630
 The second 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.180
 The color of the imp to rounding is good 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.790

 It's a place and what you're doing is an act 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:35.569
 Compared to the gold this time triggered 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:39.590
 But it's actually good because the people of Koch was Tei down 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:43.720

 Well, all the wr blues of the inpressor should be together 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:07.700

 I got a bit involved and had it remodeled 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.670
 Yes I have opened it a little more but let's call it 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:43.280
 It is remodeling Tomica 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.280

 It's like this, and let me make a box properly 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:58.289
 I do appreciate 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:05.729
 I have also specified all the colors 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:10.020
 I also have to replace the foil 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.330
 It had been written in the guy Do not Do What whether it was what 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.790
 The area is 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.020
 That export specification 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:21.289
 I 'm going to the tail 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.289
 After this I can not focus 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.150
 9 pieces 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:31.820
 Citi Eye logo 1 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.820
 I sent a plastic model decal and put it on 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.920
 Properly 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:43.269
 Tail pipe 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:47.480
 I have you paint 

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:50.830
 There is no mountain which was too high 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.420
 It's cool it's not ginger'm Day 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:59.090
 It is hard to sound wild 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:06:04.169
 Well, I was asked to use this sort of reminiscent imp for 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:07.499
 It means that you could not put it out if you were asked to use the rain 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:13.080
 Although we have introduced Yes Well two 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:18.229
 I think that it will not be in time if I do not go quickly because I have a toy fever 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.229
 It's the one day Ya'etto 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:28.710

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:32.900
 Well, I wonder if three will be gone by day 7 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:36.670
 After the box is damaged quite 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.860
 I had a hard time choosing pretty clean 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.040
 Hmm 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.380
