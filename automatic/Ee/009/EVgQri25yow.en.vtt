00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.700
 and although he is to everyone in 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.050
 all those exotic gp between 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.790
 today we meet again january 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.410
 excuse me small bugs from the beginning 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.850
 of the video but that's not where we are 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.730
 was returning for an excellent video a 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.320
 huge huge huge gameplay mime that 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.270
 you are done on call of duty mlaa 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.970
 by three so you quickly explains 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.830
 we are on the map gives in search 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.840
 and destruction first time I 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.830
 mounts r &amp; d on my channel and that's 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.059
 not for nothing since you will see 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.860
 that the final score is really 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.900
 breathtaking without disturbing her too much 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.489
 but the beating so julien so play with 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.200
 the holy silent mp as one can 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.839
 see for what it is and the estrie 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.920
 in support here I think that 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.150
 it's the best thing like that 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.640
 drones and their support and your 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.380
 beliefs all brothel and for what is 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.510
 of my trumps I play with them so many 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.760
 sleight of hand assassins and if the bone of mor 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.040
 lô really not really reflective and 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.960
 indivisible invisible to the eyes of the agly 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.030
 so you'll see that still this 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.950
 part we will win we will win the 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.990
 part that what you say it but I do not 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.190
 will not you be the final score you 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.290
 go see that I'm going into politics 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.360
 often the same technique of celoni rush 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.240
 du rhône there will be no gets 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.280
 less when you go to see and it's a 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.840
 very good tactics I take you 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.939
 go see your beaches to show you the 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.009
 website explain to you in e3 moore for the 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.899
 take in what consists is this 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.799
 technique so here I come I balance my 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.180
 centex there I play good if it makes 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.289
 kilts in sight then I go through there 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.350
 so there it is usually there are two 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.280
 three and a half jeans do you some 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.719
 see what we 're going to do I'm going back 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.399
 back right there it is listening to moscow 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.899
 front of the east here I covered I 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.250
 could this place there you can 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.229
 to see I had already unlocked world rhone 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.520
 I've already done two three that luca does 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.770
 know more but then I'll go 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.840
 by this wall and all friends on gives 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.250
 when here because when we're in 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.509
 hands to let go since we are in language 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.210
 defend that's when we're in mode 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.340
 defenders of the goal the friends in 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.930
 face when in the big building in 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.010
 building I find myself there it counts everything 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.960
 this is so you can easily and 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.820
 find them here he bought almost a 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.370
 full steam I was I do not know 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.230
 how can he have a penny after the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.730
 rush is gorgeous that thil cam is not going 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.900
 not with this mp5 and that's good for 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.240
 start like this gameplay is pretty 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.110
 good for me and even that would be good to 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.210
 send it to multiple channels 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.210
 Community particular code cf 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.640
 the good plan of the dic is the plague dictate 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.780
 them and maybe other channels like 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.280
 someone I see him anyway their 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.260
 introduction that there will be at the beginning of the 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.120
 she wants to see video I use mecca 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.170
 strategic that during the round 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.330
 previous but this time I 'm going 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.550
 then less chance to see them because 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.510
 we get there I'll do I know 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.550
 not what will happen to me had to do the 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.290
 big shit I did not understand I 'm not going 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.260
 not arrive I did not succeed why I 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.700
 I would go get killed right there I 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.110
 am a spectator there I have done on purpose 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.980
 not to move forward because at the beginning I 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.120
 am saying like I'm going to speed up the 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.980
 sitting on nine spectators are not 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.420
 commented insolent it will last otherwise 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.950
 so much more because during this 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.030
 mode of his viewer mode this is I 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.220
 go to enjoy it for you 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.990
 talk about two three things of three 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.970
 pretty important things so everything 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.500
 first you will soon be able to see 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.959
 on my channel the famous steam match 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.080
 the live without phase iii with maxim the 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.150
 team alpha on xbox so I tour them 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.700
 I do not know how from here I soon 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.280
 turn it here it will be available it will be 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.320
 available from here go say maximum one 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.800
 week after the little of this video we 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.959
 search the horizons all this and a half 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.700
 you have me the maximum enemy so it will be in 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.410
 live there will not be any lack of 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.239
 maxim you will see which I 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.430
 will always speak again in front of the fact 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.350
 accomplished during the live and that's otherwise 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.580
 in terms of predicting I have a little 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.140
 increased the pace of my videos it's 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.670
 true that I have a boss hold my word 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.310
 on this theme the pace of cities where this 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.830
 that I use I told myself I'm going 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.330
 make a video a week and by cc 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.310
 figured that with me no time I 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.590
 had a hole in it in the schedule the 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.420
 Friday morning I do not have classes which 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.370
 gives me a lot of time to do some 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.690
 videos if I go on tour so so 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.790
 it's really a very good thing but 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.019
 good is that provisional it will last that 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.690
 to me but I will be able to enjoy it 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.919
 to do a lot of videos and settle 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.109
 montages after my story more than 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.760
 so the little business here is for the 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.140
 moment i'm updating a video the 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.310
 Wednesday afternoon and Saturday 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.780
 afternoon for now it's the 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.790
 rhythm a video the murder of a video 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.560
 the center for the moment within a month 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.390
 I'll let you know with a view 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.580
 one of the places with gargoyle belly 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.400
 I'll give you a little wink in 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.260
 one of my videos say here is the ring 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.390
 2002 will go back to a video a week 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.830
 and so you can see this little 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.320
 this little look that camps ex really 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.600
 not play it's really moron a 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.950
 deep moron that's why it's 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.960
 to the viewer lasted a very long time 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.000
 the mecque pose la vence the guy surrenders 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.390
 finally account 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.350
 I rushed so in terms of style 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.940
 I'm talking to you about something else 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.490
 when the mullahs videos apart three 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.930
 I will try to alternate offer you 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.120
 a month a video badly to do 3 another 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.920
 game and here I am realized 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.540
 of one thing it's not to be mean 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.360
 with everyone but I'm doing well 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.620
 account in any case for my channel that 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.860
 the other videos that worth to do 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.970
 three at least successful than call of 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.830
 duty world at war 3 it's not for 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.560
 address all subscribers frankly if 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.360
 you do not like if you like 3.7 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.700
 little reluctant to other games I 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.919
 quite understand I am a little bit 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.720
 towards other times I that I do not 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.340
 do not know but it's true that 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.480
 especially my videos on the Lord of the 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.919
 rings online shop 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.480
 good they are well there are laymen and 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.010
 all that makes me happy to do but 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.720
 good I see they have a lot less 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.130
 of importance that mollard videos 3 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.390
 is good it's not I will continue to in 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.310
 do what I know there is not bad 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.910
 of subscribers who spoke about rap and 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.560
 Lord of the Rings 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.900
 So, we must have enough for everything 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.380
 the world so on the viewer comes from 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.180
 end 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.740
 finally because the guy is really nil 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.480
 in front of raining that I pass coveted 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.580
 attack and I will go through the right 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.500
 this time to add the cantons and 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.640
 I'm going to do a massacre there I had 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.979
 already my name I have not yet 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.630
 improve do not have yet to improve 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.460
 the Jews echoed on the right 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.540
 and all the massacres one speak for 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.940
 making it the strategy that I have 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.710
 recently I had about a week 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.090
 a gameplay passed on god save which 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.550
 said the whole tactic by referring to the 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.570
 risk of his dome and I was surprised 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.220
 to see that the tactics they were saying 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.140
 it was exactly the same tactic that 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.419
 I had used earlier how I did it 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.190
 gameplay becomes a two three weeks 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:21.450
 I still had not seen the video since 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.590
 the video was not even released yet 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.000
 wounded among all this guy 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.200
 and here I realized that my 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.630
 tactical was really good because 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.100
 other people there that was not the 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.540
 advised that even in their video 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.340
 so there the sleeve just ended 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.910
 you can see it's not me who does 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.140
 the calm team 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.400
 I was very lucky I had 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.450
 a lot of luck we take over 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.340
 understand because the guy gets shot 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.419
 on it he also posted the dude has 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.440
 almost made a colleague but I had 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:42.900
 of luck I had to die 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.850
 do not remember that I'm dying now 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.780
 it would be a real shame 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.550
 because I am even more to convince 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.080
 people are fleeing the ag of their wrath 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.370
 improve it's really going to be here soon 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.410
 on how I was going you know everything 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.200
 on friends or lands I had a 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.550
 perfect indication of their position and 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.419
 as corrupts the pool run in 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.350
 let's stick to the month of attack I 'm going 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:00.240
 use the same strategy 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.470
 here I am going to get around them and make a 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.970
 true massacre 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.210
 Nami will buy to watch the Loire 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.770
 actually ten dead added that at the end 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.569
 a building bought and the last one 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.669
 who is hiding cache of the fact too and I 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:11.590
 finish it like a rat and we end up with a 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:12.669
 very good case it's the best 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.000
 strategy i can advise you on 

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:14.259
 dom 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.569
 frankly if you're in r and d 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:17.470
 try to prevent this strategy after 

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:19.060
 the guys were maybe not very 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.259
 strong but in front and that's it I hope 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.240
 that we ask to have gathered only well 

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:23.349
 but he wanted to see the final score he 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.800
 will soon appear 

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:29.020
 good there it really shows that we won 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.729
 4 1 and that's what he abhors a 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.900
 seysses ratio and my best part 

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:33.970
 I've never done, we're looking for the 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.050
 struction and so on this Thursday at 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.759
 the APs for a new video 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.690
 I hope it was able to touch 

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:39.690
 everyone barailla more
