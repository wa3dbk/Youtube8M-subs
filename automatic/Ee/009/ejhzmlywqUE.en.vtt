00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.659
 Y 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.340
 we will need three knives one strong 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.340
 and width for bark des and another short 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.000
 to separate the meat from the bones and the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.900
 long and flexible ham knife 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.110
 also a hammer sharpener and if it is 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.480
 possible a clamp 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.320
 the ham has four main parts 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.140
 the mace the most veined and juicy part 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.140
 babilla more cured the codillo more 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.110
 fibrous and with sweet nuances and tip 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.090
 of intense flavor we will begin to cut 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.250
 by the area of ​​the mace placing the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.380
 hoof up the first cut is 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.870
 fundamental we will do it to two fingers of 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.270
 this bone 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.610
 we will tilt the knife to take advantage 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.770
 all the meat 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.720
 next with the short knife 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.720
 we will join the two ends of the cut 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.100
 we make a wedge in the ham removing 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.100
 this area of fat and tendon 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.630
 It is convenient to clean both sides of the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.900
 ham as we cut it so that 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.730
 Do not overdry 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.830
 we will save some slices of bacon 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.220
 for the subsequent conservation of 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.170
 piece is important always cut in 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.290
 parallel to the central axis of the ham that goes 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.180
 from the hoof to the tip the 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.500
 correct cutting direction is toward 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.500
 we always carefully 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.470
 the first difficulty that we 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.300
 we will find it will be the hip bone 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.820
 with the short knife we ​​will separate the 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.740
 bone meat on both sides after 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.420
 when we cut our slices 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.070
 they will be detached without effort 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.500
 our cut will be completely 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.020
 straight and the typical boat will not appear 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.210
 a good slice should occupy all the 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.869
 width of the piece measure three or four 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.340
 centimeters wide and be very thin 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.009
 we will continue cutting until it appears 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.289
 another bone 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.239
 with the short knife we will mark it at 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.030
 just like we did before and we will continue 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.370
 cutting when bones prevent us 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.980
 extract more slices we will turn it around 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.870
 the ham now in the babilla we will continue 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.730
 keeping the parallel cut the same 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.290
 we made earlier about the club very 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.420
 soon we will see the bone of the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.829
 rump which we will mark with the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.549
 short knife to follow 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.549
 cutting straight 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.099
 later the bones will appear 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.830
 of the knuckle area that we will mark 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.050
 the time to take advantage of this area 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.240
 to finish turning the ham 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.600
 we will be able to extract very 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.790
 appetizing 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.950
 we can use the most glued parts 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.350
 to the femur and the tip of the ham for 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.330
 make taquitos or cook and bones 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:00.099
 to make some stews taste 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.099
 Enjoy your ham and good food
