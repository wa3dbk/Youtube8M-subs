00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
advanced players so I'll show you how to

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.329 
advanced players so I'll show you how to
move<00:01:03.019> it<00:01:03.140> around<00:01:03.230> but<00:01:03.500> first<00:01:03.769> I'll<00:01:03.890> cover<00:01:04.100> my

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
move it around but first I'll cover my

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.430 
move it around but first I'll cover my
three<00:01:05.180> open<00:01:05.510> patterns<00:01:05.930> in<00:01:06.380> this<00:01:06.740> pattern

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
three open patterns in this pattern

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.719 
three open patterns in this pattern
there's<00:01:09.440> quite<00:01:09.650> a<00:01:09.680> bit<00:01:09.860> of<00:01:09.950> theory<00:01:10.190> to<00:01:10.490> it<00:01:10.610> if

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
there's quite a bit of theory to it if

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.610 
there's quite a bit of theory to it if
you<00:01:10.820> really<00:01:10.970> want<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.270> understand<00:01:11.780> it<00:01:11.960> he's

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
you really want to understand it he's

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.030 
you really want to understand it he's
using<00:01:12.979> a<00:01:13.040> 1<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.580> a<00:01:14.090> 5<00:01:14.390> that's<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:15.380> perfect<00:01:15.740> fifth

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
using a 1 and a 5 that's a perfect fifth

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.880 
using a 1 and a 5 that's a perfect fifth
and<00:01:16.630> then<00:01:17.630> when<00:01:17.780> I<00:01:17.810> put<00:01:18.050> my<00:01:18.080> third<00:01:18.470> finger<00:01:18.860> down

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
and then when I put my third finger down

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.510 
and then when I put my third finger down
and<00:01:19.840> adds<00:01:20.840> but<00:01:21.140> instead<00:01:21.710> of<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.950> five<00:01:22.219> now

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
and adds but instead of the five now

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.850 
and adds but instead of the five now
changes<00:01:23.000> to<00:01:23.149> a<00:01:23.180> major<00:01:23.420> six<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.590> this<00:01:24.740> is

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
changes to a major six so this is

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.830 
changes to a major six so this is
basically<00:01:25.689> excuse<00:01:26.689> me<00:01:26.840> technically<00:01:27.469> it's<00:01:27.710> a

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
basically excuse me technically it's a

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.120 
basically excuse me technically it's a
perfect<00:01:29.840> fifth<00:01:30.049> and<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.439> major<00:01:30.649> and<00:01:30.950> then

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
perfect fifth and the major and then

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.370 
perfect fifth and the major and then
major<00:01:31.340> six<00:01:31.790> way<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:32.149> it's<00:01:32.479> like<00:01:32.630> back<00:01:33.170> and

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
major six way so it's like back and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.529 
major six way so it's like back and
forth<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:33.740> keep<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.070> fifth<00:01:34.310> down<00:01:34.549> you<00:01:35.420> know

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
forth you keep the fifth down you know

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.510 
forth you keep the fifth down you know
and<00:01:35.750> I'm<00:01:35.840> talking<00:01:36.079> about<00:01:36.110> this<00:01:36.590> first<00:01:37.159> finger

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
and I'm talking about this first finger

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.600 
and I'm talking about this first finger
is<00:01:37.700> holding<00:01:37.939> down<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.420> chin<00:01:39.009> the<00:01:40.009> fifth<00:01:40.250> army

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610

but<00:01:49.990> there's<00:01:50.990> your<00:01:51.200> major<00:01:51.409> six<00:01:51.890> it<00:01:52.040> goes<00:01:52.220> one

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
but there's your major six it goes one

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.600 
but there's your major six it goes one
and<00:01:52.759> two<00:01:53.330> and<00:01:53.720> you<00:01:54.290> know<00:01:54.409> it's<00:01:54.560> like<00:01:54.710> one<00:01:54.920> two

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
by the way that's one of my favorites

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:26.800 
by the way that's one of my favorites
there's<00:02:17.989> lots<00:02:18.170> of<00:02:18.319> variations<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:25.810> knows

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
there's lots of variations you knows

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.150 
there's lots of variations you knows
lots<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.500> variations<00:02:29.080> but<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.650> root

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
lots of variations but this is the root

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.320 
lots of variations but this is the root
of<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.430> this<00:02:31.910> is<00:02:31.970> where<00:02:32.239> it<00:02:32.330> starts<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:34.330> that's

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
of it this is where it starts so that's

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.449 
of it this is where it starts so that's
an<00:02:35.510> e<00:02:35.660> now<00:02:36.260> we<00:02:36.319> can<00:02:36.530> move<00:02:36.650> over<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.100> you<00:02:37.190> see<00:02:37.430> a

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
an e now we can move over and you see a

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.100 
an e now we can move over and you see a
string<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.030> fifth<00:02:38.209> string<00:02:38.510> is<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.840> open

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
string the fifth string is the open

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.460 
string the fifth string is the open
