00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:02.000
 for louis release of beethoven piece 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.550
 on the guitar can play shows 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.900
 now step by step in one 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:14.240
 So let's start with the recording 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:19.330
 Great september lets of the eduard and 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.330
 although here on the fourth bunch 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:31.259
 the throne of this is the great tina of the 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:39.420
 is the little one saying thieme 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:39.420
 that is has the great winless 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.000
 We always play in exchange for that 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:49.910
 open side 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.880
 So this one puts your finger here 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:56.850
 third or fourth you have to know how 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.810
 you do not feel comfortable 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:05.060
 play nothing but open side 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.060
 then this sound of 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.750
 So there are actually back 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:34.470
 ideas but now we'll stick with it 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:39.570
 this theme the third time you play 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.570
 instead of do it again 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:50.019
 so if you 've played the fa come 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:58.290
 you to de on the third and then to the c 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:58.290
 on the first bunch of the page and then to 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:14.590
 spit on debt very slowly because 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:17.500
 I've got my fingers around it now 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.530
 then easier to slide up once 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.239
 and then the index finger on Cyprus 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.620
 Now I'll do it again with the 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.620
 follow forefinger 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.450
 and then on the second reason the g 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:45.959
 string the ah ok the first time together 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:48.830
 you barely play a minor chord on that 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.830
 to the side 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.880
 and you play by me 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:04.200
 until then 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:10.140
 now comes this sound and this sound in the 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:14.690
 connection and now before the hair on 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.690
 Are you going to hit the e major chord 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.180
 Now you are that toni again 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.560
 to have 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.560
 on a hair side you are here 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:39.470
 and right back in the arms and 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.470
 again only to the side so until the 10th 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.289
 and then again could theme 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.040
 so widely understood I repeat 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.040
 once again 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:28.969
 the 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:53.840
 so now comes the next batch and 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:06:04.090
 when you play the c major chord and 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:04.090
 but spit these two sides and the c 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.710
 Yes 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.470
 but once 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.100
 Slowly, yes, now I am 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:45.410
 itself out yes it is not so good anymore 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:50.150
 you sit on the terrace and at the ge 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:53.720
 when you play for changed here at 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:56.750
 the third volume of the hna page is the idea and 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.130
 the g string and the bass side that is 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.200
 Here custom says that the kidnappers 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.920
 your victim's flat has enough if you 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.920
 play him like this 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:11.919
 then you play openly open side 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.100
 and now it's time for a minor sap 

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:14.100
 team 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:29.360
 and then e7 but only until again until the 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.360
 side then 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:55.530
 and the conclusion and a classic 

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:58.200
 piece can be very relaxing 

00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:01.900
 I hope I could help her further 

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:06.330
 and I'm glad if you are one of my 

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.330
 other videos that look
