containers good for small landscape

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.889 
containers good for small landscape
plantings<00:01:22.060> but<00:01:22.270> if<00:01:22.360> you're<00:01:22.509> going<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.750> a

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
plantings but if you're going to a

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.630 
plantings but if you're going to a
larger<00:01:23.380> bed<00:01:23.920> that<00:01:24.100> you're<00:01:24.189> trying<00:01:24.429> to<00:01:24.490> fill

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
larger bed that you're trying to fill

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.069 
larger bed that you're trying to fill
with<00:01:24.729> color<00:01:24.789> I<00:01:25.060> would<00:01:25.240> recommend<00:01:25.600> our<00:01:25.659> larger

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
with color I would recommend our larger

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.559 
with color I would recommend our larger
six<00:01:26.319> inch<00:01:26.470> pot<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:27.579> will<00:01:27.700> also<00:01:28.030> carry<00:01:28.240> them<00:01:28.479> in

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
six inch pot and will also carry them in

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:30.990 
six inch pot and will also carry them in
flats<00:01:28.869> that<00:01:29.340> would<00:01:30.340> be<00:01:30.429> the<00:01:30.549> most<00:01:30.819> economical

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
flats that would be the most economical

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.819 
flats that would be the most economical
choice<00:01:31.509> but<00:01:31.990> certainly<00:01:32.229> a<00:01:32.319> little<00:01:32.380> more<00:01:32.590> work

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
choice but certainly a little more work

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:34.350 
choice but certainly a little more work
because<00:01:33.039> they're<00:01:33.189> smaller<00:01:33.429> plugs<00:01:33.819> to<00:01:34.090> plant

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
because they're smaller plugs to plant

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.539 
because they're smaller plugs to plant
so<00:01:34.990> three<00:01:35.380> different<00:01:35.470> sizes<00:01:35.829> available<00:01:36.100> at

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
so three different sizes available at

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.389 
so three different sizes available at
many<00:01:36.640> farms<00:01:37.530> there's<00:01:38.530> one<00:01:38.770> drawback<00:01:38.979> to

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
many farms there's one drawback to

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.980 
many farms there's one drawback to
pansies<00:01:39.819> and<00:01:40.030> some<00:01:40.330> of<00:01:40.420> us<00:01:40.539> live<00:01:40.720> in<00:01:40.840> areas

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
pansies and some of us live in areas

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.660 
pansies and some of us live in areas
that<00:01:41.140> have<00:01:41.349> quite<00:01:41.679> a<00:01:41.709> quite<00:01:42.130> a<00:01:42.159> few<00:01:42.399> deer

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
that have quite a quite a few deer

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.749 
that have quite a quite a few deer
around<00:01:43.270> and<00:01:43.780> deer<00:01:44.110> look<00:01:44.679> at<00:01:44.799> pansies<00:01:45.130> as<00:01:45.280> as<00:01:45.700> a

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
around and deer look at pansies as as a

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.330 
around and deer look at pansies as as a
salad<00:01:46.119> to<00:01:46.360> it<00:01:46.420> they<00:01:47.200> will<00:01:47.319> eat<00:01:47.500> them<00:01:47.649> up<00:01:47.770> as

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
salad to it they will eat them up as

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.859 
salad to it they will eat them up as
soon<00:01:48.429> as<00:01:48.700> you<00:01:48.789> turn<00:01:48.909> your<00:01:48.970> back<00:01:49.179> on<00:01:49.360> so<00:01:49.689> I<00:01:49.720> do

soon as you turn your back on so I do

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.469 
soon as you turn your back on so I do
