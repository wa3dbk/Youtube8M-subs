important to have a good canter before
you<00:00:44.339> even<00:00:44.489> start<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> changes<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.500> horses

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
you even start the changes so the horses

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.049 
you even start the changes so the horses
in<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.150> frame<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.449> he<00:00:49.080> can<00:00:49.290> really<00:00:50.059> begin

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
in a in a frame that he can really begin

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.649 
in a in a frame that he can really begin
to<00:00:51.570> balance<00:00:52.199> himself<00:00:52.620> over<00:00:53.309> his<00:00:53.430> feet<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.000> be

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
to balance himself over his feet and be

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.560 
to balance himself over his feet and be
supple<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.350> forward<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.610> very<00:00:57.000> important

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
supple and forward it's very important

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.500 
supple and forward it's very important
when<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.780> do<00:00:57.930> your<00:00:58.110> changes<00:00:58.910> so<00:00:59.910> Robin<00:01:00.270> how's

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
when you do your changes so Robin how's

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.389 
when you do your changes so Robin how's
he<00:01:00.690> been<00:01:00.840> going<00:01:01.050> has<00:01:01.410> he<00:01:01.530> been<00:01:01.649> been<00:01:02.070> good<00:01:02.280> in

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
he been going has he been been good in

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.219 
he been going has he been been good in
this<00:01:02.489> Kendra<00:01:02.940> now<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.629> changes<00:01:04.080> are

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
this Kendra now and the changes are

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.790 
this Kendra now and the changes are
coming<00:01:04.320> better<00:01:04.649> I<00:01:05.990> think<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.500> get<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
coming better I think if you get the

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.499 
coming better I think if you get the
check<00:01:08.009> the<00:01:08.190> canter<00:01:08.729> really<00:01:09.030> good<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
check the canter really good then the

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.600 
check the canter really good then the
changes<00:01:09.930> are<00:01:10.110> there<00:01:10.259> right<00:01:10.649> that's<00:01:11.190> how<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.490> is

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
changes are there right that's how it is

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.020 
changes are there right that's how it is
with<00:01:11.789> him<00:01:12.200> this<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.350> an<00:01:13.500> older<00:01:13.830> horse<00:01:14.009> and<00:01:14.430> he

we did with him what we've been working

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.440 
we did with him what we've been working
on<00:01:23.039> very<00:01:23.070> hard<00:01:23.429> Robin's<00:01:23.850> been<00:01:24.030> working<00:01:24.330> on

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
on very hard Robin's been working on

he doesn't take it in his own mind to do
the<00:01:30.090> changes<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.569> what<00:01:30.660> have<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:32.580> of

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
the changes and what have you so one of

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.960 
the changes and what have you so one of
the<00:01:32.759> first<00:01:32.970> exercises<00:01:33.149> we<00:01:33.959> do<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:34.349> that<00:01:34.729> is<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
the first exercises we do for that is to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.979 
the first exercises we do for that is to
do<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> very<00:01:36.360> tight<00:01:36.780> serpentine<00:01:38.390> all<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:39.989 
do a very tight serpentine all on the

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:42.139 
do a very tight serpentine all on the
same<00:01:40.200> lead<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.830> he<00:01:40.890> does<00:01:41.039> one<00:01:41.220> loop<00:01:41.429> in<00:01:41.610> regular

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
same lead so he does one loop in regular

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:43.910 
same lead so he does one loop in regular
counter<00:01:42.509> one<00:01:42.660> loop<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.020> counter<00:01:43.380> counter<00:01:43.739> all

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
counter one loop and counter counter all

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.130 
counter one loop and counter counter all
the<00:01:44.099> way<00:01:44.220> down<00:01:44.489> from<00:01:45.179> the<00:01:45.390> side<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.929> center

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the way down from the side to the center

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.020 
the way down from the side to the center
line<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.890> perhaps<00:01:47.039> if<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.459> like<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.789> go<00:01:47.910> out

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
line so perhaps if you like to go out

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.600 
line so perhaps if you like to go out
and<00:01:48.330> try<00:01:48.810> doing<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.289> I'll<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.099> myself<00:01:50.280> out

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
and try doing that I'll get myself out

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.070 
and try doing that I'll get myself out
of<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.789> way<00:01:50.910> and<00:01:51.149> see<00:01:51.509> what<00:01:51.630> happens

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
of the way and see what happens

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.770 
of the way and see what happens
okay<00:01:52.709> and<00:01:53.099> if<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.729> think<00:01:53.910> he's<00:01:54.030> wound<00:01:54.239> up<00:01:54.420> I

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
okay and if you think he's wound up I

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.359 
okay and if you think he's wound up I
mean<00:01:54.989> II<00:01:55.429> see<00:01:56.429> if<00:01:56.520> he<00:01:56.610> can<00:01:56.759> do<00:01:56.910> that<00:01:58.160> and<00:01:59.160> I'll

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
mean II see if he can do that and I'll

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.859 
mean II see if he can do that and I'll
stand<00:01:59.640> over<00:01:59.970> here<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.390> centerline<00:02:00.720> I

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
stand over here on the centerline I

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.520 
stand over here on the centerline I
don't<00:02:01.170> want<00:02:01.319> you<00:02:01.410> going<00:02:01.619> beyond<00:02:02.099> me<00:02:02.310> okay

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
we're going on that side

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:14.280 
we're going on that side
so<00:02:07.770> come<00:02:07.979> on<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.280> left<00:02:08.520> leaning<00:02:08.819> first

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.890 

and<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.189> important<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:16.330> make<00:02:16.510> sure<00:02:16.750> that

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900

he stays obedient he doesn't think about

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.490 
he stays obedient he doesn't think about
changing<00:02:19.720> when<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:19.959> go<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.349> counter

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
changing when you go to the counter

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.580 
changing when you go to the counter
counter<00:02:21.069> loop<00:02:21.250> it's<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.329> very<00:02:22.689> very<00:02:23.200> good

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
counter loop it's a very very good

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.509 
counter loop it's a very very good
suppling<00:02:24.250> exercise<00:02:26.129> and<00:02:27.129> he's<00:02:27.220> coming

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
suppling exercise and he's coming

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.830 
suppling exercise and he's coming
forward<00:02:27.790> nicely<00:02:28.269> into<00:02:28.599> your<00:02:28.659> bridle<00:02:29.200> and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
forward nicely into your bridle and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
forward nicely into your bridle and
she's<00:02:31.840> making<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.260> loop<00:02:32.409> and<00:02:32.769> there

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
she's making the loop and there

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.710 
she's making the loop and there
shouldn't<00:02:33.099> be<00:02:33.159> no<00:02:33.250> change<00:02:33.879> in<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.239> canter

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
shouldn't be no change in the canter

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.509 
shouldn't be no change in the canter
he's<00:02:34.959> got<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.230> be<00:02:35.319> supple<00:02:35.739> as<00:02:35.890> he<00:02:36.010> makes<00:02:36.190> and

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
he's got to be supple as he makes and

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.259 
he's got to be supple as he makes and
you<00:02:36.610> just<00:02:36.790> make<00:02:37.000> as<00:02:37.150> many<00:02:37.299> loops<00:02:37.720> as<00:02:38.049> you<00:02:38.200> can

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
you just make as many loops as you can

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.580 
you just make as many loops as you can
ride<00:02:40.269> him<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.480> little<00:02:40.780> forward<00:02:41.200> when<00:02:41.349> you<00:02:41.440> get

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
ride him a little forward when you get

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.119 
ride him a little forward when you get
to<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.799> counter<00:02:42.159> canter<00:02:43.409> so<00:02:44.409> he<00:02:44.530> doesn't<00:02:44.890> suck

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
to the counter canter so he doesn't suck

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.500 
to the counter canter so he doesn't suck
back<00:02:47.129> and<00:02:48.129> he's<00:02:48.280> actually<00:02:48.519> doing<00:02:48.909> this<00:02:49.180> very

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
back and he's actually doing this very

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.979 
back and he's actually doing this very
nicely<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:52.030> could<00:02:52.209> come<00:02:52.389> back<00:02:52.599> again<00:02:52.930> you

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
nicely and you could come back again you

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.289 
nicely and you could come back again you
bit<00:02:53.739> squashed<00:02:54.129> him<00:02:54.340> on<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.549> last<00:02:54.760> turn<00:02:55.060> but

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
bit squashed him on the last turn but

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.460 
bit squashed him on the last turn but
that's<00:02:55.480> okay<00:02:57.780> but<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.900> can<00:02:59.049> see<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.319> horse

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
that's okay but you can see the horse

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.089 
that's okay but you can see the horse
really<00:02:59.859> being<00:03:00.250> obedient<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:01.829> coming<00:03:02.829> forward

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
really being obedient and coming forward

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.399 
really being obedient and coming forward
he<00:03:03.730> gets<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:04.030> little<00:03:04.299> bit<00:03:04.540> stiff<00:03:04.810> sometimes<00:03:05.019> in

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
he gets a little bit stiff sometimes in

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.800 
he gets a little bit stiff sometimes in
the<00:03:05.500> counter<00:03:05.829> counter<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.609> robbing<00:03:07.480> after

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
the counter counter and robbing after

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.379 
the counter counter and robbing after
this<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.200> would<00:03:08.530> go<00:03:08.709> into<00:03:08.889> an<00:03:09.159> extended<00:03:09.760> canter

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
this I would go into an extended canter

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.500 
this I would go into an extended canter
across<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.109> diagonal<00:03:11.879> so<00:03:12.879> now<00:03:13.060> you've<00:03:13.359> got

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
across the diagonal so now you've got

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.660 
across the diagonal so now you've got
him<00:03:13.629> nicely<00:03:13.870> balanced<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.859> come<00:03:15.040> around<00:03:15.190> come

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
him nicely balanced and come around come

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.890 
him nicely balanced and come around come
from<00:03:15.879> F<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:17.400> do<00:03:18.400> an<00:03:18.519> extended<00:03:18.970> cancer<00:03:19.599> across

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
from F and do an extended cancer across

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.220 
from F and do an extended cancer across
and<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:21.129> might<00:03:21.340> want<00:03:21.639> to<00:03:21.699> try<00:03:22.329> change<00:03:22.780> at<00:03:23.109> the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
and you might want to try change at the

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.970 
and you might want to try change at the
end<00:03:24.269> now<00:03:25.269> bring<00:03:25.480> him<00:03:25.599> back<00:03:25.840> collect<00:03:26.349> him<00:03:26.560> first

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
end now bring him back collect him first

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.300 
end now bring him back collect him first
and<00:03:27.310> then<00:03:27.370> try<00:03:28.359> your<00:03:28.569> change<00:03:31.169> well<00:03:32.169> done<00:03:32.410> well

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
and then try your change well done well

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.530 
and then try your change well done well
done<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:34.180> let<00:03:34.959> him<00:03:35.109> walk

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.750 

give<00:03:39.140> it<00:03:39.260> time<00:03:39.799> that<00:03:39.890> was<00:03:39.980> good<00:03:40.189> it<00:03:40.340> was<00:03:40.459> clean

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
give it time that was good it was clean

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:48.460 
give it time that was good it was clean
and<00:03:42.640> that's<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:43.819> difficult<00:03:44.269> one<00:03:44.390> no<00:03:44.629> I<00:03:47.470> was

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
and that's the difficult one no I was

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.490 
and that's the difficult one no I was
really<00:03:48.739> good

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.620 

and<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.160> think<00:03:53.460> that<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:54.060> know<00:03:54.210> having<00:03:54.390> him

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
and I think that you know having him

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.570 
and I think that you know having him
supple<00:03:55.080> and<00:03:55.230> then<00:03:55.350> sending<00:03:55.920> him<00:03:56.070> forward<00:03:56.430> like

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
supple and then sending him forward like

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.000 
supple and then sending him forward like
that<00:03:56.610> then<00:03:57.300> he's<00:03:57.450> ready<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.840> any<00:03:58.140> is<00:03:58.470> balanced

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
that then he's ready to any is balanced

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.540 
that then he's ready to any is balanced
and<00:03:59.640> ready<00:03:59.730> enough<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.240> do<00:04:00.390> it<00:04:01.430> where'd<00:04:02.430> you

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
and ready enough to do it where'd you

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.120 
and ready enough to do it where'd you
two<00:04:02.640> come<00:04:02.790> on<00:04:02.820> the<00:04:03.000> big<00:04:03.180> circle<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:03.990> send<00:04:04.980> him

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
two come on the big circle and send him

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.770 
two come on the big circle and send him
out<00:04:05.250> in<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.760> canter<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:06.330> then<00:04:06.450> bring<00:04:06.660> him

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
out in the canter and then bring him

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.930 
out in the canter and then bring him
back<00:04:06.960> into<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.260> little<00:04:07.440> sink<00:04:07.740> do<00:04:08.190> three<00:04:08.520> small

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
back into a little sink do three small

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.390 
back into a little sink do three small
circles<00:04:08.970> within<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.080> circle<00:04:10.440> very<00:04:10.770> collected

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
circles within the circle very collected

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.090 
circles within the circle very collected
canter<00:04:11.640> but<00:04:12.000> very<00:04:12.270> jumping<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.710> want<00:04:14.040> to
