different problem which requires a
different<00:02:40.710> solution<00:02:41.209> Wow<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.690> best<00:02:42.900> thing

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110

i think it's the challenges that you get
constantly<00:02:49.170> every<00:02:49.650> single<00:02:50.100> day<00:02:50.280> best<00:02:50.970> thing
