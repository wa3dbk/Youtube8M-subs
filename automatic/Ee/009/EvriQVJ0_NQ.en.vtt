00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
because I always like lining my lips

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.690 
because I always like lining my lips
darker<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:32.119> preserve<00:01:32.539> my<00:01:33.170> natural<00:01:33.649> lip<00:01:33.830> shape

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
darker to preserve my natural lip shape

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.870 
darker to preserve my natural lip shape
cuz<00:01:35.060> my<00:01:35.810> name<00:01:35.990> is<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.200> darker<00:01:36.740> here<00:01:37.189> and<00:01:37.429> lighter

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
cuz my name is a darker here and lighter

00:01:37.880 --> 00:02:20.360 
cuz my name is a darker here and lighter
there<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:38.860> anyways<00:01:39.860> I<00:01:45.429> need<00:01:46.429> a<00:01:46.459> mirror

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.820

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
so that's what it looks like without any

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.890 
so that's what it looks like without any
lip<00:02:23.129> liner<00:02:23.370> or<00:02:23.580> anything<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.269> try<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.599> stay
