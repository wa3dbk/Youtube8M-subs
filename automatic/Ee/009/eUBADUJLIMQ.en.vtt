00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:19.840
 formed all the children 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.190
 what 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.510
 Hello 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.840
 after the attempt caray 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.840
 I go back to my channel 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.340
 or very good people we are a video 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.860
 more and I'm going to teach you to be 160 by 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.850
 site or what you call it basically 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.120
 sitting I can make a move 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.980
 quite similar to the normal 180's worth 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.840
 what happens we have to do a 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.430
 pull of poles or means that if 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.449
 we are used to pulling towards 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.160
 right or left 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.120
 we have to do it to the side 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.080
 opposite and that's going to make us throw 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.370
 as a force now we have to pull 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.550
 as a force because it takes ethically 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.320
 to have very loose let's be like 70 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.140
 degrees is worth something like that what we will do 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.240
 to 90 degrees okay then we have to 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.710
 throw strong and strong as strong 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.229
 that we can use to turn is between 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.360
 sitting down we have to pull a lot of 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.860
 Neck is worth neck and waist and then 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.869
 with the vice is that the vice we raise 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.490
 a little bit up front and we hit the 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.369
 pull and then we lift the wheel back 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.800
 worth this is going to be that the movement is 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.920
 easier to do we will have to do it 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.509
 with desire and with force is worth because we 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.190
 it's going to cost quite a bit, it costs 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.600
 that we are used to the side 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.830
 contrary to what we are going to learn to 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.970
 do now good I'm going to leave several 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.560
 clips of like support by my side 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.560
 normal and then for the cup side 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.140
 do not 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.769
 and 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.769
 ah 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.400
 ah 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.260
 i 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.380
 ah 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.650
 and 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.960
 ah 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.640
 good as you have seen the pen you have 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.040
 what to do what is basically high is worth 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.920
 that you can turn the vice well and nothing 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.930
 problems al alca el cx and when we are 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.610
 from fake it will try to keep a little 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.780
 until you can shoot if you can do 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.570
 a point like this 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.000
 you can notice that it has to go to gale 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.150
 group but if your embassy will help you 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.340
 quite especially when there are 180 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.560
 embassies so that this momentum and do 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.990
 the first and worth that is one thing that is 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.310
 a tic that would help you a lot and good 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.900
 when you have the fake and the roll back 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.700
 turning for the side that suits you best 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.740
 which is not a site one side 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.209
 specific but a little bit better 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.190
 for the side of opodo also the roll 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.410
 back, but that's basically it 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.060
 matter of and throwing it if you want 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.100
 do it later when you are and 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.330
 automatically the body will go 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.150
 so you do not have to turn butterfly where 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.890
 have to turn then for that side the 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.690
 hirai be the current ones and good has been 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.720
 I hope you liked it 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.430
 It says to like you comment if not if you have 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.090
 Any doubt whatever it is , leave it to me 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.489
 the comments 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.489
 ok and nothing we see the next goodbye
