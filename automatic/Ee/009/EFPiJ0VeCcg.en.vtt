00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
this the gizmos in the back here you can

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.449 
this the gizmos in the back here you can
see<00:02:37.970> two<00:02:38.600> analog<00:02:39.080> sensors<00:02:39.650> which<00:02:39.950> we<00:02:40.100> can<00:02:40.280> hook

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
see two analog sensors which we can hook

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.199 
see two analog sensors which we can hook
up<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.670> areas<00:02:41.569> around<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:42.050> suit<00:02:42.290> a

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
up to areas around the suit a

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.100 
up to areas around the suit a
microprocessor<00:02:44.209> in<00:02:44.330> here<00:02:44.510> which<00:02:44.660> needs<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.020> be

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
microprocessor in here which needs to be

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.780 
microprocessor in here which needs to be
powered<00:02:45.410> very<00:02:45.770> powerful<00:02:46.280> so<00:02:46.430> we<00:02:46.520> actually

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
powered very powerful so we actually

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.240 
powered very powerful so we actually
take<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.150> from<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.480> Formula<00:02:47.840> One<00:02:47.900> car<00:02:48.250> engine

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
take that from a Formula One car engine

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.500 
take that from a Formula One car engine
management<00:02:49.550> system<00:02:50.680> we<00:02:51.680> have<00:02:51.860> a<00:02:52.510> inertial

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
management system we have a inertial

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.260 
management system we have a inertial
motion<00:02:53.660> unit<00:02:54.140> here<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.560> an<00:02:55.459> also<00:02:55.760> GPS

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
motion unit here and an also GPS

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.880 
motion unit here and an also GPS
built-in<00:02:56.720> so<00:02:56.959> we<00:02:57.050> can<00:02:57.200> see<00:02:57.380> at<00:02:57.470> any<00:02:57.620> time

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
built-in so we can see at any time

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.460 
built-in so we can see at any time
what's<00:02:58.520> going<00:02:58.850> on<00:02:58.970> on<00:02:59.120> track<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.840> if<00:03:00.200> I<00:03:00.320> move

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
what's going on on track and if I move

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.320 
what's going on on track and if I move
it<00:03:00.620> around<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:01.070> can<00:03:01.250> actually<00:03:01.370> see<00:03:01.790> pitch

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
it around you can actually see pitch

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.350 
it around you can actually see pitch
your<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:02.930> role<00:03:03.110> working<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.910> going<00:03:05.209> from

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
your and role working and going from

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.840 
your and role working and going from
green<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.900> red<00:03:05.930> as<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.800> system<00:03:07.280> goes<00:03:07.459> into<00:03:07.489> an

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
green to red as the system goes into an

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.850 
green to red as the system goes into an
unnatural<00:03:08.390> position<00:03:08.420> so<00:03:09.320> we<00:03:09.470> get<00:03:09.620> an<00:03:09.709> awful

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
unnatural position so we get an awful

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.699 
unnatural position so we get an awful
lot<00:03:10.070> of<00:03:10.100> data<00:03:10.340> back<00:03:10.670> on<00:03:10.970> track<00:03:11.390> from<00:03:11.450> this<00:03:11.900> and

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
lot of data back on track from this and

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.710 
lot of data back on track from this and
all<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:12.980> this<00:03:13.130> unit<00:03:13.519> pretty<00:03:14.060> lightweight<00:03:14.330> and

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
all of this unit pretty lightweight and

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.449 
all of this unit pretty lightweight and
compact<00:03:14.900> fits<00:03:15.560> in<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.830> back<00:03:16.010> of<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.250> suit

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
compact fits in the back of the suit
