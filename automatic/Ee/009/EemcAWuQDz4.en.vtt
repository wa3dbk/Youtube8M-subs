00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
actually a cortex a9 processor but the

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.810 
actually a cortex a9 processor but the
thing<00:00:31.960> that's<00:00:32.110> interesting<00:00:32.349> here<00:00:33.040> is<00:00:33.190> this<00:00:33.760> is

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
thing that's interesting here is this is

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.970 
thing that's interesting here is this is
this<00:00:34.270> is<00:00:34.480> running<00:00:34.809> fruit<00:00:35.140> ninja<00:00:35.530> and<00:00:35.710> fruit

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
this is running fruit ninja and fruit

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.760 
this is running fruit ninja and fruit
ninja<00:00:36.220> is<00:00:36.370> a<00:00:36.400> game<00:00:36.670> that<00:00:37.110> was<00:00:38.110> originally<00:00:38.739> made

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
ninja is a game that was originally made

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.810 
ninja is a game that was originally made
for<00:00:38.980> a<00:00:39.840> Tegra<00:00:40.840> kind<00:00:41.500> of<00:00:41.680> right<00:00:42.070> so<00:00:42.280> is<00:00:42.610> the

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
for a Tegra kind of right so is the

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.460 
for a Tegra kind of right so is the
reason<00:00:43.330> why<00:00:43.479> this<00:00:43.540> game<00:00:43.870> is<00:00:44.050> pretty

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
reason why this game is pretty

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.610 
reason why this game is pretty
interesting<00:00:44.769> oops<00:00:45.760> is<00:00:46.080> because<00:00:47.080> you<00:00:47.470> can

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
interesting oops is because you can

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.320 
interesting oops is because you can
actually<00:00:47.800> see<00:00:48.010> like<00:00:48.729> the<00:00:48.879> inside<00:00:49.180> of<00:00:49.210> the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
actually see like the inside of the

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.049 
actually see like the inside of the
fruit<00:00:49.629> and<00:00:49.780> as<00:00:50.019> it<00:00:50.229> spins<00:00:50.379> in<00:00:50.559> real<00:00:50.680> time<00:00:51.059> so

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
fruit and as it spins in real time so

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:53.189 
fruit and as it spins in real time so
you<00:00:52.120> can<00:00:52.210> actually<00:00:52.300> see<00:00:52.479> the<00:00:52.690> pits<00:00:52.930> and<00:00:53.110> it

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
you can actually see the pits and it

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.259 
you can actually see the pits and it
this<00:00:53.920> does<00:00:54.190> this<00:00:54.460> game<00:00:54.790> really<00:00:55.030> actually

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
this does this game really actually

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:56.939 
this does this game really actually
shows<00:00:55.720> like<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.110> immense<00:00:56.500> graphic

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
shows like the immense graphic

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.869 
shows like the immense graphic
performance<00:00:57.460> but<00:00:57.659> is<00:00:58.659> able<00:00:58.870> to<00:00:59.110> you<00:00:59.620> know<00:00:59.879> be

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
performance but is able to you know be

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.070 
performance but is able to you know be
produced<00:01:01.629> by<00:01:01.750> this<00:01:01.930> tablet<00:01:02.379> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
produced by this tablet and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.000 
produced by this tablet and
traditionally<00:01:05.080> this<00:01:05.170> has<00:01:05.320> been<00:01:05.409> only<00:01:05.620> Tegra<00:01:05.979> 2

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
traditionally this has been only Tegra 2

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.500 
traditionally this has been only Tegra 2
that's<00:01:06.370> been<00:01:06.460> able<00:01:06.549> to<00:01:06.729> do<00:01:06.820> this<00:01:06.940> previously

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
that's been able to do this previously

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.560 
that's been able to do this previously
when<00:01:07.780> fruit<00:01:08.020> ninja<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:09.430> being<00:01:09.640> played<00:01:09.909> you

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
when fruit ninja was being played you

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.320 
when fruit ninja was being played you
could<00:01:11.350> only<00:01:11.530> see<00:01:11.860> like<00:01:12.340> solid<00:01:12.790> colors<00:01:13.119> in<00:01:13.240> the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
could only see like solid colors in the

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.120 
could only see like solid colors in the
center<00:01:13.600> you<00:01:13.630> couldn't<00:01:13.990> actually<00:01:14.080> see<00:01:14.290> seeds

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
center you couldn't actually see seeds

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.950 
center you couldn't actually see seeds
or<00:01:15.280> anything<00:01:15.610> let's<00:01:16.240> actually<00:01:16.420> get<00:01:16.690> out<00:01:16.840> of

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
or anything let's actually get out of

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:25.080 
or anything let's actually get out of
here<00:01:17.080> for<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.380> second<00:01:22.650> let's<00:01:23.650> see<00:01:23.890> back<00:01:24.760> back

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
here for a second let's see back back

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.540 
here for a second let's see back back
back<00:01:25.330> back<00:01:25.600> back<00:01:25.900> back<00:01:26.170> back<00:01:26.410> well<00:01:27.280> anyways

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
back back back back back well anyways

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.750 
back back back back back well anyways
this<00:01:27.670> doesn't<00:01:27.940> seem<00:01:28.060> to<00:01:28.150> be<00:01:28.210> working<00:01:28.270> hold<00:01:28.990> on

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
this doesn't seem to be working hold on

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.680 
this doesn't seem to be working hold on
if<00:01:30.760> you<00:01:30.910> notice<00:01:31.150> this<00:01:31.210> is<00:01:31.330> actually<00:01:31.660> a

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
if you notice this is actually a

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:41.600 
if you notice this is actually a
resistive<00:01:32.200> touchscreen<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.810> should<00:01:41.080> work

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
resistive touchscreen that should work

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:50.630 
resistive touchscreen that should work
well<00:01:42.610> then

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.310 

so<00:01:51.640> what<00:01:51.880> may<00:01:52.330> be<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.510> performance<00:01:53.020> is<00:01:53.140> as

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
so what may be the performance is as

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.380 
so what may be the performance is as
amazing<00:01:53.530> as<00:01:53.860> I<00:01:54.340> thought<00:01:54.580> it<00:01:54.760> should<00:01:54.940> be<00:01:55.090> but

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
amazing as I thought it should be but

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.840 
amazing as I thought it should be but
this<00:01:55.720> tablet<00:01:56.260> is<00:01:56.440> made<00:01:57.010> by<00:01:57.160> Ramos<00:01:57.580> and<00:01:57.610> if

done several reviews on them and if you
see<00:02:02.440> the<00:02:02.590> screen<00:02:02.920> see<00:02:03.280> that<00:02:03.430> flex<00:02:03.730> this<00:02:04.300> is<00:02:04.420> a

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
see the screen see that flex this is a
