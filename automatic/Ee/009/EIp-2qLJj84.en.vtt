adapts<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.869> front-facing<00:02:10.470> camera<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.220> the

rear-facing camera in every lighting

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.200 
rear-facing camera in every lighting
situation<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.010> have<00:02:14.099> amazing<00:02:14.400> low-light

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
situation so you have amazing low-light

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.320 
situation so you have amazing low-light
and<00:02:15.300> daytime<00:02:15.990> photos<00:02:16.910> now<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:17.940> thought<00:02:18.180> that

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
and daytime photos now I thought that

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.810 
and daytime photos now I thought that
the<00:02:18.450> Note<00:02:18.630> edge<00:02:18.840> was<00:02:19.200> bad<00:02:19.620> by<00:02:20.040> any<00:02:20.070> means<00:02:20.580> it

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
the Note edge was bad by any means it

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.640 
the Note edge was bad by any means it
was<00:02:20.910> actually<00:02:21.210> really<00:02:21.450> great<00:02:21.780> but<00:02:22.470> when

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
was actually really great but when

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.890 
was actually really great but when
comparing<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.250> s6<00:02:23.670> edge<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.150> just<00:02:24.210> didn't

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
comparing to the s6 edge it just didn't

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.730 
comparing to the s6 edge it just didn't
stand<00:02:25.170> out<00:02:25.290> in<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.620> same<00:02:25.800> way<00:02:26.900> overall<00:02:27.900> really

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
stand out in the same way overall really

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.820 
stand out in the same way overall really
two<00:02:29.010> good<00:02:29.220> cameras<00:02:29.760> but<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.240> s6<00:02:30.570> edge<00:02:30.750> will<00:02:31.680> be

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
two good cameras but the s6 edge will be

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.910 
two good cameras but the s6 edge will be
better<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:33.000> note<00:02:33.210> of<00:02:33.390> course<00:02:33.660> gives<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.380> high

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
better the note of course gives the high

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.300 
better the note of course gives the high
demand<00:02:35.460> of<00:02:35.760> well<00:02:36.630> simply<00:02:37.350> having<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:37.980> longer

battery<00:02:38.460> life<00:02:38.940> battery<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:40.080> really<00:02:40.500> important

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
battery life battery is really important

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.400 
battery life battery is really important
to<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.100> lot<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.370> people<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.870> Note<00:02:43.140> edge

to a lot of people and the Note edge

to a lot of people and the Note edge

proved time and time again that it had

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.450

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
comparing to the s6 edge not only that

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.340 
comparing to the s6 edge not only that
but<00:02:51.060> comparing<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.540> pretty<00:02:51.780> much<00:02:51.900> every<00:02:52.170> phone

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
but comparing to pretty much every phone

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.260 
but comparing to pretty much every phone
on<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.530> market<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:53.190> Note<00:02:53.340> edge<00:02:53.610> really<00:02:54.060> stood

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
on the market the Note edge really stood

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.330 
on the market the Note edge really stood
out<00:02:54.330> in<00:02:54.600> terms<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.900> battery<00:02:55.110> life<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.980> really

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
out in terms of battery life to really

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.370 
out in terms of battery life to really
last<00:02:56.730> one<00:02:57.240> of<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.450> longest<00:02:57.810> bear<00:02:57.990> lights<00:02:58.200> in

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
last one of the longest bear lights in

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.360 
last one of the longest bear lights in
the<00:02:58.470> entire<00:02:58.530> US<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.520> still<00:03:00.150> stands<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.600> stay

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.850 
the entire US and still stands to stay
now<00:03:02.370> what<00:03:02.880> about<00:03:03.060> sound<00:03:03.480> quality<00:03:03.660> well<00:03:04.440> when

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
now what about sound quality well when

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.790 
now what about sound quality well when
it<00:03:04.950> came<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.310> sound<00:03:05.640> quality<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.530> we<00:03:07.530> tried

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
it came to sound quality and we tried

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.430 
it came to sound quality and we tried
both<00:03:08.070> these<00:03:08.280> phones<00:03:08.520> out<00:03:08.910> we<00:03:09.840> could<00:03:09.990> see<00:03:10.200> a

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
both these phones out we could see a

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:30.410 
both these phones out we could see a
subtle<00:03:11.070> difference<00:03:27.080> so<00:03:28.080> we<00:03:28.200> found<00:03:28.560> was<00:03:28.890> s6<00:03:29.880> had

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
subtle difference so we found was s6 had

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.260 
subtle difference so we found was s6 had
just<00:03:31.020> not<00:03:31.350> only<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.680> louder<00:03:32.070> sound<00:03:32.280> really

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
just not only a louder sound really

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.790 
just not only a louder sound really
because<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.630> its<00:03:33.750> speaker<00:03:34.170> placement<00:03:34.410> coming

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
because of its speaker placement coming

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.680 
because of its speaker placement coming
from<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.100> bottom<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.670> phone<00:03:35.850> this<00:03:36.450> is<00:03:36.600> a

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
from the bottom of the phone this is a

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.170 
from the bottom of the phone this is a
Note<00:03:36.930> edge<00:03:37.110> having<00:03:37.500> not<00:03:37.620> on<00:03:37.770> the<00:03:37.890> rear<00:03:38.180> but

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
Note edge having not on the rear but

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.620 
Note edge having not on the rear but
also<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.960> s6<00:03:40.560> edge<00:03:40.710> did<00:03:41.490> sound<00:03:41.910> better<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.360> was

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
also the s6 edge did sound better it was

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.880 
also the s6 edge did sound better it was
louder<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.890> sound<00:03:44.130> sounded<00:03:44.520> fuller<00:03:45.890> now

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
louder and the sound sounded fuller now

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.440 
louder and the sound sounded fuller now

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
with 32 now of course on this phone I

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.030 
with 32 now of course on this phone I
had<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.940> add<00:04:12.090> memory<00:04:12.780> in<00:04:13.320> order<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.800> use<00:04:14.010> that

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
had to add memory in order to use that

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.450 
had to add memory in order to use that
but<00:04:14.640> I<00:04:14.850> do<00:04:15.000> find<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.630> overall<00:04:16.109> experience

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:16.460 
but I do find the overall experience

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.539 
but I do find the overall experience
really<00:04:17.460> if<00:04:17.670> you<00:04:17.880> have<00:04:18.090> a<00:04:18.120> 64<00:04:18.750> gig<00:04:19.109> I<00:04:19.680> don't<00:04:20.220> miss

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
really if you have a 64 gig I don't miss

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.720 
really if you have a 64 gig I don't miss
the<00:04:20.790> SD<00:04:21.150> card<00:04:21.450> however<00:04:22.350> if<00:04:22.680> you<00:04:22.890> mainly<00:04:23.520> had<00:04:23.700> a
