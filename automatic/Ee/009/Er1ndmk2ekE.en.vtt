00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.430
 There is very good youtube here why 

00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:07.250
 commenting today I bring you another review 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.740
 of a weapon model really very very 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.110
 interesting that surely many do not 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.169
 you will go through it so surely and 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.689
 good is the rx hold punch the model of 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.789
 professional statistics and comment 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.920
 because it seems so good to me and because it is 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.900
 above the other models of the rx 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.039
 and in many ways and above 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.839
 many models of other rifles 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.179
 I assault the truth will explain why 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.439
 then that from the bottom good 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.119
 looking for a middle domain game 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.040
 a game started and just when it was 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.750
 the second part catching sack 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.780
 helicopters had they drew the 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.520
 east tank of the detroit map I do not know 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.960
 not catching enough and then getting 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.910
 take a few flags get 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.770
 make a pretty good streak but 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.880
 really do not get the game because 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.620
 is talking impossible was not I 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.450
 I just have a starting game and 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.550
 Well, I have left what is the 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.900
 after they kill me here because this 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.160
 streak that is quite big not so 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.050
 I leave you in the background so you can see how 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.030
 goes this weapon and really this weapon 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.740
 neither is it the best weapon to 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.630
 this map because this map is one of the most 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.220
 small of the game but it also works 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.380
 pretty good anyway , I'm telling you 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.310
 that this weapon works much better in 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.590
 maps like this 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.000
 and maps as solar ie maps that 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.880
 they have more open sites less 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.799
 alleys and then especially when they are 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.770
 long long maps this weapon is the 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.390
 best burst gun of the game let's go 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.820
 there because it seems to me this we go in 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.649
 first place let's go with your statistics 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.360
 I would like to remember also is not whether the 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.060
 I will also put on the screen for 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.039
 buy a bit the rx steel bites record 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.710
 is that the x still by had 3 more damage 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.869
 lost 2 of accuracy and lost 1 of 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.189
 cadence this model of the patch like 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.110
 you are looking to the right as you won 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.259
 of the year loses one of precision and loses 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.179
 one of driving then this rifle is 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.280
 really very good because he wins two 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:48.380
 points of damage is comparable to what 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.569
 wins the steel by since I really believe 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.479
 that practically when the weapons win 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.640
 damage in terms of the models I mean 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.810
 with that win one or two I think that already 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.970
 is enough, that is, you do not have to 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.530
 win three for example the bp 11 goliat and 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.170
 I think it would win 1 or 2 damage 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.959
 it would be practically the same then the 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.030
 subject of damage is the rx hold pÃ¡nchez and the 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.910
 steel bait are practically the same with 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.160
 which would then come to the decision should 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.150
 Compare the accuracy and cadence the 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.439
 I handle as I say no 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.849
 it's practically nothing I think that 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.110
 no influence when targeting the 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.879
 time to change weapons do not make me 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.079
 a lot of the case but it 's a bullshit what 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.180
 it shows is very little and do not pay attention to it and 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.950
 I dont know 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.659
 you start to compare the precision 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.650
 precision that loses this rifle then 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.239
 you practically do not notice one of 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.099
 precision that possible accurate you do not notice 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.530
 the steel bites when you lose one of 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.269
 precision more by far and so it shows 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.829
 and then we have to also lose 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.390
 cadence this does not lose cadence with what 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:43.030
 which is why I think this is much better 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.920
 fossil jump that the hall punch air with 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.019
 the blow h sorry the steel bait 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.700
 because it does not lose rhythm and does not 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.889
 Loses precision and damage practically 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.170
 it's the same kills a blast up a lot 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:56.019
 that is, it is very far away 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.090
 I say very far away and when it is already 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.040
 relatively almost almost to the point 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.599
 of the map with which you give a burst and a 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.069
 little more than obvious tools 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.780
 to kill a burst you have to give the 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.220
 three bullets equal a burst of 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.139
 two bullets and the uncle does not die 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.799
 obviously this weapon has a lot 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.389
 hurt 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.189
 but of course you have to give it the blast 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:14.530
 whole so that it dies from a close 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.750
 goes really well has a very cadence 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.099
 good thing that the steel bait then 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.900
 it lacks not sometimes that it lacks a 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.430
 little bit not a plus of cadence that is what 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.599
 who loses and this rifle makes 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.159
 really be the best of the 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.859
 category really I mean I tell you that 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.840
 If I do not say a word , you'll see in the guide 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.970
 that I will make the comparison of possible and 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.720
 your furniture and all that this weapon 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.880
 perfectly 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.430
 is in the 25th assault rifle 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.200
 honestly I think it's the best weapon of 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.760
 bursts of the game reminds me a lot to 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.530
 the 1016 of coz 4 that are burned 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.120
 among the preferred ones and is that it kills 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.710
 very much they kill a lot really I 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.630
 they like guns a lot and this 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.400
 weapon I feel very comfortable taking it like this 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.190
 that this is about what I had to 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.230
 comment on the lx the panzer that 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.400
 personally taking the os models 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.800
 I say that this is better and that if 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.870
 you have the advantage that by very elite 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.400
 that is the other one is really better 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.840
 even cadet models that are 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.400
 better than other elite you already know 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.570
 so that's this series not of 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.920
 discover the best models and 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.080
 analyze them and tell you why they seem to me 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.310
 the best so you have if you click 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.780
 in the weapon you have the list of 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.220
 reproduction with all the models that 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.270
 me bringing to this series also what 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.100
 you have in the description for the track and 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.019
 from the mobile with the tablet or ipad what 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.720
 that what you have so today kids 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.450
