00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.070
 Hello everyone, Andrei 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.340
 This weekend I walked around the flea market 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.210
 the local did not buy for the cheap 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.250
 the video card is the same ford 650ti analog 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.080
 for byte 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.980
 I will not immediately show that 2 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.550
 the card behaves they connected to 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.550
 tv 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.100
 picture unfortunately not very cameras not 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.770
 wants to focus on my tv 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:48.280
 and there and seen the flashing cursor 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.290
 rebooted the hobbits many will say because 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.920
 there would be a picture of a video card course 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:58.780
 working there problems can we 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.620
 restart the computer and see just 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.250
 black screen and 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.680
 there are no mistakes and sold not 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.590
 boot windows 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.590
 nothing just a black screen 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.620
 turn on the computer 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.829
 back to the video card 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:37.980
 all the same problem but the problem is banal 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.980
 for video card 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:49.650
 I think you can see the missing capacitor 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:52.290
 express food machine even shot down from there 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.770
 along with pads judging by 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.950
 the solder trail someone tried to solder 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:03.350
 straight to the connector apparently she is not very 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.300
 fortunately for the first two pairs 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.369
 the capacitors remained intact 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:12.319
 that is, these video cards will work by 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.319
 tire Lesya Express x2 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:23.070
 here we insert it into the word c16 she 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.470
 us does not work in case x1 will be 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:30.450
 great work let's do this 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:34.170
 check and I here is an adapter hoteli 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.230
 on f-16 well, I hope with me x1 the rest 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.840
 contacts are simply not used 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:45.960
 although we connect all this to our computer 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:49.260
 video card and will check the fleet so 16 it 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:55.430
 can connect as x1 device ttx 8 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.430
 they will all work video cards 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.240
 power dock with dima 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.090
 power on 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.980
 look will work and 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.370
 here is the screensaver and this time the sentence 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.620
 load windows will not load yet 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.159
 Neither will the government video card 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.159
 earned 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:49.230
 7 fellow turn on our video card 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.920
 in a good way to take a thin soldering iron 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.920
 find somewhere a similar capacitor and 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:04:00.200
 gently solder it clear the contact 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:04.500
 him something sometime i know here 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.629
 but not everyone has a thin soldering iron 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:12.750
 and especially 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:15.079
 similar smd capacitors but this time 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.799
 the tire works like all express 2 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:20.449
 catch up contact just insulate and 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.770
 use only 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:33.479
 all that is whole and for that to us 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:36.150
 we need the usual scotch cut off another 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.690
 small strip and glue on unnecessary 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.690
 contact 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.690
 And so we glue the two sides a few 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.169
 they will become sealed mine they 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.490
 will not be used for verified as 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:59.210
 in appearance they will say that something is somewhere 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:02.840
 sealed that let's plug and 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.840
 check work 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.990
 than 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.130
 he saver motherboard again 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.910
 offer to load windows 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.910
 loaded 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.440
 That does not want the camera on a dark screen 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.920
 focus on think crane loading 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.910
 windows 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.910
 have seen everything 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:57.229
 os windows boot to start in paused 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.560
 and see how our video works 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:59.560
 card 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.550
 he is ready to run 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.570
 see consider 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:27.420
 all express 20 x 16 can work 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:33.350
 even the video card how it works given 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:33.350
 x2 1.1 moment can work on 2.0 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.430
 I have everything on this if this video is for you 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:44.990
 like it like subscribe 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.990
 on the channel all bye
