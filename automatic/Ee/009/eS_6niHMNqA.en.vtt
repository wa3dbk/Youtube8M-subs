00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello to everything so today I you 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.080
 make a video to show you the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.870
 difference between a real louis bag 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.170
 vuitton speedy 30 or any 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.500
 size by the way is a fake so I 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.109
 here the truth that is just left and the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.210
 wrong which just right so I have to 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.359
 got myself just to do 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.699
 this video which help you for a 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.789
 buying a bag because one is very 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.900
 many buy bags on ibeo on 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.790
 internet because they are cheaper 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.969
 still mine I bought it in 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.500
 beauty club being but it's true we 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.540
 can find several bags a lot 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.430
 cheaper on ebay so not to 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.620
 made you have you donate or 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.780
 just scam I'm doing 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.020
 this video so first when we 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.440
 looks both like that where it already has 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.870
 some differences then already the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.120
 first is at the level of the hip 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.809
 as you can see so more true 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.370
 he's a little so seven years old does not 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.640
 not to wear on the shoulder 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.890
 you can just bring by hand neither 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:14.220
 on the arm but a bag being in speedy 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.130
 have never worn shoulder while there 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.990
 we can see that it's a big one 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.650
 which allows to be worn paul so 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.439
 first sign that it's a fake 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.200
 then then that can be an aspect 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.659
 brilliant but it's good of him that there is 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.820
 we can see that there are also cash das 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.520
 publishing but this is absolutely not the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.930
 plastic boy 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:44.159
 then second difference 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:46.680
 the little rivet for closing when 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.500
 you look just below that makes 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.360
 like to explain a little 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.370
 sweet soft matter 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.670
 on this one we see very well that it is 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.260
 plastic on both sides this is in 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.300
 the bigger the hole is here 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.860
 it allows the padlock if you want 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.740
 completely close the bag so 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.300
 attached with the padlock here then there 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.140
 it's a very small hole besides this 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.730
 bag does not have a padlock 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.140
 while when you buy in 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.990
 therefore necessarily applies there is always 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:23.360
 the padlock with these two keys so lifted 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.640
 l on one side and the goal one part and 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.740
 the other side with these two keys and the 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.390
 keys that allow that allows everything to 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.220
 opening the sand then the canna 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:37.340
 earlier then we see here I do not know 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.760
 if you want to create shout so purpose we 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.380
 the also but it is not at all 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.730
 same quality besides aesthetically 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.400
 we see that it 's not the same thing 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:52.340
 there and basically there and there are not 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.110
 so compared to the canvas so for 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.450
 tell you I do not see so much 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.310
 different centers of canvas help apart 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.380
 that on the must she is a little bit 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.519
 lighter than on the real touch you 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.430
 I can not tell you that there is really 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.140
 difference either but there is a 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.680
 difference in the canvas on these 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.980
 two models 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.260
 it is that on the real the goal is 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.299
 speedy as they say to my web is 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.989
 still in the running there is no break 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:23.510
 throughout the length of the bag 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.549
 I do not know if you see so this is 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.590
 always playful just like on the model 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:31.310
 monogram you will see that there it is 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.049
 high dlv high and the canvas does like 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.320
 it's like that so it's normal that 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.690
 other 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:40.640
 cd side upside down so here see 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.260
 very well that there are the seams so 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.780
 it's several pieces of canvas that have 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.350
 been assembled 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.959
 it's a fake so we'll be interested in 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:56.830
 the inter also so I 'm going to open 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:58.030
 short, that's it for the real thing so I 'm sorry 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.610
 and glitter in that I had a 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.440
 hot coast and a little girl and 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.650
 besides you can see that these 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:10.390
 courts to this one often with 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.120
 a lot more difficulties because 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.310
 I knew it's nice to open so is 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.190
 always the red interest 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.169
 this one is beautiful a little darker the 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.220
 more Bordeaux that it hires a lot 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:26.320
 more lively then slow to the truth that is 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.370
 what we find then always finds 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.169
 skeptical rock so has this little ring 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.440
 allows it to attach a small 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:41.590
 jitters sold in stores since 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:44.080
 always have me if it was lived in leather 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.300
 always like on the rancid and as on 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.600
 the extremities 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.800
 besides who details the fight on 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.090
 bet made in France 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.030
 there are some that have been made en route 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.669
 she is there absolutely nothing of the other 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.530
 side always the soft matter very strong 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.710
 a little less there still not this 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.710
 touch 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:12.590
 so interest always this little 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:15.100
 pouch like that pocket and very small 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.539
 sorry game was wrong in my fate 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.580
 so do not overload 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:22.340
 this cover because otherwise it can 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.979
 damage especially I believe on the part 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.729
 outdoor shots on the van de la a11 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:31.490
 parra leader is just very very 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.229
 important there is the serial number of 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.550
 bag 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:39.500
 so here we see tr 31 62 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.099
 so it serves as a watch although it's a 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.479
 true bag tr it corresponds to a country but 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:48.020
 most of it corresponds to France 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.580
 apparently and the 31 62 just 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.500
 take the second digit is the 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.720
 fourth digit you assemblies 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.900
 so that's twelve so 2012 I did not 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.810
 of course the back like that I you 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.800
 I am yours so the year of the bag 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:05.690
 then for the data of each time 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.889
 we put on the 3 6 I know more 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.169
 really what does it mean I think 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.599
 it's relative to the month so here we go 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:14.960
 super important show it's stolen 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:16.010
 behind the pocket that comes the number of 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.159
 bag series 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.360
 we will be interested in it 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:23.150
 already inside is not at all 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:29.810
 the same is a cover and with a 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:31.220
 zipper and in a little trick in 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:37.099
 written read your bet but we are 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:37.700
 completely crazy and no speedy bag 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:42.320
 more 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:44.510
 klose in the pocket so here you are 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.340
 save that on the speedy model 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.590
 the interior is always the same 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.800
 even on the monogram it's always 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.810
 all smooth with this little pouch 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:58.490
 on the monogram model we will say that 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:07:02.420
 the interior is Belgian on the pdi down the 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:04.220
 checkered it's still red so here it is 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.870
 I hope this little video you 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.550
 will have helped if you want to buy yourself a 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.400
 raised your tone but you do not want you 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.620
 scam that it allows you to 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.610
 see differences because that's 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.390
 true that when we do not know in the 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:20.150
 brand see a real or info we do not know 

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.860
 not too much because we see the checkerboard 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.420
 little things in orange dubois breast 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.510
 concrete but now that you see that 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.550
 it's not so difficult to distinguish 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.670
 true of the false but it is true that with the 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:34.280
 time the counterfeit is improving 

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:36.680
 really there are flaws that looks 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.240
 really true but it's true 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.750
 that the quality is not quite the 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.190
 same thing so here is so if you have 

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.840
 questions do not hesitate to me 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.430
 request and I will do my best for you 

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.780
 answer and I really hope that 

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:51.070
 videos you 'll have I make you 

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.070
 kisses and see you soon
