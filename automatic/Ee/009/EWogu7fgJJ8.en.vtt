 ambulance employees in one 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.459
 perilous situation brought about by 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.459
 a psychiatric patient 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.060
 Do doctors try to save what's going on 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.260
 rescue falls on his left eye 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.260
 looks little hopeful 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.140
 it regularly happens that we humans 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.120
 farmers who 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.980
 stabbed or knocked down or 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.670
 probably kicked off with 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.219
 ever done that before 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.569
 and then it's hanssen and there is 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:49.569
 totally aware of what's going on 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.430
 and how to use some coarse language 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.170
 and yes I had he can in the 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.609
 justice that costs human lives 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.170
 they sit behind me they sit beside with 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.400
 the does not work 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.400
 and then suddenly you stand along the highway 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.640
 that moment sir pushes away and it 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.840
 is very clear that he is the fast 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.610
 ambulance driver 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.440
 Wiebe fisherman on his way to a patient 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.819
 he gets a crash and thereby becomes 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.379
 badly injured 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.329
 a blow to someone for whom his work 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.859
 his lust and his life of being constant 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.959
 down that highway and I walked a bit 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.550
 up and then you all see cars on 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.550
 and 2 3 rows thick some space 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.100
 it is usually a short message with the 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.170
 important data where you know 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.000
 of course not everything immediately 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.560
 and then you go with the certain tension 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.419
 you'll go to 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.910

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.620
