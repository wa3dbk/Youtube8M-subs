00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
vapor carbon elite 2.0 so let's get into

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.730 
vapor carbon elite 2.0 so let's get into
it<00:00:11.250> so<00:00:11.780> as<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.929> can<00:00:13.080> see<00:00:13.139> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
nike vapor carbon elite I went to the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.100 
nike vapor carbon elite I went to the
store<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:31.949> bought<00:00:32.130> these<00:00:32.450> on<00:00:33.450> here

store and bought these on here
it's<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.600> vapor<00:00:36.600> carbon<00:00:37.730> 2.0<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.170> they<00:00:40.170> did

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
it's a vapor carbon 2.0 and they did

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.170 
it's a vapor carbon 2.0 and they did
two-point<00:00:40.739> nose<00:00:41.960> to<00:00:42.960> DS<00:00:43.260> cuz<00:00:44.190> remember<00:00:44.460> these

I<00:01:12.080> noticed<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.380> carbon<00:01:13.950> fiber<00:01:14.570> on<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.630> Nike

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
I noticed this carbon fiber on a Nike

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.679 
I noticed this carbon fiber on a Nike
swoosh<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.830> was<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.790> dang<00:01:18.409> that's<00:01:19.409> fresh<00:01:19.979> and

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.320 
swoosh I was like dang that's fresh and
then<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:22.080> saw<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.159> like<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.549> first<00:01:23.939> took<00:01:24.030> out<00:01:24.210> my

then I saw it like I first took out my
heart<00:01:24.540> cuz<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.840> saw<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> bolt<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.920> plate

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
heart cuz I saw it a bolt on the plate

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.960 
heart cuz I saw it a bolt on the plate
and<00:01:26.310> everything<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.700> there

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
and everything so I can get on and there

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.170 
and everything so I can get on and there
because<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> bold<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.020> white<00:01:31.170> one

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
because the bold and white one

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.530 
because the bold and white one
but<00:01:33.180> damn<00:01:33.420> we<00:01:34.259> got<00:01:34.700> carbon<00:01:35.700> fiber<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.210> back

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
but damn we got carbon fiber on the back

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.600 
but damn we got carbon fiber on the back
too<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:38.009> heel<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.329> heel<00:01:40.189> right<00:01:41.189> Nike

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
too on the heel on the heel right Nike

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.080 
too on the heel on the heel right Nike
just<00:01:41.790> went<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.180> lot<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.659> knees<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.200> year<00:01:44.090> and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
just went a lot of knees this year and

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.870 
just went a lot of knees this year and
then<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.329> guess<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.780> see<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.979> fly<00:01:47.250> wire<00:01:47.549> is

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
then I guess you can see the fly wire is

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.870 
then I guess you can see the fly wire is
a<00:01:48.030> vote<00:01:48.420> vote<00:01:49.140> green<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:50.240> got<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:52.250> mesh<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.850> mesh

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
a vote vote green I got it mesh the mesh

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.389 
a vote vote green I got it mesh the mesh
right<00:01:54.390> here<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.990> tongue<00:01:58.399> breathability

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
right here on the tongue breathability

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.359 
right here on the tongue breathability
and<00:01:59.850> then<00:02:00.810> something<00:02:01.610> that<00:02:02.610> really<00:02:03.479> caught<00:02:03.780> my

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
and then something that really caught my

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.570 
and then something that really caught my
you<00:02:05.369> know<00:02:05.430> remember<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.390> vapor<00:02:06.840> carbines

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
you know remember on the vapor carbines

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.440 
you know remember on the vapor carbines
the<00:02:08.580> vapor<00:02:08.819> carbon<00:02:09.149> flies

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
the vapor carbon flies

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.170 
the vapor carbon flies
how<00:02:11.129> like<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:13.300> tongue<00:02:14.010> wasn't<00:02:15.180> completely

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
how like the tongue wasn't completely

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.759 
how like the tongue wasn't completely
attached<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.959> whole<00:02:17.200> thing<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.650> was<00:02:17.680> just

attached to the whole thing it was just
attached<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.840> missile<00:02:20.459> nothing<00:02:21.459> me<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:21.790> what

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
attached to missile nothing me so what

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.540 
attached to missile nothing me so what
the<00:02:22.090> hell<00:02:22.209> am<00:02:22.239> I<00:02:22.420> talking<00:02:22.690> about<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.959> base

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
the hell am I talking about the base

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.610 
the hell am I talking about the base
like<00:02:24.550> right<00:02:24.760> here<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.930> was<00:02:26.019> only<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.290> touch<00:02:26.470> of

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
like right here it was only a touch of

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.380 
like right here it was only a touch of

so<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.220> all<00:02:30.430> really<00:02:30.670> got<00:02:30.790> any<00:02:30.940> problems<00:02:31.269> with

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
so I all really got any problems with

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.530 
so I all really got any problems with
that<00:02:31.660> when<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:31.989> was<00:02:32.080> trying<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.410> bomb<00:02:33.330> I'm<00:02:34.330> have

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
that when I was trying to bomb I'm have

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.720 
that when I was trying to bomb I'm have
to<00:02:34.660> break<00:02:34.870> these<00:02:35.080> in<00:02:35.319> but<00:02:35.950> I'm<00:02:36.190> probably<00:02:36.489> gonna

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
to break these in but I'm probably gonna

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.729 
to break these in but I'm probably gonna
only<00:02:37.000> use<00:02:37.239> it<00:02:37.390> for<00:02:37.420> game<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.349> you<00:02:38.500> know<00:02:38.620> home

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
only use it for game so you know home

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:39.900 
only use it for game so you know home
