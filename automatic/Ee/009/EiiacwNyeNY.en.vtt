00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.329
 it becomes a bit complicated 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.940
 develop anything from this 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.410
 reputation all that but here's the idea 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.100

 large never place early 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.810

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.299
 they need you to fight and get 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.349
