 hello everyone, evgeny 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.360
 Kartashov I greet you in a new video 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.969
 lessons photoshop site master and 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.400
 This lesson is about colorization. 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.560
 photos we will look at an easy way with 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.689
 which you can revive 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.289
 colors on your photo make them 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.140
 a bit unusual so say a little in 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.090
 vintage style 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.390
 The first thing we do is create 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.980
 adjustment layer curves 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.579
 slightly correct our contrast 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.070
 photos and make it brighter 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.070
 Give the curve a light S-shape 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.370
 still slightly raise the light portion and 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.289
 let's see what we got as 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:59.129
 seeing pictures has already become much 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.730
 brighter and more contrast now create 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:08.310
 easy color effect create again 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:13.159
 adjustment layer curves and change 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:17.810
 soft light mode 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.810
 now see what you can do here 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.750
 double click 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:28.950
 open the adjustment layer window 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:32.790
 select the blue channel and raise the bottom 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.130
 curve point to the top dark 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.810
 parts of the image are painted here 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.180
 such a bluish color to 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.840
 we need this light color to balance 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.090
 plots do the opposite color 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.159
 so yellowish either 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.130
 orange red 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:57.689
 for this we omit the right point 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:02.159
 curve down a little and attach small 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:06.090
 bend and add a little purple 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:11.580
 component for this choose green 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.870
 channel and slightly lower the top point 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.060
 crooked 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.810
 now remove the extra contrast 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:25.580
 image choose composite curve 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.580
 rgb and raise the point of the shadows on it and 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.590
 also brighten the image a little 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.690
 don't be afraid to experiment with different 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.299
 settings achieve the best 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.450
 the result if this effect 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:46.079
 seem a little you can change the mode 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.390
 overlaying overlap is significantly 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.480
 enhances the effect but in this case it is necessary 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.540
 also be careful maybe here 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.220
 will have to reduce the opacity 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.250
 adjustment layer than by the way they 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.470
 good at any time you can change 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:06.420
 adjustment but we will leave the mode 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:11.400
 blending soft light and opacity 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:17.989
 approximately 80 90 percent now create 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.989
 one more adjustment layer color 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:24.329
 leave for now the color we need 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:27.750
 change the blending mode of this layer to 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:30.239
 dimming the basics white color here to us 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.709
 nothing will give it is transparent 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:37.919
 for this blend mode now if 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.099
 we will start to change the color we change 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:43.079
 overall tone of the image 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:48.720
 add some yellow or cream 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:51.859
 colors are about here like we see it 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:58.500
 gives the image new shades 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:04:00.510
 changing color change shade i want 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.329
 give a little bit of that yellowish 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:09.269
 I think red is enough 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:14.699
 if we want to make the color darker then 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:15.209
 choose a darker range click 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:18.269
 ok 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:22.049
 but we lost the blue color of the dark 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:25.530
 areas let's get it back for this 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:29.040
 select the mask of the adjustment layer 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.220
 and use one of the image channels 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:38.340
 as a mask for this let's go into 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:42.419
 menu image-external channel select 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:45.480
 any channel can be here 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:49.139
 loop through channels to get 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:53.370
 best results for example me 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:55.820
 more like the green channel also 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.200
 you can see what inversion will give us 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.280
 in this case we do not need him 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:06.680
 invert blending mode set 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:13.280
 multiply and press ok 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:13.280
 what it gave us a look at the layer mask 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.100
 in dark areas we see the underlying 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.010
 adjustments 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:25.830
 light areas we have superimposed 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:30.540
 this color in dimming mode 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:34.410
 fundamentals and in the end we have this 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:36.570
 effect we can reduce the opacity 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:42.030
 layers to regulate the degree 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:44.490
 impacts so let's see from such here 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.950
 faded nondescript photos we 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.070
 got such a brighter and 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.960
 filled with a different mood should 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.500
 say what settings for each 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.660
 images must be individual 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.990
 be guided by your taste as you 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:04.320
 more like it anyway 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:07.530
 individual shape curves and color for 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.169
 Fill the image depending on what scale 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.360
 you want to get combining different 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:16.320
 colors you can get a lot 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:18.990
 various options for images given 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.680
 Coloring technique is widely used in 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.850
 processing wedding photos hope 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.250
 did you like the lesson 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:29.520
 the following lessons I will tell you about 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:32.190
 other ways to color photos with 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.050
