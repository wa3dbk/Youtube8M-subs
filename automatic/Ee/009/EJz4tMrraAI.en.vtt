00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.819
 hello unknown scum that this 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.800
 breaking italy the shock and went to 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:09.610
 Monday to Friday when we talk about 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:20.110
 what happens in the world 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:21.820
 here on youtube the first thing I wanted 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.110
 mention praise and oh my god i hope you don't 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.850
 mark the noises that come from outside 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.980
 generally when i say egypt i hope 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.750
 a feel you are not feeling however I am 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.910
 sure enough that today the screams of 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.800
 wind could pass to three bosses 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.070
 microphones give you back ears 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.350
 in the case he said this benign yesterday 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.880
 roberto benigni held on raiuno one 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.260
 show that lasted about two hours if that 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.740
 I was not mistaken the most beautiful of the 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.960
 world 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.370
 or my god if you didn't see it what 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.800
 you missed go immediately to 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.180
 they looked benign is a poet and after 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.260
 a typical introduction take on 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.520
 which has made fun of some 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.950
 especially political exponents 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.300
 Berlusconi as he usually analyzes 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.970
 the fundamental principles of ours 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.590
 constitution of the first 12 articles as if 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.110
 it was a poem he put us 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.059
 much of his was a lot of transport and the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.890
 what was nice and interesting below 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.810
 various points of view and I say this because 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.609
 today there are controversies in Italy each 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.439
 once something nice happens there 

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:13.060
 must be the controversy because we are 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.359
 of pain in the ass and criticons e 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.619
 even if the benign skill that it is 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:19.209
 undisputed has managed to move even the 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.759
 people who normally criticize everything 

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:23.229
 there were however the suv criticoni 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.700
 and I know that there is not even scum 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.770
 who decided to move the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.810
 objections to everything 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.459
 first of all, so it's nice to hear it 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.350
 because you know when you do the satire that 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:34.299
 when you criticize someone even if you don't 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.189
 he agrees that it is always very delicate 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.659
 very kind and very correct i know that 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.399
 many fail to appreciate the 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.319
 subtlety of the courageous kindly 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.719
 that you are criticizing many prefer 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:45.880
 instead it is the figure of the asshole who 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.529
 says things but I love it benini Ã¨ 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.789
 a person who exudes love 

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:51.189
 also the way he interpreted 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.869
 some items some pieces of 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.119
 articles of the constitution was 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.469
 fantastic quote for those who watched it 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.329
 part in which he defined the 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.369
 constitution like the ropes they tied 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.599
 ulisse while he was seduced by 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.080
 siren song succeed a 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:05.670
 interpret but what is boring 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.740
 really like a series of laws like 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.479
 if they were a poem it is not for everyone not 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.220
 it is from everyone and I say this to all 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.140
 people that with all the money that i 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.560
 they gave me I would have done a lot of 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.690
 better 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.550
 no you wouldn't have done much better 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.380
 apparently according to the newspaper that 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.000
 be very angry because benign 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.070
 has criticized Berlusconi what not 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.230
 had never done in the past then we are 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.850
 all fallen from the pear is almost 6 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.160
 million and to those who complain about 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.850
 this thing I say 1 set to one more 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.710
 little more 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.180
 2 Stop criticizing those who make money 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.010
 a lot of money doing something in the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.810
 which is very good at producing some 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.490
 what I personally felt 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.290
 little more enriched after I have 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.180
 looked benign this morning I have 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.740
 raised with good humor this is worth 6 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.260
 millions of cash and one person 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.270
 yes especially if then the rai in such 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.530
 gives him money as an investment 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.570
 it is still early to see the data 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.130
 of the auditel but everyone knows that almost 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.500
 all of Italy looked at last night 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.240
 benign so much that fazio a raitre is not 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.640
 aired then hypothesize that the 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.020
 rai still earned some money 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.310
 through advertising if after 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.780
 heard this anyway you want 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.330
 complain about money because you don't 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.250
 live on money but live and pay it 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.140
 you know that I love you anyway 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.030
 i love like a father but it's a bit 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.010
 a long time ago, perhaps, rather than 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.239
 while these are turned you prepare the 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.920
 thick hair to go out with friends 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.630
 that you never presented to him 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.130
 balance of small pieces of some 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.989
 who took off his nose that yes 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.250
 but they implant a father in their hair 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.170
 moreover we must learn humility and 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.670
 I say this for all the comments 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.930
 very contemptuous with cars yesterday on 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.090
 twitter that said Malay to 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.890
 constitution I already know part of that 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.989
 it's not true because most of it 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.370
 we do not know the constitution or not 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.050
 because of him our system of 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.030
 education does not teach it and should 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.470
 doing it starting from elementary school would be 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.030
 important already for children to do 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.430
 the constitution would create gods 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.410
 better citizens but regardless 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.209
 maybe you know the constitution and not 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.670
 you are pleased to see it explained this way 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.870
 just don't bother because many 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.360
 others may not know it 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.140
 let us learn humility I compare myself last 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.690
 years is the I understand why they don't do me 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.220
 bad though I like them and casillas 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.540
 argument as seen in the video of 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.250
 yesterday there was the war I said 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.049
 something very unpopular is 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.400
 was much debated and moreover me 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.720
 they still say for a moment how much it is 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.970
 proud of the scum who 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.530
 despite often not agreeing either 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.150
 very 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.430
 misa succeeds for the most part to 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.780
 be very posed and stylish in saying 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.460
 your opinion regardless 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.110
 from age and I am very very pleased that 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.790
 the best of the Italian community of 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.290
 youtube is ending up in the scum 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.150
 well so 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.490
 so to make you smile let's talk about 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.760
 this this ayane sherman a woman 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.680
 53 year old quadriplegic who went 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.090
 at the university of pittsburgh nobel is 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.800
 was chosen for an experiment by the 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.260
 researchers of the faculty of medicine 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.000
 we have already seen things like this e 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.090
 I'm about to talk to you about robotic arms 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.850
 moved by brains from both monkeys and da 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.500
 human beings but this case is different 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.050
 in fact tetraplegic woman which 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.120
 means that he has not been able to move for 13 years 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.100
 his body but his body 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.980
 woman two sensors were connected 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.330
 there are in the brain and these sensors 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.790
 allow you to move an arm 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.560
 mechanical and not after months and months of 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.510
 training think of when someone 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.550
 suffers an accident takes months of 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.190
 physiotherapy to overcome the mobility of 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.930
 a limb no she took two days 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.970
 succeed after 13 years that did not move 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.040
 nothing left to move that arm 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.140
 perform simple maneuvers that later 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.030
 He has perfected over time this thing and 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.290
 beautiful let us realize how much 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.510
 quickly is going on there 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.310
 technological slash medical research in 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.010
 this area and how much it can help 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.240
 many many people I just cost 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.130
 that I didn't light the tree this morning 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.870
 much better before moving on to 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.340
 next slew of news today that 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.720
 it's not exactly news though 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.979
 I'm the way I want to 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.240
 close today's inguinal break 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.919
 trying to convey the good mood 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.690
 that benini sent to me 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.370
 we continue to repeat this story 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.870
 I keep repeating it 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.940
 today's alpini are alessandro e 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.789
 Anna who decided to represent 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.620
 the scum to Paris send us various 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:56.000
 photos in various places of Paris this 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.380
 I think it's a great big one 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.210
 telecommunications antenna if you are 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.280
 the standard-bearer is the Reggina for today 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.390
 especially, they send me this 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.580
 kiss hand could have sent 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.800
 Alessandro instead, but Anna sent him 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.320
 so nice choice 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.610
 in closing as I said before I ignore 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.770
 a bit of news i know this is one 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.750
 show of news but I want to do these 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.570
 things are a series of moments 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.340
 beautiful of 2012 collected by bat feed 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.990
 who decided to restore ours 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.070
 faith in humanity I will not let you see 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.440
 all 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.660
 release in the description is are things 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.430
 like that of the parents who created 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.470
 to their little baby in a wheelchair 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.600
 the most beautiful halloween costume 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.250
 could create or the history of scott 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.230
 lidia a man with down syndrome 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.330
 sick to the kidneys he had made known 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.010
 to the mother he liked to receive 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.690
 letters the mother in turn had made 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.220
