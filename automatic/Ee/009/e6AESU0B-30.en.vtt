time<00:02:00.310> today<00:02:01.209> that<00:02:01.509> I've<00:02:01.630> used<00:02:01.659> any<00:02:02.170> heat<00:02:02.470> she

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
time today that I've used any heat she

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.210 
time today that I've used any heat she
did<00:02:03.579> give<00:02:04.329> me<00:02:04.360> a<00:02:04.509> really<00:02:04.780> good<00:02:04.899> trim<00:02:05.409> and<00:02:05.739> I

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
did give me a really good trim and I

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.180 
did give me a really good trim and I
needed<00:02:06.670> it<00:02:06.789> badly<00:02:07.179> and<00:02:07.659> she<00:02:08.289> also<00:02:08.500> put<00:02:08.920> long

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
needed it badly and she also put long

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.720 
needed it badly and she also put long
layers<00:02:09.610> in<00:02:10.000> my<00:02:10.539> hair<00:02:10.780> because<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.590> was<00:02:12.010> kind<00:02:12.670> of

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
layers in my hair because it was kind of

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.160 
layers in my hair because it was kind of
off<00:02:12.940> falling<00:02:13.480> at<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:13.630> same<00:02:13.750> length<00:02:14.349> so

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
off falling at the same length so

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.979 
off falling at the same length so
hopefully<00:02:17.170> did<00:02:17.410> see<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:22.000> she<00:02:22.090> cut<00:02:22.599> it<00:02:22.810> I

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
hopefully did see that so she cut it I

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.110 
hopefully did see that so she cut it I
got<00:02:23.379> a<00:02:23.410> deep<00:02:23.650> condition<00:02:24.160> i<00:02:24.250> got<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.549> works<00:02:24.819> i

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
got a deep condition i got the works i

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.460 
got a deep condition i got the works i
went<00:02:25.870> at<00:02:26.079> one<00:02:26.319> o'clock<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.980> i<00:02:27.489> left<00:02:27.790> at<00:02:27.970> five

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
went at one o'clock and i left at five

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.800 
went at one o'clock and i left at five
so<00:02:29.470> she<00:02:29.530> put<00:02:30.130> in<00:02:30.250> work<00:02:30.549> like<00:02:30.970> she<00:02:31.450> didn't

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
so she put in work like she didn't

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.080 
so she put in work like she didn't
really<00:02:31.840> know<00:02:32.319> how<00:02:32.650> much<00:02:32.950> my<00:02:33.400> hair<00:02:33.639> had<00:02:33.850> grown

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
really know how much my hair had grown

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.849 
really know how much my hair had grown
and<00:02:34.480> when<00:02:34.630> she<00:02:34.750> started<00:02:35.049> blowing<00:02:35.290> drying<00:02:35.590> it

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
and when she started blowing drying it

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.340 
and when she started blowing drying it
she<00:02:36.489> literally<00:02:36.910> had<00:02:37.569> them<00:02:37.720> breaking<00:02:37.959> up<00:02:38.200> in

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
she literally had them breaking up in

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.740 
she literally had them breaking up in
sections<00:02:38.889> that's<00:02:39.519> how<00:02:39.700> i<00:02:39.730> do<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.299> but<00:02:40.510> she'll

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
sections that's how i do it but she'll

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.650 
sections that's how i do it but she'll
just<00:02:41.049> go<00:02:41.290> at<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.560> like<00:02:41.920> all<00:02:42.730> at<00:02:42.850> once<00:02:43.329> but<00:02:43.510> she

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
just go at it like all at once but she

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.059 
just go at it like all at once but she
had<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.019> literally<00:02:44.290> breaking<00:02:44.680> up<00:02:44.920> their

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
had to literally breaking up their

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.640 
had to literally breaking up their
sections<00:02:45.549> and<00:02:45.730> do<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:46.060> like<00:02:46.440> two<00:02:47.440> or<00:02:47.620> three

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
sections and do it like two or three

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.090 
sections and do it like two or three
parts<00:02:48.250> at<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.459> time<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:49.660> i'm<00:02:50.560> probably<00:02:50.799> going<00:02:51.010> to

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
parts at a time so i'm probably going to

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.699 
parts at a time so i'm probably going to
leave<00:02:51.250> it<00:02:51.430> straight<00:02:51.790> for<00:02:52.000> as<00:02:52.090> long<00:02:52.329> as<00:02:52.389> i<00:02:52.569> can

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709

i'm already thinking about washing it
but<00:02:56.500> what's<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.400> purpose<00:02:57.639> of<00:02:57.849> getting

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
but what's the purpose of getting
