here comes our help on the big woman all
right

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.559 

good<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:18.530> harder<00:03:18.799> I<00:03:18.830> push<00:03:18.950> them<00:03:19.280> in<00:03:19.459> here<00:03:19.760> not

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
good the harder I push them in here not

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:21.910 
good the harder I push them in here not
that<00:03:20.689> that<00:03:20.780> makes<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:21.079> easier<00:03:21.349> drivin<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.890> car

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
that that makes it easier drivin the car

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.740 
that that makes it easier drivin the car
but<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.459> makes<00:03:22.610> his<00:03:22.819> stamina<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.629> his

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
but it makes his stamina and his

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.380 
but it makes his stamina and his
endurance<00:03:24.260> a<00:03:24.860> lot<00:03:25.340> stronger<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.150> does

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
endurance a lot stronger and it does

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.300 
endurance a lot stronger and it does
eventually<00:03:26.720> lead<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.260> lower<00:03:27.590> heart<00:03:27.920> rates<00:03:28.099> by

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
eventually lead to lower heart rates by

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.080 
eventually lead to lower heart rates by
pushing<00:03:28.610> in<00:03:28.909> those<00:03:29.180> zones<00:03:33.519> in<00:03:34.519> his<00:03:34.700> heartbeat

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
pushing in those zones in his heartbeat

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.809 
pushing in those zones in his heartbeat
he's<00:03:35.209> improving<00:03:35.690> three<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.409> four<00:03:36.650> beats<00:03:36.950> every

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
he's improving three to four beats every

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.440 
he's improving three to four beats every
couple<00:03:38.209> weeks<00:03:39.760> on<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.970> days<00:03:41.120> when<00:03:41.299> you're

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
couple weeks on the days when you're

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.830 
couple weeks on the days when you're
slacking<00:03:42.849> calorie<00:03:43.849> burns<00:03:44.030> way<00:03:44.239> down<00:03:44.420> heart

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
slacking calorie burns way down heart

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.899 
slacking calorie burns way down heart
rates<00:03:45.049> down<00:03:45.319> and<00:03:45.379> and<00:03:45.859> he'll<00:03:46.129> look<00:03:46.280> at<00:03:46.459> you<00:03:46.670> and

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
rates down and and he'll look at you and

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.420 
rates down and and he'll look at you and
say<00:03:47.120> you<00:03:47.720> know<00:03:47.870> we<00:03:48.560> need<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:48.829> pick<00:03:49.159> the<00:03:49.280> pace

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
say you know we need to pick the pace

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.890 
say you know we need to pick the pace
back<00:03:49.730> up<00:03:49.940> we<00:03:50.060> didn't<00:03:50.299> make<00:03:50.450> it<00:03:50.569> into<00:03:50.720> this

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
back up we didn't make it into this

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.599 
back up we didn't make it into this
heart<00:03:51.109> rate<00:03:51.140> zone<00:03:51.500> or<00:03:51.709> we<00:03:51.799> didn't<00:03:52.010> do<00:03:52.099> this<00:03:52.250> and

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
heart rate zone or we didn't do this and

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.550 
heart rate zone or we didn't do this and
compared<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.090> this<00:03:53.480> last<00:03:53.720> workout<00:03:54.170> we<00:03:54.409> did

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
compared to this last workout we did

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.440 
compared to this last workout we did
this<00:03:54.799> so<00:03:55.099> it<00:03:55.340> gives<00:03:55.489> us<00:03:55.579> a<00:03:55.639> lot<00:03:55.790> of<00:03:55.849> comparisons

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
this so it gives us a lot of comparisons

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.379 
this so it gives us a lot of comparisons
that<00:03:56.750> you<00:03:56.840> can't<00:03:57.019> hide<00:03:57.200> from
