then we'll get into the advanced

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.970 
then we'll get into the advanced
passcode<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.180> what<00:00:48.539> we'll<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.870> here<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.289> just

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
passcode so what we'll do here is just

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.950 
passcode so what we'll do here is just
for<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.190> example<00:00:50.579> I'm<00:00:51.329> going<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.600> keep<00:00:51.780> my

for this example I'm going to keep my
touch<00:00:52.770> ID<00:00:52.980> passcode<00:00:53.550> cuz<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.820> already<00:00:54.090> there

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
touch ID passcode cuz it's already there

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.639 
touch ID passcode cuz it's already there
but<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.510> won't<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.870> prompted<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.410> this

in<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.150> more<00:01:33.540> advanced<00:01:34.170> passcode<00:01:34.710> using

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
in a more advanced passcode using

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.580 
in a more advanced passcode using
letters<00:01:35.460> numbers<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.210> characters<00:01:36.439> that<00:01:37.439> you

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
letters numbers and characters that you

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.260 
letters numbers and characters that you
would<00:01:37.740> use<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.610> example<00:01:38.970> we're

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
would use so just for this example we're

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300 
would use so just for this example we're
going<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.420> go<00:01:39.570> across<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> bottom<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.619> all<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
going to go across the bottom of all the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.109 
going to go across the bottom of all the
letters<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.759> ZX<00:01:42.390> c<00:01:42.750> v<00:01:43.079> BN<00:01:43.680> m<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.520> we're<00:01:44.970> going

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
letters so ZX c v BN m and we're going

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.569 
letters so ZX c v BN m and we're going
to<00:01:45.149> hit<00:01:45.299> next<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.990> we'll<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.009> again<00:01:47.310> just

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
to hit next and we'll do that again just

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.260 
to hit next and we'll do that again just
so<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.920> we<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.070> get<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.369> example<00:01:50.759> going

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
so that we can get this example going

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.319 
so that we can get this example going
we'll<00:01:51.509> hit<00:01:51.630> done<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.520> now<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.579> process<00:01:54.119> is

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
we'll hit done and now the process is

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.940 
we'll hit done and now the process is
going<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.600> be<00:01:54.750> as<00:01:54.930> follows<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.590> when<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> phone

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
going to be as follows so when the phone

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.830 
going to be as follows so when the phone
is<00:01:56.009> locked<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.640> want<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.880> unlock<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.450> it's

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
is locked and you want to unlock it it's

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.569 
is locked and you want to unlock it it's
going<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.200> prompt<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.680> like<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.280> with<00:01:59.549> a

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
going to prompt you like so with a

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.609 
going to prompt you like so with a
keyboard<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.360> enter<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.810> your<00:02:00.990> advanced

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
keyboard so to enter in your advanced

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.440 
keyboard so to enter in your advanced
passcode<00:02:02.159> it's<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.909> take<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> little<00:02:03.270> bit

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
passcode it's going to take a little bit

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.090 
passcode it's going to take a little bit
more<00:02:03.689> time<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.740> be<00:02:04.890> more

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
more time and it's going to be more

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.219 
more time and it's going to be more
secure<00:02:05.430> than<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.790> simple<00:02:06.119> passcode<00:02:06.360> so

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
secure than the simple passcode so

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.719 
secure than the simple passcode so
that's<00:02:07.409> pretty<00:02:07.649> much<00:02:07.770> how<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.039> do<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.399> as<00:02:08.550> I

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
that's pretty much how you do it as I

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.170 
that's pretty much how you do it as I
said<00:02:09.000> if<00:02:09.179> you'd<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.810> enter<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
said if you'd like to enter in the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.940 
said if you'd like to enter in the
touch<00:02:11.329> ID<00:02:11.569> passcode<00:02:12.230> there<00:02:12.439> is<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.590> video<00:02:12.890> you

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
touch ID passcode there is a video you

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.490 
touch ID passcode there is a video you
can<00:02:13.280> check<00:02:13.489> that<00:02:13.519> out<00:02:13.700> right<00:02:13.849> there<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.599> it

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
can check that out right there and it

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.649 
can check that out right there and it
should<00:02:15.739> show<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.099> exactly<00:02:16.609> how<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.939> do<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.420> and

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
should show you exactly how to do so and

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.050 
should show you exactly how to do so and
you<00:02:17.719> can<00:02:17.870> actually<00:02:18.019> have<00:02:18.469> the<00:02:18.980> passcode<00:02:19.879> with

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
you can actually have the passcode with

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.580 
you can actually have the passcode with
the<00:02:20.150> fingerprint<00:02:20.629> scanner<00:02:20.750> as<00:02:21.049> well<00:02:21.290> as<00:02:21.469> an

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
the fingerprint scanner as well as an

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.410 
the fingerprint scanner as well as an
advanced<00:02:21.980> passcode<00:02:22.400> or<00:02:22.609> a<00:02:22.670> simple<00:02:23.180> passcode

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
advanced passcode or a simple passcode

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.000 
advanced passcode or a simple passcode
depending<00:02:24.019> on<00:02:24.109> how<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.260> want<00:02:24.349> to<00:02:24.560> set<00:02:24.739> it<00:02:24.769> up

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
depending on how you want to set it up

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.099 
depending on how you want to set it up
so<00:02:25.549> that's<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.819> process<00:02:26.060> hit<00:02:26.719> that<00:02:26.900> like

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.109 
so that's the process hit that like

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:28.569 
so that's the process hit that like
