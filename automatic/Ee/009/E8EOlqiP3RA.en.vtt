00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 a warm red new one 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:08.160
 media representatives but mature 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.639
 Consideration will be the whole weekend 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.809
 are the whole board of the go 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:21.090
 come to the conclusion that we karl 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:24.510
 daxbacher free now and him 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.820
 Martin the new interim coach 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.300
 The causes for this are short 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.809
 addressed 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.130
 we have been playing for the last eight 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.750
 unfortunately only two victories come in 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.290
 can 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.489
 four draws and two defeats 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.680
 that's exactly what ours are 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.879
 expectation not quite met 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.469
 but not only that but it works 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.210
 not just results around results 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.930
 We also came to the conclusion 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.020
 that the development of each one 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.789
 or the whole team with the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.750
 corresponds to what we look at throughout 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.240
 breakfast and therefore as previously mentioned 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.939
 But the decision was made 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.560
 separating our coach is with me 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.040
 Personally, of course, very sorry if you 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.460
 Many many gates in the last year many 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.369
 celebrate many beautiful experiences with him 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.979
 allowed and of course he did 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.080
 undoubtedly also a great success there 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.799
 rankommt 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.810
 but we who have the responsibility 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.700
 and of course, over a longer term 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.670
 beyond that period 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.430
 We see ourselves in the duty 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.000
 now to make that decision and 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.509
 iso or we say it is 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.299
 always better to act what to react 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.540
 and this is a clear sign that 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:01.409
 it's a reaction and wannsee and sascha 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.829
 kloer alone now remove the 300 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.909
 that will not be enough, it is too 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.220
 parallel to it of course 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.790
 an appeal to the team today already 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.530
 Of course we also take the boat 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.040
 must take and take in the duty 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.280
 have to 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.930
 and now we are expecting ourselves in the 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.840
 remaining play a significant 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.370
 reaction 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.410
 if it finally succeeds 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.780
 anyway a second thing and then 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.720
 you will see if we are a right one 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.640
 have made a decision or 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.060
 maybe it's a wrong one 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.060
 undecided
