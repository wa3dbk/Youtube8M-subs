in<00:00:00.299> this<00:00:00.450> video<00:00:00.719> we're<00:00:00.960> going<00:00:01.050> to<00:00:01.110> be<00:00:01.230> looking

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
in this video we're going to be looking

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.010 
in this video we're going to be looking
at<00:00:01.800> deploying<00:00:02.190> code<00:00:02.909> from<00:00:03.480> a<00:00:03.570> hosted

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
at deploying code from a hosted

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.280 
at deploying code from a hosted
repository<00:00:04.710> like<00:00:05.009> github<00:00:05.549> or<00:00:06.120> bitbucket<00:00:06.290> and

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
repository like github or bitbucket and

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.580 
repository like github or bitbucket and
pushing<00:00:08.160> that<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.670> server<00:00:09.210> like<00:00:09.809> in<00:00:10.110> Amazon

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
pushing that to a server like in Amazon

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.690 
pushing that to a server like in Amazon
ec2<00:00:10.849> instance<00:00:11.849> or<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.929> digital<00:00:13.620> ocean<00:00:13.889> droplet

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
ec2 instance or a digital ocean droplet

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.510 
ec2 instance or a digital ocean droplet
now<00:00:15.360> I'm<00:00:15.480> going<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.719> be<00:00:15.839> using<00:00:16.379> github<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.340> this

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
now I'm going to be using github in this

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.040 
now I'm going to be using github in this
case<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.090> I'm<00:00:18.180> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.359> be<00:00:18.480> using<00:00:18.840> digital

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
case and I'm going to be using digital

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.670 
case and I'm going to be using digital
ocean<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:20.310> create<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.939> droplet<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.840> we're

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
ocean to create a droplet and we're

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.009 
ocean to create a droplet and we're
going<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.890> be<00:00:23.010> using<00:00:23.369> deployed<00:00:23.939> io<00:00:24.390> to

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
going to be using deployed io to

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.550 
going to be using deployed io to
actually<00:00:25.410> deploy<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:28.050> makes<00:00:28.289> it

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
actually deploy this and this makes it

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.859 
actually deploy this and this makes it
really<00:00:28.920> easy<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.760> actually<00:00:30.300> deploy<00:00:30.660> your

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
really easy to actually deploy your

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.380 
really easy to actually deploy your
application<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.910> keeps<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.059> all<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.270> one

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
application and keeps it all in one

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.750 
application and keeps it all in one
place<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.020> keeps<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.350> really<00:00:34.469> nice<00:00:34.680> I've<00:00:35.460> used

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
place and keeps it really nice I've used

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.110 
place and keeps it really nice I've used
a<00:00:35.880> couple<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.390> different<00:00:37.380> websites<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.850> work

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
a couple of different websites that work

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.780 
a couple of different websites that work
like<00:00:39.600> deploy<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.680> found<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.129> deploy<00:00:41.489> has

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
like deploy but I found that deploy has

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.119 
like deploy but I found that deploy has
the<00:00:42.090> most<00:00:42.329> options<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.260> it's<00:00:43.350> also<00:00:43.530> really

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the most options and it's also really

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.630 
the most options and it's also really
easy<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.910> set<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.180> as<00:00:45.600> well<00:00:45.950> so<00:00:46.950> as<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.579> see

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
easy to set up as well so as you can see

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.319 
easy to set up as well so as you can see
I<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.690> github<00:00:49.170> repo<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:51.090> called

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
I have a github repo here it's called

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.750 
I have a github repo here it's called
hello<00:00:51.660> world<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.770> basically<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.340> have

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
hello world and I basically just have

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.360 
hello world and I basically just have
one<00:00:54.059> file<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.690> here<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.170> commit<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.949> this

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
one file in here one commit and this

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.299 
one file in here one commit and this
just<00:00:56.640> says<00:00:56.789> hello<00:00:57.030> world<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:58.260> real<00:00:58.800> life<00:00:59.010> your

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
just says hello world in real life your

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.069 
just says hello world in real life your
application<00:01:00.030> will<00:01:00.359> obviously<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> lot

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
application will obviously be a lot

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.529 
application will obviously be a lot
larger<00:01:01.579> but<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.820> case<00:01:03.030> I'm<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.300> going

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
larger but in this case I'm just going

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.780 
larger but in this case I'm just going
to<00:01:03.690> use<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.080> as<00:01:04.320> an<00:01:04.470> example<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.640> can

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
to use this as an example and you can

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.910 
to use this as an example and you can
see<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> result<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.710> by<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
see the result of this here so by the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.530 
see the result of this here so by the
end<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> video<00:01:08.610> we'll<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.119> deployed

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
end of the video we'll have deployed

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.050 
end of the video we'll have deployed
this<00:01:10.080> all<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> code<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.729> repository

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
this all of the code in this repository

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.700 
this all of the code in this repository
to<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.200> digital<00:01:13.710> ocean<00:01:14.130> server<00:01:15.049> so<00:01:16.049> regardless

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
to a digital ocean server so regardless

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.380 
to a digital ocean server so regardless
of<00:01:16.920> what<00:01:17.040> serve<00:01:17.310> you're<00:01:17.520> using<00:01:17.850> I'm<00:01:18.180> going<00:01:18.330> to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
of what serve you're using I'm going to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.539 
of what serve you're using I'm going to
go<00:01:18.479> ahead<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.780> set<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.170> up<00:01:19.380> now<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.310> I'm

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
go ahead and set this up now so I'm

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.149 
go ahead and set this up now so I'm
going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.729> create<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.360> new<00:01:21.840> droplet<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.770> digital

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
going to create a new droplet in digital

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.100 
going to create a new droplet in digital
ocean<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.939> you've<00:01:24.270> not<00:01:24.420> already<00:01:24.479> signed<00:01:24.900> up

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
ocean if you've not already signed up

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.719 
ocean if you've not already signed up
with<00:01:25.229> digital<00:01:25.560> ocean<00:01:25.710> go<00:01:26.159> ahead<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.520> feel

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
with digital ocean go ahead and feel

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.840 
with digital ocean go ahead and feel
free<00:01:26.759> if<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.119> want<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.470> I'm<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.310> not

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
free if you want to so I'm going to not

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.819 
free if you want to so I'm going to not
really<00:01:29.880> choose<00:01:30.200> too<00:01:31.200> many<00:01:31.380> different<00:01:31.710> options

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
really choose too many different options

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.230 
really choose too many different options
here<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.610> going<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.820> hit<00:01:32.970> create

here and just going to hit create

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.480 
here and just going to hit create
droplet<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.530> that's<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.950> create<00:01:35.220> my

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
droplet and that's going to create my

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.149 
droplet and that's going to create my
droplet<00:01:35.970> for<00:01:36.329> me<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.960> I'll<00:01:37.229> get<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> username

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
droplet for me and I'll get a username

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.760 
droplet for me and I'll get a username
and<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> password<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:39.299> email<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.960> me<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.590> can

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
add an SSH key here I really depends on

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.550 
add an SSH key here I really depends on
your<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:45.119> know<00:01:45.240> how<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.570> want<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.930> work<00:01:46.350> with

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
this okay so once your droplets created

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.020 
this okay so once your droplets created
we're<00:01:49.590> going<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.799> open<00:01:49.920> up<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.220> terminal<00:01:50.610> and

something like Windows you can use party

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.850 
something like Windows you can use party
to<00:01:56.399> do<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.509> once<00:01:57.689> we're<00:01:57.869> connected<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
to do this so once we're connected the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.319 
to do this so once we're connected the
first<00:01:59.040> thing<00:01:59.280> we<00:01:59.369> want<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.640> do<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.939> install

first thing we want to do is install
Apache<00:02:00.719> just<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.469> can<00:02:01.619> test<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.130> this

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
Apache just so we can test that this

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.719 
Apache just so we can test that this
works<00:02:02.700> via<00:02:03.450> an<00:02:03.689> HTTP<00:02:04.530> server<00:02:04.579> you<00:02:05.579> can

we're now interested in is where our

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.950 
we're now interested in is where our
public<00:02:27.990> files<00:02:28.350> are<00:02:28.800> located<00:02:29.360> in<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:30.570> case<00:02:30.780> it

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
public files are located in this case it

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.850 
public files are located in this case it
happens<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.440> be<00:02:31.560> involved<00:02:32.070> at<00:02:33.030> HTML<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:34.710> will

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
happens to be involved at HTML this will

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.200 
happens to be involved at HTML this will
differ<00:02:35.130> depending<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.850> server<00:02:36.120> that

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.820 
create an environment here and I'm just
going<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.000> call<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.300> hello<00:03:48.720> world

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
going to call this hello world

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.320 
going to call this hello world
production<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.670> can<00:03:50.790> give<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.090> color

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
production and you can give it a color

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.300 
production and you can give it a color
label<00:03:51.720> if<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:51.930> want<00:03:52.170> and<00:03:52.709> we<00:03:52.800> also<00:03:52.980> need<00:03:53.190> to

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
label if you want and we also need to

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.550 
label if you want and we also need to
choose<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.850> branch<00:03:54.269> as<00:03:54.660> well<00:03:54.690> so<00:03:55.170> this<00:03:55.320> could

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
choose the branch as well so this could

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.100 
choose the branch as well so this could
be<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.980> development<00:03:56.670> branch<00:03:56.820> a<00:03:57.269> specific

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
be a development branch a specific

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.630 
be a development branch a specific
branch<00:03:58.380> or<00:03:58.680> in<00:03:58.830> this<00:03:58.950> case<00:03:59.160> it's<00:03:59.370> just<00:03:59.550> going

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
branch or in this case it's just going

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.640 
branch or in this case it's just going
to<00:03:59.730> be<00:03:59.820> the<00:03:59.910> master<00:04:00.300> branch<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.870> there's<00:04:01.560> not

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
to be the master branch and there's not

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.140 
to be the master branch and there's not
really<00:04:01.709> much<00:04:01.920> else<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.370> need<00:04:02.519> to<00:04:02.640> do<00:04:02.730> here<00:04:03.000> but

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
really much else you need to do here but

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.150 
really much else you need to do here but
you<00:04:03.239> can<00:04:03.540> do<00:04:04.230> things<00:04:04.380> like<00:04:04.530> HipChat

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
you can do things like HipChat

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.390 
you can do things like HipChat
or<00:04:05.400> campfire<00:04:06.120> deployment<00:04:06.989> notifications<00:04:07.650> so

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
or campfire deployment notifications so

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.890 
or campfire deployment notifications so
I'm<00:04:08.459> going<00:04:08.580> to<00:04:08.640> hit<00:04:08.790> add<00:04:08.940> environment<00:04:09.690> and

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
I'm going to hit add environment and

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.860 
I'm going to hit add environment and
once<00:04:10.530> that's<00:04:10.769> done<00:04:11.010> we<00:04:11.400> can<00:04:11.430> choose<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.300> server

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
once that's done we can choose a server

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.259 
once that's done we can choose a server
so<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.769> can<00:04:14.130> see<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.400> options<00:04:14.730> here<00:04:15.000> and

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
so you can see the options here and

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.670 
so you can see the options here and
depending<00:04:15.840> on<00:04:16.109> when<00:04:16.260> you're<00:04:16.380> watching<00:04:16.500> this

the droplet though what we need to do

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.740 
the droplet though what we need to do
here<00:04:34.260> is<00:04:34.470> we<00:04:34.890> need<00:04:35.010> to<00:04:35.160> actually<00:04:35.340> change<00:04:35.940> this

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
here is we need to actually change this

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.910 
here is we need to actually change this

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
to the hello world droplet so now what

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.770 
to the hello world droplet so now what
we<00:04:41.010> can<00:04:41.160> do<00:04:41.310> is<00:04:41.460> we<00:04:41.640> can<00:04:41.790> provide<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.450> remote

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
we can do is we can provide the remote

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.560 
we can do is we can provide the remote
path<00:04:43.140> remember<00:04:43.980> this<00:04:44.220> remote<00:04:44.580> path<00:04:44.850> is<00:04:45.120> far

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
path remember this remote path is far

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.320 
path remember this remote path is far
above<00:04:45.840> Double<00:04:46.530> H<00:04:46.650> tml<00:04:47.220> so<00:04:47.760> we<00:04:47.850> can<00:04:47.970> enter<00:04:48.300> that

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
above Double H tml so we can enter that

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.440 
above Double H tml so we can enter that
in<00:04:48.630> here<00:04:49.040> so<00:04:50.040> now<00:04:50.190> we<00:04:50.250> can<00:04:50.550> go<00:04:50.670> and<00:04:50.820> click<00:04:51.090> check

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
in here so now we can go and click check

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.020 
in here so now we can go and click check
connection<00:04:52.080> but<00:04:52.350> this<00:04:52.620> is<00:04:52.800> going<00:04:53.010> to<00:04:53.130> fail<00:04:53.550> so

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
connection but this is going to fail so

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.790 
connection but this is going to fail so
you'll<00:04:54.180> see<00:04:54.450> what<00:04:54.630> we<00:04:54.780> need<00:04:54.900> to<00:04:55.050> do<00:04:55.260> here<00:04:55.500> to

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
you'll see what we need to do here to

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.590 
you'll see what we need to do here to
actually<00:04:56.130> make<00:04:56.310> this<00:04:56.430> work<00:04:56.730> and<00:04:57.030> this<00:04:57.540> is

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
actually make this work and this is

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.710 
actually make this work and this is
because<00:04:58.020> we<00:04:58.140> don't<00:04:58.410> have<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:59.010> SSH<00:04:59.640> key<00:05:00.030> for

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
tell you how to do this so if you hit

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.000 
tell you how to do this so if you hit
learn<00:05:09.870> about<00:05:10.140> public<00:05:10.560> key<00:05:10.710> authentication

you do get a guide here what we're going

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.780 
you do get a guide here what we're going
to<00:05:13.650> do<00:05:13.740> is<00:05:13.830> we're<00:05:13.920> going<00:05:14.010> to<00:05:14.070> hit<00:05:14.280> this<00:05:14.520> and

to do is we're going to hit this and
we're<00:05:14.880> going<00:05:15.000> to<00:05:15.030> take<00:05:15.360> this<00:05:15.660> key<00:05:16.050> we're<00:05:16.770> going

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
we're going to take this key we're going

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.290 
we're going to take this key we're going
to<00:05:16.950> copy<00:05:17.220> this<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:17.760> we're<00:05:17.940> going<00:05:18.060> to<00:05:18.090> paste

this into our authorized keys on our

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.310 
this into our authorized keys on our

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.030 

there<00:05:48.060> we<00:05:48.180> go<00:05:48.300> it<00:05:48.600> works<00:05:48.840> so<00:05:49.590> there's<00:05:49.710> a<00:05:49.860> couple

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
there we go it works so there's a couple

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.010

of optional things you can do here like

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.260 
of optional things you can do here like
post-deployment<00:05:52.830> commands<00:05:53.370> and<00:05:53.790> web<00:05:54.000> hooks

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
post-deployment commands and web hooks

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.910 
post-deployment commands and web hooks
I'm<00:05:54.810> going<00:05:55.110> to<00:05:55.170> skip<00:05:55.380> this<00:05:55.530> for<00:05:55.710> now

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920

deployment<00:06:16.050> notes<00:06:16.290> here<00:06:16.530> I'm<00:06:16.590> not<00:06:16.710> going<00:06:16.830> to

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:16.920 
deployment notes here I'm not going to

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.100 
deployment notes here I'm not going to
do<00:06:17.040> this<00:06:17.220> so<00:06:17.460> I'm<00:06:17.520> going<00:06:17.610> to<00:06:17.670> hit<00:06:17.900> review<00:06:18.900> and

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
do this so I'm going to hit review and

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.090 
do this so I'm going to hit review and
then<00:06:22.110> I'm<00:06:22.200> going<00:06:22.320> to<00:06:22.410> hit<00:06:22.560> start<00:06:23.040> deployment

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
then I'm going to hit start deployment

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.800 
then I'm going to hit start deployment
so<00:06:26.100> that's<00:06:26.430> now<00:06:26.670> deploying<00:06:27.210> if<00:06:27.510> we<00:06:27.660> just

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
so that's now deploying if we just

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.450 
so that's now deploying if we just
refresh<00:06:28.170> the<00:06:28.320> page<00:06:28.500> there's<00:06:28.920> not<00:06:29.190> a<00:06:29.220> lot<00:06:29.400> of

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
refresh the page there's not a lot of

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.010 
refresh the page there's not a lot of
files<00:06:29.700> here<00:06:30.000> so<00:06:30.120> that<00:06:30.270> should<00:06:30.480> be<00:06:30.570> done<00:06:30.810> now

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
files here so that should be done now

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.500 
files here so that should be done now
and<00:06:31.560> when<00:06:31.770> we<00:06:31.830> go<00:06:31.950> over<00:06:32.220> to<00:06:32.340> our<00:06:32.370> server<00:06:32.790> you

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
and when we go over to our server you

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.010 
and when we go over to our server you
can<00:06:33.630> see<00:06:33.870> that's<00:06:34.380> been<00:06:34.620> deployed
