00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.340
 which usually creates doubts in our 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.080
 students and is also a reason for disapproval 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.230
 I'll talk about plagiarism 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.050

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.499

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.589

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:01.530
 intellectual failure to indicate where 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.839
 announce as such the pseudonym name 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.900

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.330
 in addition to responding for moral damages is 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.270
 forced to disclose the identity 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.740
 so how can we avoid it? 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.630
 situations of plagiarism that will be 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.380
 presented by professor Maria de 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.890
 fatima 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.410
 in the case of the beloved student John the students 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.020
 next week you will have to bring 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.070
 a research on what is the science of 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.530
 perfection 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.850
 thinking about the activity you have to do 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.190
 The student John went to his house. 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.350
 determined to do activity 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.300
 When I got home, John started to 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.420
 search the internet and then some 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.720
 minutes found what I wanted 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.120
 I thought John thought the science of 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.730
 perception on an internet site 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.590
 selected three that he wanted copied and 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.930
 pasted into the text editing program 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.320
 organized the text the following week was 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.700
 to school with your work ready 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.980
 but to deliver the activity to the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.610
 teacher maria de fátima she recognizes 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.860
 The text speaks with John and John 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.690
 when a person transcribes the work 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.149
 intellectual property of another author 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.619
 we call plagiarism plagiarism is a crime 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.510
 we can avoid it 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.230
 the Brazilian Association of Standards 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.720
 abnt techniques predicts these situations and 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.650
 shows how we can use such text 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.460
 without being characterized as plagiarism 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.760
 for example 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.620
 in this case we have a direct quotation 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.900
 happens when the text of an author is 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.760
 transcribed by another person without due 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.120
 authorization reference 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.940
 I'll explain better to avoid plagiarism 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.550
 we should revere the quoted text with the 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.920
 author name in capital letters year 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.290
 of the publication of the work page number 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.280
 volume or assignment of the work which was 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.190
 used 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.950
 See how your text should appear 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.160
 this is the form you should reference 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.110
 the text joão 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.570
 but if the transcribed text has more than 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.180
 three lines have to be presented with 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.580
 single letter spacing with 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.049
 4 cm margin recoil 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.930
 left 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:13.680
 see how this text would be presented and 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.459
 the larger portion was transcribed soon 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.739
 John 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.160
 now that you know how to reference the 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.769
 your activity make the right fixes 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.600
 Teacher, I'll make corrections, joão. 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.030
 now knows as a reference to a quote 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.570
 direct and return home to do the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.250
 corrections however joão wants 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.450
 simply put the reference in the 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.010
 direct quote 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.489
 he wants to write with his own 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.620
 words that he researched after much 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:45.630
 analyze the text he writes next 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:48.030
 sentence when John hands the 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:52.500
 activity for the teacher her hour 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.630
 activity explains again john or 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.310
 even if the text is not registered 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.459
 same in the way it was presented 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.069
 now is still characterized as plagiarism 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.890
 in this case we have a tape 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.680
 happens when a person shows 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.170
 with other words the idea of ​​an author 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.239
 without differentiating it properly by giving 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.680
 understand that the text is of its own 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.500
 authorship 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.690
 to avoid this kind of plagiarism 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.370
 name of the author and year of 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.320
 publication of the work 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.360
 see how a text should be presented 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.240
 in its activity 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.490
 so with your own words you 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.080
 transmitted the idea of an Islam and 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.389
 correct reference 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.460
 Now John is ready to make the 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.919
 work refer to those of other 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.580
 people without having to worry about 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.410
 Plagiarism is also important not 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.020
 forget to reference the cited author 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.130
 in the references to the end of the work 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.530
 saying the author's name 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.639
 the title of the work edition number of 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.479
 local work 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:56.419
 publisher and year of publication note the 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.520
 reference used by joão 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:02.070
 ready now that we know what's down 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.830
 we can identify it and avoid it 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.570
 so you and I can 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.130
 conduct our research in a 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.680
 correct and efficient 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.509
 citing and referencing the ideas and their 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.229
 respective authors 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:15.229
 good studies
