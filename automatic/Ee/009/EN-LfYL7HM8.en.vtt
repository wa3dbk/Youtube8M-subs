00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.800 
but it's kind of hard to show cuz on top
you've<00:03:48.010> got<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.220> radiator<00:03:48.490> support<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.390> it's

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
you've got the radiator support and it's

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.660 
you've got the radiator support and it's
just<00:03:50.050> very<00:03:50.260> hard<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.620> show<00:03:50.710> and<00:03:51.190> then<00:03:51.520> of

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
just very hard to show and then of

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.070 
just very hard to show and then of
course<00:03:51.700> you<00:03:52.120> know<00:03:52.240> as<00:03:52.300> far<00:03:52.450> as<00:03:52.540> driving<00:03:52.780> around

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
course you know as far as driving around

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.780 
course you know as far as driving around
it's<00:03:53.620> gonna<00:03:53.770> be<00:03:53.980> much<00:03:54.220> like<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.550> stock

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
it's gonna be much like the stock

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.640 
it's gonna be much like the stock
radiator<00:03:55.240> except<00:03:55.630> we're<00:03:55.750> gonna<00:03:55.840> get<00:03:56.110> a<00:03:56.290> lot

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
radiator except we're gonna get a lot

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.440 
radiator except we're gonna get a lot
better<00:03:57.040> cooling<00:03:57.580> performance<00:03:57.760> so<00:03:58.180> that<00:03:58.300> way

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
better cooling performance so that way

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.260 
better cooling performance so that way
forever<00:03:59.170> out<00:03:59.350> to<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.590> track<00:03:59.920> you<00:04:00.670> know<00:04:01.000> we<00:04:01.120> can

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
forever out to the track you know we can

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.970 
forever out to the track you know we can
stay<00:04:01.480> out<00:04:01.510> longer<00:04:01.930> drive<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.380> car<00:04:02.530> harder

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
stay out longer drive the car harder

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.950 
stay out longer drive the car harder
without<00:04:03.160> risk<00:04:03.880> of<00:04:04.150> overheating<00:04:04.480> which<00:04:04.840> is

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
without risk of overheating which is

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.810 
without risk of overheating which is
exactly<00:04:05.380> what<00:04:05.620> we<00:04:05.740> want<00:04:06.040> this<00:04:06.190> car<00:04:06.400> does<00:04:06.610> see

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
exactly what we want this car does see

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.520 
exactly what we want this car does see
quite<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.090> bit<00:04:07.150> of<00:04:07.330> track<00:04:07.570> use<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.260> we<00:04:08.350> just

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
quite a bit of track use and we just

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.990 
quite a bit of track use and we just
wanted<00:04:08.680> to<00:04:08.740> make<00:04:08.920> sure<00:04:09.070> that<00:04:09.220> we<00:04:09.370> were<00:04:09.580> staying

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
wanted to make sure that we were staying

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.880 
wanted to make sure that we were staying
safe<00:04:10.420> and<00:04:10.660> we<00:04:11.110> could<00:04:11.260> stay<00:04:11.410> out<00:04:11.440> on<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.680> track

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
safe and we could stay out on the track

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.430 
safe and we could stay out on the track
longer<00:04:12.610> and<00:04:12.850> have<00:04:13.090> more<00:04:13.360> fun<00:04:13.690> with<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.050> car<00:04:14.200> so

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
longer and have more fun with the car so

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.130 
longer and have more fun with the car so
next<00:04:14.860> let's<00:04:15.100> talk<00:04:15.220> about<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.640> install<00:04:16.150> really

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
next let's talk about the install really

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.740 
next let's talk about the install really
install<00:04:17.680> is<00:04:17.859> very<00:04:18.760> simple<00:04:19.209> I<00:04:19.270> mean<00:04:19.420> as<00:04:19.510> far<00:04:19.690> as

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
install is very simple I mean as far as

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.970 
install is very simple I mean as far as
radiator<00:04:20.260> and<00:04:20.380> stalls<00:04:20.620> go

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
radiator and stalls go

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.710 
radiator and stalls go
everything<00:04:21.580> hooks<00:04:21.790> up<00:04:21.940> just<00:04:22.120> like<00:04:22.240> stock<00:04:22.510> and

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
everything hooks up just like stock and

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.690 
everything hooks up just like stock and
pull<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:22.990> stock<00:04:23.200> radiator<00:04:23.530> out<00:04:23.740> take<00:04:24.430> off<00:04:24.550> the

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
pull the stock radiator out take off the

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.490 
pull the stock radiator out take off the
fan<00:04:24.880> shroud<00:04:25.060> pop<00:04:25.510> it<00:04:25.630> on<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.870> Mishimoto

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
fan shroud pop it on the Mishimoto

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.890 
fan shroud pop it on the Mishimoto
radiator<00:04:26.620> put<00:04:27.430> it<00:04:27.520> all<00:04:27.610> back<00:04:27.760> in<00:04:28.000> hook<00:04:28.570> back<00:04:28.720> up

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
radiator put it all back in hook back up

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.510 
radiator put it all back in hook back up
all<00:04:29.020> your<00:04:29.050> hoses<00:04:29.290> and<00:04:29.590> you're<00:04:29.710> good<00:04:29.980> to<00:04:30.010> go<00:04:30.250> now

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
all your hoses and you're good to go now

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.100 
all your hoses and you're good to go now
I<00:04:30.730> did<00:04:30.970> pressure<00:04:31.240> test<00:04:31.570> this<00:04:31.750> radiator

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
I did pressure test this radiator

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.930 
I did pressure test this radiator
everything's<00:04:32.590> good<00:04:32.800> no<00:04:33.160> leaks<00:04:33.190> or<00:04:33.640> anything

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
everything's good no leaks or anything
