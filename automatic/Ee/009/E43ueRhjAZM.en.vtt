00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.880 
two chips connect to lift up the chips
as<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.460> push<00:01:08.670> them<00:01:08.820> together<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.680> you<00:01:10.680> push

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
them together they're going to weave

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.350 
them together they're going to weave
into<00:01:13.260> each<00:01:13.590> other<00:01:16.580> when<00:01:17.580> starting<00:01:17.940> out<00:01:18.060> just

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
into each other when starting out just

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.240 
into each other when starting out just
practice<00:01:18.780> with<00:01:18.960> four<00:01:19.200> chips<00:01:19.530> two<00:01:20.010> in<00:01:20.130> each

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
practice with four chips two in each

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.390 
practice with four chips two in each
stack<00:01:21.110> once<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.229> can<00:01:22.380> successfully<00:01:22.830> complete

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
stack once you can successfully complete

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.820 
stack once you can successfully complete
that<00:01:24.020> increase<00:01:25.020> your<00:01:25.200> chip<00:01:25.410> stack<00:01:27.830> we're

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
that increase your chip stack we're

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.469 
that increase your chip stack we're
going<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.010> add<00:01:29.130> two<00:01:29.160> more<00:01:29.550> chips<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> stack

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
going to add two more chips on the stack

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.560 
going to add two more chips on the stack
so<00:01:31.080> we're<00:01:31.260> shuffling<00:01:31.440> six<00:01:31.979> chips<00:01:32.310> now<00:01:32.570> three

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
so we're shuffling six chips now three

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.020 
so we're shuffling six chips now three
and<00:01:33.690> three

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.260 

just<00:01:40.690> like<00:01:40.840> that

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.429 

make<00:01:43.869> sure<00:01:43.899> the<00:01:44.200> chips<00:01:44.469> are<00:01:45.310> stacked<00:01:45.700> evenly

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
make sure the chips are stacked evenly

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.020 
make sure the chips are stacked evenly
using<00:01:47.439> your<00:01:47.740> second<00:01:48.159> and<00:01:48.250> your<00:01:48.310> third<00:01:48.729> finger

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
using your second and your third finger

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.080 
using your second and your third finger
on<00:01:49.329> the<00:01:49.750> far<00:01:49.990> side<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:50.619> your<00:01:50.979> thumb<00:01:51.340> on<00:01:51.579> the

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
on the far side and your thumb on the

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.410 
on the far side and your thumb on the
closed<00:01:52.329> side<00:01:52.659> you're<00:01:53.670> gently<00:01:54.670> squeezing<00:01:55.329> the

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
closed side you're gently squeezing the

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.660 
closed side you're gently squeezing the
chips<00:01:55.659> together<00:01:56.049> so<00:01:57.039> they're<00:01:57.189> firm<00:01:57.429> and

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
chips together so they're firm and

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.660 
chips together so they're firm and
you're<00:01:58.270> using<00:01:58.450> your<00:01:58.689> index<00:01:58.840> finger<00:01:59.469> to<00:02:00.429> lift

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
you're using your index finger to lift

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.719 
you're using your index finger to lift
up<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.240> bottom<00:02:01.630> chip<00:02:01.960> as<00:02:02.549> you're<00:02:03.549> pushing

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
up the bottom chip as you're pushing

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.639 
up the bottom chip as you're pushing
them<00:02:03.969> together<00:02:04.119> to<00:02:04.600> let<00:02:05.020> them<00:02:05.170> fall<00:02:05.409> together

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
them together to let them fall together

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.190 
them together to let them fall together
and<00:02:06.130> then<00:02:07.060> all<00:02:07.179> you're<00:02:07.360> doing<00:02:07.569> is<00:02:07.659> taking<00:02:07.840> your

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
and then all you're doing is taking your

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.050 
and then all you're doing is taking your
second<00:02:09.129> and<00:02:09.190> third<00:02:09.280> finger<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:09.940> your<00:02:10.000> thumb

second and third finger and your thumb
and<00:02:10.539> squeezing<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.530> stack<00:02:11.769> together<00:02:12.989> just<00:02:13.989> as

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
and squeezing the stack together just as

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.720 
and squeezing the stack together just as
if<00:02:14.260> you<00:02:14.290> were<00:02:14.470> shuffling<00:02:15.099> a<00:02:15.280> deck<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.579> cards

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730
