00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.279
 review cool sports car trade ah 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.279
 go 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.350
 but what are we going to do for the beginning ? 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.090
 in Los Santos custom and pump this 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.430
 baby already after that I'm all about you 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.580
 She'll tell me the way it has already 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.890
 There is a video in which I tried and 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.330
 understate and turn over cars and you 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.910
 you can find it on my channel i 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.380
 I will definitely put the link in this video 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.930
 we'll try the same thing too 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:55.480
 stir to give you first compose 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:57.670
 Nngu them so what kind of guys are u 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.370
 this car dumb Glushak you just 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.580
 can not imagine here is the most standard 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.170
 the most normal for me is the coolest 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.110
 if he would be the most expensive i would all 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.920
 stupidly put the rest and not all 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.580
 just crap 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:16.180
 honestly so okay color then spoller 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.440
 what we put a spoiler so we are here 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.320
 in general, all spoilers 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.430
 increase the grip so 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.440
 put the jacks 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.690
 although it does not look very simple 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.020
 spoiler spoiler as not cool but 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:32.410
 long let it be a turbocharged transmission 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.300
 wheels wheels i will put all-terrain 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.300
 so that you can understate it well 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.140
 naturally bulletproof 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.319
 no bulletproof in no case be impossible 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.119
 set so we have there from tuning yet 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:50.160
 by the way very little upgrade here only 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:54.369
 it turns out through wow you cool 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.840
 for also toned so cool that is 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:01.360
 the guys here both noticed 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:06.100
 except the spoiler and this is what is called 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.929
 Glushakov not more memory and by the way 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.680
 saying this one here come on now if 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.540
 we will choose with you the color to the car 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.959
 notice that this one here is the color that 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.770
 roof and everything else he does not change 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.020
 additional color is nonsense of course 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.260
 some kind of but it really changes that way 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.460
 here is just a line here are these seams 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.170
 let's set them to catch 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.610
 died that is, this is such a nonsense 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.290
 change only the main color here 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.580
 here are all the features are not very 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.860
 cool but you can pick italic 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.010
 but you can pick up something like that 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.190
 a combination of black although I practically 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.930
 all cars tune the combination 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.930
 black and anything else here 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.510
 I will put such and nacre naturally 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.910
 that's so cool finally lime green 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.700
 but again lime but here's this layman 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.720
 some sort of calm that is not aggressive on 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.160
 relaxed checks 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.790
 and put the wheels black cool 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.460
 cool of course these clutches awful figs with 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.440
 them so guys but let's a little bit 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.580
 go for a start, I'll tell you all 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.410
 her characteristics guys and 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.910
 the characteristics on your screen let me 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:23.710
 I read them the speed of 8.21 100 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.240
 acceleration exactly eight braking 2.67 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.160
 and traction that is 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.720
 manageability 8 point three hundred i.e. 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.370
 guys is very cool 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.030
 characteristics it is really very very 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.620
 well peppy I would even say it is 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.770
 especially he has really good 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.140
 management although it is very low by itself 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.420
 imagine a car and it even happens that 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.280
 she does n't have very little speed 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.070
 It turns out to call on the curb 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.550
 funny sometimes it is understandable 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.690
 her gasoline engine 6 pass 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.940
 understeer like almost any 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.360
 supercar 40 that is it as a whole 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:05.350
 it is normally bought online 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.240
 for 650 thousand and you can sell it 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.610
 then by santos custom if you donâ€™t 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.380
 tuning valya that is just naked if 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.380
 you suddenly need money that they can be 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.370
 will sell for 390 thousand this too 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:22.000
 pretty good 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:24.420
 and and this car it is assembled from ssc 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.550
 tuatara 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:32.290
 ferrari enzo ferrari fxx what else 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.100
 car I do not know what kind of car gta 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:39.680
 spano and pagani zonda that is guys and 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.420
 Can you imagine this car? 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.460
 which is now on your screens 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:49.010
 it was assembled from 1 2 3 4 out of 5 cars and you 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.490
 imagine that is from real life 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.220
 took 5 points and stuffed it all 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.590
 in this car and get this here 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.240
 a piece that is guys a car with quite good ones 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.020
 characteristics even I would say 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.130
 funny 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.860
 and let's in general now I quickly 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.900
 I'll shoot the wheels oh no mice not 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.000
 confused something let's generally eat and 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.490
 with employee and understated minimum and 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.800
 let's go overturn cars and and the old 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.020
 I will finish you cool brother now I will 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.220
 I will show you how to make this car a flipper 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.290
 im so that this car could 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.000
 throw on their cars they flew away 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.000
 somewhere in the sky that is she 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.800
 becomes like some kind of 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.390
 even springboard for the rest of the machines 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.520
 when you are good at overclocking they can 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.410
 very epic cool fly and come on 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.360
 Now let's move to the military base 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.050
 probably because it will be very cool all 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.330
 see this 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.310
 guys all I got here at the military base 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.960
 here is very cool ride in general 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.540
 look how I turn everything around 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.940
 and I am generally very awesome, I even 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.590
 I think the record is great which individuals 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.200
 about thirty minutes I rode here 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.850
 maybe even be with my face 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.400
 tell you just going to ride 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.660
 ugorat well because very cool and 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.490
 I'm really having fun 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.320
 liked very well okay not the point 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.960
 let's think about it 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.080
 buy this car online and here 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.990
 In general, well , firstly with respect to 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.700
 in terms of speed, I think you are with me 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.340
 agree she is slower than pegassi 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:16.490
 zentorno slower than about gentle 20 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:19.940
 slower than pegassi osiris slower 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.190
 than entity xf in slower even than adr 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.520
 that's really slower than all these machines 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.350
 that somewhere 7 give where 6 turned out 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.630
 guys she really will be slower then 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.280
 there is a race for the race this car is not 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.280
 take it because it's really weaker 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.500
 the rest but she's pretty good 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.570
 control but in any case no one 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:42.110
 I advise that is better guys all the same on 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:44.030
 race and not take but this car has 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.800
 cool awesome feature that you now 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.630
 I show that it can really 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.660
 become a springboard for the rest 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.520
 machines and 20 them up then 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.830
 online it will be very cool yes guys 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.690
 this glitch works online 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.220
 I told you everything completely 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.400
 leave a link in the description again 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.810
 telling you this is this very real 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.340
 cool meaning you can with friends 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.390
 have fun for example take such three 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:09.150
 cars and ride by just 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:12.490
 turn over all other cars 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.680
 awesome actually turns out here 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.380
 as you can see, and I tried with friends 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.510
 three just very very cool fucking 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.060
 have fun so be sure to try 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.280
 worth 650000 from the car so I think 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.630
 it's a little bit well and more about it in general 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.880
 tell anything in the race and not 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.530
 take therefore only around the city in 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.180
 online ride is a lot of fun but 

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:34.090
 on this i think guys complete the video 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.070
 Thank you all for watching and probably 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.810
 video will come out all the same as I will be on it 

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:41.670
 just roll and turn everything and 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:46.870
 all all guys thanks for watching so far

 the sky is our first house first thing first 

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:59.170
