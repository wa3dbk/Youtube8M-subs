00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 my friends so what's up is roger 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.929
 Welcome to a new role 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.420
 minecraft war experience on the vest 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.219
 on the compost but and yes we people 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.230
 play again a quick fire games 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.490
 and let's see how the whole thing goes 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.010
 I would like to try 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.420
 this round one or the other kill 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.480
 to do more just like that again 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.740
 new small gross speed round out 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:40.649
 and go off pretty well 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:50.870
 In any case, that's what I'll take 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:53.039
 not much fun made me me 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.660
 round course is about to play and it does 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.079
 Just super fun just everything 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.670
 minecraft s class and now i'm dying 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.149
 of course again because I caught you 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.160
 will 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.059
 so minecraft fun makes my friends 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.059
 and yes 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.140
 that goes off 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.960
 minecraft exotic the demolition on the 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.370
 server and yes that's my more 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.930
 took a shot try something here 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.570
 tear and I just hope that it 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.760
 This time works and I have a lot of fun 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.710
 have no in this round that is up 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.790
 every case works and everything goes well 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.590
 that's possible until now 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.270
 really fresh I do not know when 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.890
 how long ago it has been me for so long 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.630
 needed for a recording in 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.500
 So minecraft has been around for a long time 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.420
 again so long ago that I am here 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.530
 really sentences for a video and no 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.250
 I do not know how many recordings I try 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.470
 already behind me 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.229
 So-called otherwise this is actually markus 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.330
 I go in already is a good round 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.770
 that is , and then, of course, too 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.500
 already uploaded but today is 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.360
 it somehow completely different I need 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.080
 so much recording car comes down that 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.520
 is not so I need so many 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.010
 Trying to try this is easy 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.650
 But it's annoying 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.940
 so i wanted to appeal that i exactly 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.530
 on friday I had streamed and 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.330
 Real people thank you so much 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.590
 they have one or the other on me 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.510
 Follow twitter and be active there 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.580
 I got streamed and me 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.810
 had the highest time you have 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.540
 So someone chat, I did not 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.390
 but of course what has so 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.820
 someone wrote that I have 80 spectators 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.290
 I did not see that, but it did 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.489
 were really blatant many people here 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:33.140
 and that is someone who is not bad 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:36.019
 is and is very nice but is on 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.200
 every case is driving correctly 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.810
 thank you 80 spectators old right 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.519
 So what's the meaning of sick? 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.840
 but for me that's it 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.160
 Extremely much and I wanted to 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.160
 this one again very cordially 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.190
 thank all the people at the start 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.900
 were and did not know it was already 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.690
 really many and also in the chat was 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.760
 written correctly and were all active 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.930
 always right frogs and all nice and 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.459
 so really cool thank you for 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.310
 The stream joulex was also there 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.989
 and has streamed with and has too 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.019
 Have fun and we have there 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.880
 maybe already over 21 projects us 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.640
 entertain that come in a future 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.040
 new line has and so we are in 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.540
 deathmatch as a small troll mcs against 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.690
 me okay i'm pretty full 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.970
 we think that for the whole 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:27.240
 baked and so patzak zack zack 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.490
 he probably yes, unfortunately I still have one 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.310
 I can not describe chat because of that 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.840
 but that's exactly what it is 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.400
 we make the short cut and see each other 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.410
 then right in the second round again 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.990
 so that always back on the 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.330
 second map pack and I wanted too 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.310
 show my places again very briefly 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.630
 there you see it I am now 17th place 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.520
 and may not be there much longer 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.160
 that lasts for an extremely long time 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.680
 you rise in the square but I can do that 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.180
 So I'm assuming that it will be soon 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.950
 as far as I could be now 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.110
 in the near future even more sentences that 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.720
 I might soon be the top 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.830
 Could reach 10 and then it will 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.390
 probably on my channel 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.520
 then a video but I come 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.930
 Just wanted to show it because it feels 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.610
 I always ask or many 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.340
 Do not you know Mr Kreisky's place 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.480
 two top 20 and couscous further about that 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.040
 I just showed it again 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.300
 so many on the 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.700
 be up to date and know 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.900
 so there is celebrated because you can 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:24.030
 natural cleanup times very briefly so 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:28.130
 Shit the tempo was not bad 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:32.060
 but now we have you oh you are 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.060
 the eifel comes running from behind 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.960
 good that there is a perfect and he has me 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.030
 not to speak that was not 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.640
 everything I wanted to tell you are 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.380
 a little brave can as a year of 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.510
 case 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.310
 he's thankful for that because we're leaving 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.270
 quickly remove again 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.080
 rob I think so well and yes then can 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.669
 I still appeal 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.650
 I am now clear again 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.640
 currently, forcing him to know prime 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.770
 maybe one or the other of 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.480
 I have already come on twitter 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.860
 had posted and smells so correct 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.270
 clear sound page is now always down 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.770

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.080

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.670

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.630
 who cares just go on it 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.870
 you can also have a look if you are 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.230
 want 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:16.280

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.170
 now the days a new episode 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.990

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.160

 I know I should say that 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.680
 Guess I can do that and come 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.440
 we want the episode with destination 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.640

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.340
 do not say exactly 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.810
 Two could win with it, and I with all 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.360
 but that's exactly what it was 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.950
 everything she wanted to address and 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.870
