 the best the update only some 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.390
 weeks or a few months or a month the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.890
 I really do not know and when this video came out 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.480
 I already had it ready but as a 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.960
 washing a little bad from the throat not 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.519
 could you bring them then good 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.440
 repaired the bucs to this new 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.309
 update that I had added 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.309
 new things 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.690
 and I think that nothing else did that to them 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.239
 he did not add so much not 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.760
 they added fences and do not follow things 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.590
 I think nothing more then fences 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.320
 good if you have a little free time 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.510
 and they want to play something they want 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.310

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.030
 little bit more decoration stuff 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.979
