00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is an ETZ 250... Don't laugh, you idiot!
And the thing is that the front isn't ETZ.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
There is an MZ telescope, you can see it, because the former owner
had no money to a brake disc oil hydraulics...

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
How do we call it, Lacus?
The problem is that I have hangover and I can't speak, so...

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
With the brake slave cylinder were some problems
and he had no money to have repaired

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and he rather changed the whole thing on a complete MZ
first telescope with tire, so you can see it.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This is why drumbrake is on the front and not like it's usual
on ETZs, cause these have usually brake disc.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And the man was so creative and enthusiastic that
he made an Enduro from this ETZ.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Why is it an Enduro? Cause the tailpipe isn't manufacturing,
its ending is sporty as you can see it there

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and it has a weird rubber that is for rough road, cause
the former owner used it on rough road.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But then he didn't use it for a long time cause of a heart attack
and he said that it's too much for him and he rather sold it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But supposedly the motor was recently completely or partially renewed.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Here we can see a new seat cover, he repainted it fairly,
altough I'd not call it nice, but he repainted it.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It has a Pioneer sticker too, but I really don't understand it
and the pluggings were changed in the engine bottom end in order not to leak the oil.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Plus it has a few tuning, I show it on the dashboard, if I can call it this way.
We can't see here a speedometer, but we have a rev-counter...

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
(- The brake? - Oh, I won't forget about it, you do not expect!)

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We have a temperature indicator, that has a sonda, it is visible here.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It's good for the kids like Lacus,
cause when they race like hell, the needle shows the problem

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and then they have to stop a little bit or else the plug will be cooked.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We have here a charge-indicator device, if you switch it on, you can see it.
Now it's 12 volt in it, this is good for us. All of the lamps light.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And the brakelight not just lights, it plays music too.
It has no direction indicator, but this isn't a big problem. We have the switch on it.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The lamps are working. Dare we switch it on from the charge?
I'm not sure it will visible. But it is. So all of the lamps are working.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Fuel cock is good, the carburetor too. You can see here, the brake switch is a
little bit tuned, because in factory defaults it looks like in the barrel is a switch,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that usually goes bad. Not the switch is that goes bad,
it gets dirty and doesn't work anymore.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So this is here a little bit different.
The brake plays the music finely.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Lacus, let's start up this beautiful 250 for a while!
It would have succeeded, but Lacus was partying till late night and...

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:23.000
You can see here the rev, right? ...yes. There is no speedometer,
plus you can see that the charge indicator is changing depending on the rev.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Let's go with it!
Wait, wait, I come too.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
- Do you sit on it?
- Sure.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Wait! But very carefully!

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
We're so fallin over, fuck!
- If I'm driving, we won't.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
This is a tree in front of us!
- It's beside us.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So, it's going perfectly. Otherwise there is something with the shift, cause I don't
feel the difference between the degrees, but it shifts great and it doesn't...

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Hey, I'd rather not stay up here!
Lacus, Lacus!

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
- We're going down, don't worry.
- Geez, fuck it! Shit!

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Do you hear me?! Are you normal? We're gonna die.
- We won't. Until I'm driving, we won't.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
- Upwards?
- Okay. But go slow.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
- Upwards we need full gas.
- We don't need it.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
- Of course we do, it picks up the first tire.
- No, cause, I want to survive.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Are you stupid? Here upwards? Geez!
Slow down, we're gonna die!

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Fuck you!
- It's running.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000
What? Shit.
Slow down! Fine, I'm getting off.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
It's too much for me, for my age, plus I have hangover.
Shut it off!

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Ouch, I survived!

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Okay, I'm going to puke.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So the ETZ is fine, Attila starts dissassembling it.
The parts will be on the internet soon.
