00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
a wall ever again so what's the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.060 
a wall ever again so what's the
technology<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.050> that's<00:00:55.469> kind<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.739> powering

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
technology that that's kind of powering

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.500 
technology that that's kind of powering
that<00:00:56.250> where's<00:00:56.430> what's<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.149> said<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.390> was<00:00:57.480> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
that where's what's is you said it was a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.720 
that where's what's is you said it was a
fuel<00:00:58.079> cell<00:00:58.230> butane<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.070> core<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.699> core

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
fuel cell butane the core the core

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.520 
fuel cell butane the core the core
technology<00:01:00.600> inside<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.199> were<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.350> take

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
technology inside if you were to take

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.049 
technology inside if you were to take
this<00:01:01.710> off<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.100> look<00:01:02.250> inside<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.940> would

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
this off and look inside you would

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.570 
this off and look inside you would
actually<00:01:03.180> see<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.870> power<00:01:04.229> chip<00:01:04.860> what<00:01:05.280> we<00:01:05.369> call<00:01:05.549> a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
actually see a power chip what we call a

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.969 
actually see a power chip what we call a
silicon<00:01:06.180> power<00:01:06.420> cell<00:01:06.900> what<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.530> actually<00:01:07.950> is

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
silicon power cell what that actually is

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.179 
silicon power cell what that actually is
is<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.880> very<00:01:09.240> small<00:01:09.590> solid<00:01:10.590> oxide<00:01:11.159> fuel

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
is it's a very small solid oxide fuel

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.580 
is it's a very small solid oxide fuel
cell<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.360> very<00:01:12.659> advanced<00:01:13.020> technology

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
cell it's a very advanced technology

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.920 
cell it's a very advanced technology
that<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.799> worked<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.189> at<00:01:14.520> MIT<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.810> we've

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
that we worked on at MIT and that we've

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.440 
that we worked on at MIT and that we've
commercialized<00:01:16.560> into<00:01:16.920> our<00:01:17.070> product<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.790> so

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
commercialized into our product and so

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.340 
commercialized into our product and so
she<00:01:18.509> said<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.720> were<00:01:18.810> working<00:01:18.900> with<00:01:19.080> with

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
she said you were working with with

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.740 
she said you were working with with
intel<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.250> pact<00:01:20.549> yeah<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.270> intel

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
intel on that on that pact yeah so intel

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.780 
intel on that on that pact yeah so intel
actually<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.259> helping<00:01:22.650> us<00:01:22.770> manufacture<00:01:23.580> these

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
actually is helping us manufacture these

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.999 
actually is helping us manufacture these
silicon<00:01:24.270> power<00:01:24.479> cells<00:01:24.869> which<00:01:25.290> go<00:01:25.470> inside<00:01:25.860> and

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
silicon power cells which go inside and

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.460 
silicon power cells which go inside and
what<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.610> silicon<00:01:27.000> power<00:01:27.150> cell<00:01:27.570> does<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.229> it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
what the silicon power cell does is it

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.980 
what the silicon power cell does is it
extracts<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.280> fuel<00:01:29.729> from<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.150> cartridge<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
extracts the fuel from the cartridge and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.109 
extracts the fuel from the cartridge and
that's<00:01:31.560> butane<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.790> could<00:01:32.909> be<00:01:33.000> any

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
that's butane but it could be any

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.330 
that's butane but it could be any
hydrocarbon<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.900> could<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.140> methanol<00:01:34.950> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
hydrocarbon it could be methanol it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.730 
hydrocarbon it could be methanol it
could<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.909> butanol<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.079> could<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.290> anything<00:01:37.470> of

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
could be butanol it could be anything of

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.740 
could be butanol it could be anything of
that<00:01:37.770> nature<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.670> butane<00:01:39.060> everybody<00:01:39.509> knows

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
that nature but butane everybody knows

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.120 
that nature but butane everybody knows
it's<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> same<00:01:40.530> stuff<00:01:40.740> that's<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.040> your

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
it's the same stuff that's in your

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.160 
it's the same stuff that's in your
cigarette<00:01:41.490> lighter<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.960> very

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
cigarette lighter and it's very

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.889 
cigarette lighter and it's very
convenient<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.790> goes<00:01:45.030> into<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.659> device

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
convenient and that goes into the device

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.039 
convenient and that goes into the device
and<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.649> convert<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.579> butane<00:01:48.270> into

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
and we convert that butane into

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.840 
and we convert that butane into
electricity<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.829> then<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.250> power<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
electricity and then we power a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.780 
electricity and then we power a
cellphone<00:01:51.659> with<00:01:51.899> it

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
cellphone with it

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.660 
cellphone with it
the<00:01:54.390> exhaust<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.900> that<00:01:55.050> exhaust<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.160> there<00:01:56.370> any

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the exhaust is that exhaust is there any

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.850 
the exhaust is that exhaust is there any
issue<00:01:56.850> with<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.090> no<00:01:57.330> actually<00:01:57.870> the<00:01:58.620> exhaust

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
issue with that no actually the exhaust

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.240 
issue with that no actually the exhaust
