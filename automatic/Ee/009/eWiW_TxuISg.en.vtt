 silkworm breeding alternative production with huge response 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.600
 economic 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.330
 Sericulture known in China for more than five thousand years extended 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.240
 for Asia and then in Europe covers the production of raw silk through 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.090
 Chinese silkworm breeding is the main source of silk production 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.929
 natural 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:24.989
 and in America, Brazil is considered the most advanced 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:26.999
 product 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.799
 lasheras urges a fiber produced by the salivary gland is from the worm 

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:37.809
 Insect silk that is characterized by pure elaborate unique evra very required 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:39.660
 for the textile industry 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.520
 the volute cycle of the silkworm is fulfilled in approximately two months 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.580
 The ideal food is made with bids of the mulberry essential element that 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.730
 the being and the cultor must exist an erp because of the close link that he has for 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.750
 avoid the roles in production 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.340
 in three and four days the construction of the cocoons culminates 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.830
 characterized by constituting a kilo with you 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.070
 once finished the silkworm enters a process of metamorphosis 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.729
 going from the state of larva to chrysalis 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.310
 the silk cocoons are marketed at values ​​that vary according to their 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.310
 quality and are quoted in dollars per kilogram 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.890
 the optimal thing is to produce and what silk from the cocoon for it is 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.730
 necessary to have cradle and side the premium you want for and the small rapa 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.990
 scale in order to manufacture customarily low in our country is 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.500
 proposed the silkworm and the cocoons with relative divine however it is 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.570
 It is convenient to boost their growth because the global demand is very 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.060
 superior to the global offer 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.329
 The secret is to achieve a better quality product 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.049
 silkworm breeding high economic response
