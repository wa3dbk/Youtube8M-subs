 messenger 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:14.190
 tokidoki itself. von let's do the test of visibility in the sun 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.679
 comparing samsung galaxy s2 i htc sensation 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:21.729
 I'm trying to put in which nation such that 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.470
 not because you see reflections of other things as it happened 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.539
 in the past 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.569
 at this moment we have the brightness in both automatically 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.240
 excuse the movements we go to put it 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.400
 at most we see what happens 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.460
 display 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.400
 display 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.210
 brightness 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.290
 music 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.370
 let's put 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.920
 at most 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.260
 here did not go a maximum of one second 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.430
 ok maximum here maximum here 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.889
 which then 

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.760
 a moment he has another 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.530
 energy saving we are going to remove now we return to the main screen 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.550
 we see the visibility of both 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.010
 many reflections on the slcd 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.250
 definitely primitive 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.390
 the superamoled plus we have better visibility in the sun we also try to 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.250
 exchange them 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.890
 we see if the changing situation remains so we see one 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.730
 page 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.600
 the whites go 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.600
 for example in messages 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.700
 in the black and white excuse me 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 at this point we go directly to the internet 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.550
 ok 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.250
 the second is nervous. 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.060
 sorry I'm managing to keep in focus 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.670
 the second child in loading bookmarks 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.890
 we see that he runs on the balcony 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.880
 we see the pages of a second that is also loading the sensation 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.850
 moment of patience 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.710
 we have good visibility 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.690
 in the white of the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.710
 samsung galaxy s2 still revenue 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.189
 the sensation 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:11.570
 unfortunately this is a man 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.789
 I'm not a bit dark though 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.839
 about the 3 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:18.769
 ok we opened 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.329
 as you can see, let's try again to switch places so that we don't 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:23.459
 we have then 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.819
 problems of sorts but see that 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.119
 - I cry out loud 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:31.200
 from the video camera millet seed 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.489
 the samsung galaxy s2 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.090
 live I would say that they are quite on the same level 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.659
 we have down again 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:45.059
 it is a little to scroll the pages 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.589
 rate to me seems to improve visibility to is super amoled 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.090
 in the best contrast 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.019
 then you will tell me too 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.969
 and with this we have concluded a very short time
