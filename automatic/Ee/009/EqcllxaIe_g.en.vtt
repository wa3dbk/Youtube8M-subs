00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.780
 super-g water cheap 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.850
 so use the hour only 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.910
 so that use Euro 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.740

 also something it is 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 but that requires Catholics to be the case 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.970

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:08.349
 Neighboring 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.349
 after over 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.409
