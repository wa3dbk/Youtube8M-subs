00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.639 
made so much sense to me doing Isagenix
and<00:01:48.060> with<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.600> under<00:01:48.899> nature<00:01:49.170> protein

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
and with the the under nature protein

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.679 
and with the the under nature protein
and<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.829> flawless<00:01:50.159> beautiful<00:01:50.939> protein<00:01:51.509> that

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
and the flawless beautiful protein that

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.230 
and the flawless beautiful protein that
we<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.380> our<00:01:52.500> shakes<00:01:52.970> along<00:01:53.970> with<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
we have in our shakes along with the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.670 
we have in our shakes along with the
cleansing<00:01:54.600> process<00:01:55.340> when<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.460> lose

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
cleansing process when we lose

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.160 
cleansing process when we lose
we're<00:01:58.680> not<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:59.369> losing<00:01:59.610> weight<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.570> that's

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
we're not just losing weight and that's

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.200 
we're not just losing weight and that's
why<00:02:01.320> when<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.649> do<00:02:01.979> all<00:02:02.100> those<00:02:02.250> other<00:02:02.430> diets<00:02:02.880> to

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
why when you do all those other diets to

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.020 
why when you do all those other diets to
HCG<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.960> name<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.350> when<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.280> lose<00:02:05.490> weight

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
HCG you name it when you lose weight

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.779 
HCG you name it when you lose weight
usually<00:02:06.720> your<00:02:06.869> metabolism<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:08.459> lose<00:02:08.640> your

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
usually your metabolism you lose your

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.430 
usually your metabolism you lose your
metabolism<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:09.869> that's<00:02:09.989> why<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.380> many

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
metabolism to and that's why so many

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.550 
metabolism to and that's why so many
people<00:02:11.060> yo<00:02:12.060> yo<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.569> why<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:12.930> many<00:02:13.050> people<00:02:13.170> gain

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
people yo yo and why so many people gain

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.080 
people yo yo and why so many people gain
more<00:02:13.739> weight<00:02:13.800> than<00:02:14.069> they<00:02:14.220> lost<00:02:14.459> originally

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
more weight than they lost originally

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.050 
more weight than they lost originally
but<00:02:15.810> on<00:02:15.930> isagenix<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:17.550> gain<00:02:17.790> lean<00:02:18.030> muscle

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
but on isagenix you you gain lean muscle

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.850 
but on isagenix you you gain lean muscle
when<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.690> lose<00:02:18.870> weight<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.349> that's<00:02:19.560> why<00:02:19.800> you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
when you lose weight and that's why you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.290 
when you lose weight and that's why you
know<00:02:20.190> some<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.610> guys<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.819> get<00:02:21.120> really

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
you're building lean muscle and the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.550 
you're building lean muscle and the

metabolism<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.260> for<00:02:31.530> me<00:02:31.739> at<00:02:31.950> 42<00:02:32.760> years

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
metabolism and that for me at 42 years

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.300 
metabolism and that for me at 42 years
old<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.450> noticed<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.290> huge<00:02:34.560> difference<00:02:34.650> in<00:02:35.190> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
whole body functioned within 30 days you

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.190 
whole body functioned within 30 days you
know<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.650> year<00:02:40.739> ago<00:02:41.069> starting<00:02:42.060> Isagenix<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.810> my

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
know a year ago starting Isagenix and my

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.130 
know a year ago starting Isagenix and my
metabolism<00:02:43.590> was<00:02:44.549> cranking<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.239> I've<00:02:45.510> I'm<00:02:45.930> not

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
metabolism was cranking and I've I'm not

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.620 
metabolism was cranking and I've I'm not
blessed<00:02:46.440> genetically<00:02:47.180> with<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.390> good

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
blessed genetically with a good

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.440 
blessed genetically with a good
metabolism<00:02:48.900> or<00:02:49.470> good<00:02:49.799> genes<00:02:50.160> as<00:02:50.459> far<00:02:50.640> as<00:02:50.790> fat

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
metabolism or good genes as far as fat

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.309 
metabolism or good genes as far as fat
holding<00:02:52.200> on<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.350> fat<00:02:52.560> goes<00:02:52.799> so<00:02:53.959> my<00:02:54.959> metabolism

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
holding on to fat goes so my metabolism

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.979 
holding on to fat goes so my metabolism
is<00:02:55.830> in<00:02:56.010> high<00:02:56.190> gear<00:02:56.220> these<00:02:56.730> days<00:02:57.000> because<00:02:57.269> when

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
we have lean muscle in our bodies were

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.080 
we have lean muscle in our bodies were
able<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.569> crank<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:01.140> lot<00:03:01.709> better<00:03:01.859> so<00:03:02.730> for<00:03:03.000> those
