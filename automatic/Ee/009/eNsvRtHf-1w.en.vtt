even though that's probably bad and yeah
I<00:01:09.740> was<00:01:10.740> thinking<00:01:11.040> about<00:01:11.070> going<00:01:11.340> up<00:01:11.580> with<00:01:11.729> one

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
I was thinking about going up with one

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.200 
I was thinking about going up with one
more<00:01:12.360> size<00:01:12.630> has<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:14.070> seemed<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> bigger<00:01:15.119> I

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
more size has it seemed like a bigger I

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.109 
more size has it seemed like a bigger I
go<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.409> smaller<00:01:16.830> kits<00:01:17.490> or<00:01:17.670> doesn't<00:01:17.909> seem

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
go like the smaller kits or doesn't seem

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.990 
go like the smaller kits or doesn't seem
as<00:01:18.299> big<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:19.500> then<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.740> realized<00:01:20.189> tunnels<00:01:20.729> make

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
as big but then I realized tunnels make

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.840 
as big but then I realized tunnels make
it<00:01:21.390> look<00:01:21.920> like<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.490> think<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.820> a

it look like this I I think you have a
plug<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.240> can't<00:01:24.420> really<00:01:24.570> tell<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.259> size

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
plug you can't really tell like the size

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.620
