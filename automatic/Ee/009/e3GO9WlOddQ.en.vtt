00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.550 
um locations and you will be able to get
a<00:00:21.539> hundred<00:00:21.660> percent<00:00:21.810> as<00:00:22.109> long<00:00:22.230> as<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.410> have

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
a hundred percent as long as you have

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.230

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
caught up yet then go check out the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.470 
caught up yet then go check out the
other<00:00:25.980> four<00:00:26.310> parts<00:00:26.699> below<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
other four parts below in the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.509 
other four parts below in the
description<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.199> today<00:00:28.980> I'm<00:00:29.189> gonna<00:00:29.340> be

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
description and today I'm gonna be

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.030 
description and today I'm gonna be
focusing<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.599> rest<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> map<00:00:31.289> before<00:00:31.800> I

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
focusing on the rest of the map before I

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.860 
focusing on the rest of the map before I
have<00:00:32.340> done<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.700> whole<00:00:32.880> city<00:00:33.239> because<00:00:33.690> that's

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
have done the whole city because that's

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.020 
have done the whole city because that's
where<00:00:34.079> most<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.410> them<00:00:34.559> are<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.610> time<00:00:35.880> I'm

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
where most of them are and this time I'm

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.549 
where most of them are and this time I'm
gonna<00:00:36.120> be<00:00:36.300> looking<00:00:36.570> at<00:00:36.660> all<00:00:36.899> corners<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
gonna be looking at all corners of the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.340 
gonna be looking at all corners of the
map<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.040> getting<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.910> last<00:00:39.120> view<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.200> is

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
map and getting the last view so this is

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.780 
map and getting the last view so this is
the<00:00:40.469> first<00:00:40.710> jump<00:00:41.010> all<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.280> them<00:00:41.370> around<00:00:41.460> this

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
the first jump all of them around this

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.090 
the first jump all of them around this
area<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.500> pretty<00:00:43.800> complicated

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
area and this is a pretty complicated

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.770 
area and this is a pretty complicated
area<00:00:44.640> because<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.000> all<00:00:45.120> looks<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> same

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
area because it all looks the same

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.630 
area because it all looks the same
there's<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.500> many<00:00:46.620> different<00:00:47.010> prongs<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.550> you

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
there's so many different prongs and you

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.490 
there's so many different prongs and you
need<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.879> find<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.390> specific<00:00:48.719> one<00:00:49.289> and

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
need to find this specific one and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.630 
need to find this specific one and
you're<00:00:49.829> gonna<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.160> jump<00:00:50.309> over<00:00:50.610> that

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
you're gonna have to jump over that

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.270 
you're gonna have to jump over that
train<00:00:51.270> track<00:00:51.570> there<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.140> over<00:00:52.829> them<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
train track there and over them to the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.549 
train track there and over them to the
road<00:00:53.489> basically<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.629> need<00:00:54.840> quite<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> long

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
road basically you need quite a long

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.959 
road basically you need quite a long
run-up<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.160> unless<00:00:56.430> you're<00:00:56.730> using

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
run-up for this unless you're using

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.420 
run-up for this unless you're using
quite<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> fast<00:00:57.570> car<00:00:57.840> which<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.199> found<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.340> you

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
quite a fast car which I found so you

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.770 
quite a fast car which I found so you
need<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.670> hit<00:00:59.760> just<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> left<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.600> that

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
need to hit just to the left of that

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.810 
need to hit just to the left of that
wind<00:01:01.020> turbine<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:02.039> off<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> edge<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.640> that

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
wind turbine just off the edge of that

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.299 
wind turbine just off the edge of that
and<00:01:03.030> as<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:04.019> see<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.619> below<00:01:04.830> me<00:01:05.100> here

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
and as you can see just below me here

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.370 
and as you can see just below me here
there's<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.700> train<00:01:06.060> track<00:01:06.420> there<00:01:06.750> if<00:01:07.200> you

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
there's that train track there if you

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.410 
there's that train track there if you
clip<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> fail<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.060> if<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.270> can

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
clip that it is a fail so if you can

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.030 
clip that it is a fail so if you can
land<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.869> jump<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.380> works<00:01:10.590> out<00:01:10.830> fine

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
land on that jump that works out fine

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.000 
land on that jump that works out fine
and<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.000> one<00:01:12.210> jump<00:01:12.450> already<00:01:12.720> done<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and that is one jump already done so the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.710 
and that is one jump already done so the
second<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:14.610> across<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> road<00:01:15.450> you've

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
second is just across the road you've

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.510 
second is just across the road you've
just<00:01:15.930> jumped<00:01:16.140> from<00:01:16.409> here<00:01:16.680> over<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> railroad

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
just jumped from here over the railroad

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.030 
just jumped from here over the railroad
and<00:01:18.030> onto<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:18.960> road<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.500> need<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.950> be

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and onto this road so you need to be

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.190 
and onto this road so you need to be
facing<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.580> other<00:01:20.610> way<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.900> off<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
facing the other way and just off the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.780 
facing the other way and just off the
side<00:01:22.409> here<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.860> see<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> small<00:01:23.400> patch

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
side here you can see that a small patch

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.240 
side here you can see that a small patch
of<00:01:23.820> mud<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.450> use<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.080> slow<00:01:25.290> motion<00:01:25.680> here<00:01:25.890> using

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
of mud I use the slow motion here using

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.520 
of mud I use the slow motion here using
Franklin<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.659> don't<00:01:27.930> need<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.290> that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
Franklin you don't need to have that

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.130 
Franklin you don't need to have that
much<00:01:28.740> pace<00:01:29.040> going<00:01:29.310> into<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.880> jump<00:01:30.210> but<00:01:30.810> it

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
much pace going into this jump but it

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.929 
much pace going into this jump but it
does<00:01:31.409> help<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.920> don't<00:01:32.159> even<00:01:32.340> need<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.640> hit<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
does help you don't even need to hit the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.910 
does help you don't even need to hit the
road<00:01:33.119> as<00:01:33.390> long<00:01:33.600> as<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.840> land<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.439> don't

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
road as long as you land it and don't

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.399 
road as long as you land it and don't
hit<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.159> bridge<00:01:35.579> or<00:01:35.850> land<00:01:36.450> too<00:01:36.780> close<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
hit that bridge or land too close to the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.830 
hit that bridge or land too close to the
jump<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.979> works<00:01:38.250> out<00:01:38.400> fine<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> bit

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
jump it works out fine just have a bit

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.109 
jump it works out fine just have a bit
of<00:01:39.869> speed<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.310> two<00:01:41.579> jumps<00:01:41.939> down

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
of speed and that is two jumps down

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.359 
of speed and that is two jumps down
eight<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.049> go

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
eight to go

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.950 
eight to go
so<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.640> jump<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.270> last<00:01:45.479> jump<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.810> this

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
so this jump is the last jump in this

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.469 
so this jump is the last jump in this
small<00:01:46.259> area<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:48.030> don't<00:01:48.210> want<00:01:48.420> to

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
small area here and you don't want to

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.030 
small area here and you don't want to
follow<00:01:48.689> where<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.320> actually<00:01:49.649> gone<00:01:49.890> you

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
follow where this is actually gone you

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.679 
follow where this is actually gone you
want<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.220> come<00:01:50.310> off<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.460> from<00:01:51.030> here<00:01:51.390> where

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
want to come off just from here where

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.840 
want to come off just from here where
there<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> house<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.770> there<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.610> jump

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
there is a house and there is the jump

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.490 
there is a house and there is the jump
that<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.149> actually<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.450> penitentiary<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.350> in

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that is actually a penitentiary just in

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.590 
that is actually a penitentiary just in
front<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.040> area<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.149> need<00:01:57.479> to

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
front of you this area so you need to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.840 
front of you this area so you need to
find<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:58.049> house<00:01:58.320> behind<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.040> which<00:01:59.369> looks<00:01:59.700> a

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
find that house behind you which looks a

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.179 
find that house behind you which looks a
bit<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.930> then<00:02:01.829> there<00:02:02.070> is

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
bit like this and then there is

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.429 
bit like this and then there is
basically<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:03.149> small<00:02:03.540> grassy<00:02:04.079> hill<00:02:04.290> in

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
basically just a small grassy hill in

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.230 
basically just a small grassy hill in
front<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.610> penitentiary

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
front of you and the penitentiary

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.930 
front of you and the penitentiary
directly<00:02:07.020> below<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.399> so<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.489> need<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.729> pick<00:02:08.819> up

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
directly below it so you need to pick up

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.639 
directly below it so you need to pick up
quite<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> bit<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.450> pace<00:02:09.660> here<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.170> actually

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
quite a bit of pace here I actually

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.380 
quite a bit of pace here I actually
managed<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.160> do<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.430> first<00:02:11.730> time<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.180> does

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
managed to do this first time it does

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.420 
managed to do this first time it does
seem<00:02:12.690> like<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.290> quite<00:02:13.709> an<00:02:13.830> easy<00:02:13.920> job

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
seem like it is quite an easy job

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.709 
seem like it is quite an easy job
there<00:02:14.519> is<00:02:14.609> quite<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.819> large<00:02:15.060> gap<00:02:15.329> between<00:02:15.359> the

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:15.719 
there is quite a large gap between the

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.319 
there is quite a large gap between the
fence<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.290> building<00:02:16.739> but<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.849> problem

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
fence and the building but the problem

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.440 
fence and the building but the problem
is<00:02:18.510> here<00:02:18.810> as<00:02:19.140> soon<00:02:19.560> as<00:02:19.829> you're<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.579> you<00:02:21.299> have

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
is here as soon as you're in you have

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.630 
is here as soon as you're in you have
two<00:02:21.810> stars<00:02:22.170> on<00:02:22.379> you<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.769> there's<00:02:23.069> not<00:02:23.340> much

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
two stars on you and there's not much

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.539 
two stars on you and there's not much
escape<00:02:24.090> there<00:02:24.329> hence<00:02:24.629> why<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> prison<00:02:25.859> but

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
escape there hence why is a prison but

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.069 
escape there hence why is a prison but
not<00:02:26.579> making<00:02:26.939> out<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.269> prison<00:02:27.780> might<00:02:27.930> actually

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
not making out the prison might actually

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.630 
not making out the prison might actually
be<00:02:28.349> one<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.650> best<00:02:28.829> things<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.159> do<00:02:29.459> because

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
be one of the best things to do because

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.309 
be one of the best things to do because
the<00:02:29.939> next<00:02:30.209> jump<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.510> right<00:02:30.719> here<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.109> that<00:02:31.290> is

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
the next jump is right here and that is

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.050 
the next jump is right here and that is
actually<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.829> hospital<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.639> had<00:02:32.790> come<00:02:33.030> to

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
actually the hospital you had come to

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.809 
actually the hospital you had come to
and<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:34.019> is<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.200> jump<00:02:34.560> over<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.950> motel<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:35.730> is

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
and this is a jump over a motel that is

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.640 
and this is a jump over a motel that is
right<00:02:36.090> there<00:02:36.359> so<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:36.900> need<00:02:37.109> to<00:02:37.319> build<00:02:37.469> up

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
right there so you need to build up

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.649 
right there so you need to build up
quite<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.010> lot<00:02:38.219> of<00:02:38.280> pace<00:02:38.459> as<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.849> can<00:02:39.120> see<00:02:39.359> here

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
quite a lot of pace as you can see here

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.569 
quite a lot of pace as you can see here
I've<00:02:40.079> started<00:02:40.349> from<00:02:40.829> just<00:02:41.129> next<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.459> the

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
I've started from just next to the

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.750 
I've started from just next to the
hairdresser's<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.829> the<00:02:43.829> hospital<00:02:44.400> was<00:02:44.489> just

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
hairdresser's and the hospital was just

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.369 
hairdresser's and the hospital was just
on<00:02:44.909> my<00:02:45.000> left<00:02:45.239> there<00:02:45.480> there's<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.989> very<00:02:46.230> small

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
on my left there there's a very small

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.379 
on my left there there's a very small
ramp<00:02:46.859> and<00:02:47.069> if<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.489> is<00:02:47.579> at<00:02:47.730> night<00:02:47.909> it's<00:02:48.150> very

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
ramp and if it is at night it's very

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.449 
ramp and if it is at night it's very
hard<00:02:48.689> to<00:02:48.750> see<00:02:49.019> so<00:02:49.560> I've<00:02:49.680> used<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.950> slow<00:02:50.129> motion

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
hard to see so I've used the slow motion

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.429 
hard to see so I've used the slow motion
here<00:02:50.639> so<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.879> can<00:02:51.030> see<00:02:51.239> it<00:02:51.329> clearer<00:02:51.659> this

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
here so you can see it clearer this

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.020 
here so you can see it clearer this
small<00:02:52.769> bit<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.010> cardboard<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.549> need<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.909> go

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
small bit of cardboard you need to go

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.420 
small bit of cardboard you need to go
over<00:02:54.239> that<00:02:54.599> building<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.290> just<00:02:56.010> land<00:02:56.250> that

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
over that building and just land that

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.339 
over that building and just land that
jump<00:02:56.700> there's<00:02:57.389> quite<00:02:57.689> a<00:02:57.720> lot<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:57.959> space<00:02:58.319> to

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
jump there's quite a lot of space to

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.470 
jump there's quite a lot of space to
land<00:02:58.709> after<00:02:59.099> that<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.519> you<00:02:59.939> should<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.299> able<00:03:00.389> to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
land after that so you should be able to

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.520 
land after that so you should be able to
do<00:03:00.599> it<00:03:00.659> as<00:03:00.750> long<00:03:00.870> as<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.049> have<00:03:01.139> enough<00:03:01.319> speed

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
do it as long as you have enough speed

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.920 
do it as long as you have enough speed
to<00:03:01.590> get<00:03:01.859> over<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.250> motel<00:03:02.639> so<00:03:03.419> the<00:03:03.540> next<00:03:03.689> jump

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
to get over the motel so the next jump

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.659 
to get over the motel so the next jump
is<00:03:04.019> just<00:03:04.290> below<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:04.739> on<00:03:04.889> the<00:03:04.980> map<00:03:05.219> you've

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
is just below this on the map you've

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.879 
is just below this on the map you've
just<00:03:05.969> come<00:03:06.180> from<00:03:06.389> this<00:03:06.689> direction<00:03:06.959> up<00:03:07.409> here<00:03:07.680> so

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
just come from this direction up here so

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.259 
just come from this direction up here so
you<00:03:07.980> just<00:03:08.010> need<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.370> head<00:03:08.549> past<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:09.090> airport

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
you just need to head past the airport

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.470 
you just need to head past the airport
you<00:03:09.959> need<00:03:10.079> to<00:03:10.200> find<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:10.889> road<00:03:11.219> here<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:11.849> head

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
you need to find this road here and head

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.780 
you need to find this road here and head
just<00:03:12.959> south<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.409> it<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.769> there<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.430> small

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
just south of it and there is a small

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.819 
just south of it and there is a small
track<00:03:15.239> that<00:03:15.510> leads<00:03:15.659> to<00:03:15.959> it<00:03:16.079> and<00:03:16.379> with<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.530> rock

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
track that leads to it and with a rock

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.469 
track that leads to it and with a rock
at<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.129> end<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.549> you<00:03:17.909> just<00:03:17.939> need<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.239> make<00:03:18.419> it

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:18.479 
at the end and you just need to make it

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.199 
at the end and you just need to make it
over<00:03:18.810> those<00:03:19.049> big<00:03:19.409> rocks<00:03:19.739> basically<00:03:20.430> there's

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
over those big rocks basically there's

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.210 
over those big rocks basically there's
no<00:03:21.510> distance<00:03:22.019> you<00:03:22.260> need<00:03:22.379> for<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:22.709> as<00:03:22.949> long<00:03:23.129> as

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
no distance you need for this as long as

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.409 
no distance you need for this as long as
you<00:03:23.310> have<00:03:23.400> enough<00:03:23.430> speed<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:23.970> get<00:03:24.060> over<00:03:24.269> this

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
you have enough speed to get over this

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.479 
you have enough speed to get over this
and<00:03:24.709> even<00:03:25.709> though<00:03:25.919> there<00:03:26.069> is<00:03:26.190> an<00:03:26.310> airport

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
and even though there is an airport

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.099 
and even though there is an airport
there<00:03:26.909> you<00:03:27.150> won't<00:03:27.359> get<00:03:27.569> a<00:03:27.599> wanted<00:03:27.959> level

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
there you won't get a wanted level

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.409 
there you won't get a wanted level
because<00:03:28.919> it's<00:03:29.220> just<00:03:29.760> in<00:03:29.939> the<00:03:30.060> middle<00:03:30.090> of

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
because it's just in the middle of

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.240 
because it's just in the middle of
nowhere<00:03:30.689> and<00:03:31.109> I<00:03:31.409> don't<00:03:31.470> think<00:03:31.769> they<00:03:32.010> really

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
nowhere and I don't think they really

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.610 
nowhere and I don't think they really
care<00:03:32.280> about<00:03:32.699> it<00:03:32.909> so<00:03:33.090> that's<00:03:33.479> five<00:03:33.900> jumps<00:03:34.379> down

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
care about it so that's five jumps down

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.640 
care about it so that's five jumps down
five<00:03:35.159> to<00:03:35.400> go<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.879> so<00:03:36.750> far<00:03:37.049> they've<00:03:37.229> all<00:03:37.470> been

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
five to go and so far they've all been

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.189 
five to go and so far they've all been
pretty<00:03:37.979> easy<00:03:38.040> but<00:03:39.000> they<00:03:39.150> do<00:03:39.329> get<00:03:39.569> a<00:03:39.599> bit<00:03:39.780> harder

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
pretty easy but they do get a bit harder

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.679 
pretty easy but they do get a bit harder
as<00:03:40.349> they<00:03:40.620> go<00:03:40.769> on<00:03:40.979> and<00:03:41.189> they<00:03:41.879> do<00:03:41.939> require<00:03:42.180> quite

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:42.689 
as they go on and they do require quite

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:44.240 
as they go on and they do require quite
a<00:03:42.720> lot<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:42.959> travelling<00:03:43.409> as<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.650> can<00:03:43.769> see<00:03:43.979> here

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
a lot of travelling as you can see here

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.219 
a lot of travelling as you can see here
this<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.519> quite<00:03:44.699> a<00:03:44.729> solitary<00:03:45.269> jump<00:03:45.569> so<00:03:46.169> you

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:46.229 
this is quite a solitary jump so you

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.770 
this is quite a solitary jump so you
need<00:03:46.409> to<00:03:46.530> follow<00:03:46.799> this<00:03:47.099> road<00:03:47.459> all<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.849> way<00:03:48.299> and

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
need to follow this road all the way and

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.780 
need to follow this road all the way and
make<00:03:49.290> sure<00:03:49.439> you<00:03:49.560> get<00:03:49.739> off<00:03:49.829> of<00:03:49.859> this<00:03:50.189> bit<00:03:50.489> here

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
make sure you get off of this bit here

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.969 
make sure you get off of this bit here
and<00:03:51.000> just<00:03:51.840> at<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:51.989> end<00:03:52.169> of<00:03:52.290> this<00:03:52.500> there<00:03:52.799> is<00:03:52.859> an

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
and just at the end of this there is an

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.460 
and just at the end of this there is an
S<00:03:53.159> bend<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.879> you<00:03:54.689> just<00:03:54.870> need<00:03:55.049> to<00:03:55.139> hit<00:03:55.349> this

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
S bend and you just need to hit this

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.759 
S bend and you just need to hit this
jump<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:55.889> miss<00:03:56.519> that<00:03:56.819> turn<00:03:57.090> basically<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:58.650> if

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
jump and miss that turn basically so if

00:03:58.769 --> 00:03:59.689 
jump and miss that turn basically so if
you're<00:03:58.919> travelling<00:03:59.280> from<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.519> right

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
you're travelling from the right

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.429 
you're travelling from the right
direction<00:03:59.879> you'll<00:04:00.659> find<00:04:00.930> it<00:04:01.049> quite<00:04:01.169> hard<00:04:01.259> to

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
direction you'll find it quite hard to

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.780 
direction you'll find it quite hard to
miss<00:04:01.620> this<00:04:01.769> jump<00:04:02.069> because<00:04:02.250> there<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.669> S

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
miss this jump because there is the S

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.670 
miss this jump because there is the S
Bend<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.299> you<00:04:03.329> just<00:04:03.629> need<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.870> hit<00:04:04.079> this<00:04:04.319> Rock

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
Bend and you just need to hit this Rock

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.420 
Bend and you just need to hit this Rock
jump<00:04:05.459> over<00:04:05.879> this<00:04:06.090> gap<00:04:06.449> and<00:04:06.750> land<00:04:07.680> on<00:04:07.979> the<00:04:08.280> other

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
jump over this gap and land on the other

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.330 
jump over this gap and land on the other
side<00:04:08.729> so<00:04:09.449> as<00:04:10.139> you<00:04:10.259> can<00:04:10.349> see<00:04:10.409> here<00:04:10.829> I<00:04:11.069> didn't

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
side so as you can see here I didn't

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.679 
side so as you can see here I didn't
actually<00:04:11.519> make<00:04:11.849> it<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.209> whole<00:04:12.419> way<00:04:12.449> across

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.689 
actually make it the whole way across

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:15.409 
actually make it the whole way across
but<00:04:13.379> it<00:04:13.500> still<00:04:13.799> counts<00:04:14.250> so<00:04:14.790> you<00:04:14.849> don't<00:04:15.120> need<00:04:15.299> to

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
but it still counts so you don't need to

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:16.849 
but it still counts so you don't need to
make<00:04:15.569> it<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.840> whole<00:04:15.959> way<00:04:15.989> as<00:04:16.259> long<00:04:16.500> as<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:16.709> can

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
make it the whole way as long as you can

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.190 
make it the whole way as long as you can
survive<00:04:17.220> and

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
survive and

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.890 
survive and
go<00:04:18.620> down<00:04:18.860> that<00:04:19.130> gap<00:04:19.310> as<00:04:20.150> I<00:04:20.360> said<00:04:20.570> this<00:04:20.720> does

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
go down that gap as I said this does

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.570 
go down that gap as I said this does
involve<00:04:21.050> a<00:04:21.260> lot<00:04:21.380> of<00:04:21.410> traveling<00:04:21.860> and<00:04:22.040> if<00:04:22.280> you<00:04:22.400> go

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
involve a lot of traveling and if you go

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.670 
involve a lot of traveling and if you go
back<00:04:22.850> along<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.390> road<00:04:23.540> you<00:04:23.570> came<00:04:23.930> from<00:04:24.230> you

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
back along the road you came from you

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.440 
back along the road you came from you
can<00:04:24.950> find<00:04:25.250> this<00:04:25.370> jump<00:04:25.700> but<00:04:25.850> you<00:04:25.910> do<00:04:26.090> need<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.270> be

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
can find this jump but you do need to be

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.960 
can find this jump but you do need to be
coming<00:04:26.720> from<00:04:26.810> this<00:04:27.110> direction<00:04:27.320> for<00:04:27.800> this<00:04:27.980> as

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
coming from this direction for this as

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.790 
coming from this direction for this as
he<00:04:29.120> gonna<00:04:29.270> be<00:04:29.390> jumping<00:04:29.690> over<00:04:29.780> a<00:04:29.930> small<00:04:30.260> gap<00:04:30.530> and

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
he gonna be jumping over a small gap and

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.190 
he gonna be jumping over a small gap and
avoiding<00:04:31.310> that<00:04:31.490> curve<00:04:31.820> in<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.120> road<00:04:32.300> so<00:04:33.170> I

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
avoiding that curve in the road so I

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.650 
avoiding that curve in the road so I
thought<00:04:33.440> things<00:04:33.650> like<00:04:33.890> quad<00:04:34.220> bikes<00:04:34.520> bikes<00:04:35.270> and

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
thought things like quad bikes bikes and

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.510 
thought things like quad bikes bikes and
buggies<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.410> easiest<00:04:36.710> things<00:04:36.950> to<00:04:37.070> use<00:04:37.340> on

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
buggies the easiest things to use on

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.550 
buggies the easiest things to use on
this<00:04:37.640> dirt<00:04:37.850> track<00:04:38.180> as<00:04:38.420> it<00:04:38.840> does<00:04:39.020> give<00:04:39.230> the<00:04:39.380> best

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
this dirt track as it does give the best

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.770 
this dirt track as it does give the best
turning<00:04:40.010> and<00:04:40.190> you<00:04:40.820> can<00:04:41.060> it<00:04:41.360> doesn't<00:04:41.630> really

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
turning and you can it doesn't really

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.960 
turning and you can it doesn't really
matter<00:04:42.050> with<00:04:42.260> Franklin<00:04:42.770> anyway<00:04:43.130> but<00:04:43.700> that's

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
matter with Franklin anyway but that's

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.000 
matter with Franklin anyway but that's
the<00:04:44.180> jump<00:04:44.420> there<00:04:44.720> as<00:04:44.930> you<00:04:45.290> can<00:04:45.440> see<00:04:45.650> you<00:04:45.800> do

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
the jump there as you can see you do

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.470 
the jump there as you can see you do
need<00:04:46.220> quite<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.460> lot<00:04:46.580> pace<00:04:46.820> and<00:04:46.970> I<00:04:47.060> only<00:04:47.210> just

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
need quite a lot pace and I only just

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.900 
need quite a lot pace and I only just
made<00:04:47.720> it<00:04:47.930> but<00:04:48.350> it<00:04:48.470> still<00:04:48.590> counts<00:04:48.950> as<00:04:49.580> long<00:04:49.790> as

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
made it but it still counts as long as

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.660 
made it but it still counts as long as
you<00:04:50.000> make<00:04:50.150> it<00:04:50.180> it's<00:04:50.750> fine<00:04:51.140> the<00:04:51.830> next<00:04:52.250> jump<00:04:52.460> is

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
you make it it's fine the next jump is

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.000 
you make it it's fine the next jump is
definitely<00:04:53.390> the<00:04:53.570> hardest<00:04:53.750> jump<00:04:54.200> there<00:04:54.830> aren't

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
definitely the hardest jump there aren't

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.410 
definitely the hardest jump there aren't
any<00:04:55.130> jumps<00:04:55.430> really<00:04:55.550> surrounding<00:04:56.090> this<00:04:56.240> the

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
any jumps really surrounding this the

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.420 
any jumps really surrounding this the
nearest<00:04:56.690> one<00:04:56.810> is<00:04:56.900> probably<00:04:57.170> the<00:04:57.350> motel<00:04:57.830> but

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
nearest one is probably the motel but

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.760 
nearest one is probably the motel but
this<00:04:58.730> is<00:04:58.910> just<00:04:59.420> off<00:04:59.570> a<00:04:59.630> dirt<00:05:00.050> track<00:05:00.410> and<00:05:00.650> you

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
this is just off a dirt track and you

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.130 
this is just off a dirt track and you
need<00:05:00.920> to<00:05:01.010> find<00:05:01.220> a<00:05:01.340> huge<00:05:01.640> light<00:05:01.940> house<00:05:02.150> here<00:05:02.510> you

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
need to find a huge light house here you

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.770 
need to find a huge light house here you
will<00:05:03.530> need<00:05:03.710> a<00:05:03.770> very<00:05:04.400> very<00:05:04.520> big<00:05:05.180> run-up<00:05:05.570> for

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
will need a very very big run-up for

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.660 
will need a very very big run-up for
this<00:05:06.110> because<00:05:06.410> it's<00:05:06.830> quite<00:05:07.190> a<00:05:07.220> large<00:05:07.430> gap

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
this because it's quite a large gap

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.430 
this because it's quite a large gap
unless<00:05:07.970> you<00:05:08.120> can<00:05:08.240> find<00:05:08.360> a<00:05:08.480> very<00:05:08.690> fast<00:05:08.960> car<00:05:09.080> but

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
unless you can find a very fast car but

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.870 
unless you can find a very fast car but
you'll<00:05:09.530> need<00:05:09.710> to<00:05:09.860> bring<00:05:10.100> that<00:05:10.280> from<00:05:10.460> somewhere

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
you'll need to bring that from somewhere

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.120 
you'll need to bring that from somewhere
else<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.990> reason<00:05:12.260> this<00:05:12.350> is<00:05:12.410> so<00:05:12.680> hard<00:05:12.950> is

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
else the reason this is so hard is

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.130 
else the reason this is so hard is
because<00:05:13.160> there's<00:05:13.610> a<00:05:13.670> very<00:05:14.030> small<00:05:14.150> amount<00:05:14.990> of

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
because there's a very small amount of

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.350 
because there's a very small amount of
rock<00:05:15.440> you<00:05:15.650> can<00:05:15.800> actually<00:05:16.130> land<00:05:16.400> on<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:16.670> light

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
rock you can actually land on the light

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.910 
rock you can actually land on the light
house<00:05:17.540> takes<00:05:17.810> up<00:05:17.960> most<00:05:18.200> of<00:05:18.440> that<00:05:18.560> little

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
house takes up most of that little

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.610 
house takes up most of that little
island<00:05:19.310> and<00:05:19.490> there's<00:05:20.420> also<00:05:20.750> these<00:05:21.110> things<00:05:21.440> in

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
island and there's also these things in

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.620 
island and there's also these things in
front<00:05:21.830> of<00:05:21.920> the<00:05:22.010> jump<00:05:22.280> which<00:05:22.580> can<00:05:22.970> affect<00:05:23.420> the

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
front of the jump which can affect the

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.420 
front of the jump which can affect the
direction<00:05:24.110> you're<00:05:24.260> going<00:05:24.290> in<00:05:24.740> so<00:05:25.100> this<00:05:25.280> took

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
direction you're going in so this took

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.540 
direction you're going in so this took
me<00:05:25.780> numerous<00:05:26.780> tries<00:05:27.170> and<00:05:27.590> you'll<00:05:28.160> see<00:05:28.370> why

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
me numerous tries and you'll see why

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.700 
me numerous tries and you'll see why
here<00:05:28.910> as<00:05:29.150> I<00:05:29.390> said<00:05:29.450> there's<00:05:30.140> a<00:05:30.200> very<00:05:30.500> small

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
here as I said there's a very small

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.200 
here as I said there's a very small
amount<00:05:30.950> of<00:05:31.130> rock<00:05:31.310> you<00:05:31.460> can<00:05:31.610> land<00:05:31.760> on<00:05:31.850> and<00:05:32.030> that

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
amount of rock you can land on and that

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.200 
amount of rock you can land on and that
is<00:05:32.360> it<00:05:32.570> so<00:05:33.020> I<00:05:33.050> actually<00:05:33.230> landed<00:05:34.070> on<00:05:34.340> it<00:05:34.520> and

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
is it so I actually landed on it and

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.060 
is it so I actually landed on it and
then<00:05:35.480> just<00:05:35.810> skid<00:05:36.140> it<00:05:36.230> off<00:05:36.380> because<00:05:36.590> it's<00:05:36.860> so

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
then just skid it off because it's so

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.550 
then just skid it off because it's so
small<00:05:37.360> but<00:05:38.360> if<00:05:38.450> you<00:05:38.540> can<00:05:38.720> do<00:05:38.900> that<00:05:39.050> that<00:05:39.320> is<00:05:39.410> the

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
small but if you can do that that is the

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.650 
small but if you can do that that is the
hardest<00:05:39.920> jump<00:05:40.130> done<00:05:40.430> and<00:05:40.700> this<00:05:41.060> one<00:05:41.270> is<00:05:41.420> still

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
hardest jump done and this one is still

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.930 
hardest jump done and this one is still
a<00:05:41.720> bit<00:05:41.960> tricky<00:05:42.320> as<00:05:42.500> I've<00:05:42.980> said<00:05:43.160> before<00:05:43.220> I<00:05:43.610> had

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
a bit tricky as I've said before I had

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.670 
a bit tricky as I've said before I had
already<00:05:44.060> done<00:05:44.420> one<00:05:44.690> jump<00:05:44.990> prior<00:05:45.350> to<00:05:45.560> these

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
already done one jump prior to these

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.460 
already done one jump prior to these
videos<00:05:46.100> so<00:05:46.400> this<00:05:46.820> is<00:05:47.090> actually<00:05:47.540> the<00:05:47.930> final

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
videos so this is actually the final

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.440 
videos so this is actually the final
jump<00:05:48.740> even<00:05:49.190> I<00:05:49.340> will<00:05:49.610> show<00:05:49.790> you<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:50.030> other<00:05:50.120> jump

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
jump even I will show you the other jump

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.840 
jump even I will show you the other jump
just<00:05:50.930> after<00:05:51.320> this<00:05:51.470> you'll<00:05:52.220> need<00:05:52.400> to<00:05:52.520> come<00:05:52.730> from

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
just after this you'll need to come from

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.420 
just after this you'll need to come from
this<00:05:53.120> direction<00:05:53.180> and<00:05:53.890> you'll<00:05:54.890> need<00:05:55.070> to<00:05:55.250> go

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
this direction and you'll need to go

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.330 
this direction and you'll need to go
through<00:05:55.790> a<00:05:55.820> gate<00:05:56.120> and<00:05:56.360> do<00:05:57.200> a<00:05:57.230> few<00:05:57.560> sharp<00:05:57.980> turns

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
through a gate and do a few sharp turns

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.130 
through a gate and do a few sharp turns
so<00:05:58.910> you<00:05:58.970> need<00:05:59.360> to<00:05:59.510> have<00:05:59.630> Franklin's

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
so you need to have Franklin's

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.530 
so you need to have Franklin's
slow-motion<00:06:00.950> driving<00:06:01.400> I<00:06:01.550> found<00:06:02.300> the<00:06:02.390> easiest

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
slow-motion driving I found the easiest

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.120 
slow-motion driving I found the easiest
way<00:06:02.990> was<00:06:03.170> to<00:06:03.350> come<00:06:03.500> from<00:06:03.620> the<00:06:03.770> petrol<00:06:04.100> station

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
way was to come from the petrol station

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.030 
way was to come from the petrol station
and<00:06:04.730> just<00:06:05.270> hit<00:06:05.540> this<00:06:05.690> jump<00:06:05.750> without<00:06:06.410> that<00:06:06.830> much

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
and just hit this jump without that much

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.980 
and just hit this jump without that much
pace<00:06:07.370> because<00:06:07.730> I<00:06:07.910> tried<00:06:08.270> doing<00:06:08.450> it<00:06:08.630> with<00:06:08.780> a<00:06:08.810> lot

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
pace because I tried doing it with a lot

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.810 
pace because I tried doing it with a lot
of<00:06:09.020> pace<00:06:09.290> and<00:06:09.560> landed<00:06:09.950> in<00:06:10.040> the<00:06:10.100> next<00:06:10.460> area<00:06:10.760> and

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
of pace and landed in the next area and

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.880 
of pace and landed in the next area and
it<00:06:11.060> said<00:06:11.270> failed<00:06:11.540> so<00:06:12.200> if<00:06:12.320> you<00:06:12.410> do<00:06:12.560> it<00:06:12.710> and<00:06:12.860> just

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
it said failed so if you do it and just

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.190 
it said failed so if you do it and just
land<00:06:13.160> in<00:06:13.310> this<00:06:13.400> tiny<00:06:13.760> area<00:06:14.480> here<00:06:14.810> it's<00:06:15.080> very

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
land in this tiny area here it's very

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.320 
land in this tiny area here it's very
easy<00:06:15.650> and<00:06:15.980> as<00:06:16.040> you<00:06:16.160> can<00:06:16.280> see<00:06:16.430> there<00:06:16.640> I<00:06:16.850> just<00:06:17.180> got

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
easy and as you can see there I just got

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.990 
easy and as you can see there I just got
the<00:06:17.450> achievement<00:06:17.510> good<00:06:18.380> show<00:06:18.710> off<00:06:18.890> so<00:06:19.700> that<00:06:19.730> is

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
the achievement good show off so that is

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.670 
the achievement good show off so that is
actually<00:06:20.270> the<00:06:20.360> final<00:06:20.720> jump<00:06:20.930> for<00:06:21.110> me<00:06:21.230> but<00:06:21.440> this

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
actually the final jump for me but this

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.830 
actually the final jump for me but this
is<00:06:21.860> the<00:06:21.890> final<00:06:22.340> one<00:06:22.400> for<00:06:22.610> you<00:06:22.760> as<00:06:23.000> I'm<00:06:23.450> guessing

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
is the final one for you as I'm guessing

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
is the final one for you as I'm guessing
you<00:06:23.960> haven't<00:06:24.140> done<00:06:24.320> any<00:06:24.590> and<00:06:24.710> you're

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
you haven't done any and you're

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.130 
you haven't done any and you're
following<00:06:25.250> this<00:06:25.460> tutorial<00:06:25.730> so<00:06:26.660> you<00:06:26.750> just<00:06:26.930> come

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.140 
following this tutorial so you just come

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.440 
following this tutorial so you just come
from<00:06:27.260> there<00:06:27.560> you<00:06:28.040> need<00:06:28.160> to<00:06:28.220> head<00:06:28.520> around<00:06:29.000> to

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
from there you need to head around to

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.200 
from there you need to head around to
this<00:06:29.630> small

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
this small

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.460 
this small
and<00:06:30.330> you<00:06:30.419> have<00:06:30.660> to<00:06:30.810> come<00:06:30.990> from<00:06:31.169> this<00:06:31.289> direction

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
and you have to come from this direction

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.800 
and you have to come from this direction
if<00:06:31.889> you<00:06:31.979> don't<00:06:32.280> you<00:06:32.699> will<00:06:32.789> not<00:06:32.970> make<00:06:33.180> it<00:06:33.449> you

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
if you don't you will not make it you

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.170 
if you don't you will not make it you
can<00:06:33.960> normally<00:06:34.110> find<00:06:34.620> a<00:06:34.860> few<00:06:35.190> quadbikes<00:06:35.819> just

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
can normally find a few quadbikes just

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.120 
can normally find a few quadbikes just
down<00:06:36.389> here<00:06:36.419> and<00:06:36.990> I<00:06:37.620> don't<00:06:37.949> actually

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
down here and I don't actually

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.620 
down here and I don't actually
understand<00:06:38.639> how<00:06:38.669> the<00:06:38.910> tractor<00:06:39.300> made<00:06:39.479> it

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
understand how the tractor made it

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.150 
understand how the tractor made it
because<00:06:39.870> there<00:06:40.020> is<00:06:40.110> a<00:06:40.139> jump<00:06:40.410> in<00:06:40.590> the<00:06:40.710> road<00:06:40.919> I

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
because there is a jump in the road I

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.860 
because there is a jump in the road I
don't<00:06:41.340> know<00:06:41.490> any<00:06:41.669> other<00:06:41.699> way<00:06:41.849> around<00:06:42.270> it<00:06:42.479> so

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
don't know any other way around it so

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.629 
don't know any other way around it so
this<00:06:43.050> is<00:06:43.110> another<00:06:43.470> jump<00:06:43.800> that's<00:06:43.979> a<00:06:44.069> very<00:06:44.310> basic

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 
this is another jump that's a very basic

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.939 
this is another jump that's a very basic
you<00:06:45.120> don't<00:06:45.150> need<00:06:45.479> that<00:06:45.660> much<00:06:45.840> speed<00:06:46.169> as<00:06:46.770> long

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
you don't need that much speed as long

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:48.770 
you don't need that much speed as long
as<00:06:47.039> you<00:06:47.130> can<00:06:47.280> make<00:06:47.430> that<00:06:47.580> tiny<00:06:47.940> gap<00:06:48.270> I<00:06:48.449> made<00:06:48.690> it

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
as you can make that tiny gap I made it

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.689 
as you can make that tiny gap I made it
quite<00:06:48.900> easy<00:06:49.110> as<00:06:49.319> you<00:06:49.410> can<00:06:49.560> see<00:06:49.800> but<00:06:50.370> that<00:06:50.580> is

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699 
quite easy as you can see but that is

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:53.689 
quite easy as you can see but that is
all<00:06:50.970> the<00:06:51.030> jumps<00:06:51.569> completed<00:06:52.259> so<00:06:52.860> hopefully<00:06:53.340> you

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:53.699 
all the jumps completed so hopefully you

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:55.820 
all the jumps completed so hopefully you
have<00:06:53.729> followed<00:06:54.210> this<00:06:54.419> and<00:06:54.720> found<00:06:55.229> all<00:06:55.530> of<00:06:55.560> the

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
have followed this and found all of the

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.499 
have followed this and found all of the
jumps<00:06:56.160> and<00:06:56.310> completed<00:06:56.699> them<00:06:56.789> yourselves

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:57.509 
jumps and completed them yourselves

00:06:57.509 --> 00:06:59.390 
jumps and completed them yourselves
