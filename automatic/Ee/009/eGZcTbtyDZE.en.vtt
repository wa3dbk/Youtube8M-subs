00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.580
 Yes Hello everyone 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:18.840
 This time will be Oki's second photo correction 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:23.300
 From now on the most basic of the day's photo correction 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:29.870
 I would like to talk about level correction 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:32.960
 Before going into Kinnery level correction, show the nature of the picture first 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:36.430
 About how to read the graph called a histogram 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.430
 I would like to explain 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.960
 The histogram is 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:53.250
 Ebel's correction in the strait 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.250
 Doing always this way when you do this it will appear as a graph 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.430
 Leftmost 0 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:04.280
 Right side is 255 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:08.330
 When the image is displayed 256 times today 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.659
 That is the level of brightness of the soil ventilation 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.900
 Pixel is 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.820
 How many 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.820
 It represents what is distributed 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:31.380
 List g when shooting in the camera 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.380
 You can also display on the back of the LCD 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.570
 Yes 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:43.920
 When displaying the captured image of the extreme right 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:48.750
 Doing this you can also display the piste grams in Table 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:52.590
 Toka wonder if reddish in Te possibly field a multi-well if you look at the this 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:58.439
 I not become, as can be seen Toka wonder if is better to longer little exposure 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.860
 So the very role is also to give a glossy color balance day in aptitude at the time of the shooting 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.860
 stand 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:14.530
 For example, this m 31 Andromeda Galaxy Falls 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.819
 This is the most typical as astrophotography 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.819
 In the form of a histogram 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:31.530
 Most of the money will be the black part of the bag 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:33.630
 Kana about 40 from say 45 at roughly a few aircraft is in this histogram 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.700
 It is around here 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:42.890
 Most of this black part of the background is around this 40 to 50 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.890
 Indicates the numbers around it 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:54.220
 Please see here Higa day 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:57.940
 No. 250, which is part of the image that is saturated 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:02.700
 Hey there too, there is a mountain here 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:06.710
 This is this bright hope in the middle of giving up 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:11.920
 Or also absorption in the industry Station Him gar 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:16.590
 These places are already overexposed. 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.590
 I have gone to a few companies 255 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.280
 Because 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.400
 This photo looks like a little 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:32.280
 Tteyuu underexposed Kana but I feel 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:37.940
 If you add more exposure, the background will become brighter 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:43.050
 m 31 k hugh may look a bit better 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:46.010
 However , these rapid expansion parts of the 39th term are more 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:52.020
 Will be saturated 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:56.390
 So it may have been good for this as an exposure period 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:59.990
 I think this is the part that does this 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:06.010
 I have not been here until 255 and more 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:06.010
 If it was in the second quarter of the pile, it is safe to expose it 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:21.920
 In this way it piece and g comes to As can be seen in its view 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:28.480
 You have come to be seen well because the nature of the photos 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.480
 Would you like it is, for example, take a look at 1 photos of cut another 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:36.040
 This is because I took a picture with the wrong white balance setting 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:41.130
 And it is near the pre-The 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.130
 The whole screen looks pretty reddish . 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:51.630
 First person of this histogram leftmost 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:54.780
 Contact mountain there is one closer to zero in a few aircraft 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.569
 This is a part of this mountain 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.180
 This silk day 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:02.780
 Such a ne 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:08.090
 One black part is making a mountain here 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.830
 And wide of Kyo' and the width of the people here about the above you are fishing guarantee 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.409
 It will be in the mountains 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.810
 Just this 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:17.790
 But the color of the red customer is 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:23.510
 rgb or red green blue 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.510
 You can understand very well if you try to disassemble each knee Gran 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:30.460
 This is I think you have entered towards the red Di to the right 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.460
 And green 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:39.039
 It is blue 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:42.930
 In this way because the color balance is lost photos To much also Haba Yamano City of histogram 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.930
 I think that I understand that I am worried 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:53.300
 In this way I look at how the fist grams become to understand the nature of the photos 

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:58.069
 Because you will understand well 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:01.009
 What has happened to the hit g by all means look at the various types of photo 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:05.509
 I want you to observe it by all means 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:08.639
 A photo that is overexposed to the opposite of a well- exposed photo underexposed photo 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:14.340
 Well-balanced photo 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:16.569
 I think that the more you look at the histogram of the photos, the more you look at the photos. 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:23.189
 I will 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:23.189
 Yes, thank you also for the third time next time
