 verter rota 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.040
 btn arya flywheel 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.230
 help on the internet thought I would hack 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:24.539
 and press say let's press uranium and other things 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:33.360
 and I tried and preload current growth 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:36.059
 750 watt motor yak couple at 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.510
 load reduction inclusion that is 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:44.969
 not a bunch of pesudomone run and 220 volts 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:49.079
 A380 is now connected to you now 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.829
 try all programmers cotton wool system 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.699
 they asked 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:59.129
 load key Tokyo huddling though 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.789
 not only strayed weakened and c 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.960
 belt 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.680
 yak recommend on the internet nothing 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.720
 750 watts motor output 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:17.820
 weekend on the shaft 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:24.420
 Scythian Yamato 270 gave 230 flywheel 20 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:27.380
 kilogram further skill 200 and 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.990
 stop generator 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:36.030
 generator 4 kilowatt load bones 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:39.259
 fireplace kilowatt aperture even the whole 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.259
 load and we can pull 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 drills 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.830
 missed and Bulgarians oppose 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:55.600
 and everything turned off a little more 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.600
 now try to run and 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.009
 so you tried the system for the culture you 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.509
 we both have 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:13.519
 self-locking at work did not hang anything 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:17.630
 then the bridge and so we start sharing the currents at 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:22.060
 we will be an hour once you are so start it up 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.060
 and now he is from undermining 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.870
 leave for 750 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.200
 give a drink 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.870
 hair dryers play kilowatt 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.470
 remembers ducks believe 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.570
 why you yourself 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.570
 and taken 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.849
 typing it on the generator to 150 white 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:56.570
 concluding that the engine does not sleep if 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:59.870
 all boot covers and including 750 wars that is 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:04.870
 water strings started once you are 750 watts 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.870
 amp has become 384 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.390
 there is no torus for him 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.080
 turned off the system 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:31.699
 Here such garbage nagal here not became 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:36.500
 and free energy we did not work then 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:40.660
 are you including the generator load 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.660
 view we have a result of growth 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:47.389
 Sydney 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:50.530
 Russian strum on the engine what 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.530
 750 watts 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.190
 like this from their fire 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.880
 can anyone sit down and say you can sit down 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.880
 on so different
