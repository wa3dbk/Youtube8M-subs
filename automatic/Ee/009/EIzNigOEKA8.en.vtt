00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
confusing in fact some of us think the

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.260 
confusing in fact some of us think the
taxi<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.529> after<00:00:17.160> landing<00:00:17.609> at<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.850> strange

taxi in after landing at a strange

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.450 
taxi in after landing at a strange
airport<00:00:18.869> can<00:00:19.170> be<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.529> hardest<00:00:19.740> part<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.369> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
airport can be the hardest part of the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.030 
airport can be the hardest part of the
trip<00:00:20.699> but<00:00:21.390> say<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:21.840> done<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.800> the

trip but say it's done and the

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.500 
trip but say it's done and the
visibility<00:00:23.520> is<00:00:23.820> poor<00:00:24.060> then<00:00:24.930> things<00:00:25.470> can<00:00:25.890> be

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
visibility is poor then things can be

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.820 
visibility is poor then things can be
really<00:00:27.510> confusing<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:29.210> confusion<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.390> not

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
really confusing and confusion is not

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.479 
really confusing and confusion is not
good<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.820> FAA<00:00:33.420> has<00:00:34.020> mandated<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.010> use<00:00:35.039> of

good so the FAA has mandated the use of
standardized<00:00:36.210> signs<00:00:36.719> around<00:00:37.170> an<00:00:37.649> airport<00:00:38.039> but

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
standardized signs around an airport but

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.549 
standardized signs around an airport but
all<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.300> signs<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.780> markings<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.350> world

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
me sort out the meaning of airport signs

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.729 
me sort out the meaning of airport signs
more<00:00:59.940> than<00:01:00.179> anything<00:01:00.449> else<00:01:00.839> and<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.229> saying

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
is black square you're there what that

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.180 
is black square you're there what that
means<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> sign<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> black

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
means is if you see a sign with a black

square with yellow letters and borders

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.980 
square with yellow letters and borders
it<00:01:12.659> tells<00:01:13.079> you<00:01:13.439> what<00:01:13.740> taxiway<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.240> so

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
it tells you what taxiway you are on so

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.080 
it tells you what taxiway you are on so
in<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.259> case<00:01:16.560> black<00:01:16.890> square<00:01:17.310> you're<00:01:17.700> there

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
in this case black square you're there

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.200 
in this case black square you're there
means<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.840> are<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.229> taxiway<00:01:20.009> Bravo<00:01:20.310> by<00:01:21.149> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
means you are on taxiway Bravo by the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.209 
means you are on taxiway Bravo by the
way<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.600> convention<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.289> that<00:01:22.320> taxiways<00:01:23.189> are

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
way the convention is that taxiways are

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.880 
way the convention is that taxiways are
labeled<00:01:23.880> with<00:01:24.090> one<00:01:24.390> or<00:01:24.600> more<00:01:24.869> letters<00:01:25.289> and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
labeled with one or more letters and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.179 
labeled with one or more letters and
when<00:01:26.399> it's<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.700> stub<00:01:27.149> taxiway<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.590> also<00:01:28.829> can

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
when it's a stub taxiway it also can

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.560 
when it's a stub taxiway it also can
have<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> number<00:01:29.640> such<00:01:30.090> as<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.509> case

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
have a number such as in this case

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.510 
have a number such as in this case
alpha-1<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.979> alpha-2

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
alpha-1 and alpha-2

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.529 
alpha-1 and alpha-2
so<00:01:33.149> black<00:01:34.140> square<00:01:34.439> you're<00:01:35.130> their<00:01:35.429> signs<00:01:35.850> are

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
so black square you're their signs are

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.899 
so black square you're their signs are
called<00:01:37.670> location<00:01:38.670> signs<00:01:40.579> now<00:01:41.579> here's

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
called location signs now here's

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.789 
called location signs now here's
something<00:01:42.179> else<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.689> use<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.140> help<00:01:43.259> me<00:01:43.380> keep<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
something else I use to help me keep the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.849 
something else I use to help me keep the
sign<00:01:44.039> straight<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.359> all<00:01:45.859> Direction

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
sign straight and that is all Direction

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.029 
sign straight and that is all Direction
signs<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:48.060> an<00:01:48.299> arrow<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:49.170> point<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.890> to

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
signs have an arrow to point you to

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.719 
signs have an arrow to point you to
something<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.869> know<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.380> sounds<00:01:52.890> simple<00:01:53.159> but

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
something I know that sounds simple but

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.340 
something I know that sounds simple but
it<00:01:53.850> actually<00:01:54.299> helps<00:01:54.600> me<00:01:54.719> because<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:55.140> there's

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
it actually helps me because if there's

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.099 
it actually helps me because if there's
any<00:01:55.469> question<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.100> my<00:01:56.340> mind<00:01:56.369> as<00:01:57.179> whether<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
any question in my mind as whether the

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:00.830 
any question in my mind as whether the
sign<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> location<00:01:59.039> sign<00:01:59.549> or<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.969> Direction

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
sign is a location sign or a Direction

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.260 
sign is a location sign or a Direction
sign<00:02:01.109> it<00:02:01.590> helps<00:02:01.979> me<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.310> remember<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.999> all

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
sign it helps me to remember that all

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.840 
sign it helps me to remember that all
Direction<00:02:04.079> signs<00:02:04.289> have<00:02:05.100> an<00:02:05.280> arrow<00:02:05.460> and

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
Direction signs have an arrow and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.669 
Direction signs have an arrow and
Direction<00:02:06.329> signs<00:02:06.479> by<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.780> way<00:02:06.990> are<00:02:07.200> yellow

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
Direction signs by the way are yellow

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.529 
Direction signs by the way are yellow
like<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.280> with<00:02:08.550> black<00:02:08.819> lettering<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
like this with black lettering and

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.260 
like this with black lettering and
you'll<00:02:09.929> see<00:02:10.110> them<00:02:10.289> just<00:02:10.770> before<00:02:11.270> taxiway

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
you'll see them just before taxiway

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.330 
you'll see them just before taxiway
intersections<00:02:13.230> in<00:02:13.620> this<00:02:13.770> case<00:02:14.010> we're<00:02:14.310> on

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
intersections in this case we're on

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.950 
intersections in this case we're on
tactically<00:02:15.000> Charlie<00:02:15.420> we're<00:02:15.570> coming<00:02:15.840> up<00:02:15.900> to

tactically Charlie we're coming up to
Juliet<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.220> arrows<00:02:17.490> point<00:02:17.880> the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
Juliet and the arrows point the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.650 
Juliet and the arrows point the
direction

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
direction

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.570 
direction
for<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.960> turn<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.440> another<00:02:19.650> taxiway<00:02:20.250> here<00:02:20.550> I

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
for a turn to another taxiway here I

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.760 
for a turn to another taxiway here I
turn<00:02:20.910> right<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.420> get<00:02:21.570> on<00:02:21.720> Juliet<00:02:22.140> or<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.440> could

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
turn right to get on Juliet or I could

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.940 
turn right to get on Juliet or I could
turn<00:02:23.070> left<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.910> get<00:02:24.060> on<00:02:24.090> Juliet<00:02:24.600> now<00:02:25.080> Direction

turn left to get on Juliet now Direction

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.460 
turn left to get on Juliet now Direction
signs<00:02:26.250> are<00:02:26.580> often<00:02:26.760> used<00:02:27.270> in<00:02:27.630> combination<00:02:27.930> with

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
signs are often used in combination with

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.950 
signs are often used in combination with
location<00:02:29.220> signs<00:02:29.490> like<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.570> give<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.930> a

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
location signs like this to give you a

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.800 
location signs like this to give you a
visual<00:02:31.650> picture<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.490> what<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.180> intersection

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
visual picture of what that intersection

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.080 
visual picture of what that intersection
is<00:02:33.990> going<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.230> look<00:02:34.380> like<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.520> their<00:02:35.760> group

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
is going to look like and so their group

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.210 
is going to look like and so their group
so<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:36.510> they<00:02:36.690> read<00:02:37.290> from<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.800> left<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.160> the

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
so that they read from the left to the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.680 
so that they read from the left to the
right<00:02:38.310> showing<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.090> direction<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.570> the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
right showing the direction of the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.800 
right showing the direction of the
taxiways<00:02:40.200> by<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.650> angle<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.970> arrows<00:02:42.360> and

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
taxiways by the angle of the arrows and

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.500 
taxiways by the angle of the arrows and
so<00:02:43.140> signs<00:02:43.560> indicating<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.640> turn<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.300> left

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
so signs indicating a turn to the left

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.210 
so signs indicating a turn to the left
will<00:02:45.780> be<00:02:45.930> are<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.290> ready<00:02:46.530> for<00:02:46.770> this<00:02:46.920> on<00:02:47.160> the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
will be are you ready for this on the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.270 
will be are you ready for this on the
left<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.300> group<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:49.050> location<00:02:49.740> sign<00:02:50.010> or

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
left of the group the location sign or

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.970 
left of the group the location sign or
black<00:02:50.670> square<00:02:51.180> you're<00:02:51.540> there<00:02:51.930> sign<00:02:52.350> is<00:02:52.710> in<00:02:52.890> the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
black square you're there sign is in the

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.010 
black square you're there sign is in the
middle<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.430> group<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.390> here<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.660> can

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
middle of the group and so here you can

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.980 
middle of the group and so here you can
see<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.470> you're<00:02:55.620> on<00:02:55.770> taxiway<00:02:56.520> Bravo<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.720> of

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
see that you're on taxiway Bravo and of

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.900 
see that you're on taxiway Bravo and of
course<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.470> signs<00:02:58.710> indicating<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.430> turn<00:02:59.670> to

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
course the signs indicating a turn to

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.850 
course the signs indicating a turn to
the<00:02:59.970> right<00:03:00.030> will<00:03:00.450> be<00:03:00.480> on<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.990> right<00:03:01.410> side<00:03:01.440> of

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
the right will be on the right side of

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.620 
the right will be on the right side of
the<00:03:01.920> group<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.340> think<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.880> had<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.390> thing

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
the group I think you had this thing

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.620 
the group I think you had this thing
figured<00:03:03.900> out<00:03:04.230> now<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.830> whole<00:03:05.340> sign<00:03:06.030> group<00:03:06.420> is

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
figured out now the whole sign group is

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.170 
figured out now the whole sign group is
usually<00:03:07.080> on<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.290> left<00:03:08.010> side<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.700> taxiway

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
usually on the left side of the taxiway

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.840 
usually on the left side of the taxiway
and<00:03:09.570> that<00:03:10.200> cleverly<00:03:10.890> enough<00:03:11.130> is<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:11.550> that<00:03:11.730> the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
and that cleverly enough is so that the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.480 
and that cleverly enough is so that the
pilot<00:03:12.270> in<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.540> left<00:03:12.840> seat<00:03:13.050> can<00:03:13.650> see<00:03:14.100> that

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
pilot in the left seat can see that

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.700 
pilot in the left seat can see that
group<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.880> signs<00:03:15.150> very<00:03:15.450> easily<00:03:15.720> now<00:03:16.440> each

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
group of signs very easily now each

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.710 
group of signs very easily now each
direction<00:03:17.010> sign<00:03:17.580> is<00:03:17.880> separated<00:03:18.480> from<00:03:18.570> the

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
direction sign is separated from the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.160 
direction sign is separated from the
others<00:03:18.960> by<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.200> black<00:03:19.970> vertical<00:03:20.970> bar<00:03:21.300> so<00:03:22.110> you

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
others by a black vertical bar so you

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.500 
others by a black vertical bar so you
know<00:03:22.560> which<00:03:22.860> arrow<00:03:23.190> belongs<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:24.000> which<00:03:24.210> letter

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
know which arrow belongs to which letter

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.690 
know which arrow belongs to which letter
so<00:03:25.110> that'll<00:03:25.380> help<00:03:25.410> make<00:03:25.830> it<00:03:26.040> clear<00:03:26.340> for

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
so that'll help make it clear for

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.490 
so that'll help make it clear for
instance<00:03:27.060> whether<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.660> sign<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.080> referring

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
instance whether the sign is referring

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.880 
instance whether the sign is referring
to<00:03:28.530> two<00:03:28.830> different<00:03:28.880> taxiways<00:03:29.880> or<00:03:30.180> one<00:03:31.170> taxiway

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
to two different taxiways or one taxiway

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.320 
to two different taxiways or one taxiway
that's<00:03:32.160> labeled<00:03:32.550> with<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:32.850> two<00:03:32.910> letter

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
that's labeled with a two letter

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.140 
that's labeled with a two letter
combination<00:03:34.110> like<00:03:34.290> alpha<00:03:34.710> alpha<00:03:34.860> here<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:35.820> in

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
combination like alpha alpha here so in

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.140 
combination like alpha alpha here so in
this<00:03:36.510> case<00:03:36.930> you'd<00:03:37.380> have<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.650> tight<00:03:38.460> turn<00:03:38.850> or<00:03:39.120> a

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
this case you'd have a tight turn or a

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.780 
this case you'd have a tight turn or a
90-degree<00:03:39.840> turn<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.560> left<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:41.520> get<00:03:41.730> on

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
90-degree turn to the left to get on

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.350 
90-degree turn to the left to get on
taxiway<00:03:42.660> Foxtrot<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:44.040> about<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:44.640> 45<00:03:45.330> degree

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
taxiway Foxtrot and about a 45 degree

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.050 
taxiway Foxtrot and about a 45 degree
turn<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.140> left<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.530> get<00:03:46.680> on<00:03:46.860> golf<00:03:47.370> as<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:47.880> can

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
turn the left to get on golf as you can

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.170 
turn the left to get on golf as you can
see<00:03:48.300> and<00:03:48.720> you'd<00:03:49.500> turn<00:03:49.800> about<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.490> 45<00:03:51.150> degree

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
see and you'd turn about a 45 degree

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.210 
see and you'd turn about a 45 degree
turn<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.930> right<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.290> get<00:03:52.380> on<00:03:52.560> alpha<00:03:53.040> alpha

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
turn to the right to get on alpha alpha

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.030 
turn to the right to get on alpha alpha
and<00:03:53.790> you'd<00:03:54.480> have<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.750> 90<00:03:55.230> degree<00:03:55.500> turn<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.950> the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
and you'd have a 90 degree turn to the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.220 
and you'd have a 90 degree turn to the
right<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.400> get<00:03:56.490> on<00:03:56.550> alpha<00:03:57.030> Bravo<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:58.050> can

right to get on alpha Bravo and you can

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.140 
right to get on alpha Bravo and you can
see<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:58.740> you're<00:03:58.860> actually<00:03:59.310> on<00:03:59.340> at<00:03:59.760> this<00:03:59.910> time

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
see that you're actually on at this time

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.500 
see that you're actually on at this time
taxiway<00:04:00.810> Bravo<00:04:01.020> now<00:04:01.860> sometimes<00:04:02.640> when<00:04:03.209> you<00:04:03.330> get

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
taxiway Bravo now sometimes when you get
