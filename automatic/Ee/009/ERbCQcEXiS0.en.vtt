00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
motivation and I guess what it all came

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.020 
motivation and I guess what it all came
down<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:58.079> me<00:01:58.409> remembering<00:01:59.219> what<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.670> is

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030

the<00:02:04.380> maturity<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.520> foresight<00:02:06.210> to

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the maturity and the foresight to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.550 
the maturity and the foresight to
understand<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.500> we<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.520> have<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.000> make<00:02:09.149> some

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
understand that we do have to make some

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.809 
understand that we do have to make some
decisions<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.800> some<00:02:10.950> trade-offs

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
decisions and some trade-offs

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.350 
decisions and some trade-offs
you<00:02:12.420> know<00:02:12.629> and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
you know and

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.740 
you know and
