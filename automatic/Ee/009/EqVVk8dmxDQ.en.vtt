00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
that all the time on YouTube but the

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.860 
that all the time on YouTube but the
difference<00:04:48.949> with<00:04:49.220> musicians<00:04:50.000> is<00:04:50.300> that<00:04:50.660> like

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
difference with musicians is that like

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.840 
difference with musicians is that like
if<00:04:51.050> you<00:04:51.169> take<00:04:51.380> a<00:04:51.410> like<00:04:51.770> an<00:04:51.919> audio<00:04:52.310> track<00:04:52.400> or

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
music track of 1m and use it one of your

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
videos you're actually taking that the

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.409 
videos you're actually taking that the
value<00:04:57.229> of<00:04:57.440> that<00:04:58.070> creation<00:04:58.400> in<00:04:58.760> its<00:04:58.940> entirety

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
value of that creation in its entirety

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.510 
value of that creation in its entirety
and<00:04:59.900> putting<00:05:00.680> it<00:05:00.770> out<00:05:00.889> there<00:05:00.919> whereas<00:05:01.400> if

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
and putting it out there whereas if

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.219 
and putting it out there whereas if
you're<00:05:01.639> taking<00:05:01.789> like<00:05:02.150> video<00:05:02.660> game<00:05:03.020> play

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
you're taking like video game play

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:04.930 
you're taking like video game play
footage<00:05:03.260> you're<00:05:04.160> only<00:05:04.280> taking<00:05:04.430> a<00:05:04.669> small

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
footage you're only taking a small

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.730 
footage you're only taking a small
portion<00:05:05.270> of<00:05:05.600> the<00:05:05.690> value<00:05:06.020> of<00:05:06.080> that<00:05:06.199> video<00:05:06.380> game

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
portion of the value of that video game

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.890 
portion of the value of that video game
delivering<00:05:07.460> it<00:05:07.550> to<00:05:07.789> your<00:05:08.120> viewers<00:05:08.389> the<00:05:08.690> other

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
delivering it to your viewers the other

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.719 
delivering it to your viewers the other
value<00:05:09.410> obviously<00:05:09.979> is<00:05:10.039> that<00:05:10.220> they<00:05:10.400> could<00:05:10.610> get

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
value obviously is that they could get

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.460 
value obviously is that they could get
the<00:05:10.880> game<00:05:11.060> and<00:05:11.270> experience<00:05:11.750> it<00:05:11.960> and<00:05:11.990> play<00:05:12.440> it

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
the game and experience it and play it

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.840 
the game and experience it and play it
for<00:05:12.740> themselves<00:05:12.860> so<00:05:13.460> what<00:05:13.580> it<00:05:13.639> really<00:05:13.760> feels

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
for themselves so what it really feels

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.550 
for themselves so what it really feels
like<00:05:14.120> it<00:05:14.300> comes<00:05:14.479> down<00:05:14.630> to<00:05:14.900> is<00:05:14.990> that<00:05:15.050> Nintendo

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
like it comes down to is that Nintendo

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.310 
like it comes down to is that Nintendo
wants<00:05:15.830> to<00:05:15.889> have<00:05:16.039> control<00:05:16.520> over<00:05:16.760> their<00:05:17.570> video

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
wants to have control over their video

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.320 
wants to have control over their video
games<00:05:18.710> on<00:05:19.070> YouTube<00:05:19.699> and<00:05:19.910> that<00:05:20.030> makes<00:05:20.210> sense

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
games on YouTube and that makes sense

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.230 
games on YouTube and that makes sense
and<00:05:20.750> I<00:05:20.810> have<00:05:20.930> every<00:05:21.139> right<00:05:21.289> to<00:05:21.500> do<00:05:21.680> so<00:05:21.910> but<00:05:22.910> the

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
and I have every right to do so but the

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.939 
and I have every right to do so but the
way<00:05:23.479> they're<00:05:23.690> going<00:05:23.870> about<00:05:24.050> doing<00:05:24.110> this<00:05:24.560> is

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
way they're going about doing this is

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.790 
way they're going about doing this is
kind<00:05:25.639> of<00:05:25.820> like<00:05:26.150> I<00:05:26.539> think<00:05:27.139> it's<00:05:27.289> just<00:05:27.350> making<00:05:27.620> a

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
kind of like I think it's just making a

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.379 
kind of like I think it's just making a
lot<00:05:27.919> more<00:05:28.039> enemies<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.729> it's<00:05:28.880> creating

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
lot more enemies and it's creating

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.060 
lot more enemies and it's creating
probably<00:05:29.900> more<00:05:30.080> problems<00:05:30.530> for<00:05:30.590> their<00:05:30.800> brand

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
probably more problems for their brand

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.400 
probably more problems for their brand
in<00:05:31.220> the<00:05:31.340> long<00:05:31.550> run<00:05:31.599> then<00:05:32.599> it's<00:05:33.050> actually

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
in the long run then it's actually

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.870 
in the long run then it's actually
helping<00:05:33.740> there's<00:05:34.039> several<00:05:34.220> other<00:05:34.430> stories<00:05:34.789> to
