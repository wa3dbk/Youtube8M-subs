00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.669
 ah 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.969
 hi let me teach you how to do these 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.760
 bracelets for this we need what 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.439
 next to start we will take care of 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.880
 these very young and where do you worry if 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.680
 you can not find them because we also have 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.910
 the option to do them and is father 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.830
 because we can make them from several 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.619
 colors for this we are going to use 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.300
 skeins of silk or cotton thread 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.180
 we also need tweezers that are not 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.200
 so necessary but if they are of great help 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.940
 chain that you can get them in 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.550
 jewelry stores or some stores 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.309
 of cloth 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:43.270
 rings and these little hooks we will measure the 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.270
 chain with our doll 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.969
 we divide the chain we insert a 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.969
 ring and we close it 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.329
 Y 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.149
 we open another ring and we are going to put 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.129
 this time a hook and before closing it 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.750
 we will also introduce the string in the 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.150
 another end of the first ring 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.310
 we closed everything very well and officially already 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.869
 we have our bracelet now 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.659
 we will place the pendant and for this we have to 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.580
 look for the middle part of the bracelet 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.950
 there we just put a ring to the 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.780
 same ring that already brought the charm and the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.560
 We put on the bracelet closing the 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.560
 perfectly 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.940
 and you're done but remember that 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.920
 we also have the next option 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.200
 let's do something like these locks 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.550
 Obviously, when we are younger we open a 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.180
 ring and we do it to a little 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.920
 we wrap the thread in three fingers 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.950
 the ring and we continue doing the 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.369
 same movement but this time we will go 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.050
 passing the thread through the ring of the video 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.260
 if I did not understand very well my 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.260
 implication 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.670
 when you think it's ready, we cut and 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.670
 we make a knot with the help of another thread 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.200
 and then we cut again from below 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.050
 we put another ring in our first 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.440
 ring and then we put it with our 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.440
 bracelet 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.540
 and ready really is very easy and the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.270
 you can make the colors you like 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.190
 maybe you can put another pendant 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.140
 exactly must be this meter needs 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.210
 that was all the video to little is not 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.740
 very easy but I do not leave without before 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.810

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.120
