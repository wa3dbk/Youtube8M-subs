00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 typical problem then you check something in 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.339
 the university does not and thinks clearly how 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.790
 in the school wikipedia and further 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.069
 it's 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.900
 think then you are the article 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.490
 and do not even check what's there 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.980
 something but German does not see it 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.780
 out and the completely sober group 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.970
 then one expects the feeling and exactly 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.830
 That's where we come in when you play the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.480
 first read all characters is like that 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.180
 an article on wikipedia matter 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.279
 most useful therefore today ours 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.279
 theme uni mat in german 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.500
 you sure have already left 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.570
 any article here 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.500
 seen such a funny v with 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.970
 horizontal line that means for all 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.640
 if you write funny stuff with 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.850
 horizontal line xxx square bigger now 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.650
 said so for every xx square bigger 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.629
 equals zero 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.370
 instead of writing for all iks is 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.470
 You can also write for all iks 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.290
 Colon the colon means so 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.180
 much as it is or it is what he is 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.920
 Certainly have seen it before 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.360
 a funny wrong around sf 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.400
 that is, there is at least one 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.860
 so if you want to say there is 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.300
 at least 1x for asics is smaller 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.730
 than 5 you can do it that way 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.620
 Of course you can write that of course 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.340
 also canceled by then means 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.620
 quite logically accurate there is no stupid 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.979
 it also gives this again 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.370
 false 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.600
 this time with an exclamation point that means it 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.070
 is exactly one 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.479
 class what is the difference now 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.580
 between the thing without an exclamation mark 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.380
 and that's clear with 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.390
 For example, you have three taverns 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.460
 drunk then ask yourself somewhere 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.440
 moral apostle water drunk if 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.970
 I now say there is at least one 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.190
 alcoholic drink that I distort 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.680
 then it is absolutely right 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.390
 but if you say it is exactly 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.190
 alcoholic stimulant which 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.170
 my lips wetted then you have 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.030
 definitely geflunkert or too much 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.460
 drunk and some of you have had three 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.530
 I just hope you guys are 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.360
 Of course nobody talks like that, but it does not matter 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.560
 without exclamation can also several 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.149
 be with exclamation point is exactly 1 so 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.220
 a very simple sign times 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.130
 diversified a colon before a 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.190
 the same one writes one when one is 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.989
 something defines that often needs 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.489
 in physics where all variables 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.320
 swirl around and you immediately the 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.390
 Overview loses then you can 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.910
 for expressions that occur again and again 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.620
 define abbreviation so let's say 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.180
 with you there is always that here 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.880
 in front 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.380
 27 times pi square half and that often 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.269
 that it sucks the shit every time 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.680
 to have to write down 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.400
 then he just gives it all away 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.890
 and only writes double-dot 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.780
 27 times pi square half it now one of 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.070
 you defined expression you can 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.380
 Of course, if you are in the 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.850
 expression with the variable you have alone 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.739
 already sees half of the 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.480
 Math items already better off a bit 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.610
 at least maybe here too 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.850
 but that's the only one almost 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.330
 promised what should that already be 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.760
 again 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.610
 That's a buzz with it 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.160
 you hum and that's how it is now 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.870
 several things important first, it is important 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.120
 about which variable you have the sum 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.130
 that makes you look below the 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.060
 buzz sign in the case here thus 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.489
 rather over m 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.190
 that's what it's called second is important 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.510
 from where to where you run away load that 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.610
 are the limits of the sum so here 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.530
 in that case you leave and from 1 to 5 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.110
 Now it's still important to run something in 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.180
 every moment with your n is made in 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.360
 The case should be in quarters 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.200
 that's before the buzz sign 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.040
 The sum then looks like this 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.579
 out is equal to 1 square +2 square +3 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.670
 square +4 square +5 square equal to 55 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:45.190
 So here was square at 1 to the to 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.590
 two and lose and so on until the 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.510
 upper limit namely the 5 and because it 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.870
 every sign is just everything 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.940
 add we test if you do that 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.489
 we've come to understand this now 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.640
 sum navas makes that a reminder 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.200
 what do we summon from where to where what 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.609
 must be done at any moment 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.500
 So first the 1 then the two then the 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.890
 3 and then we are already at the top 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.349
 border 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.450
 So it's easy to get six out 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.250
 or then there are only three left 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.979
 tiny things you need to know 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.320
 the buzz of the first buzz in which the 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.970
 upper limit is equal to the lower one 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.450
 sum then just has a moment 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.729
 in the case, just the 1 second 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.310
 buzz in which the upper limit even 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.650
 smaller than the lower one here is the 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.360
 2 definitely smaller than the 3 the 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.370
 you just define it as zero 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.490
 should because if you add nothing adds 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.470
 Third off, buzz out in those 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.930
 the variable over the summed up is even 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.700
 does not occur quite nasty because you do 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.820
 that then so that you can only hum for 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.729
 calculate it equal to 1 that gives 9 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.410
 then for two finally again 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.599
 You do that again until you get to the top 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:05:00.310
 index and adds titan 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:02.650
 So in our case three times what is 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.110
 That's just a simple one again 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.849
 multiplication station does the same thing 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.580
 again to the sign only that did not add up 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.199
 but multiplied here it goes 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.720
 at the three go and the upper limit 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.639
 is 5 and then you just keep writing 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.130
 once in between, because it's just that 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.620
 Multiplication sign is everything 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.780
 guys and girls so now show me if 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.470
 you have understood that so what is there 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.060
 this one 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.650
 if you know it, write the solution 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.940
 with hashtags i'm a pro in the 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.380
 comments and if you do not faint 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.219
 shimmer has writes hashtag age 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.569
 lammert not feel comfortable 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:33.610
 here you can you now still pure 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.529
 how to prove it to everyone for thousands 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.210
 case on there are really cool tips 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:38.979
 If we could help them, let them 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.749
 a thumb up there and subscribe 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.919
 then you will not miss any more videos 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:43.029
 always have a nice drink and 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.740
 Paper planes in front of you build 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.740
 in the sense skin is pure and yes
