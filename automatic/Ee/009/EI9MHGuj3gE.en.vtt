00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
you by comparing it to true blue trees

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.180 
you by comparing it to true blue trees
black<00:00:58.960> cement<00:00:59.290> threes<00:00:59.590> and<00:00:59.860> white<00:01:00.010> cement

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190

trees

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.510 

so<00:01:16.370> go<00:01:16.670> with<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:16.850> back<00:01:17.090> view<00:01:17.300> first<00:01:18.400> right<00:01:19.400> off

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
so go with the back view first right off

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.320 
so go with the back view first right off
the<00:01:19.670> get-go<00:01:19.880> you<00:01:20.060> can<00:01:20.390> see<00:01:21.220> that<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.790> Oregon

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
the get-go you can see that the Oregon

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.620 
the get-go you can see that the Oregon
threes<00:01:25.270> are<00:01:26.270> way<00:01:26.480> darker<00:01:26.810> and<00:01:27.080> way<00:01:27.140> thicker

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
threes are way darker and way thicker

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.300 
threes are way darker and way thicker
now<00:01:29.630> add<00:01:29.810> another<00:01:29.960> pair<00:01:32.860> no<00:01:33.860> white<00:01:34.070> some

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
now add another pair no white some

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.270 
now add another pair no white some
enteries

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
enteries

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.940 
enteries
get<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.430> elephant<00:01:37.820> print<00:01:38.500> true<00:01:39.500> blue<00:01:39.680> trees

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
get the elephant print true blue trees

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.160 
get the elephant print true blue trees
so<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.000> elephant<00:01:41.360> print<00:01:41.570> on<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:41.869> oregon

trees<00:01:42.410> is<00:01:42.590> way<00:01:42.740> way<00:01:43.040> thicker<00:01:44.860> now<00:01:45.860> another

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
trees is way way thicker now another

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.980 
trees is way way thicker now another
