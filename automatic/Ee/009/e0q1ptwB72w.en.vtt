00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.520

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.700

 a ballad and a real cigarette 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.090
 I was one of those people who went to 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.670
 ballad and maybe light a cigarette 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.100
 such I had no notion of evil that this 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.230
 Could you do the cigarette for me? 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.880
 cause about 50 types of diseases 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.040
 many different 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.710
 the cigarette is fully connected to these 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.130
 especially diseases of the disease 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.899
 lung cancer this even the most 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.990
 of men dying of cancer 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.950
 is derived from the question of the use of 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.149
 cigarettes 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.039
 Did you know that cigarettes have? 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:22.209
 approximately 4,700 substances 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:24.159
 toxic substances of these 4,700 substances 

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:26.560
 are more harmful to health 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.380
 which ones are the first one is the 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.689
 nicotine this in the first place causes 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.420
 dependence which in my opinion would be 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.459
 the first cause to be prohibited from 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.709
 sale of cigarettes in brazil in the world 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:41.170
 This is a product that causes you to depend 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:42.490
 should not sell after all the government forbids 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.249
 some other things that cause 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.109
 addiction to nicotine comes faster 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:49.479
 to the brain than if it had taken a 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.219
 cocaine career that 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.619
 addition, it is totally related to 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.149
 cardiac and vascular problems 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.310
 second most toxic substance 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.919
 of cigarette smoke is 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.630
 carbon monoxide and what is carbon monoxide 

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:04.810
 knows that gas coming out of the exhaust 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.439
 of your car yes this is monoxide 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.909
 carbon 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.560
 Imagine only when you smoke a cigarette 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.119
 same thing you put your mouth on 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.220
 car exhaust and feel if that 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.440
 carbon monoxide combines with 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.240
 hemoglobin and it does and makes the 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.080
 amount of oxygen in your body 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.330
 decrease 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.980
 after a few hours the smoker he 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.819
 end up feeling some headaches 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.950
 he does not smoke 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.870
 obviously what is this when what 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.159
 you smoke decreases oxygen in your 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.650
 body and then when that substance 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.540
 toxic is eliminated by your body your 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.519
 body begins to return the amount of 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.319
 Oxygen earlier when this 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.540
 happens to the person who is addicted to 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.370
 cigarette is so accustomed to oxygen 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.349
 in the body a little lower than him 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.599
 begins to feel the lack of downloading 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.310
 again create this genius and this generates 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.230
 what a headache 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.480
 and then the person feels the need to 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.730
 re-smoking third substance 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.609
 seen as a villain of the cigarette is also 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.370
 the tar that tar product is 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:00.250
 associated with various types of cancer is not 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.189
 only that this substance has polonium
