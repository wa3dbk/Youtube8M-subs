00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.930
 Essentially dear friends today we are 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.109
 We will get acquainted with a laptop or rather 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:06.960
 its technical characteristic 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.419
 expedition with 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:10.569
 3,702 

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:12.899
 but the Danes will start with the application itself 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:15.089
 will find out 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.980
 processor info 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.320
 motherboard and 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.150
 of memory 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.279
 so here we are on the screen 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.029
 processor name intel core i ii 7 27 20 kilo m 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.029
 bridge scene 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.130
 l 3 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.430
 six megabytes 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.790
 motherboard 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.710
 memory is used here 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.500
 type ddr3 im 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.510
 8 gigabytes 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.220
 percentage slightly more detailed 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.290
 information 4 gigabytes of one 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.069
 lath 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:46.500
 it's 53 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.740
 606 7 megahertz and there is a second bar in general 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.950
 then the same 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.670
 that is, two strips of 4 gigabytes 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.850
 graphics it does not see foros jacky 550 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.760
 5 m 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.390
 one gigabyte 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.460
 closed this application we start 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.180
 first arrest 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.610
 a little more 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.750
 information 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.340
 let's start the motherboard processor well you 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.790
 see on the screen 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.740
 according to my description 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.740
 then get out a beer and one 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.680
 look at the motherboard 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.450
 tire type and kentucky ndpi ii 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.560
 in memory 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.370
 yet again 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.920
 gigabyte 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.920
 balls in more detail we see that it is samsung 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.010
 and bounce 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.510
 size by module type by module 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.890
 and ddr3 sdram memory chips 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.729
 the percentage of the chipset is not here with us 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:43.960
 information 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.229
 I will not continue the industrial zone of the system until 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.060
 call all 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.570
 thanks to the actions 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.050
 since I had to do this simulation 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.050
 expert therefore according to ng 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.360
 equal dol networks using up to 7 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.060
 home extended 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.850
 performance index 5 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.680
 the idea of ​​ethnos is sheer at the least 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.500
 about 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.330
 processor 7 and 4 mb 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.389
 memory 7 and 4 graphics 6 9 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.249
 for a m 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:16.319
 graphics for games 6 idea and hard disk 5 and 9 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.209
 thousand 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.839
 the smallest score is this 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.719
 hard drive is installed here two 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.229
 hard drive m 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:26.729
 jazz get to know next 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:29.729
 in bins to the system 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:32.859
 and choosing multimedia 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.589
 audio 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.279
 real n 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:39.279
 and high definition controllers in the morning 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.459
 slightly more information about 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.189
 sound processor 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.489
 gave data storage 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.389
 and here 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.729
 worth two hard drives 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:52.279
 here is one year two 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:54.899
 or dividends and here 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:57.899
 this is samsung to he 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.649
 that's the name 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:04.949
 logically drives and we see 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:07.889
 in the second hard drive 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.679
 information 

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:12.579
 dividends 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.759
 but it is logical 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:16.079
 Further 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.589
 here's just information even more 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.589
 detailed on Zhukovsky disk 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.829
 sato you 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:31.499
 network 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:32.260
 nko 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.359
 son of may 3 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.359
 the thief of you 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:42.319
 such information 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.859
 close what device is 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.649
 device bendus 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:49.649
 here is a summary 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.229
 the battery here 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:58.339
 so again schedule 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.959
 here they are 2gs kan 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.939
 application 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.290
 The range of basic applications 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.519
 there is not very much in it 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.719
 engine mounted sleep 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.729
 according to his 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.629
 close 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:22.629
 with pension and Athens Kikvete Center 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:26.729
 further look 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.729
 properties 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.780
 I have already shown the minimum 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.499
 this petya is 9 points 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:37.639
 brief information 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.889
 later system 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.580
 can start the device manager 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.580
 see what devices are already there 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:51.879
 Bluetooth module 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:54.129
 network adapters to them 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:55.699
 accordingly there is a universal 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.110
 monitor 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.110
 In this case, they 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.689
 screen resolution 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:06.900
 screen 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.120
 brightness settings them 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.850
 now you are the brightest sleep maxim 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.610
 You do not see on the screen but the brightness 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.110
 really very high 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.110
 go back ago 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:21.819
 and close 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:22.939
 what do we have 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:24.069
 the second lies 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:26.339
 the second we have adjustment cutting 

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:27.069
 us 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:28.229
 sow 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.469
 nutrition 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:31.379
 Bluetooth m 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:32.389
 farther 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.430
 all other applications may 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.139
 means if we click on samson 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:38.610
 key which is on the panel with 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.689
 keyboard 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:42.639
 sort of social itself on a key called you 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.490
 we click on the screen to handle 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.430
 settings 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.479
 sound 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:47.889
 a year 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.259
 tabs are important that the sound level of the speaker 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:52.020
 and a microphone can be built 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.139
 disable 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:54.490
 You'll see providing 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.069
 stable sound quality and so on 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.210
 washed turn on the tab 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.400
 2 is set here 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.860
 conventional dynamics and so let's say a subwoofer 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.039
 if so called 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:08.839
 speaker system mb in this case i 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.960
 turned on the equalizer setting 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.160
 low frequencies at maximum average 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.860
 put 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.059
 on the stage 

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:16.949
 stereo percentage 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:19.589
 set slightly above average 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:20.879
 equalizer 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:23.129
 but again astrologer laser 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:25.169
 he used here 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.229
 here are thirty one hertz to sixteen 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:28.699
 kHz 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.610
 retained that on construction 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.010
 system let and czech me and 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.300
 in general, it is not so important for us 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.139
 microphone 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.789
 and additionally 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:42.809
 restore settings and connectors 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:43.580
 there is 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.129
 that is, when connecting for example 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:48.129
 headphone appears on the screen 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:52.490
 where we can choose percent mode 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.889
 headphone work there for example if we 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:55.849
 switch 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:57.529
 thomas microphone opens 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:59.389
 microphone and accordingly we can 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:06:59.979
 poland 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:01.979
 switch it for example to headphones 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:04.089
 use as headphones but it 

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:08.129
 as a last resort and if you eat will be 9 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:09.189
 this period 

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:12.189
 and just ordinary headphones 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:15.849
 from six ball 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:16.970
 thanks to all 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:17.670
 by the park
