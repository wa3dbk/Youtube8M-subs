00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.629
 My name is AndrÃ©s Contreras, I am the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.599
 first of 16 colombia I have come with 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.760
 matteo martÃ­nez camilo in av and we came to 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.410
 participate in the invitation disciple 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.630
 to lima peru 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.910
 and that's what we've done so far 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.040
 and really, it's something that is the same 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.800
 in the whole world then we have very 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.140
 ok with that and those things are good at 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.350
 notice that there are no differences but 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.610
 that we can understand ourselves almost 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.610
 that sometimes without having to talk 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.000
 Here are some steps ahead 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.489
 gigantic in terms of industry there are 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.800
 enough that there is national the street is 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.940
 spectacular have the passes that one does not 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.970
 imagine that they existed in 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.900
 Latin America and the climate also helps 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.450
 a lot of support then there is here the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.310
 almost that sometimes we think that instead 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.780
 of going to usa in calama could not come to 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.410
 Peru and also does a lot of things 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.410
 good here 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.619
 Y 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.760
 by sharing with them things like 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.700
 filming a video part and that 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.380
 we share personal things too 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.030
 things that soon 11 at the beginning never 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.840
 he thought he might be talking to the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.840
 rider of that 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.830
 It has people outside it's like you have 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.830
 They taught rather than the films themselves 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.830
 do what 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.030
 always wants to ride with people from another 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.030
 country we all use 9 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.550
 good the normal fact of being with the 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.340
 Peruvians here to see them as is the moral is 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.960
 than in another country different but but it's 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.630
 sensational because we are sharing 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.340
 with another culture and we are sharing 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.550
 today but we live the least they are 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.550
 believe
