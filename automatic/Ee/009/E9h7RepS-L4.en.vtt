00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.400
 Hello my dear, everything has today. 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.500
 here to record a different video for 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.320
 6 June 1 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.350
 léo hear this one O that will give to 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.400
 you how to do this morning is it for the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.300
 sun sunrise know there she is well 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.949
 beautiful it uses four different colors and 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.579
 It's quite easy to do. 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.210
 I think you're going to like me right. 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.180
 I have done in all the nails just need this 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.960
 hence what I 'm going to do together with you 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:46.289
 but rest is ready and it's very simple 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.160
 maybe you will need are the nail polish 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.230
 extra brightness and the sponge of course also 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.180
 cotton people for him for sure 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.610
 because this line does with anyone who suggests 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.039
 So let's start first of all, I 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.000
 I used this slot here to order there cajá 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.150
 mango to paint all so yellow 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:14.490
 I've told them all first of all . 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:16.049
 yellow he is well 42 layers 7 the other 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.180
 Enamel I'm using people this 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.189
 oranges that I found beautiful when I 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.030
 I bought the daughter works with her. 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:27.420
 finances color that is the risotto of 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.829
 Little man is an orange world is well 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.229
 of the risqué josé neci tricolor is in 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:39.060
 plant is honored should also not affect 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.460
 here in the middle and to all the agents in this 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.140
 same enamel I used in the week 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.860
 passed to make the nail of b 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.009
 Kisses there, it's beautiful and I fell in love 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.079
 for him the china in the un was how to do 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.030
 a new thing for you I do not use 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.110
 even renato that I used to make a 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.479
 end point at the base of the nail 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.880
 so I found that combined're very 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.430
 so this is of course going to be pregnant 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.700
 put on as a belt 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.910
 So, to start with, it passes two hands. 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.020
 of being yellow and what I do 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.530
 I make people 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.570
 all the lines together so I 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.250
 I paint all the engineering of two hands 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.220
 only of course after that I will do 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.100
 Grace, I do one mother at a time. 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.600
 So what do I do here? I'm already there. 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.810
 spain is alone i'll do in 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.040
 even the dirty one because that's where I 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.640
 I've already done my nails. 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.310
 It's there, I want them now. 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.450
 we had now that after yellow 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:44.000
 orange and I put it on the sponge are 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:49.220
 kind in secret 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.239
 soon he'm not sure where I come come 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.970
 here o 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.239
 and I'll do this and if that color in 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.459
 all hand dance lines're what's more 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.010
 easy to top enamel here is accurate 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.709
 By making stick nail nail 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.260
 So I come here, I'm only going because 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:11.090
 They always try to start from the bottom up. 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:16.120
 because the gradient effect will get better 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.680
 Of course you are from the bottom up. 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.420
 more or less so it is clear that it is a 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.360
 line more or less right? 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.850
 but I tried not to leave so much market 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.100
 line a little bit the same because it gives 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.610
 So much higher and one more to 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:37.570
 low and the gradient effect will 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:44.000
 more true true 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:46.519
 And look, I made orange, too. Forest 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.940
 all grass all vaccines after the 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:53.480
 We'll take this picture and now picks 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.980
 the pink glaze was here I'm not 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.980
 alone can be on the same side 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.610
 doing the same procedure is easy 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.070
 in all actions 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.360
 but now that I've done the others I'll hop 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:11.990
 direct press starts here under 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.970
 bone bin 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:18.270
 The more the picadinho he gets like this 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.970
 the enamel is better than me and you're gradient 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.950
 stay more but there is a real 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.050
 so you start from below and 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.390
 putting you put shows here 's how 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.330
 and is filled with down and when 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:34.010
 going up the is going to have less enamel 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:38.640
 What's the answer? It 's getting more like this. 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:41.880
 Look what the gradient effect is now 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.200
 this color here this glaze that do not even know 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:51.840
 that you the same cell edson ex agreement 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:54.660
 72 believe you read it I'll get it here 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:59.280
 I post here but they can use any 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:02.490
 red like that or any brand steering wheel 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.830
 It stays the same here as it is well 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:12.710
 Then dark that goes from varginha begins 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:12.710
 well at the right point and goes up 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.090
 One of the things I did to get a 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.830
 more about this online tena that was 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.380
 I come here again O 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.330
 so then I did it all this 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.540
 process not all mothers now I 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:39.630
 I come here quickly with this orange 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:44.790
 prayer and I go over here just over 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.540
 an orange another wee O 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.180
 a little 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.080
 cover a little more yellow passes a 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:55.310
 a little bit on top of the rose because it 's 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:58.050
 the objective to be very integral of 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:04.530
 right and now I come here again with 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:07.380
 one more time and this is a 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.200
 retouching of people very fast just to 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:13.470
 be well degraded and even well 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:16.170
 inspired by the colors and I will pass here by 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.210
 Why is this rose mixing now? 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.780
 orange that is already on top of the 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.940
 rose 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:25.130
 This wine that we pass last 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.130
 that I did not see gets too marked 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:38.069
 look at that and it looks like the gradient in O 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:43.080
 end 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:47.599
 now the very simple last step is to get 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:52.819
 that its extra brightness is to go over 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:55.819
 A very generous layer is to stay. 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:55.819
 butt 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:06.599
 just look at the gradient was lion people well 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:10.289
 integrated is really 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:12.870
 It's now to close, we're going 

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:15.240
 clean and around the nail because with 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:21.120
 this technique of the towers have no way 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:23.610
 escape as not to dirty the e-mec 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.630
 company is fast showing the 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.630
 end result for you 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:42.970
 and look at the finished nail 

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:47.740
 No , welcome, we ask. 

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:50.139
 legislation in super easy to do 

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:53.590
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:55.180
 line that would mark the end of summer and 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:58.539
 early spring 

00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:01.389
 nothing like reliving the beautiful days of sunshine 

00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:04.690
 This is the second sunset in our 

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:08.229
 edition of this hope you have 

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:10.919
 liked and until the next video lets me 

00:08:08.229 --> 00:08:10.919
 see followed
