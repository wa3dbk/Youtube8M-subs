specifically<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:18.630> going<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.900> have<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.020> same

specifically it's going to have the same

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.530 
specifically it's going to have the same

going to see a small smidgen of a bump

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.160 
going to see a small smidgen of a bump
it's<00:02:29.790> going<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.060> be<00:02:30.150> bumped<00:02:30.450> from<00:02:30.570> 1,000<00:02:31.290> 1,050

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
it's going to be bumped from 1,000 1,050

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.680 
it's going to be bumped from 1,000 1,050
supposedly<00:02:34.170> most<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:34.740> is<00:02:34.920> down<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.280> TDP

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
supposedly most of this is down to TDP

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.780 
supposedly most of this is down to TDP
but<00:02:36.690> maybe<00:02:37.410> some<00:02:37.860> manufacturers<00:02:38.520> are<00:02:38.670> going

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
but maybe some manufacturers are going

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.550 
but maybe some manufacturers are going
to<00:02:38.850> push<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.600> envelope<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:40.020> little<00:02:40.050> bit<00:02:40.350> more

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
to push the envelope a little bit more

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.560 
to push the envelope a little bit more
it's<00:02:40.830> more<00:02:40.920> than<00:02:41.370> beer<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.970> that's<00:02:42.330> the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
it's more than beer and that's the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.790 
it's more than beer and that's the
change<00:02:43.490> it's<00:02:44.490> going<00:02:44.970> form<00:02:45.300> for<00:02:45.750> gigs<00:02:46.020> 28<00:02:46.530> gigs

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
change it's going form for gigs 28 gigs

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.210 
change it's going form for gigs 28 gigs
so<00:02:47.130> basically<00:02:48.000> it's<00:02:48.120> double<00:02:48.630> and

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
so basically it's double and

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.040 
so basically it's double and
specifically<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.340> actual<00:02:51.300> core<00:02:51.570> clocks<00:02:51.870> have

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
specifically the actual core clocks have

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.380 
specifically the actual core clocks have
also<00:02:52.350> raised<00:02:52.620> as<00:02:52.860> well<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.700> it's<00:02:54.030> going<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.300> be

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
also raised as well so it's going to be

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.180 
also raised as well so it's going to be
twelve<00:02:54.840> hundred<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.440> 50<00:02:55.920> megahertz

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
twelve hundred and 50 megahertz

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.420 
twelve hundred and 50 megahertz

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
currently to 1500 megahertz for the for

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.490 
currently to 1500 megahertz for the for
the<00:02:59.459> rebrand<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.660> that's<00:03:00.930> going<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.230> provide

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
the rebrand so that's going to provide

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.020 
the rebrand so that's going to provide

rebranded<00:03:19.290> same<00:03:19.560> amount<00:03:19.860> shaders<00:03:20.250> is

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
rebranded same amount shaders is

currently<00:03:20.870> 2560<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.560> core<00:03:22.769> clock<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.160> going

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
currently 2560 the core clock is going

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.100 
currently 2560 the core clock is going
to<00:03:23.370> be<00:03:23.430> raised<00:03:23.640> around<00:03:23.820> 50<00:03:24.330> megahertz<00:03:24.630> as<00:03:24.930> well

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
to be raised around 50 megahertz as well

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.400 
to be raised around 50 megahertz as well
so<00:03:25.350> it's<00:03:25.410> going<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.620> be<00:03:25.820> 1010<00:03:26.820> but<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.959> memory

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
so it's going to be 1010 but the memory

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.650 
so it's going to be 1010 but the memory
configurations<00:03:29.160> are<00:03:29.370> going<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:29.970> be<00:03:30.090> as<00:03:30.269> above

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660

back<00:04:02.640> in<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:02.970> day<00:04:03.120> but<00:04:04.280> it's<00:04:05.280> not<00:04:05.640> a<00:04:05.670> bad<00:04:05.940> thing

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
back in the day but it's not a bad thing

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.940 
back in the day but it's not a bad thing
you<00:04:06.540> know<00:04:06.660> three<00:04:06.959> brands<00:04:07.440> are<00:04:07.590> for<00:04:08.130> purposes

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
you know three brands are for purposes

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.720 
you know three brands are for purposes
but<00:04:10.950> you<00:04:11.670> know<00:04:11.820> I<00:04:12.769> guess<00:04:13.769> there's<00:04:14.459> going<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.700> be

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
but you know I guess there's going to be

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.250 
but you know I guess there's going to be
small<00:04:15.030> changes<00:04:15.480> obviously<00:04:15.630> there's<00:04:16.049> going<00:04:16.109> to

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
small changes obviously there's going to

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.810 
small changes obviously there's going to
be<00:04:16.290> a<00:04:16.350> small<00:04:16.470> performance<00:04:16.799> bump<00:04:17.400> with<00:04:17.700> the

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
be a small performance bump with the

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.610 
be a small performance bump with the
core<00:04:18.090> clocks<00:04:18.479> and<00:04:18.750> obviously<00:04:18.989> going<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.290> get<00:04:19.410> a

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
core clocks and obviously going to get a

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.850 
core clocks and obviously going to get a
core<00:04:20.340> so<00:04:20.790> a<00:04:20.820> memory<00:04:21.299> bump<00:04:21.780> as<00:04:21.989> well<00:04:22.169> how<00:04:22.650> much

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
core so a memory bump as well how much

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.589 
core so a memory bump as well how much
extra<00:04:23.190> difference<00:04:23.880> is<00:04:24.000> going<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.210> make<00:04:24.390> maybe

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
extra difference is going to make maybe

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.350 
extra difference is going to make maybe
five<00:04:24.960> ten<00:04:25.229> percent<00:04:25.650> I'm<00:04:25.830> just<00:04:26.099> guessing<00:04:26.430> I'm

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
five ten percent I'm just guessing I'm

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.790 
five ten percent I'm just guessing I'm
basing<00:04:27.719> that<00:04:27.750> on<00:04:27.990> nothing<00:04:28.469> other<00:04:28.650> than

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
basing that on nothing other than

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.890 
basing that on nothing other than
pulling<00:04:29.009> numbers<00:04:29.189> out<00:04:29.490> of<00:04:29.580> my<00:04:29.699> ass<00:04:29.909> and<00:04:30.270> from

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
pulling numbers out of my ass and from

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.469 
pulling numbers out of my ass and from
benchmarking<00:04:31.680> that<00:04:31.860> r9<00:04:32.219> 290x<00:04:32.759> and<00:04:33.270> playing

are<00:04:40.680> you<00:04:40.800> running<00:04:41.250> what<00:04:42.060> settings<00:04:42.599> are<00:04:42.689> you

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
are you running what settings are you

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.809 
are you running what settings are you
running<00:04:43.229> are<00:04:43.409> you<00:04:43.590> for<00:04:44.009> example<00:04:44.370> doing<00:04:44.550> down

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
running are you for example doing down

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.270 
running are you for example doing down
so<00:04:45.090> I'm<00:04:45.210> playing<00:04:45.569> are<00:04:45.810> you<00:04:45.990> running<00:04:46.349> at<00:04:46.469> 4k<00:04:47.009> I'm

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
so I'm playing are you running at 4k I'm

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.790 
so I'm playing are you running at 4k I'm
obviously<00:04:48.180> a<00:04:48.419> ridiculous<00:04:49.020> example<00:04:49.500> is<00:04:49.560> if

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
obviously a ridiculous example is if

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.640 
obviously a ridiculous example is if
you're<00:04:49.949> running<00:04:50.099> a<00:04:50.310> 640<00:04:50.849> by<00:04:51.000> 480<00:04:51.509> core<00:04:52.379> clocks

you're running a 640 by 480 core clocks

you're running a 640 by 480 core clocks

going to make no difference on the other
hand<00:04:55.590> if<00:04:55.740> you're<00:04:55.860> running<00:04:55.949> at<00:04:56.189> 4k<00:04:56.729> and<00:04:57.000> your

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
the problem and blah blah blah but

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.420 
the problem and blah blah blah but
either<00:05:08.789> way<00:05:09.150> it's<00:05:09.330> nice<00:05:09.629> the<00:05:10.529> price<00:05:10.949> is<00:05:11.189> really

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
either way it's nice the price is really

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.179 
either way it's nice the price is really
where<00:05:11.729> I'm<00:05:12.029> concerned<00:05:12.449> or<00:05:13.080> not<00:05:13.319> concerned<00:05:13.830> but

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:14.189 
where I'm concerned or not concerned but

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.100 
where I'm concerned or not concerned but
the<00:05:14.669> price<00:05:14.909> is<00:05:14.939> really<00:05:15.389> where<00:05:15.539> it<00:05:15.659> comes<00:05:15.870> into

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
the price is really where it comes into

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.149 
the price is really where it comes into
for<00:05:16.620> me<00:05:16.819> obviously<00:05:18.229> the<00:05:19.229> higher<00:05:19.650> clocked

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:20.159 
for me obviously the higher clocked

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:22.279 
for me obviously the higher clocked
memory<00:05:20.669> might<00:05:21.150> push<00:05:21.419> up<00:05:21.599> the<00:05:21.629> price<00:05:21.719> a<00:05:21.960> little

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
memory might push up the price a little

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.580 
memory might push up the price a little
bit<00:05:22.939> what<00:05:23.939> I'd<00:05:24.060> like<00:05:24.330> is<00:05:24.389> for<00:05:24.599> it<00:05:24.750> to<00:05:24.810> be<00:05:25.050> pretty

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
bit what I'd like is for it to be pretty

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.920 
bit what I'd like is for it to be pretty
much<00:05:25.830> in<00:05:26.039> the<00:05:26.069> same<00:05:26.310> ballpark<00:05:26.639> as<00:05:27.090> the<00:05:27.449> common

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.019 
much in the same ballpark as the common

expensive because otherwise it's kind of

number out of thin air let's assume that

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:52.790 
number out of thin air let's assume that
the<00:05:48.000> online<00:05:48.389> 290x<00:05:49.169> is<00:05:49.529> like<00:05:50.839> 240<00:05:51.839> pounds<00:05:52.529> when

now and maybe there's some changes to
the<00:06:10.289> cooler<00:06:10.710> maybe<00:06:11.339> overclocks<00:06:12.029> a<00:06:12.150> little<00:06:12.389> bit

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
the cooler maybe overclocks a little bit

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:13.459 
the cooler maybe overclocks a little bit
better<00:06:12.599> maybe<00:06:12.779> there's<00:06:13.110> some<00:06:13.229> slight<00:06:13.439> changes

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:19.879 
to the architecture what have you then
yeah<00:06:17.430> I<00:06:17.669> can<00:06:17.909> see<00:06:18.180> it<00:06:18.330> being<00:06:18.599> a<00:06:18.779> nice<00:06:19.169> upgrade

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
along those lines then maybe you know

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.999 
along those lines then maybe you know
you'd<00:06:39.839> be<00:06:39.870> okay

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009 
you'd be okay

you'd be okay

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:46.820 
however and you've got the money behind
you<00:06:44.849> then<00:06:45.389> obviously<00:06:45.629> you're<00:06:46.229> probably<00:06:46.529> not

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
you then obviously you're probably not

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.079 
you then obviously you're probably not

which are obviously going to be the
