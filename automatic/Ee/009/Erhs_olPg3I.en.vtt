00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.970
 Now, today, what we have to do is look at the web [geography] cache there. 

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:14.129
 And most of us are going to use the webpage, on the web, google map and we have 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.830
 [Samsung Wave] 533 is here, so we will be showing you DondeLite. 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:23.320
 And what do I want to do, I want to tell you a mapping trick with this, 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.109
 Because this map is actually a web browser, it has a cache if we don't 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.230
 The graph is reloaded and there is no access to the data. 

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:37.640
 So, you will see that we don't have a SIM card here, we are currently on Wi-Fi. I'm going 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.829
 What I did was turn off Wi-Fi and the way we are going to use this map, then on 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.390
 One last point, use the compass... this is some sort of sorting or partial sorting in the park square. I do not 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.890
 Know, we will find it. good or not? 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.799
 Turn off Wi-Fi technology, let's find out now. 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:59.689
 We are making progress, I don't have a GPS signal very much. 

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:00.960
 [Swim] 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.960
 As you can see, 

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:11.959
 816 meters, it said that there is no direction but, oh, go straight. determine. 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:22.329
 This is very typical, it gets the GPS direction [signal], you go a bit, 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.700
 At that time it only knew about it, which direction you were going. 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.189
 As you can see the map we are still using, we are still on Wi-Fi or data, we are not 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.019
 Not even having a SIM card. 

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:38.310
 Now that we have closed down on the map, there are no streets here, we sort in some parks. 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.310
 Hey, we have to use the screen in this direction, I can tell you if there is any data. 

00:01:45.728 --> 00:01:50.929
 connection. No, turn on Wi-Fi? No. You can see that there is 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.409
 No maps were pulled down. This is very useful, we can see us 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.909
 Relative position, relative to waypoints, even on this screen. 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.909
 However, we want to use the direction of the screen. It wants us to go and let us be excited. 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:36.159
 150 meters, somewhere in front of you. 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.620
 [go] 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.860
 [sound go] 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.270
 [go] 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.500
 [sound go] 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.500
 It said that somewhere here, 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.379
 115 meters 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.609
 13, right in front. 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.989
 Note that the arrows turn flat because we are getting closer. 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.589
 One is on the right and a little regret to the left. 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:36.169
 95 meters, 93 ... left... 80 meters.... 76 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.199
 a little bit of rights 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:57.899
 57, 55, trees in these places 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:14.900
 Well, now, at this point, 25 ... 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.310
 The accuracy of the GPS we started at the edge of the problem. 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:26.469
 So what do we do, let us see where we are, not on the map, but we see 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.470
 We are more or less pointing in the right direction. You will see that we have our position, 

00:04:35.168 --> 00:04:40.279
 You can't see, and the yellow dot is our waypoint. 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:52.279
 Somewhere here. 

00:04:58.728 --> 00:04:59.928
 I am going to find it. 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:04.429
 There is also a fairly easy to find, a really huge cache.
