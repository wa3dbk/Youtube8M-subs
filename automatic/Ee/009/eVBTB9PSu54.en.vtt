00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
drain refill on the engine coolant

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.419 
drain refill on the engine coolant
all<00:00:11.849> right<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.150> drain<00:00:12.480> plug<00:00:13.110> here<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.650> very

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
all right the drain plug here is very

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.150 
all right the drain plug here is very
conveniently<00:00:15.059> located<00:00:15.710> right<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.949> middle

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
conveniently located right in the middle

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.800 
conveniently located right in the middle
and<00:00:18.199> has<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.230> hole<00:00:19.619> right<00:00:20.520> below<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.630> can

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
and has a hole right below it so you can

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.580 
and has a hole right below it so you can
drain<00:00:22.590> into<00:00:22.980> your<00:00:23.130> pan<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:27.170> we're<00:00:28.170> also<00:00:28.410> going

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
drain into your pan and we're also going

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.349 
drain into your pan and we're also going
to<00:00:28.650> take<00:00:28.830> off<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.220> radiator<00:00:29.490> cap<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.240> can

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
to take off the radiator cap so we can

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.419 
to take off the radiator cap so we can
let<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.599> fall<00:00:30.810> out<00:00:30.840> better

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:37.429 

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:54.790 

near<00:00:38.429> you

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.080 

we<00:00:55.800> took<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.130> drain<00:00:56.370> plug<00:00:56.550> all<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.880> way<00:00:56.970> out

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
we took the drain plug all the way out

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.670 
we took the drain plug all the way out
just<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:58.050> helps<00:00:58.200> speed<00:00:58.500> up<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
just because it helps speed up the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.950 
just because it helps speed up the
process<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.280> watch<00:00:59.460> out<00:00:59.670> if<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.180> first

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
process but watch out if you do it first

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.810 
process but watch out if you do it first
thing<00:01:01.320> when<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.590> first<00:01:01.800> open<00:01:02.220> up<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.550> plug

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
thing when you first open up the plug

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.880 
thing when you first open up the plug
it's<00:01:03.390> probably<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.870> concussion<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.680> make<00:01:04.860> a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
it's probably in a concussion I make a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.700 
it's probably in a concussion I make a
big<00:01:05.159> mess<00:01:05.369> all<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.729> coolant<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.470> let<00:01:07.619> it

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
big mess all that coolant so we let it

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.740 
big mess all that coolant so we let it
drain<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.160> little<00:01:08.400> bit<00:01:08.550> and<00:01:08.729> then<00:01:09.240> when<00:01:09.660> it

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
drain for a little bit and then when it

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.109 
drain for a little bit and then when it
slowed<00:01:10.050> down<00:01:10.350> took<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> plug<00:01:11.430> out<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.820> speed

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
slowed down took the plug out to speed

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.950 
slowed down took the plug out to speed
it<00:01:12.210> up<00:01:12.300> anyways<00:01:13.400> it's<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:15.030> about<00:01:15.390> done<00:01:15.690> so

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
it up anyways it's just about done so

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.900 
it up anyways it's just about done so
put<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.460> drain<00:01:17.460> plug

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
put in the drain plug

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.510 
put in the drain plug
now<00:01:18.590> just<00:01:19.590> needs<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:19.979> hand<00:01:20.220> tight<00:01:20.490> and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
now just needs to be hand tight and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.540 
now just needs to be hand tight and
don't<00:01:21.060> go<00:01:21.240> crazy<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.080> plastic<00:01:22.550> and

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
don't go crazy on it's just plastic and

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.180 
don't go crazy on it's just plastic and
then<00:01:23.940> that'll<00:01:24.330> do<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.570> okay<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> refill<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
then that'll do it okay to refill the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.460 
then that'll do it okay to refill the
cooling<00:01:26.520> system<00:01:26.910> well<00:01:27.539> well<00:01:28.080> we're<00:01:28.259> going<00:01:28.380> to

order to mount the funnel on to the

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.380 
order to mount the funnel on to the
radiator<00:02:05.550> and<00:02:07.190> it's<00:02:08.190> hogan<00:02:08.459> Philip<00:02:08.700> okay<00:02:09.119> here

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
radiator and it's hogan Philip okay here

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.240 
radiator and it's hogan Philip okay here
we<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.599> our<00:02:09.720> small<00:02:09.989> adapter<00:02:10.289> or<00:02:10.679> small<00:02:10.979> cap

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
we have our small adapter or small cap

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.180 
we have our small adapter or small cap
we're<00:02:12.180> going<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.420> mount<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.930> just<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.890> way<00:02:14.010> we

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
we're going to mount it just the way we

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.210 
we're going to mount it just the way we
would<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.910> radiator<00:02:15.390> cap<00:02:16.099> tighten<00:02:17.099> it<00:02:17.190> down

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
would the radiator cap tighten it down

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.850 
would the radiator cap tighten it down
and<00:02:17.730> then<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.810> allows<00:02:18.959> us<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.500> mount<00:02:19.650> our

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
and then that allows us to mount our

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.180 
and then that allows us to mount our
funnel<00:02:20.280> just<00:02:20.489> going<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.300> push<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:21.720> there<00:02:21.870> so

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
funnel just going to push in there so

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.430 
funnel just going to push in there so
snug<00:02:23.190> enough<00:02:23.310> not<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.730> leak<00:02:23.940> now<00:02:24.930> we<00:02:24.989> can<00:02:25.200> fill

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
snug enough not to leak now we can fill

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:33.530 
snug enough not to leak now we can fill
it<00:02:25.560> up

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.660 

and<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:34.660> we<00:02:34.780> refilled<00:02:35.260> our<00:02:35.620> accord<00:02:36.190> with<00:02:36.520> the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
and so we refilled our accord with the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.500 
and so we refilled our accord with the
genuine<00:02:37.120> blue<00:02:37.750> Honda<00:02:38.680> coolant<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:39.510> because

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
genuine blue Honda coolant and because

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.880 
genuine blue Honda coolant and because
that<00:02:40.630> was<00:02:40.750> specifically<00:02:41.260> designed<00:02:41.680> for<00:02:41.740> the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
that was specifically designed for the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.650 
that was specifically designed for the
Honda<00:02:42.040> vehicle<00:02:42.460> so<00:02:42.820> that's<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.360> one<00:02:43.480> that

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
Honda vehicle so that's the one that

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.570 
Honda vehicle so that's the one that
well<00:02:44.410> is<00:02:44.920> definitely<00:02:45.400> recommended<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:46.120> then

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
well is definitely recommended and then

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.950 
well is definitely recommended and then
what<00:02:48.580> we're<00:02:48.700> going<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.850> do<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:49.270> we're<00:02:49.780> going<00:02:49.810> to

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.500 
what we're going to do is we're going to
run<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.440> engine<00:02:50.640> because<00:02:51.640> right<00:02:52.120> now<00:02:52.240> we<00:02:52.300> have

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
run the engine because right now we have

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.690 
run the engine because right now we have
our<00:02:52.540> overflow<00:02:53.020> going<00:02:53.680> here<00:02:53.950> some<00:02:54.550> of<00:02:54.580> the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
our overflow going here some of the

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.100 
our overflow going here some of the
school<00:02:54.970> is<00:02:55.150> they<00:02:55.270> get<00:02:55.480> sucked<00:02:55.750> into<00:02:55.960> the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
school is they get sucked into the

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.560 
school is they get sucked into the
engine<00:02:56.230> once<00:02:56.650> it's<00:02:56.830> running<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.480> once<00:02:58.480> the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
engine once it's running and once the

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.430 
engine once it's running and once the
thermostat<00:02:59.020> opens<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.710> the<00:03:01.290> coolant<00:03:02.290> is

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
thermostat opens and the coolant is

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.230 
thermostat opens and the coolant is
flowing<00:03:02.470> through<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.100> engine<00:03:03.430> it's<00:03:03.910> going<00:03:04.090> to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
flowing through the engine it's going to

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.000 
flowing through the engine it's going to
clear<00:03:04.510> out<00:03:04.540> any<00:03:04.780> air<00:03:05.020> bubbles<00:03:05.050> that<00:03:05.710> are<00:03:05.770> in

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
clear out any air bubbles that are in

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.230 
clear out any air bubbles that are in
there<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.370> then<00:03:07.120> when<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:07.900> fan<00:03:08.170> kicks<00:03:08.500> on

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
there and then when the fan kicks on

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.430 
there and then when the fan kicks on
then<00:03:10.240> you<00:03:10.780> want<00:03:11.020> to<00:03:11.790> turn<00:03:12.790> on<00:03:12.940> your<00:03:13.120> heater

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
then you want to turn on your heater

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.530 
then you want to turn on your heater
which<00:03:14.610> when<00:03:15.610> you<00:03:15.700> first<00:03:15.910> start<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.240> engine

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
which when you first start the engine

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.990 
which when you first start the engine
have<00:03:17.230> all<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:17.650> turned<00:03:18.040> off<00:03:18.220> have<00:03:18.580> the<00:03:18.730> heater

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
have all that turned off have the heater

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.720 
have all that turned off have the heater
off<00:03:19.270> a/c<00:03:19.660> off<00:03:20.020> a<00:03:20.050> lot<00:03:20.320> of<00:03:20.410> stuff<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.770> then<00:03:21.520> but

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
off a/c off a lot of stuff and then but

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.490 
off a/c off a lot of stuff and then but
once<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.120> fan<00:03:22.330> kick<00:03:22.540> in<00:03:22.750> turn<00:03:23.080> on<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.320> heater

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
once a fan kick in turn on the heater

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.530 
once a fan kick in turn on the heater
let<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.250> coolant<00:03:24.610> flow<00:03:24.700> into<00:03:25.210> the<00:03:25.360> heater

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
let the coolant flow into the heater

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.440 
let the coolant flow into the heater
cord<00:03:25.960> and<00:03:26.170> then<00:03:26.880> once<00:03:27.880> you're<00:03:28.000> at<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.120> point

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
cord and then once you're at that point

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.220 
cord and then once you're at that point
it<00:03:28.930> should<00:03:29.020> be<00:03:29.380> full<00:03:29.650> then<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.520> go<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.030> you

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
it should be full then you go and you

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.800 
it should be full then you go and you
plug<00:03:32.230> up<00:03:32.440> if<00:03:33.130> you<00:03:33.280> have<00:03:33.400> this<00:03:33.610> cool<00:03:34.390> funnel

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
plug up if you have this cool funnel

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.440 
plug up if you have this cool funnel
here<00:03:34.990> you<00:03:35.620> plug<00:03:35.950> it<00:03:36.100> up<00:03:36.220> here<00:03:36.550> and<00:03:36.760> then<00:03:37.270> you

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
here you plug it up here and then you

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.630 
here you plug it up here and then you
can<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:37.810> remove<00:03:38.170> it<00:03:38.380> but<00:03:38.920> before<00:03:39.070> you<00:03:39.430> do

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
can to remove it but before you do

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.410 
actually just go back a step you want to
squeeze<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.230> radiator<00:03:44.740> hose<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:45.670> that<00:03:45.700> when

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
squeeze the radiator hose so that when

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.930 
squeeze the radiator hose so that when
you<00:03:46.570> plug<00:03:47.110> it<00:03:47.320> and<00:03:47.440> remove<00:03:47.740> it<00:03:47.950> you're<00:03:48.760> not

you plug it and remove it you're not

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:57.350 
you plug it and remove it you're not
overflowing<00:03:49.720> here<00:03:49.930> at<00:03:49.990> the<00:03:50.110> cap<00:03:50.820> that's<00:03:51.820> it
