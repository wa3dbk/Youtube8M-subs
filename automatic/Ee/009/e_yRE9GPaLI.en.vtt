00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.640
 hello friends like that 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.889
 countdown begins the game bully troy you 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.200
 we are shown 

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:13.059
 the gun that is going to climb 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.720
 Here is such a nice man beautiful 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.019
 suit with excellent sex scheme 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.630
 already 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:22.090
 my ears like god wanted to say a mustache 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.189
 galoshes in general is a great man very 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.390
 cute as you can see and that he will 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.189
 an hour to do you will not believe it will 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.929
 fly bullets I donâ€™t know why 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.039
 does pay him for it or he just 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.140
 works for the soul 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.120
 maybe from him such a hobby but it 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.879
 absolutely mad game and I know 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.829
 first filmed this review as a summer play yes 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.260
 but I decided to overwrite the sound from above 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.660
 because this game is too freaky and I 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.219
 there just behaved himself terribly and very 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.050
 panicked really gras very 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.020
 tough because here you need to manage 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.730
 a bullet that flies very fast and with 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.660
 This also contrive to get into all sorts of 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.850
 checkpoints are really hard enough 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.519
 but very interesting first you need to get there 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.780
 in such a lattice on it you fly 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.550
 knocking everything in its way sometimes 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.950
 incomprehensible fly into or already how would you 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.020
 collapsed and what happens picture 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.570
 changing very quickly and in general this game 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.610
 created supposedly for learning I don't know for 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.210
 learning what am i learning whom learning 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.799
 ricocheting trajectories or whatever 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.930
 principle of movement of the bullet probably but I do not 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.060
 know this bullet is absolutely chaotic on my 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.130
 look flies in life of course bullets so not 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.320
 fly at least so there in 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.659
 someone else's windows somewhere else do not crash into 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.250
 the statue does not ricochet from them but looks 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.810
 the game is really funny 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.290
 entertainment is know it but can 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.090
 be thirty minutes yet how 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.770
 see on the chart in this game all 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.049
 decorated well for such a simple 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.140
 free by the way in my indie games 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.219
 and just fine but what happens 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.439
 incomprehensible 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.780
 why do we fly where we fly too 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.950
 absolutely unclear as I understand the plot 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.270
 here is linear enough that is 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.649
 trajectory on which you will fly 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.560
 or not fly if you will 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:59.380
 it is the same 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.259
 less predictable if it were the same 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.610
 the game but thought for you with a non-standard 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.080
 trajectories that is, you could have been there in one 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.820
 the end 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.870
 it will come judges in the third and in these 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.520
 the rooms were some interesting 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.090
 Easter eggs moments something else this game 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.970
 could be 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.280
 Well, in my opinion generally more interesting 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.810
 not be free at all and worth them then 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.610
 money but this game is apparently for what 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.290
 other targets created say for 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.780
 learning I don't know why I don't know who 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.820
 in the corner such information hardly anything 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.910
 couldn't find here but it looks very 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.800
 cool this dude is fat who 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.530
 or not fat don't know at all maybe 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.060
 this is his condition 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.950
 there is a show to fly the bullets need exactly 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.330
 look like this know how sumoists they are 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.520
 why not fat them just like that 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.910
 condition okay they throw 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.320
 thick page okay actually 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.080
 I recommend a very interesting game and 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.090
 say for a penny weigh and I really 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.560
 liked it though it is very chaotic there 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.450
 plays to this is just mad music i 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.650
 felt like some madman who 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.430
 manages a fat man who flies on 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.480
 bullets it's just not what 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.010
 inhuman absolutely and date cake 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.230
 This is such a space as it is now, but also in 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.390
 the principle is less clear that you are flying 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.680
 around the room and around the other room then 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.310
 girlfriend room is all very fast 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.370
 changing and it certainly gives the game 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.630
 some nervousness and oddness there 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.390
 even have some kind of results table 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.370
 that is, if you can there the whole family 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.380
 sit down to compete who the soul flies on 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.910
 bullets reveal there champion championship 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.790
 the entrance of the champion of the city 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.500
 here is an unpleasant moment again 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.970
 crashed everything very often as a cutter 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.950
 see because it is not clear where to give birth 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.870
 Absolutely, I did not really understand the meaning 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.510
 This game but you know a little 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.640
 entertainment for a few maybe i think 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.040
 which is unlikely a minute can be 20 30 well 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.980
 so I recommend well, and at the end of this 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.260
 Hall of Fame with the names of the developers too 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.820
 quite funny did ok thanks 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.290

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.480
 appear with him small reviews 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.790
 interesting mini toys and of course 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.080
 large toys subscribe if still 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.080
