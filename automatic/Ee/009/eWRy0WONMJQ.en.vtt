00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
going to be very difficult to do that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.340

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
three months and i'll tell you why let's

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.139 
three months and i'll tell you why let's
say<00:00:43.559> from<00:00:43.710> day<00:00:43.890> one<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.190> close<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.059> our

property even if you have your contract

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.069 
property even if you have your contract
at<00:00:47.730> higher<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.149> day<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.570> which<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.809> something

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
at higher on day one which is something

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.540 
at higher on day one which is something
to<00:00:49.230> talk<00:00:49.350> about<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.250> another<00:00:51.149> videos

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
to talk about that and another videos

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.529 
to talk about that and another videos
depending<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> scope<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.059> work<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.390> more

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
depending on the scope of work and more

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.090 
depending on the scope of work and more
than<00:00:54.719> likely<00:00:54.930> there's<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> lot<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.800> what<00:00:55.980> it

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
than likely there's a lot of what it

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
than likely there's a lot of what it
needs<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.370> done<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.640> property<00:00:56.969> because

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
needs to be done the property because

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.549 
needs to be done the property because
that's<00:00:57.300> why<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.539> got<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.930> such<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> good<00:00:58.410> deal

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
that's why you got it such a good deal

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.500 
that's why you got it such a good deal
so<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.370> give<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.670> benefit<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> delta<00:01:00.390> you

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
so if you give the benefit the delta you

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.479 
so if you give the benefit the delta you
give<00:01:00.660> them<00:01:00.780> 30<00:01:01.170> days<00:01:01.530> do<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> rehab<00:01:02.280> process

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
give them 30 days do the rehab process

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.910 
give them 30 days do the rehab process
which<00:01:03.449> typically<00:01:03.870> could<00:01:04.170> take<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.589> know<00:01:04.650> four

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
which typically could take you know four

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.460 
which typically could take you know four
to<00:01:04.949> six<00:01:05.309> weeks<00:01:05.840> well<00:01:06.840> long<00:01:07.080> ago<00:01:07.260> possibly

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470
