gecko or dqo electric start kit that's

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.679 
gecko or dqo electric start kit that's
coming<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.290> at<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:21.180> now<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.659> just

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
coming in at but for right now it just

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.039 
coming in at but for right now it just
has<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.350> full<00:01:22.560> story<00:01:23.119> as<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.450> can<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.780> had

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
has the full story as you can see I had

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.440 
has the full story as you can see I had
it<00:01:25.140> running<00:01:25.439> at<00:01:25.650> first<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.640> got<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.790> caning

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
it running at first it's got a caning

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.249 
it running at first it's got a caning
air<00:01:27.630> filter<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.290> was<00:01:29.070> uh<00:01:29.600> letting<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.689> run<00:01:30.840> so

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
air filter I was uh letting it run so

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.030 
air filter I was uh letting it run so
getting<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.220> real<00:01:32.400> hot<00:01:32.750> or<00:01:33.750> enough<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.890> can

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
getting it real hot or enough that I can

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.310 
getting it real hot or enough that I can
put<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.420> compression<00:01:36.420> tester<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.290> I

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
put this compression tester on it so I

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.539 
put this compression tester on it so I
could<00:01:37.500> show<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.650> how<00:01:37.770> much<00:01:37.979> compression<00:01:38.460> this

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
could show you how much compression this

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.749 
could show you how much compression this
guy<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.990> I'm<00:01:40.200> gonna<00:01:40.350> take<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.130> spark<00:01:41.400> plug<00:01:41.610> out

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
guy so I'm gonna take the spark plug out

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.940 
guy so I'm gonna take the spark plug out
now<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.299> ain't<00:01:42.450> too<00:01:42.509> hot<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:45.680> show<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.740> how

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
now if it ain't too hot and show you how

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
now if it ain't too hot and show you how
much<00:01:47.100> compression<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.700> guy

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.039

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
that was a Titan yeah

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:03.630 
that was a Titan yeah
oh<00:01:57.149> yeah<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:01.090> I<00:02:01.270> can<00:02:01.329> get<00:02:01.600> this<00:02:01.750> home<00:02:02.460> with<00:02:03.460> one

okay<00:02:48.579> I<00:02:48.959> got<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.200> compression<00:02:51.040> tester<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.489> it

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
okay I got the compression tester in it

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:58.050 
okay I got the compression tester in it
as<00:02:52.359> you<00:02:52.870> can<00:02:53.079> see<00:02:53.260> its<00:02:53.499> own<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:56.980> B<00:02:57.219> zero<00:02:57.639> in

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
as you can see its own is a B zero in

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.300 
as you can see its own is a B zero in
the<00:02:58.209> white<00:02:58.389> area<00:02:58.749> I'm<00:02:59.650> gonna<00:02:59.769> give<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.099> three

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
the white area I'm gonna give it three

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.740 
the white area I'm gonna give it three
pools

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:15.010 

can<00:03:04.320> brush<00:03:04.500> myself<00:03:11.660> there's<00:03:12.660> three<00:03:12.930> pools<00:03:13.610> and

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
can brush myself there's three pools and

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.020 
can brush myself there's three pools and
if<00:03:16.020> you<00:03:16.230> can<00:03:16.410> see<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:17.030> around<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:19.010> 150<00:03:20.030> pounds

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
if you can see it around the 150 pounds

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.790 
if you can see it around the 150 pounds
of<00:03:21.150> compression<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:22.350> it's<00:03:22.500> got<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.650> good

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
of compression so it's got a good

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.850 
of compression so it's got a good
compression<00:03:24.140> it<00:03:25.140> uh<00:03:25.380> runs<00:03:26.130> great<00:03:27.680> I'll<00:03:28.680> let

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
compression it uh runs great I'll let

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.750 
compression it uh runs great I'll let
you<00:03:28.980> see<00:03:29.160> more<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.490> it

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
you see more of it

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:42.839 
you see more of it
I'll<00:03:30.060> put<00:03:30.300> new<00:03:30.420> tires<00:03:30.690> on<00:03:30.990> the<00:03:31.080> front

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.630 

that's<00:03:43.510> my<00:03:43.749> aftermarket<00:03:44.709> fog<00:03:44.920> lights<00:03:45.280> for<00:03:45.549> the

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
that's my aftermarket fog lights for the

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.000 
that's my aftermarket fog lights for the
headlights<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.359> only<00:03:46.989> got<00:03:47.200> one<00:03:47.260> hooked<00:03:47.650> up<00:03:47.859> it

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
headlights I only got one hooked up it

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.780 
headlights I only got one hooked up it
can't<00:03:48.219> power<00:03:48.400> both<00:03:48.700> of<00:03:48.969> them<00:03:50.459> but<00:03:51.459> when<00:03:51.639> the

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
can't power both of them but when the

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.149 
can't power both of them but when the
electric<00:03:52.120> start<00:03:52.359> kit<00:03:52.569> comes<00:03:52.840> in<00:03:53.019> I'll<00:03:53.769> put<00:03:53.829> it

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
electric start kit comes in I'll put it

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.800 
electric start kit comes in I'll put it
on<00:03:54.280> it<00:03:54.430> then<00:03:54.549> I<00:03:54.639> can<00:03:54.819> hook<00:03:54.969> it<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.209> a<00:03:55.239> 12-volt

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
on it then I can hook it to a 12-volt

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:09.530 
on it then I can hook it to a 12-volt
battery<00:03:56.230> and<00:03:56.739> run<00:03:57.310> both

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540
