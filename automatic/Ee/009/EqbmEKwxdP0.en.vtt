which<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.530> managers<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.280> we're<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.270> to

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
which is managers so we're going to

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.330 
which is managers so we're going to
manage<00:00:45.539> these<00:00:45.750> basketballs<00:00:48.230> this<00:00:49.230> game<00:00:50.129> is

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
manage these basketballs this game is

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.979 
manage these basketballs this game is
taking<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.700> really<00:00:51.059> long<00:00:51.360> time<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.690> load<00:00:52.020> I

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
taking a really long time to load I

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.180 
taking a really long time to load I
guess<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.140> means<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> graphics<00:00:55.920> are<00:00:56.070> going

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
guess this means the graphics are going

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.889 
guess this means the graphics are going
to<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.370> great<00:00:56.699> that's<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> only<00:00:57.510> reason<00:00:57.629> it

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
to be great that's the only reason it

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.349 
to be great that's the only reason it
would<00:00:58.020> take<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.410> long<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.649> load<00:01:02.210> assess<00:01:03.210> its

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
would take this long to load assess its

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.440 
would take this long to load assess its
updating<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> teams<00:01:04.850> but<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.060> some<00:01:06.180> reason

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
updating the teams but for some reason

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.730
