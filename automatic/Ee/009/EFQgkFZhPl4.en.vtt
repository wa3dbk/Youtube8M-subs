00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.050 
takes like 30 seconds to make 14 I'll
know<00:02:02.439> about<00:02:02.649> this<00:02:02.829> new<00:02:03.009> skilling<00:02:03.460> thing<00:02:03.670> it's

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
know about this new skilling thing it's

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.670 
know about this new skilling thing it's
okay<00:02:04.420> i<00:02:04.630> guess<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:04.960> makes<00:02:05.110> everything<00:02:05.409> nice

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
okay i guess it makes everything nice

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.560 
okay i guess it makes everything nice
and<00:02:05.740> that's<00:02:06.009> one<00:02:06.310> clicks<00:02:06.579> before<00:02:06.880> i<00:02:07.149> think<00:02:07.420> it

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
and that's one clicks before i think it

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.040 
and that's one clicks before i think it
the<00:02:07.719> cliq<00:02:07.899> more<00:02:08.460> done<00:02:09.460> now<00:02:10.300> let's<00:02:10.570> sell<00:02:10.869> these

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
the cliq more done now let's sell these

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.790 
the cliq more done now let's sell these
as<00:02:11.740> you<00:02:12.700> can<00:02:12.850> see<00:02:13.060> with<00:02:13.240> prices<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:14.470> look<00:02:14.680> at

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
as you can see with prices you look at

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.460 
as you can see with prices you look at
that<00:02:15.000> 800<00:02:16.000> GP<00:02:16.390> each<00:02:16.630> which<00:02:17.050> is<00:02:17.230> pretty<00:02:17.380> much

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
that 800 GP each which is pretty much

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.920 
that 800 GP each which is pretty much
doubling<00:02:18.070> your<00:02:18.160> cash<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.670> they

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
doubling your cash and they

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.140 
doubling your cash and they
instantly<00:02:19.319> for<00:02:19.530> even<00:02:19.739> more<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.909> because

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
instantly for even more this because

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.209 
instantly for even more this because
they're<00:02:21.299> going<00:02:21.569> up<00:02:21.719> so<00:02:22.230> let's<00:02:22.500> calculate<00:02:22.739> our

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
they're going up so let's calculate our

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:29.330 
they're going up so let's calculate our
profit<00:02:25.280> calculator<00:02:27.260> so<00:02:28.260> let's<00:02:28.439> add<00:02:28.620> up<00:02:29.010> the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
profit calculator so let's add up the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.670 
profit calculator so let's add up the
pie<00:02:29.760> dish<00:02:29.969> and<00:02:30.209> pastries<00:02:30.689> up<00:02:30.870> though<00:02:31.200> whoops

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
pie dish and pastries up though whoops

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.339 
pie dish and pastries up though whoops
written<00:02:32.219> over<00:02:32.489> here<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.420> thousand<00:02:34.200> four

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
written over here so thousand four

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.839 
written over here so thousand four
hundred<00:02:34.790> plus<00:02:36.170> 3,400<00:02:37.549> so<00:02:38.549> it<00:02:38.790> costs<00:02:39.090> us<00:02:39.209> 4.8<00:02:39.870> k

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
hundred plus 3,400 so it costs us 4.8 k

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:49.339 
hundred plus 3,400 so it costs us 4.8 k
so<00:02:41.849> then<00:02:42.019> 13,000<00:02:44.299> minus<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:46.790> 4800<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.349> there

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
so then 13,000 minus the 4800 and there

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.319 
so then 13,000 minus the 4800 and there
you<00:02:49.439> go<00:02:49.500> we<00:02:49.680> made<00:02:49.859> 8.2<00:02:50.489> k<00:02:50.700> right<00:02:50.879> then<00:02:51.030> at<00:02:51.120> 30

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
you go we made 8.2 k right then at 30

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.280 
you go we made 8.2 k right then at 30
seconds<00:02:52.040> we<00:02:53.040> can<00:02:53.189> do<00:02:53.659> 120<00:02:54.659> of<00:02:54.840> these

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
seconds we can do 120 of these

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.330 
seconds we can do 120 of these
inventories<00:02:55.650> per<00:02:56.519> hour<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:57.659> is<00:02:57.689> about

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
inventories per hour so this is about

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.690 
inventories per hour so this is about
984<00:02:59.340> k<00:02:59.700> /<00:02:59.970> our<00:03:00.150> money<00:03:00.989> making<00:03:01.290> method<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.769> like

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
984 k / our money making method and like

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.819
