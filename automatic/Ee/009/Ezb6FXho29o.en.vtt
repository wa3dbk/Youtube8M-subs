00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120
 the Italians try the shot from outside 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.120
 madonna google a maria che gol 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.449
 hi to all the boys and welcome to 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.550
 this new video today we are on fifa 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.710
 so we are not on the game but on the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.080
 demo because I wanted to try it before 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.900
 the game came out on September 25th if not 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.849
 I'm wrong because he signed 14 a little 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.219
 abandoned because we were now at the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.440
 end of year 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.149
 was about to come out about 15 not me 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.820
 it didn't even seem necessary to start one 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.350
 series on fifa 14 but certainly the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.180
 we will do on fifa 15 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.680
 although I am an admirer but pes 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.379
 in the last two years I have to admit it 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.690
 fifa was far superior to 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.010
 own shaun soccer 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.629
 let's go see some of the ones that are i 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.390
 the best and the improvements are few 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.219
 sincerely few are sure to be 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.239
 the graphic quality will be improved 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.250
 now we're going to see 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.500
 there are some little extra features 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.989
 that is, they were added 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.979
 the emotional intelligence that is what it does 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.530
 to change 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.990
 the emotions of the players who react 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.580
 at angola of the contrasts the tactics of 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.869
 team 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.180
 agility control has become more 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.490
 specifies the duels 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.560
 have become more confident than 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.180
 push out opponents 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.740
 then there is a general remediation to the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.869
 goalkeepers who seemed gods before 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.580
 baboons when they parried the balls 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.280
 now that they've added parades 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.420
 aesthetically beautiful and perhaps this is one 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.130
 I like things better on the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.020
 team management put us 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.960
 management the team much faster 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.250
 and practical compared to before you came 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.470
 parties pass the urge to 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.750
 change the training a lot 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.750
 pretty that is the possibility to rent 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.549
 that is, to borrow for a tot 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.259
 of matches of the players who may not 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.509
 we will never buy because they cost 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.640
 too much so we can anyway 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.540
 use our favorite samples for 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.040
 a few games 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.640
 we will then resume business 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.420
 and so these are the best and most 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.410
 large is not that there are so many 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.720
 we know that football games are 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.910
 these already scared his 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.240
 game engine when the next one came out 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.970
 January 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.640
 and above all with fifa own chance 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.140
 or that we hope this year will take over 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.180
 at the same level 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.980
 maybe he won't surpass it though yes 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.330
 will bring it back to the same level and we will 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.250
 we're going to try in November when 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.010
 the new pro the chance soccer will come out 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.450
 so let's have a game 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.209
 a normal kick-off is normal 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.470
 the manchester city boys inspires me 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.270
 against we do against the chelsea 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.730
 there's a bit of lag in this demo I don't know 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.890
 what is a monstrous fps drop every 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.600
 so much will be a problem I think 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.770
 of the demo especially the demo of 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.750
 playstation 4 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.489
 I also remind you that I am playing on 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.110
 playstation 4 because it was given to me 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.459
 from a friend who no longer uses it because 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.680
 had to leave for work then 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.800
 I will use these games like fifa ad 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.840
 they on playstation 4 and not on xbox 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.940
 although reluctantly because the joystick 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.850
 I hate playstation 4 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.040
 but if city against chelsea the difficulty 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.690
 it's preset so I don't know I don't think 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.730
 be beginner because I see them moving 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:14.400
 well so i think it's a mode 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:18.260
 intermediate or madonna mia jam already had 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.810
 made shit in your hand you were here where you go 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.370
 big sweeps away the terror the 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.730
 manchester city pressure 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.060
 ivano vinci and the killing cross al 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.950
 center but under fire 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:36.349
 oh my God joystiq min jams times 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.459
 with the keys raisa great whale intervention 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:43.190
 filter pass down downwards 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:47.599
 still what corn maize is thinking about 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:50.660
 try shooting shit volley 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:54.050
 that you apologize for apologizing for 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.640
 a ball is thrown at yaya tourÃ© ti 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.959
 they lose everything because I love you with the 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:04.220
 player turns aguero tries the shot 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:08.390
 externally madonna check her to hard test 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:12.620
 the shot from outside but then google goes away 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.930
 and aia tour and I forgave you for shooting 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.600
 first because only military with the outside 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.130
 impressed their own time of 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.829
 take the hand with the children because 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.770
 since the power of the shot is a little 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.120
 different beware of goals 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:34.990
 mind the exterior of toure de gaulle 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:39.740
 we are loads we are loads if sedov ai 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:45.919
 hazard dubai these balls still there 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:47.740
 try to give apologies in the second 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.789
 position you throw in excess to 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.350
 the first half ends 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:55.490
 one to zero for us but there were two others 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.320
 golletti that you could do a couple of 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.910
 my mistakes because I'm taking 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.460
 practicality with joystick 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.720
 but this is the first boys game a 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.639
 another very fine thing they have 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.440
 inserted are the kinematics that is i 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.970
 replays are made as if it were a 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.100
 film this is a cool glue 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.320
 beautiful and pure the goalkeepers' parades 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.690
 they are really beautiful and took the ball 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.360
 silva counter-attack boys counter-attack 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.750
 passage towards aguero sees it at the bottom 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.040
 dzeko takes the ball the square doesn't 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:30.110
 I believe rigor 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:30.110
 rigorous rigor figures 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.140
 already here was the rigor I felt 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.160
 to external to put it 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.460
 but there are those who have made a parade 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:43.100
 hallucinating fry for their rigor 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.100
 terror not its rigors if they are equal 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:50.220
 let's see some examples on the schemes yes 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.310
 they are similar to those therefore enough 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.600
 little press I want it to have four 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.600
 they make trecate hallucinating 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:06.480
 I hate it 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:12.390
 for landini fernandinho what you must draw 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:14.670
 poured lob charged too little 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:17.150
 now filtering towards aguero in the center 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:23.310
 at 100 to 100 they look at look at dzeko 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:28.910
 dzeko who does not get lost will talk about 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:31.650
 champion duck of six that shitty goals 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.000
 look at how thin the mass went 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.800
 still too slow because I'm not 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.590
 just used to charge very little 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.320
 finger never fernandinho is the leaf 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:47.640
 filtering passage down the kun down 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:51.450
 to any test the shooting at things that 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:56.310
 you ate I still do ittci 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:58.410
 TV of very light girls 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.170
 even the shooting around aguero was too much 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.240
 too light and black hands occupied 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:07.320
 to look still centuries deep 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:11.500
 dzeko dzeko dzeko dzeko the square 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:15.970
 but the parade has touched I don't believe it 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:17.680
 that parade made take it with your foot with 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.930
 the tip of the foot 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.620
 look at the top look at it how it goes 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:31.510
 watch it jovetic shooting room 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:34.210
 I omit you pressure go or I think 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:36.970
 is over the game is over the 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:40.720
 match also shows the man replays 

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:42.310
 match edin dzeko 8.29 guys i am 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.290
 the case that I liked you was the 

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.510
 fifa 15 demo video after 

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:49.090
 this will come directly to the game 

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.530
 when it will be released on September 25th 

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.910
 I hope I enjoyed leaving a 

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:55.200
 comment is a sharing see you
