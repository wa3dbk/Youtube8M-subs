00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
it take the tail right off must have

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.330 
it take the tail right off must have
just<00:03:10.810> hit<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.019> back<00:03:11.319> of<00:03:11.349> the<00:03:11.680> ground<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.099> death

just hit the back of the ground to death

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.599 
just hit the back of the ground to death
and<00:03:13.209> never<00:03:13.450> had<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.720> jig<00:03:14.109> in<00:03:14.260> its<00:03:14.410> mouth<00:03:14.709> try

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
and never had the jig in its mouth try

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.879 
and never had the jig in its mouth try
again<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:16.150> wouldn't<00:03:16.480> hit<00:03:16.569> again<00:03:16.900> so<00:03:17.319> it's

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
again it wouldn't hit again so it's

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.550 
again it wouldn't hit again so it's
actually<00:03:18.040> had<00:03:18.340> five<00:03:18.609> bites<00:03:19.090> in<00:03:19.419> caught<00:03:19.690> three
