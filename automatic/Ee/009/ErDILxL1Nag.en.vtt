you're<00:04:02.389> just<00:04:02.599> simply<00:04:03.079> drilling<00:04:03.590> a<00:04:03.680> hole<00:04:03.709> at<00:04:04.040> an

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
you're just simply drilling a hole at an

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:09.640 
you're just simply drilling a hole at an
angle<00:04:05.469> and<00:04:06.760> again<00:04:07.760> this<00:04:08.719> bit<00:04:09.049> by<00:04:09.319> changing

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
angle and again this bit by changing

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.420 
angle and again this bit by changing
where<00:04:10.639> this<00:04:10.790> collar<00:04:11.090> goes<00:04:11.680> that<00:04:12.680> determines

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
where this collar goes that determines

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.949 
where this collar goes that determines
the<00:04:13.519> thickness<00:04:14.150> of<00:04:14.269> the<00:04:14.359> material<00:04:14.480> you're

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
the thickness of the material you're

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.240 
the thickness of the material you're
joining<00:04:15.260> but<00:04:16.239> simple<00:04:17.239> enough<00:04:17.859> just<00:04:18.859> put<00:04:19.039> it<00:04:19.160> in

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
joining but simple enough just put it in

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:27.640

like<00:04:19.280> this<00:04:23.889> take<00:04:24.889> your<00:04:25.070> drill<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:26.440> drill<00:04:27.440> in

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
like this take your drill and drill in

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.260 
like this take your drill and drill in
and<00:04:27.919> it<00:04:28.070> will<00:04:28.160> give<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:28.490> that<00:04:28.520> angled<00:04:29.090> hole

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
and it will give you that angled hole

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.839 
and it will give you that angled hole
you<00:04:29.539> need<00:04:29.840> for<00:04:30.770> joining<00:04:31.430> your<00:04:31.550> boards

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849

I built two doors in that episode and

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.520 
I built two doors in that episode and
that<00:05:28.890> might<00:05:29.040> just<00:05:29.220> give<00:05:29.610> you<00:05:29.700> another<00:05:30.530> another

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
that might just give you another another

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.990 
that might just give you another another
look<00:05:31.770> at<00:05:31.920> a<00:05:31.980> different<00:05:32.070> way<00:05:32.400> of<00:05:32.430> making<00:05:32.820> them

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
look at a different way of making them

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.730 
look at a different way of making them
alright<00:05:33.720> good<00:05:34.350> luck
