work<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.800> karma<00:00:37.800> consumables<00:00:38.460> now<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.820> is

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
work on karma consumables now this is

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.180 
work on karma consumables now this is
the<00:00:39.059> idea<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.629> forward<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.230> basically

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
the idea going forward and basically

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.360 
the idea going forward and basically
because<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.879> was<00:00:43.219> communicated<00:00:44.219> very

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
because this was communicated very

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.180 
because this was communicated very
poorly<00:00:45.110> ArenaNet<00:00:46.110> actually<00:00:46.530> decided<00:00:47.010> to

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
poorly ArenaNet actually decided to

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.900 
poorly ArenaNet actually decided to
revert<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.960> brief<00:00:49.890> time<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.579> that

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
revert it for a brief time and that

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.610 
revert it for a brief time and that
brief<00:00:51.149> time<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.570> going<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.899> end<00:00:52.079> when<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.469> next

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
brief time is going to end when the next

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.250 
brief time is going to end when the next
patch<00:00:52.890> hits<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.610> third<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.059> September<00:00:54.600> so

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
you can actually get it to be quite a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.859 
you can actually get it to be quite a
bit<00:01:52.710> higher<00:01:52.950> than<00:01:53.310> what<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.670> could<00:01:53.880> even

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
though the new base is going to be

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.289 
though the new base is going to be
higher<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.719> itself<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.530> first<00:01:59.250> message<00:01:59.670> make

gained before the patch don't include it
which<00:03:01.379> would<00:03:01.530> be<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.709> complete<00:03:02.160> dick<00:03:02.370> move<00:03:02.609> but

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
which would be a complete dick move but

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.599 
which would be a complete dick move but
it's<00:03:03.989> possible<00:03:04.620> but<00:03:04.799> even<00:03:05.250> then<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.430> still

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
it's possible but even then you still

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.420 
it's possible but even then you still
not<00:03:05.910> losing<00:03:06.239> out<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.890> best<00:03:08.099> thing<00:03:08.310> about

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
not losing out and the best thing about

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.349

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
honest kiss right here I've got one bag

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.500 
honest kiss right here I've got one bag
a<00:03:46.049> rather<00:03:46.739> one<00:03:47.130> stack<00:03:47.459> of<00:03:47.669> three<00:03:47.700> bags<00:03:48.120> which

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
a rather one stack of three bags which

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.020 
a rather one stack of three bags which
could<00:03:48.840> fill<00:03:49.319> up<00:03:49.470> let's<00:03:50.160> see<00:03:50.250> three<00:03:50.639> greens

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
could fill up let's see three greens

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.800 
could fill up let's see three greens
with<00:03:51.480> three<00:03:51.989> drops<00:03:52.349> as<00:03:52.769> random<00:03:53.250> materials

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
with three drops as random materials

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.289 
with three drops as random materials
tides<00:03:54.810> in<00:03:55.079> chapter<00:03:55.560> 11<00:03:55.709> they<00:03:56.669> already<00:03:56.940> could

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
tides in chapter 11 they already could

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.330 
tides in chapter 11 they already could
Philip<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.840> confirm<00:03:58.349> white<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.530> few<00:03:58.950> one<00:03:59.160> bag

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
Philip and confirm white a few one bag

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.370 
Philip and confirm white a few one bag
flops<00:03:59.669> so<00:04:00.120> this<00:04:00.480> is<00:04:00.599> just<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:00.840> really<00:04:01.049> nice<00:04:01.200> way

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
flops so this is just a really nice way

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.680 
flops so this is just a really nice way
to<00:04:01.440> keep<00:04:01.769> it<00:04:01.950> nice<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.340> neat<00:04:02.730> even<00:04:03.569> though
