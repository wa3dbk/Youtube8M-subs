00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
battery and I'm saying this is a highly

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.149 
battery and I'm saying this is a highly
fragmented<00:01:36.570> business<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:37.890> guy<00:01:38.100> is

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
fragmented business and this guy is

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.390 
fragmented business and this guy is
gonna<00:01:38.490> take<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.570> fragmented<00:01:40.320> business<00:01:40.740> and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
gonna take that fragmented business and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.910 
gonna take that fragmented business and
bring<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.119> all<00:01:42.210> together<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.439> was<00:01:43.560> really

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
bring it all together so I was really

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.080 
bring it all together so I was really
intrigued<00:01:44.100> with<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.460> started<00:01:44.759> doing<00:01:44.939> some

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
intrigued with it started doing some

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.210 
intrigued with it started doing some
research<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.720> battery<00:01:46.079> industry<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:47.100> was

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
research on the battery industry it was

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.910 
research on the battery industry it was
small<00:01:47.520> at<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.759> time<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.390> could<00:01:48.570> see

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
small at the time but you could see

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.560 
small at the time but you could see
various<00:01:49.920> things<00:01:50.009> coming<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.060> different

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
various things coming on different

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.870 
various things coming on different
electronics<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:53.009> were<00:01:53.220> gonna<00:01:53.430> going<00:01:53.820> to

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
electronics that were gonna going to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.170 
electronics that were gonna going to
require<00:01:54.180> battery<00:01:54.570> power<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.759> it<00:01:56.759> seemed<00:01:57.030> like

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
require battery power so it seemed like

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.730 
require battery power so it seemed like
something<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.659> might<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.710> know

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
something that might have you know

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.310 
something that might have you know
potential<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.420> my<00:02:00.570> wife<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.079> were

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
first franchisee and so we talked about

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.790 
first franchisee and so we talked about
it<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.850> little<00:02:53.000> bit<00:02:53.150> more<00:02:53.330> decided<00:02:53.990> to<00:02:54.140> go<00:02:54.620> with

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
it a little bit more decided to go with

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.950 
it a little bit more decided to go with
it<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.340> signed<00:02:56.270> him<00:02:56.450> became<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.780> first

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
it and signed him became the first

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.490 
it and signed him became the first
franchisee<00:02:57.710> so<00:02:58.550> that<00:02:58.760> was<00:02:58.910> in<00:02:59.030> its<00:02:59.180> infancy

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
franchisee so that was in its infancy

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.570 
franchisee so that was in its infancy
yeah<00:03:00.500> there<00:03:00.740> was<00:03:00.830> a<00:03:00.890> lot<00:03:01.040> of<00:03:01.130> things<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:01.490> have

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
yeah there was a lot of things that have

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.660 
yeah there was a lot of things that have
