00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.199
 hello everyone is good 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.210
 today I wanted to answer a question 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.310
 what reason have they done me and that is is 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.460
 possible to distinguish at first sight his 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.560
 new has been fertilized or not 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.720
 then it is obvious that simply 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.189
 looking at a way is not possible to say 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.680
 no way if it has been fertilized 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.690
 We can not know or better 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.969
 we can predict it 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.199
 if new states are the best 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.600
 possible conditions 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.360
 that is if the hen was in age 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.140
 fertile and if a cock was present also 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.899
 he is the only one in production 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.879
 so we have to know together with 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.030
 a new one was founded at least to that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.820
 of carlo and after the newspaper two runs 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.309
 operation which is called spera tour e 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.090
 with the tour sphere we go to 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.399
 place a light beam 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.369
 coming from a lamp above the pole 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:10.020
 use of man could be used 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.149
 also a special tool that you 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.280
 calls hopefully eggs in general is 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.070
 absolutely no use a torch 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.140
 pocket some experts manage to 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.259
 please simply placing it 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.860
 backlight respect to the sun e 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.780
 manage to get good results 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.550
 but a dark room and a lamp are 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.890
 for beginners the best way to 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.100
 start with the adventure of 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.829
 egg lock utc link and basket 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.200
 however, they are offering gods 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.670
 obvious advantages in terms of 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.610
 percentage of flight arriving 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.399
 however, they open up some problems in 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.770
 more for what concerns the 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:54.750
 hopes ture because why in 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.780
 incubators of this kind 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:03.090
 the egg is positioned almost vertically 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.439
 and is folded sideways several times 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.660
 per day in type incubators 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.890
 classic and instead it happened that man 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.510
 was positioned laterally and in 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.040
 horizontal way on the bottom 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.799
 of the incubator this meant that 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.230
 the embryo due to gravity 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.780
 denis and position yourself near the shell 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.420
 of the egg so that already the third quarter 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.930
 day innova with clear shell was 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.410
 perfectly possible to see a kind 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.510
 of spider red attached 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.280
 egg shell you were standing 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.500
 developing and that was the sign 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.270
 of the embryo he had done that was 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:50.240
 managed to take his own path 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:54.980
 this is not the case with basket incubators 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:57.320
 It happens because because freed from 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.780
 force of gravity more often than not 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.500
 million is positioned under a room 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.940
 of air so that in the first days 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.700
 maximum employment we see one 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.430
 greater concentration around 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.030
 to the air chamber to be sure 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.810
 that man has been fertilized and that he is 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.610
 that the development of the embryo proceeds 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.280
 we will have to wait for the sixth instead 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.530
 seventh day in some cases also the 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.970
 tenth in the house of with shell 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.640
 particularly dark a new non 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.340
 fertilized by the light of the lamp appears 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.620
 completely clear and transparent 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.660
 it is also difficult to distinguish the area 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.520
 of the inner tube placed on the use pole 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:46.880
 above a fertilized egg of about six o 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.480
 seven days shows in the highest part 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.490
 a completely clear area than the 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.130
 place inner tube in the most part 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.990
 low you can see a tangle of veins with 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.740
 a small embryo as dark as one 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:03.950
 macula that swaying the egg moves 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.860
 with the same rhythm 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.590
 instead observing an incubated egg already 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.540
 for more than two weeks we see how 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.660
 the embryo has almost occupied 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:19.700
 completely the egg is that it remains 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:21.320
 only the clear area of ​​the room 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.810
 air in the upper part in the pole 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.700
 obtuse than with the approach of 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.540
 eighteenth day increases more and more 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.450
 own dimensions the sphere si 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.789
 can make white shell eggs 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.979
 until the fourth game 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:39.710
 in brown- shelled eggs I go pink 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.710
 you can do it already from the sixth is fine 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.879
 then repeat it at a later time 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.949
 around the eighteenth and nineteenth 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:48.349
 day to verify that the development 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.060
 of the embryo has gone border and 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:52.099
 eliminate the eggs at the same time 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.010
 instead they could not complete the 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:57.240
 own development 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.240
 [Applause]
