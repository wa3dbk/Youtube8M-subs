00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.730
 and so for another piano lesson 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.900
 this time we will see how to play al 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.160
 Plan some role in short, a book 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.779
 something that comes close to this 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.860
 fantastic music 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.840
 first of all because it comes to mind 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.130
 because I want to praise one 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:30.419
 great band I discovered by watching 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:32.920
 by chance the only 5 yesterday I saw that 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:36.239
 there was a relative this band that is 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.980
 calls the German group baseballs 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.760
 fantastically resounded was present on 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.309
 one of the covers, however, the soles in the key 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.159
 rockabilly rock and roll that there is 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.500
 it would be a rock and roll style by 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.570
 50's therefore evokes a moment all 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.760
 these modern pieces play them in style 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.070
 50s beautiful and hence the idea of 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.320
 see a little piano beautiful 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.940
 the boogie rock and roll and of a un 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.320
 like as ok you have 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.950
 accompaniments to the curtain from the 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.500
 assumption that we must do well that 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.270
 then working on a do scale if 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.130
 we are filed in some all 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.800
 accompaniment can be given above all 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.990
 almost always on the first degree 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.600
 fourth degree is fifth grade 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.360
 so we will always have it if we do n't pay it 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.659
 the C major chords more 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:34.039
 in the seventh 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.039
 now an example 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.450
 or 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.610
 no 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.470
 in 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.439
 these karstic rizzi exercise that for 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.140
 show in this lesson that you will have to 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:11.540
 then try giving me the only one 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.620
 alone but where but hours 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.209
 but 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.210
 so speeches never fired and will do 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.510
 only 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:25.740
 I go away a little we will obviously vote 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.740
 many other things that can be 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:39.750
 then of course we all go from there 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.750
 always on the do because we do it 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.819
 and then Europe 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.010
 and so on anyway for this way 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.849
 so many accompaniments that you can 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.290
 do the piano but in a rock and key way 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.400
 roll or plants though before you have it all 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.480
 let's start with some simple ones 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.480
 exercises that are 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.709
 but then female soldiers install and then 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:17.360
 we go on to make it hours of hours and then 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:23.269
 we go on money and half then it is 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.769
 back to the two women soldier ok 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.800
 this is the first exercise you need 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.800
 do 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.590
 mum 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.570
 and where to test to approach a 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.550
 rock together and we will see the chords as 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.990
 to accompany with right hand and then 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.320
 let's see all the other agreements then 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.320
 the other one 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.720
 anyway okay I will not dwell 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.610
 otherwise then the video as quality 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.010
 it becomes crap since it will go 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.700
 first bet on the next episode on 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.700
 collapse
