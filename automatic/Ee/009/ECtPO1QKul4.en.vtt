00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
comparison it's a bit hard with a screen

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.880 
comparison it's a bit hard with a screen
here<00:01:53.670> but<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.200> that's<00:01:55.200> better<00:01:55.560> stick<00:01:55.860> with

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
here but it's a that's better stick with

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.319 
here but it's a that's better stick with
my<00:01:56.130> finger<00:01:57.200> if<00:01:58.200> not<00:01:58.530> thicker<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.909> wouldn't

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
my finger if not thicker and I wouldn't

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.420 
my finger if not thicker and I wouldn't
be<00:02:00.450> surprised<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:00.990> rope<00:02:01.350> could<00:02:01.380> hold<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.950> good

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
be surprised that rope could hold a good

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.969 
be surprised that rope could hold a good
ton<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:03.240> which<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.869> not<00:02:03.990> likely<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.500> met<00:02:04.860> but

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
ton but which is not likely I met but

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.869 
ton but which is not likely I met but
typically<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.579> an<00:02:05.700> over<00:02:05.969> engineered<00:02:06.420> box<00:02:07.879> on

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
typically it's an over engineered box on

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.690 
typically it's an over engineered box on
the<00:02:09.090> front<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:10.009> three<00:02:11.009> latches<00:02:11.220> there

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
the front you have three latches there

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.240 
the front you have three latches there
it's<00:02:12.180> there

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
it's there

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.710 
it's there
recess<00:02:13.640> so<00:02:13.820> there's<00:02:13.970> nothing<00:02:14.210> to<00:02:14.300> catch<00:02:14.510> on

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
recess so there's nothing to catch on

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.450 
recess so there's nothing to catch on
the<00:02:14.840> front<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.530> mold<00:02:15.830> is<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.040> seamless

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
the front the mold is a seamless

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.480 
the front the mold is a seamless
one-piece<00:02:17.090> mold<00:02:17.770> another<00:02:18.770> great<00:02:19.010> feature<00:02:19.250> is

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
one-piece mold another great feature is

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.720 
one-piece mold another great feature is
the<00:02:19.760> basket<00:02:20.210> it's<00:02:20.750> got<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:20.990> a<00:02:21.680> large<00:02:22.370> basket

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
the basket it's got a a large basket

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.400 
the basket it's got a a large basket

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
these seals here yeah it's actually got

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.420 
these seals here yeah it's actually got
dual<00:02:32.300> seals<00:02:32.690> but<00:02:32.990> one<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.230> them<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:34.010> internal

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
dual seals but one of them the internal

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.100 
dual seals but one of them the internal
one<00:02:34.580> here<00:02:34.790> is<00:02:34.880> actually<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.270> frigid<00:02:35.690> gasket

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
one here is actually a frigid gasket

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.360 
one here is actually a frigid gasket
which<00:02:36.260> should<00:02:36.410> be<00:02:36.530> familiar<00:02:36.950> with<00:02:37.070> on<00:02:37.220> your

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
the box and that that gasket actually

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.600 
the box and that that gasket actually
seals<00:02:44.870> perfectly<00:02:45.500> on<00:02:45.620> that<00:02:45.830> in<00:02:45.980> addition<00:02:46.459> to

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
seals perfectly on that in addition to

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.520 
seals perfectly on that in addition to
that<00:02:46.760> there's<00:02:47.000> another<00:02:47.420> seal<00:02:47.780> on<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.080> outside

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
that there's another seal on the outside

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.560 
that there's another seal on the outside
of<00:02:48.739> that<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:49.160> compression<00:02:49.820> sear<00:02:50.180> which<00:02:50.360> then

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
of that a compression sear which then

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.750 
of that a compression sear which then
goes<00:02:50.780> on<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.080> flat<00:02:51.290> surface<00:02:51.680> around<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.220> that

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
goes on the flat surface around it that

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.170 
goes on the flat surface around it that
ensures<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.330> total<00:02:53.810> airtight<00:02:54.580> seal<00:02:55.580> virtue<00:02:55.970> at

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
ensures a total airtight seal virtue at

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.360 
ensures a total airtight seal virtue at
any<00:02:56.300> temperature<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:57.080> it's<00:02:57.739> a<00:02:57.890> it's<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:58.220> great

around this way you can see that it's
actually<00:03:22.459> got<00:03:22.820> some<00:03:23.000> wheels<00:03:23.239> on<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.570> back<00:03:23.799> and

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
actually got some wheels on the back and

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.789 
actually got some wheels on the back and
a<00:03:25.840> lot<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:26.870> people<00:03:27.230> when<00:03:27.320> they<00:03:27.350> get<00:03:27.590> bigger

a lot of people when they get bigger
boxes<00:03:28.280> have<00:03:28.489> asked<00:03:28.850> about<00:03:29.019> wheels<00:03:30.019> so<00:03:30.320> this<00:03:30.470> is

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
boxes have asked about wheels so this is

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.680 
boxes have asked about wheels so this is
model<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.640> one<00:03:31.820> above<00:03:32.120> it<00:03:32.299> which<00:03:32.450> is<00:03:32.570> the

set of wheels and those wheels can be

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.400 
set of wheels and those wheels can be
quickly<00:03:38.030> released<00:03:38.450> off<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.810> bottom<00:03:39.080> of<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.320> if

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
quickly released off the bottom of it if

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.979 
quickly released off the bottom of it if
you<00:03:39.470> don't<00:03:39.680> need<00:03:39.860> them<00:03:40.100> and<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:41.510> allows<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:41.900> to

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
you don't need them and it allows you to

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.539 
you don't need them and it allows you to
have<00:03:42.110> a<00:03:42.140> box<00:03:42.350> with<00:03:42.530> wheels<00:03:42.799> or<00:03:43.040> without<00:03:43.310> wheel

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
have a box with wheels or without wheel

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.330 
have a box with wheels or without wheel
so<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.180> can<00:03:44.540> see<00:03:44.720> they're<00:03:44.959> got<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:45.920> very<00:03:46.130> thick

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
so you can see they're got a very thick

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.530 
so you can see they're got a very thick
handle<00:03:46.600> very<00:03:47.600> simple<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.110> wheel<00:03:48.860> it<00:03:48.980> around

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.060 

you<00:03:53.540> notice<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.959> feet<00:03:54.200> on<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.410> bottom<00:03:54.500> to

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
you notice the feet on the bottom to

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.030 
you notice the feet on the bottom to
will<00:03:55.610> also<00:03:55.940> keep<00:03:56.180> ground<00:03:56.570> heat<00:03:56.840> from<00:03:57.079> hot

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
will also keep ground heat from hot

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.539 
will also keep ground heat from hot
trays<00:03:58.400> like<00:03:58.790> on<00:03:59.000> a<00:03:59.030> ute<00:03:59.810> or<00:04:00.079> metal<00:04:01.010> trailer<00:04:01.280> or

trays like on a ute or metal trailer or

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.810 
trays like on a ute or metal trailer or
a<00:04:01.610> concrete<00:04:02.410> area<00:04:03.410> normally<00:04:04.370> when<00:04:04.489> you<00:04:04.579> put<00:04:04.730> an

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
a concrete area normally when you put an

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.490 
a concrete area normally when you put an
ice<00:04:04.970> box<00:04:05.209> on<00:04:05.420> the<00:04:05.510> ground<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.989> radiant<00:04:06.350> heat

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
ice box on the ground the radiant heat

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.140 
ice box on the ground the radiant heat
grazing<00:04:07.010> from<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.280> ground<00:04:07.519> will<00:04:07.700> get<00:04:07.880> through

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
grazing from the ground will get through

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.060 
grazing from the ground will get through
the<00:04:08.299> the<00:04:08.750> bottom<00:04:09.110> of<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:09.260> box<00:04:09.500> and<00:04:09.769> affect

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
the the bottom of the box and affect

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.520 
the the bottom of the box and affect
your<00:04:10.250> performance<00:04:10.880> these<00:04:11.390> have<00:04:11.540> got<00:04:11.570> 360

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
your performance these have got 360

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.310 
your performance these have got 360
degree<00:04:12.769> air<00:04:12.950> circulation<00:04:13.519> so<00:04:14.110> there's<00:04:15.110> no

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
degree air circulation so there's no

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.900 
degree air circulation so there's no
problem<00:04:15.709> with<00:04:15.739> having<00:04:16.100> them<00:04:16.220> on<00:04:16.310> the<00:04:16.370> backs<00:04:16.700> of

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
problem with having them on the backs of

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.240 
problem with having them on the backs of
her<00:04:17.600> view<00:04:17.840> tour<00:04:18.109> on<00:04:18.290> trailers<00:04:18.799> or<00:04:18.950> on<00:04:19.040> hot

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
her view tour on trailers or on hot

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.250 
her view tour on trailers or on hot
surfaces<00:04:19.790> that<00:04:20.390> would<00:04:20.510> normally<00:04:20.870> appear<00:04:21.109> the

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
surfaces that would normally appear the

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.589 
surfaces that would normally appear the
performance<00:04:21.739> of<00:04:21.830> the<00:04:21.890> box<00:04:22.210> so<00:04:23.210> that's<00:04:23.360> the

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
performance of the box so that's the

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.659 
performance of the box so that's the
feed<00:04:24.200> on<00:04:24.380> there<00:04:24.560> they<00:04:24.860> can<00:04:25.010> also<00:04:25.160> be<00:04:25.490> padlocked

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
feed on there they can also be padlocked

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:34.050 
feed on there they can also be padlocked
so<00:04:28.050> if<00:04:29.050> you<00:04:29.169> want<00:04:29.350> to<00:04:29.440> paddle<00:04:29.620> Lockton<00:04:33.060> just

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
so if you want to paddle Lockton just

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.570 
so if you want to paddle Lockton just
pop<00:04:34.210> that<00:04:34.240> through<00:04:34.540> like<00:04:34.690> that<00:04:34.870> and<00:04:35.550> turn<00:04:36.550> it

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
pop that through like that and turn it

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.010 
pop that through like that and turn it
and<00:04:36.850> what<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.389> there<00:04:37.479> you<00:04:37.570> go<00:04:37.690> you<00:04:37.750> can<00:04:37.990> just

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
and what and there you go you can just

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.960 
and what and there you go you can just
put<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.830> paddle<00:04:39.130> on<00:04:39.220> it's<00:04:39.520> actually<00:04:39.790> got<00:04:39.940> a

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
put the paddle on it's actually got a

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.590 
put the paddle on it's actually got a
slot<00:04:40.270> on<00:04:40.419> the<00:04:40.449> side<00:04:40.590> you<00:04:41.590> can<00:04:41.710> see<00:04:41.740> that<00:04:41.889> there

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.960 

like<00:04:46.600> so<00:04:46.860> so<00:04:47.860> that's<00:04:48.340> here<00:04:48.460> paddle<00:04:48.820> often

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
like so so that's here paddle often

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.800 
like so so that's here paddle often
something<00:04:51.970> else<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:52.330> can<00:04:52.449> use<00:04:52.479> that<00:04:52.750> same

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
something else you can use that same

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.620 
something else you can use that same
slot<00:04:53.290> for<00:04:53.590> is<00:04:54.310> tying<00:04:54.790> the<00:04:54.880> Box<00:04:55.150> down<00:04:55.419> you'll

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
slot for is tying the Box down you'll

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.820 
slot for is tying the Box down you'll
see<00:04:55.810> that<00:04:56.190> you<00:04:57.190> put<00:04:57.400> that<00:04:57.520> in<00:04:57.669> like<00:04:57.820> that<00:04:58.830> you

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
see that you put that in like that you

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.469 
see that you put that in like that you
can<00:04:59.979> actually<00:05:00.100> tie<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:00.490> Box<00:05:00.790> down<00:05:01.030> sack<00:05:01.300> and

still open and close the lid

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.640 
still open and close the lid
oh<00:05:03.419> these<00:05:04.419> are<00:05:04.630> a<00:05:04.660> technological<00:05:05.530> prick

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
oh these are a technological prick

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.050 
oh these are a technological prick
release<00:05:05.950> ratchet<00:05:06.340> by<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.550> way<00:05:06.760> that<00:05:06.970> I'm

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
release ratchet by the way that I'm

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.790 
release ratchet by the way that I'm
showing<00:05:07.270> you<00:05:07.360> here<00:05:07.570> what<00:05:08.350> you<00:05:08.440> can<00:05:08.530> put<00:05:08.680> it<00:05:08.740> in

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
showing you here what you can put it in

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.940 
showing you here what you can put it in
that<00:05:08.889> way<00:05:09.720> and<00:05:10.720> anchor<00:05:11.260> the<00:05:11.350> box<00:05:11.530> down<00:05:11.740> that

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
that way and anchor the box down that

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.510 
that way and anchor the box down that
way<00:05:12.100> so<00:05:12.760> it's<00:05:13.300> actually<00:05:13.479> got<00:05:13.750> two<00:05:13.930> ways<00:05:14.139> of

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
way so it's actually got two ways of

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.340 
way so it's actually got two ways of
vacuuming<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:15.639> box

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
vacuuming the box

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.870 
vacuuming the box
another<00:05:17.350> great<00:05:17.590> feature<00:05:17.800> of<00:05:17.979> this<00:05:18.130> box<00:05:18.400> is<00:05:18.729> the

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
another great feature of this box is the

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.840 
another great feature of this box is the
size<00:05:19.180> of<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.510> boun<00:05:20.229> you<00:05:21.039> can<00:05:21.190> see<00:05:21.370> there<00:05:21.580> it's

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
size of the boun you can see there it's

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.810 
size of the boun you can see there it's
actually<00:05:22.500> 50<00:05:23.500> millimeter<00:05:24.130> so<00:05:24.430> it's<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.639> same

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
actually 50 millimeter so it's the same

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.469 
actually 50 millimeter so it's the same
size<00:05:25.120> as<00:05:25.210> the<00:05:25.360> table<00:05:25.600> on<00:05:26.020> a<00:05:26.050> car<00:05:26.350> and<00:05:26.880> I<00:05:27.880> get

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
size as the table on a car and I get

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:29.760 
size as the table on a car and I get
that<00:05:28.570> on<00:05:28.690> the<00:05:28.750> right<00:05:28.930> angle<00:05:29.260> you<00:05:29.289> can<00:05:29.470> see<00:05:29.500> just

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
that on the right angle you can see just

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.790 
that on the right angle you can see just
how<00:05:29.889> deep<00:05:30.220> that<00:05:30.250> bung<00:05:30.700> hole<00:05:30.940> is<00:05:31.380> you<00:05:32.380> see<00:05:32.620> there

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
how deep that bung hole is you see there

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.250 
how deep that bung hole is you see there
it<00:05:32.919> goes<00:05:33.100> right<00:05:33.130> through<00:05:33.630> seven<00:05:34.630> centimeters

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
it goes right through seven centimeters

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.690 
it goes right through seven centimeters
from<00:05:35.380> inside<00:05:35.800> to<00:05:35.950> the<00:05:36.039> outside<00:05:36.190> that's<00:05:36.580> how

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
from inside to the outside that's how

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.850 
from inside to the outside that's how
thick<00:05:36.910> the<00:05:37.060> wall<00:05:37.270> is<00:05:37.510> there<00:05:37.690> to<00:05:38.410> give<00:05:38.590> you<00:05:38.650> some

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
thick the wall is there to give you some

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.040 
thick the wall is there to give you some
idea<00:05:39.220> that's<00:05:39.460> at<00:05:39.610> least<00:05:39.700> twice<00:05:40.270> as<00:05:40.600> thick<00:05:40.630> as

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
idea that's at least twice as thick as

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.350 
idea that's at least twice as thick as
most<00:05:41.320> of<00:05:41.470> the<00:05:41.530> router<00:05:41.710> miles<00:05:42.150> iceboxes<00:05:43.150> on<00:05:43.270> the

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
most of the router miles iceboxes on the

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.850 
most of the router miles iceboxes on the
market<00:05:43.780> and<00:05:43.900> of<00:05:43.990> course<00:05:44.200> a<00:05:44.260> lot<00:05:44.410> thicker<00:05:44.620> than

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
market and of course a lot thicker than

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.850 
market and of course a lot thicker than
fiberglass<00:05:45.039> ice<00:05:45.550> boxes<00:05:46.030> as<00:05:46.180> well<00:05:46.210> so<00:05:47.169> the

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
fiberglass ice boxes as well so the

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.279 
fiberglass ice boxes as well so the
reason<00:05:48.220> the<00:05:48.310> bung<00:05:48.490> is<00:05:48.639> so<00:05:48.820> large<00:05:49.120> is<00:05:49.840> because

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
reason the bung is so large is because

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:51.900 
reason the bung is so large is because
with<00:05:50.470> a<00:05:50.500> box<00:05:50.770> like<00:05:51.010> this<00:05:51.250> you're<00:05:51.490> likely<00:05:51.700> to

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
with a box like this you're likely to

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.550 
with a box like this you're likely to
have<00:05:52.060> a<00:05:52.090> lot<00:05:52.360> of<00:05:52.389> big<00:05:52.630> chunks<00:05:52.840> of<00:05:53.080> ice<00:05:53.200> after

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
have a lot of big chunks of ice after

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.900 
have a lot of big chunks of ice after
the<00:05:53.800> end<00:05:53.919> of<00:05:54.039> your<00:05:54.099> camping<00:05:54.520> trip<00:05:54.700> and<00:05:54.729> it

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
the end of your camping trip and it

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.390 
the end of your camping trip and it
makes<00:05:55.090> it<00:05:55.240> easy<00:05:55.419> through<00:05:55.660> spell<00:05:56.160> lumps<00:05:57.160> of<00:05:57.250> ice

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
makes it easy through spell lumps of ice

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.040 
makes it easy through spell lumps of ice
and<00:05:57.700> of<00:05:57.760> course<00:05:57.970> in<00:05:58.120> that<00:05:58.240> same<00:05:58.450> van<00:05:58.690> hole<00:05:58.900> you

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
and of course in that same van hole you

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.659 
and of course in that same van hole you
can<00:05:59.200> also<00:05:59.320> put<00:05:59.620> a<00:05:59.650> tap<00:05:59.919> or<00:06:00.130> a<00:06:00.160> dry<00:06:00.490> and

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
can also put a tap or a dry and

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:02.730 
can also put a tap or a dry and
therefore<00:06:01.060> throw<00:06:02.020> hose<00:06:02.229> if<00:06:02.470> you<00:06:02.500> want<00:06:02.680> to

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
therefore throw hose if you want to

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.250 
therefore throw hose if you want to
drain<00:06:02.919> it<00:06:03.039> out<00:06:03.130> that<00:06:03.310> way<00:06:03.990> so<00:06:04.990> there<00:06:05.169> you<00:06:05.229> have

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
drain it out that way so there you have

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.589 
drain it out that way so there you have
it<00:06:05.500> that<00:06:05.650> wraps<00:06:05.860> up<00:06:06.070> the<00:06:06.220> 85<00:06:06.669> liter<00:06:07.000> techne<00:06:07.450> our
