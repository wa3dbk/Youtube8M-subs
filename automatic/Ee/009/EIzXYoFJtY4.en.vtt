00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 the naval did not and today I see that you 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.130
 is doing a favor to chocolate 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.990
 I really like proof and mainly 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.040
 to begin 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.440
 of late the coffee cities something of the kind 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.740
 So it's very easy to do and I'm 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.260
 to make all the ingredients the list 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.090
 complete more quantities by finding the 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.519
 blog I'll leave nobody down here 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.750
 so let's go step by step 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.899
 I'll start by pressing two games and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.129
 melted margarine you can use 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.700
 butter also forget the old and there 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.260
 I 'll mix well 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.750
 now professional sugar is fine 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:59.239
 important sugar to not stay 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:01:02.840
 too thick we're going to want it now 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.840
 with the queen 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.720
 and I'm going to make that same penalty that 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.790
 with chocolate powder 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.009
 This powdered chocolate made you rich without 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.860
 sugar can not be 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:24.770
 I thought that if there is not much revenue 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.369
 very sweet and now just mix well 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.290
 right here 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.570
 all those who have already put the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:37.400
 mix well I'll always pick up 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.400
 chocolate and chocolate can use 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.400
 fractioned 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.480
 using those based on the market 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.110
 even if they were big and we'll have 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:54.160
 that this pact in Maria or in the microwave 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:02:02.500
 now ours ours would also explore 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:07.140
 milk chocolate and condition nor 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.140
 brand or else it gets very sweet 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.930
 now I'll mix chocolate well 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:22.120
 hot from here with the dough and not strange 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.980
 consistency of the mass does not 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:31.090
 consistency of flight because it is the brand that 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:35.230
 it will not go neither milk nor yeast then it is 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.380
 be very different from bourne is more 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.380
 or less 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:53.650
 she is so if you want very good we 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.560
 peanut nuts 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.170
 whatever you want to play in a stadium that 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.680
 do you like but do not add some 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:08.769
 small pieces of chopped chocolate 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:15.940
 so I put it only when we went 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:18.640
 it's how I felt like to add or 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.650
 I know it's can not be too hot 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.650
 Chocolate recipes remains 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.090
 and that part there is optional 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:39.120
 now I would have a way is you being 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.879
 square shape because it gets 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.659
 easy you cut to be a square or 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.189
 rectangular 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.739
 but since it did not have a container 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:50.549
 fit in the square because the microwave 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.219
 Return of the same is I have with butter 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:56.700
 and I spent a little bit even evaluates 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:04:01.230
 I went chocolate to get white. 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:07.310
 deep down you know but sincere talking is normal 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.310
 you can use it in this environment 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:05:20.200
 It'll put 18 minutes. 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.700
 to know if you are right and if you leave 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.190
 a toothpick 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.150
 usually I do here in the middle right in the 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.600
 center 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:35.380
 sticks and then you see that the toothpick came out 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:38.620
 did not come out with the dough and then the 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:56.230
 our evil and you're ready just wait s / a 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:59.080
 and cut or cut girls and so 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:02.230
 round shape I did not want to hear 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.810
 in squares as it is traditional then 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:07.450
 I used to cut this cutter here 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.430
 who is the well-married cutter then it is 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.820
 super easy you put it like this 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.470
 I put it that they are all already 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.440
 Roundup means cool 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.120
 so this is a very very recipe 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.680
