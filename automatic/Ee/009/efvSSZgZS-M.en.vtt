00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
so I'm a really compare a guardian to a

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.110 
so I'm a really compare a guardian to a
paladin<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:50.870> do<00:02:51.020> lots<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.700> lots<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.880> group<00:02:53.030> of

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
paladin you do lots of lots of group of

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.470 
paladin you do lots of lots of group of
support<00:02:53.390> stuff<00:02:57.730> kind<00:02:58.730> of<00:02:58.820> shooting<00:02:59.030> chasing

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
support stuff kind of shooting chasing

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:11.039 
support stuff kind of shooting chasing
us<00:02:59.570> know<00:02:59.720> down

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:20.920 

this<00:03:12.049> little<00:03:19.389> you<00:03:20.389> lost<00:03:20.629> the

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
this little you lost the

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:35.270 
this little you lost the
waterfall

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:04:37.300 

here<00:03:36.280> we<00:03:36.370> go<00:03:36.519> is<00:03:36.670> he<00:03:36.790> a<00:03:36.879> big<00:03:37.090> battle

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.580 

so<00:04:38.240> you<00:04:38.330> can<00:04:38.450> see<00:04:38.630> I<00:04:38.660> have<00:04:38.780> no<00:04:39.140> idea<00:04:39.290> what's

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590
