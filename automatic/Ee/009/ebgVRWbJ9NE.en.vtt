on<00:00:24.840> piece<00:00:25.840> of<00:00:26.020> crap<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.970> thing's<00:00:28.450> been<00:00:28.600> up

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:28.780 
on piece of crap this thing's been up

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.440 
on piece of crap this thing's been up
for<00:00:29.520> five<00:00:30.520> probably<00:00:31.180> ten<00:00:31.480> years<00:00:32.010> there<00:00:33.010> I

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
for five probably ten years there I

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.069 
for five probably ten years there I
think<00:00:34.450> this<00:00:34.539> switch<00:00:34.749> is<00:00:34.899> failing<00:00:35.999> so<00:00:36.999> beat<00:00:37.929> the

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
think this switch is failing so beat the

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.599 
think this switch is failing so beat the
crap<00:00:38.350> out<00:00:38.530> of<00:00:38.559> I<00:00:38.710> just<00:00:38.829> get<00:00:39.039> it<00:00:39.129> to<00:00:39.219> work<00:00:39.399> I

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 
crap out of I just get it to work I

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:42.029 
crap out of I just get it to work I
think<00:00:39.820> we<00:00:39.910> might<00:00:40.089> be<00:00:40.440> pulling<00:00:41.440> this<00:00:41.620> thing<00:00:41.859> out

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
think we might be pulling this thing out

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.220 
think we might be pulling this thing out
and<00:00:42.370> replacing<00:00:43.239> it<00:00:43.510> I<00:00:43.719> don't<00:00:43.929> know<00:00:43.989> if<00:00:44.050> it's

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
and replacing it I don't know if it's

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.950 
and replacing it I don't know if it's
just<00:00:45.219> easy<00:00:45.489> replace<00:00:45.969> a<00:00:45.999> switch<00:00:46.449> or<00:00:46.719> if<00:00:46.749> I

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
just easy replace a switch or if I

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.180
