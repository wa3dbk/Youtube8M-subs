guess slim ones have different glitch

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.160 
guess slim ones have different glitch
format<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.030> they've<00:00:36.420> been<00:00:36.540> able<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.930> get

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
format and they've been able to get

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.889 
format and they've been able to get
around<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.559> are<00:00:37.680> override<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.270> but<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.780> new

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
now you can boot into linux which is

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.890 
now you can boot into linux which is
