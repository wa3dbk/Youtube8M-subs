00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
all right so what I'd like to show you

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.530 
all right so what I'd like to show you
in<00:00:03.000> this<00:00:03.540> video<00:00:03.750> is<00:00:03.990> just<00:00:04.049> how<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.350> run<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.589> basic

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
in this video is just how to run a basic

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.120 
in this video is just how to run a basic
simulation<00:00:06.540> I'm<00:00:07.049> gonna<00:00:07.259> be<00:00:07.350> using<00:00:07.589> Microsoft

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
simulation I'm gonna be using Microsoft

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.339 
simulation I'm gonna be using Microsoft
Excel<00:00:08.389> for<00:00:09.389> your<00:00:09.510> internal<00:00:09.840> assessment<00:00:10.260> you

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
Excel for your internal assessment you

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.080 
Excel for your internal assessment you
may<00:00:10.740> choose<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.010> use<00:00:11.250> Excel<00:00:11.610> you<00:00:11.759> may<00:00:11.880> choose

may choose to use Excel you may choose
not<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.200> might<00:00:13.349> not<00:00:13.380> even<00:00:13.620> do<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:14.540> any

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
not to you you might not even do a any

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.730 
not to you you might not even do a any
sort<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.929> simulation<00:00:16.410> but<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.560> was<00:00:16.650> thinking

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
sort of a simulation but I was thinking

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.380 
sort of a simulation but I was thinking
this<00:00:16.920> might<00:00:17.160> be<00:00:17.279> something<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.670> can<00:00:17.910> do<00:00:18.090> to

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
this might be something you can do to

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.720 
this might be something you can do to
kind<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.109> enhance<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.710> technology<00:00:20.310> part<00:00:20.550> of

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
kind of enhance the technology part of

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.970 
kind of enhance the technology part of
this<00:00:21.270> ia<00:00:21.480> which<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.050> one<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.439> criteria

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
this ia which is one of the criteria

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.340 
this ia which is one of the criteria
that<00:00:23.010> you're<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.400> be<00:00:23.490> graded<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:23.880> so

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
that you're going to be graded on so

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.330 
that you're going to be graded on so
what<00:00:25.350> I'm<00:00:25.439> gonna<00:00:25.529> do<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.890> I'm<00:00:26.010> gonna<00:00:26.130> go

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.160 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go
through<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.060> your<00:00:27.390> internal<00:00:27.750> assessment

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
through in in your internal assessment

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.980 
through in in your internal assessment
we're<00:00:28.289> looking<00:00:28.560> at<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.480> roll<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.840> dice

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
we're looking at it and roll of the dice

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.900 
we're looking at it and roll of the dice
versus<00:00:31.500> Bob's<00:00:31.769> roll<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.399> I'm<00:00:32.489> just<00:00:32.610> gonna<00:00:32.730> go

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
versus Bob's roll so I'm just gonna go

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.400 
versus Bob's roll so I'm just gonna go
through<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> few<00:00:33.329> things<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.230> might

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
through a few things it that you might

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.889 
through a few things it that you might
be<00:00:35.010> able<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.309> use<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.880> I'm<00:00:36.180> gonna<00:00:36.360> start<00:00:36.690> by

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
be able to use so I'm gonna start by

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.270 
be able to use so I'm gonna start by
generating<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:38.160> random<00:00:38.700> integer<00:00:39.590> for<00:00:40.590> Ann<00:00:40.800> so

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
generating a random integer for Ann so

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.970 
generating a random integer for Ann so
if<00:00:41.640> you're<00:00:42.000> gonna<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.649> let<00:00:43.649> me<00:00:43.680> close

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
if you're gonna do this let me close

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.010 
if you're gonna do this let me close
this<00:00:44.160> box<00:00:44.399> it'll<00:00:44.730> pop<00:00:44.879> open<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.329> just<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.629> second

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
this box it'll pop open in just a second

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.700 
this box it'll pop open in just a second
but<00:00:46.219> to<00:00:47.219> generate<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:48.000> random<00:00:48.239> integer<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.530> go

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
but to generate a random integer you go

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.700 
but to generate a random integer you go
up<00:00:49.890> here<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.670> look<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:51.180> your<00:00:51.710> this

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
up here and you look for your this

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.040 
up here and you look for your this
little<00:00:53.039> Sigma<00:00:53.640> sign<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.180> that's<00:00:54.329> gonna<00:00:54.780> that

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
little Sigma sign and that's gonna that

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.290 
little Sigma sign and that's gonna that
lists<00:00:55.559> all<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.710> our<00:00:55.920> functions<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:57.180> we're

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
lists all of our functions so we're

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.910 
lists all of our functions so we're
gonna<00:00:57.420> go<00:00:57.570> down<00:00:57.750> these<00:00:57.930> are<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.230> most<00:00:58.469> common

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
gonna go down these are the most common

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.260 
gonna go down these are the most common
ones<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.250> we're<00:00:59.670> gonna<00:00:59.789> go<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.030> more

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
ones but we're gonna go to more

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.900 
ones but we're gonna go to more
functions<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.520> what<00:01:02.520> we're<00:01:02.640> gonna<00:01:02.730> be

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
functions and what we're gonna be

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.170 
functions and what we're gonna be
looking<00:01:03.059> for<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.690> randbetween<00:01:04.559> now<00:01:05.400> that's

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
looking for is randbetween now that's

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.880 
looking for is randbetween now that's
popping<00:01:06.630> up<00:01:06.750> near<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.080> top<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.439> mine<00:01:07.560> because

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
popping up near the top of mine because

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.160 
popping up near the top of mine because
I<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.220> used<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.630> don't<00:01:09.810> see<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
I just used it but if you don't see it

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.630 
I just used it but if you don't see it
you<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.619> go<00:01:10.710> ahead<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.979> type<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.400> any

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
you can just go ahead and type in any

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.130 
you can just go ahead and type in any
function<00:01:11.939> like<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.510> type<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.869> Rand

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
function like you can type in Rand

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.590 
function like you can type in Rand
between<00:01:14.100> right<00:01:14.369> here<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.909> it'll

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
between right here and it'll

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.810 
between right here and it'll
automatically<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.470> pop<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.580> I'm<00:01:17.729> gonna

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
automatically just pop up so I'm gonna

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.679 
automatically just pop up so I'm gonna
click<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.740> or<00:01:19.740> double<00:01:20.040> click<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.490> and

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
click on that or double click on it and

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.880 
click on that or double click on it and
basically<00:01:21.689> what<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.049> tell<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> computer<00:01:22.619> is

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
basically what you tell the computer is

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.820 
basically what you tell the computer is
well<00:01:23.280> what<00:01:23.520> two<00:01:23.820> numbers<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.140> want<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.439> to

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
well what two numbers do you want it to

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.530 
well what two numbers do you want it to
be<00:01:25.920> between<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.520> if<00:01:26.670> I'm<00:01:26.820> rolling<00:01:27.119> two<00:01:27.299> dice

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
be between and if I'm rolling two dice

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.219 
be between and if I'm rolling two dice
then<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.170> want<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:28.979> between<00:01:29.130> one<00:01:30.229> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
then I want it to be between one the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.740 
then I want it to be between one the
bottom<00:01:31.729> integer<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.939> top<00:01:33.090> integer<00:01:33.540> of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
bottom integer and the top integer of

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.499 
bottom integer and the top integer of
six<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:35.159> once<00:01:35.340> you've<00:01:35.490> got<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.970> I'll<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.420> go

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
six so once you've got that I'll just go

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.390 
six so once you've got that I'll just go
ahead<00:01:36.570> hit<00:01:36.750> enter<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.650> generates<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
ahead hit enter and it generates a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.370 
ahead hit enter and it generates a
random<00:01:38.880> number<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.810> roll<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
random number just like a roll of the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.039 
random number just like a roll of the
dice<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.490> could<00:01:41.670> then<00:01:41.790> take<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.479> I

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
dice and I could then take this and I

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.410 
dice and I could then take this and I
could<00:01:43.439> just<00:01:43.590> drag<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.610> corner<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.090> pull<00:01:45.299> it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
could just drag the corner and pull it

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.469 
could just drag the corner and pull it
down<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.720> show<00:01:45.990> all<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.439> Ann's<00:01:46.710> rolls<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.850> could

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
down to show all of Ann's rolls I could

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.630 
down to show all of Ann's rolls I could
also<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.470> same<00:01:49.649> thing<00:01:49.890> for<00:01:50.070> Bob's<00:01:50.310> rolls

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
also do the same thing for Bob's rolls

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.090 
also do the same thing for Bob's rolls
now<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.659> notice<00:01:52.020> any<00:01:52.259> time<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.590> do<00:01:52.770> something

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
now you notice any time I do something

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.219 
now you notice any time I do something
on<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> spreadsheet<00:01:53.729> those<00:01:54.299> integers<00:01:54.840> change

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
on the spreadsheet those integers change

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.060 
on the spreadsheet those integers change
which<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.250> totally<00:01:56.939> fine<00:01:57.590> but<00:01:58.590> that's<00:01:58.860> how<00:01:59.009> you

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
which is totally fine but that's how you

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.300 
which is totally fine but that's how you
you<00:01:59.579> generate<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:01.290> random<00:02:01.469> integers<00:02:02.100> I

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
you generate the the random integers I

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.179 
you generate the the random integers I
should<00:02:03.060> make<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> note<00:02:03.899> right<00:02:04.110> now<00:02:04.320> I'm<00:02:04.560> showing

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
should make a note right now I'm showing

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.089 
should make a note right now I'm showing
you<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.610> simulation<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.570> for<00:02:07.229> what<00:02:08.009> are

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
you this simulation just for what are

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.369 
you this simulation just for what are
the<00:02:08.190> five<00:02:08.459> rolls<00:02:08.879> here<00:02:09.179> obviously<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.259> do

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
the five rolls here obviously if you do

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.869 
the five rolls here obviously if you do
a<00:02:10.410> simulation<00:02:10.979> you're<00:02:11.370> gonna<00:02:11.459> want<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.760> do<00:02:11.849> a

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
a simulation you're gonna want to do a

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.030 
a simulation you're gonna want to do a
lot<00:02:12.180> more<00:02:12.209> rolls<00:02:12.690> than<00:02:12.840> than<00:02:13.410> just

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
lot more rolls than than just

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.140 
lot more rolls than than just
because<00:02:14.370> what<00:02:14.519> you're<00:02:14.610> gonna<00:02:14.700> be<00:02:14.849> trying<00:02:15.060> to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
because what you're gonna be trying to

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.660 
because what you're gonna be trying to
do<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.680> verify<00:02:16.680> what<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.400> found

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
do is verify what you found

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.080 
do is verify what you found
theoretically<00:02:18.680> in<00:02:19.680> doing<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.700> math<00:02:20.879> in<00:02:21.060> your

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
theoretically in doing the math in your

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.699 
theoretically in doing the math in your
internal<00:02:21.569> assessment<00:02:22.079> so<00:02:22.230> if<00:02:22.319> I<00:02:22.379> only<00:02:22.500> use

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
internal assessment so if I only use

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.470 
internal assessment so if I only use
five<00:02:22.980> that's<00:02:23.459> probably<00:02:23.970> not<00:02:24.150> going<00:02:24.299> to<00:02:24.360> be

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
five that's probably not going to be

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.319 
five that's probably not going to be
enough<00:02:24.890> but<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:26.579> you<00:02:26.670> can<00:02:26.790> see<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.180> all<00:02:27.299> on

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
enough but just so you can see it all on

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.210 
enough but just so you can see it all on
the<00:02:27.599> screen<00:02:27.720> here<00:02:28.230> that's<00:02:28.860> what<00:02:28.980> I'm<00:02:29.040> going<00:02:29.159> to

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
the screen here that's what I'm going to

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.899 
the screen here that's what I'm going to
be<00:02:29.310> doing<00:02:29.519> in<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.810> video<00:02:31.370> so<00:02:32.370> now<00:02:32.579> what<00:02:32.790> we

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
be doing in this video so now what we

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.220 
be doing in this video so now what we
want<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.150> do<00:02:33.239> is<00:02:33.329> we<00:02:33.450> want<00:02:33.629> to<00:02:33.659> compare<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.200> two

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
want to do is we want to compare the two

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.009 
want to do is we want to compare the two
roles<00:02:34.560> okay<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.220> we<00:02:35.790> know<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.000> if<00:02:36.360> an<00:02:36.720> has<00:02:36.989> a

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
roles okay so we know that if an has a

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.539 
roles okay so we know that if an has a
higher<00:02:37.409> role<00:02:37.829> than<00:02:38.099> Bob

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
higher role than Bob

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.399 
higher role than Bob
she<00:02:38.849> wins<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.720> like<00:02:39.870> if<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.019> look<00:02:40.200> at<00:02:40.319> this

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
she wins so like if you look at this

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.250 
she wins so like if you look at this
first<00:02:40.590> one<00:02:40.769> and<00:02:41.159> got<00:02:41.400> three<00:02:41.760> Bob<00:02:42.180> got<00:02:42.450> four<00:02:42.720> so

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
first one and got three Bob got four so

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.839 
first one and got three Bob got four so
Bob<00:02:43.470> was<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.799> winner<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.489> have<00:02:44.609> to<00:02:44.760> have

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
Bob was the winner so we have to have

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.119 
Bob was the winner so we have to have
the<00:02:44.970> computer<00:02:45.450> be<00:02:45.599> able<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:46.129> basically

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
the computer be able to basically

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.059 
the computer be able to basically
compare<00:02:47.790> those<00:02:47.970> two<00:02:48.209> values<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.709> my

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
compare those two values so in my

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.069 
compare those two values so in my
formula<00:02:50.760> builder<00:02:51.090> here<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:51.599> I<00:02:51.659> get<00:02:51.840> again<00:02:52.019> I

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
formula builder here so I get again I

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.379 
formula builder here so I get again I
could<00:02:52.290> click<00:02:52.440> on<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:53.190> Sigma<00:02:53.579> up<00:02:53.730> here<00:02:53.970> or<00:02:54.090> just

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
could click on the Sigma up here or just

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:55.879 
could click on the Sigma up here or just
leave<00:02:54.629> this<00:02:54.810> open

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
leave this open

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.170 
leave this open
you're<00:02:56.190> gonna<00:02:56.280> type<00:02:56.579> in<00:02:56.849> or<00:02:56.970> you're<00:02:57.090> gonna

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
you're gonna type in or you're gonna

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.830 
you're gonna type in or you're gonna
look<00:02:57.389> for<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:57.750> yes<00:02:58.409> well<00:02:58.950> if<00:02:59.310> function<00:03:00.060> okay

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
look for the yes well if function okay

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.420 
look for the yes well if function okay
so<00:03:01.650> I'm<00:03:01.859> gonna<00:03:01.950> choose<00:03:02.280> if<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:04.099> now<00:03:05.099> you<00:03:05.159> have

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
so I'm gonna choose if and now you have

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.879 
so I'm gonna choose if and now you have
two<00:03:05.609> you're<00:03:06.209> gonna<00:03:06.299> be<00:03:06.510> doing<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:07.079> test<00:03:07.379> here<00:03:07.620> so

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
two you're gonna be doing a test here so

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.710 
two you're gonna be doing a test here so
if<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.099> look<00:03:08.129> at<00:03:08.400> this<00:03:08.639> okay<00:03:09.090> we<00:03:09.359> want<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.629> know

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
if you look at this okay we want to know

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.990 
if you look at this okay we want to know
if<00:03:09.959> this<00:03:10.560> number<00:03:10.829> solved<00:03:11.370> it's<00:03:11.489> click<00:03:11.700> on<00:03:11.849> that

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
if this number solved it's click on that

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.300 
if this number solved it's click on that
okay<00:03:12.690> if<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.500> is<00:03:13.680> bigger<00:03:14.010> than<00:03:14.599> this<00:03:15.599> number

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
okay if that is bigger than this number

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.710 
okay if that is bigger than this number
then<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.549> can<00:03:17.730> go<00:03:17.849> ahead<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.150> can<00:03:18.209> return

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
then I can go ahead and I can return

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.819 
then I can go ahead and I can return
some<00:03:19.230> value<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:20.459> if<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.849> look<00:03:21.030> over<00:03:21.180> here<00:03:21.829> let's

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
some value so if I look over here let's

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.400 
some value so if I look over here let's
say<00:03:22.980> if<00:03:23.489> B<00:03:23.519> 2<00:03:24.060> is<00:03:24.209> bigger<00:03:24.359> than<00:03:24.629> C<00:03:24.840> 2<00:03:25.049> so<00:03:25.319> if

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
say if B 2 is bigger than C 2 so if

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.439 
say if B 2 is bigger than C 2 so if
Ann's<00:03:25.709> role<00:03:26.069> is<00:03:26.250> bigger<00:03:26.430> than<00:03:26.609> Bob's<00:03:26.879> role<00:03:27.209> I'm

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
Ann's role is bigger than Bob's role I'm

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:32.300 
Ann's role is bigger than Bob's role I'm
gonna<00:03:27.989> return<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.470> value<00:03:28.859> of<00:03:29.449> 1<00:03:30.449> okay<00:03:31.169> and<00:03:32.010> if

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
gonna return a value of 1 okay and if

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.069 
gonna return a value of 1 okay and if
it's<00:03:32.519> not<00:03:32.760> bigger<00:03:33.090> than<00:03:33.329> it<00:03:33.480> then<00:03:33.870> I'm<00:03:33.959> gonna

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
it's not bigger than it then I'm gonna

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.580 
it's not bigger than it then I'm gonna
return<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.680> value<00:03:34.949> of<00:03:35.340> 0<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.239> hit<00:03:37.139> enter<00:03:37.319> and

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
return a value of 0 I hit enter and

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.860 
return a value of 0 I hit enter and
again<00:03:38.489> my<00:03:38.609> numbers<00:03:38.910> have<00:03:39.030> just<00:03:39.180> changed<00:03:39.660> so<00:03:39.780> if

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
again my numbers have just changed so if

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.710 
again my numbers have just changed so if
you<00:03:39.930> look<00:03:40.109> and<00:03:40.290> roll<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:40.949> 1<00:03:41.129> Bob<00:03:41.579> roll<00:03:41.819> to<00:03:41.940> 5<00:03:42.150> so

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
you look and roll to 1 Bob roll to 5 so

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.089 
you look and roll to 1 Bob roll to 5 so
and<00:03:42.900> didn't<00:03:43.199> win<00:03:43.349> because<00:03:43.560> she<00:03:43.739> didn't<00:03:44.040> have

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
and didn't win because she didn't have

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.250 
and didn't win because she didn't have
the<00:03:44.190> higher<00:03:44.430> score<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.599> returned<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:46.109> value

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
the higher score and it returned a value

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.490 
the higher score and it returned a value
of<00:03:46.530> 0<00:03:46.799> if<00:03:47.669> I<00:03:48.060> want<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.329> record<00:03:48.599> Bob's<00:03:48.870> wins<00:03:49.199> it's

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
of 0 if I want to record Bob's wins it's

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.250 
of 0 if I want to record Bob's wins it's
exactly<00:03:49.919> the<00:03:50.129> same<00:03:50.310> okay<00:03:50.940> except<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:51.870> will<00:03:52.079> go

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
exactly the same okay except I will go

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.680 
exactly the same okay except I will go
if<00:03:53.599> Bob's<00:03:54.599> roles<00:03:54.959> are<00:03:55.489> greater<00:03:56.489> than<00:03:56.639> or<00:03:57.090> equal

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
if Bob's roles are greater than or equal

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.330 
if Bob's roles are greater than or equal
to<00:03:57.900> that's<00:03:58.319> how<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:58.530> do<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.709> greater<00:03:58.980> than<00:03:59.099> or

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
to that's how you do a greater than or

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.780 
to that's how you do a greater than or
equal<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.699> in<00:03:59.819> Excel<00:04:00.120> Ann's<00:04:00.930> roles<00:04:01.379> okay<00:04:02.099> then

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
equal to in Excel Ann's roles okay then

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.789 
equal to in Excel Ann's roles okay then
I'm<00:04:03.120> gonna<00:04:03.269> give<00:04:03.569> Bob<00:04:03.840> 1<00:04:04.199> and<00:04:04.639> give<00:04:05.639> him<00:04:05.849> 0<00:04:06.799> so

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
I'm gonna give Bob 1 and give him 0 so

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.069 
I'm gonna give Bob 1 and give him 0 so
if<00:04:08.340> I've<00:04:08.549> done<00:04:08.730> this<00:04:08.879> correctly<00:04:08.940> one<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:09.810> these

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
if I've done this correctly one of these

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.110 
if I've done this correctly one of these
squares<00:04:10.530> should<00:04:10.889> always<00:04:11.010> be<00:04:11.250> 0<00:04:11.579> and<00:04:11.849> one

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
squares should always be 0 and one

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.670 
squares should always be 0 and one
should<00:04:12.359> always<00:04:12.510> be<00:04:12.810> 1<00:04:13.019> so<00:04:13.349> if<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:13.530> look<00:04:13.650> here

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
should always be 1 so if you look here

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.559 
should always be 1 so if you look here
Bob's<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:14.609> winner<00:04:14.849> because<00:04:15.150> he<00:04:15.299> rolled

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
Bob's the winner because he rolled

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.240 
Bob's the winner because he rolled
higher<00:04:15.780> than<00:04:16.019> an<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:16.620> then<00:04:16.859> I<00:04:16.919> could<00:04:17.099> just

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
higher than an and then I could just

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.009 
higher than an and then I could just
take<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:17.820> drag<00:04:18.570> it<00:04:18.750> on<00:04:18.840> down<00:04:20.000> well<00:04:21.019> take

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
take that and drag it on down well take

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.040 
take that and drag it on down well take
that<00:04:22.049> drag<00:04:22.800> it<00:04:22.979> on<00:04:23.070> down<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.639> do<00:04:24.539> all<00:04:24.719> of<00:04:24.750> those

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
that drag it on down to do all of those

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.590 
that drag it on down to do all of those
take<00:04:25.919> that<00:04:26.159> drag<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:26.760> on<00:04:26.849> down

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
take that drag it on down

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.560 
take that drag it on down
and<00:04:28.280> that'll<00:04:29.280> keep<00:04:29.460> track<00:04:29.790> of<00:04:30.060> how<00:04:30.210> many<00:04:30.270> times

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
and that'll keep track of how many times

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.630 
and that'll keep track of how many times
an<00:04:30.900> is<00:04:31.020> winning<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:31.440> how<00:04:31.680> many<00:04:31.860> times<00:04:32.130> Bob<00:04:32.490> is

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
an is winning and how many times Bob is

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.270 
an is winning and how many times Bob is
winning<00:04:32.940> which<00:04:33.900> is<00:04:34.080> really<00:04:34.680> what<00:04:34.860> we<00:04:34.980> want<00:04:35.190> to

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
winning which is really what we want to

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.320 
winning which is really what we want to
know<00:04:35.370> when<00:04:35.550> we're<00:04:35.640> figuring<00:04:35.820> out<00:04:36.150> the

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
know when we're figuring out the

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.590 
know when we're figuring out the
theoretical<00:04:36.900> probability<00:04:37.580> so<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.820> sorry<00:04:39.510> the

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
theoretical probability so the sorry the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.020 
theoretical probability so the sorry the
experimental<00:04:40.350> probability<00:04:40.550> so<00:04:41.550> here<00:04:41.880> I'm

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
experimental probability so here I'm

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.700 
experimental probability so here I'm
just<00:04:42.270> gonna<00:04:42.480> do<00:04:42.750> a<00:04:42.780> sum<00:04:43.140> because<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:43.530> want<00:04:43.680> to

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
just gonna do a sum because I want to

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.940 
just gonna do a sum because I want to
add<00:04:43.890> up<00:04:44.130> all<00:04:44.340> of<00:04:44.580> Ann's<00:04:44.820> wins<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.660> that's<00:04:46.650> just

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
add up all of Ann's wins and that's just

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.430 
add up all of Ann's wins and that's just
up<00:04:47.100> here<00:04:47.400> in<00:04:47.580> your<00:04:47.850> formulas<00:04:48.510> very<00:04:48.930> first<00:04:49.230> one

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
up here in your formulas very first one

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
up here in your formulas very first one
and<00:04:50.430> it<00:04:50.610> automatically<00:04:51.150> chose<00:04:51.600> those<00:04:52.460> so

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
and it automatically chose those so

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.850 
and it automatically chose those so
that's<00:04:53.700> fine<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.480> then<00:04:55.020> I'm<00:04:55.140> gonna<00:04:55.230> drag<00:04:55.650> that

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
that's fine and then I'm gonna drag that

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.560 
that's fine and then I'm gonna drag that
cell<00:04:56.220> over<00:04:56.250> because<00:04:56.730> I<00:04:56.820> want<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.060> sum<00:04:57.270> up<00:04:57.450> the

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
cell over because I want to sum up the

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.100 
cell over because I want to sum up the
next<00:04:57.780> one<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.560> it'll<00:04:58.800> automatically<00:04:59.520> do<00:04:59.820> that

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
next one and it'll automatically do that

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.200 
next one and it'll automatically do that
so<00:05:01.110> you<00:05:01.170> see<00:05:01.440> in<00:05:01.530> my<00:05:01.680> first<00:05:02.220> simulation<00:05:03.000> here

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
so you see in my first simulation here

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.470 
so you see in my first simulation here
and<00:05:03.420> one<00:05:04.170> three<00:05:04.530> times<00:05:04.770> in<00:05:05.190> Bob<00:05:05.490> one<00:05:05.790> two<00:05:06.210> times

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
and one three times in Bob one two times

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.200 
and one three times in Bob one two times
so<00:05:07.380> according<00:05:08.040> to<00:05:08.070> this<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.520> probability<00:05:09.000> of

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
so according to this the probability of

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.990 
so according to this the probability of
an<00:05:09.480> winning<00:05:09.990> is<00:05:10.140> three<00:05:10.770> out<00:05:10.920> of<00:05:10.950> five<00:05:11.220> and<00:05:11.550> the

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
an winning is three out of five and the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.910 
an winning is three out of five and the
probability<00:05:12.660> of<00:05:12.690> Bob<00:05:12.960> winning<00:05:13.320> is<00:05:13.440> two<00:05:13.770> out<00:05:13.890> of

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
probability of Bob winning is two out of

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.710 
probability of Bob winning is two out of
five<00:05:14.160> and<00:05:14.490> you<00:05:14.700> can<00:05:14.730> kind<00:05:14.970> of<00:05:15.030> just<00:05:15.120> figure

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
five and you can kind of just figure

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.080 
five and you can kind of just figure
that<00:05:15.870> out<00:05:16.050> pretty<00:05:16.080> easily<00:05:16.470> or<00:05:16.890> if<00:05:17.490> I<00:05:17.610> wanted<00:05:17.910> to

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
that out pretty easily or if I wanted to

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.380 
that out pretty easily or if I wanted to
to<00:05:18.660> put<00:05:18.840> it<00:05:18.960> into<00:05:19.140> my<00:05:19.230> simulation<00:05:19.800> I<00:05:19.950> would<00:05:20.100> say

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
to put it into my simulation I would say

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.670 
to put it into my simulation I would say
make<00:05:21.390> a<00:05:21.420> formula<00:05:21.930> here<00:05:21.960> I'm<00:05:22.230> just<00:05:22.320> gonna<00:05:22.440> build

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
make a formula here I'm just gonna build

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.400 
make a formula here I'm just gonna build
this<00:05:22.890> one<00:05:23.040> myself<00:05:23.190> somebody's<00:05:23.940> equals<00:05:24.410> my

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
this one myself somebody's equals my

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.140 
this one myself somebody's equals my
probability<00:05:26.070> would<00:05:26.190> be<00:05:26.250> an<00:05:27.410> divided<00:05:28.410> by<00:05:29.150> the

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
probability would be an divided by the

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.170 
probability would be an divided by the
total<00:05:30.420> number<00:05:30.630> of<00:05:30.870> games<00:05:31.200> so<00:05:31.650> that<00:05:31.830> would<00:05:32.010> be

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
total number of games so that would be

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.600 
total number of games so that would be
an<00:05:33.180> x'<00:05:33.240> wins<00:05:33.720> plus<00:05:34.820> Bob's<00:05:35.820> wins<00:05:36.200> and<00:05:37.400> so<00:05:38.400> now

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
an x' wins plus Bob's wins and so now

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.270 
an x' wins plus Bob's wins and so now
again<00:05:39.120> my<00:05:39.570> numbers<00:05:39.900> continue<00:05:40.410> to<00:05:40.440> change<00:05:40.830> so

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
again my numbers continue to change so

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.740 
again my numbers continue to change so
write<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.610> probability<00:05:41.820> of<00:05:42.120> an<00:05:42.270> winning<00:05:42.630> is

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
write the probability of an winning is

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.490 
write the probability of an winning is
0.6<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:44.130> probability<00:05:44.640> of<00:05:44.670> Bob<00:05:44.970> winning<00:05:45.500> same

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
0.6 the probability of Bob winning same

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.920 
0.6 the probability of Bob winning same
thing<00:05:47.330> Bob's<00:05:48.330> wins<00:05:48.660> divided<00:05:49.470> by<00:05:49.560> the<00:05:49.620> total

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
thing Bob's wins divided by the total

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.760 
thing Bob's wins divided by the total
don't<00:05:51.930> forget<00:05:52.200> you<00:05:52.290> need<00:05:52.410> to<00:05:52.470> put<00:05:52.680> your

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
don't forget you need to put your

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.740 
don't forget you need to put your
brackets<00:05:53.220> in<00:05:53.400> there<00:05:56.300> all<00:05:57.300> right<00:05:57.420> so<00:05:57.480> in<00:05:57.720> this

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
brackets in there all right so in this

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.200 
brackets in there all right so in this
simulation<00:05:58.260> again<00:05:58.530> now<00:05:58.710> where<00:05:58.890> it<00:05:59.010> ends<00:05:59.670> 120

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
simulation again now where it ends 120

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.200 
simulation again now where it ends 120
percent<00:06:00.570> of<00:06:00.630> the<00:06:00.720> time<00:06:00.960> and<00:06:01.140> Bob's<00:06:01.380> won<00:06:01.650> 80%

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210

your these are our experimental
probabilities<00:06:05.490> these<00:06:06.090> will<00:06:06.420> become<00:06:06.570> they

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
probabilities these will become they

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.960 
probabilities these will become they
should<00:06:07.350> get<00:06:07.560> closer<00:06:07.920> and<00:06:08.190> closer<00:06:08.460> to<00:06:08.850> the

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
should get closer and closer to the

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.210 
should get closer and closer to the
theoretical<00:06:09.360> probabilities<00:06:10.290> the<00:06:10.950> more

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
theoretical probabilities the more

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.220 
theoretical probabilities the more

trials that I perform in this simulation

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.070 
trials that I perform in this simulation
okay<00:06:14.010> so
