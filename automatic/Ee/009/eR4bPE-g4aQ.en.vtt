00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
this time we went pretty well not a lot

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.110 
this time we went pretty well not a lot
of<00:00:10.500> shutting<00:00:10.830> at<00:00:10.950> all<00:00:11.099> little<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.670> no<00:00:11.820> shedding

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
of shutting at all little to no shedding

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.600 
of shutting at all little to no shedding
so<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.349> back<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.740> my<00:00:13.769> hair<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.099> use<00:00:14.400> these

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.440 
really the trick to roller sets is
keeping<00:02:13.629> your<00:02:13.750> hair<00:02:13.930> wet<00:02:14.910> sort<00:02:15.910> of<00:02:16.030> nicely

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
keeping your hair wet sort of nicely

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.330 
keeping your hair wet sort of nicely
smoothly<00:02:17.200> go<00:02:17.470> on<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.709> roller<00:02:18.840> comment<00:02:19.840> again

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
smoothly go on the roller comment again

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.160 
smoothly go on the roller comment again
and<00:02:21.340> now<00:02:21.489> I'm<00:02:21.580> going<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.790> take<00:02:21.970> my<00:02:22.150> art<00:02:22.390> araj<00:02:23.019> on

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
and now I'm going to take my art araj on

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.699 
and now I'm going to take my art araj on
oil<00:02:23.379> and<00:02:24.450> just<00:02:25.450> pick<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.840> very<00:02:26.290> small<00:02:26.650> amount

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
oil and just pick a very small amount

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.949 
oil and just pick a very small amount
dime<00:02:27.190> size<00:02:27.989> this<00:02:28.989> is<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.200> heat<00:02:29.470> protectant<00:02:30.959> the

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
dime size this is a heat protectant the

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.080 
dime size this is a heat protectant the
leave-in<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.440> used<00:02:32.650> was<00:02:32.829> also<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.220> he<00:02:33.459> protected

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
leave-in I used was also a he protected

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.979 
leave-in I used was also a he protected
I<00:02:34.299> mean<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.140> steady<00:02:35.379> motion<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.829> used<00:02:36.599> was<00:02:37.599> also

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
I mean the steady motion I used was also

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.500 
I mean the steady motion I used was also
illegal<00:02:38.590> he<00:02:38.890> protected<00:02:40.859> so<00:02:41.859> then<00:02:42.390> we<00:02:43.390> go

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
illegal he protected so then we go

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.430 
illegal he protected so then we go
through<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.780> one<00:02:43.930> more<00:02:43.989> time<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:47.260> then<00:02:47.410> I

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
through that one more time so then I

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.860 
through that one more time so then I
take<00:02:47.739> it

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.470 

wrap<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:53.799> around<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.190> roller<00:02:55.349> with<00:02:56.349> tension

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
wrap it around the roller with tension

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.860 
wrap it around the roller with tension
just<00:02:58.480> tug<00:02:58.780> it<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.959> little<00:02:59.110> bit<00:02:59.349> not<00:02:59.709> too<00:02:59.739> tight

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
just tug it a little bit not too tight

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.479 
just tug it a little bit not too tight
wrap<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.049> around<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:04.500> then<00:03:05.500> I'm<00:03:06.159> going

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
wrap it around and then I'm going

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.550 
wrap it around and then I'm going
backwards<00:03:09.780> let's<00:03:10.780> straighten<00:03:11.049> that<00:03:11.170> onto<00:03:11.470> the

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
backwards let's straighten that onto the

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:20.970 
backwards let's straighten that onto the
roller<00:03:13.560> like<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:17.879> take<00:03:18.879> my<00:03:19.030> clip<00:03:19.709> my<00:03:20.709> metal

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
roller like that take my clip my metal

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:33.539 
roller like that take my clip my metal
clip<00:03:21.299> I'm<00:03:22.299> sliding<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:23.110> through<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:28.180> that<00:03:32.549> no

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
clip I'm sliding it through like that no

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.809 
clip I'm sliding it through like that no
more<00:03:34.530> on<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.799> other<00:03:35.950> side<00:03:38.340> okay<00:03:39.340> so<00:03:39.400> that's

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
more on the other side okay so that's

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.410 
more on the other side okay so that's
how<00:03:40.000> I<00:03:40.030> big<00:03:40.299> doing<00:03:40.569> my<00:03:40.690> roller<00:03:40.900> sets<00:03:42.180> I'm<00:03:43.180> gonna

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
how I big doing my roller sets I'm gonna

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.849 
how I big doing my roller sets I'm gonna
put<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.810> part<00:03:44.079> two<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.319> show<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:44.769> the
