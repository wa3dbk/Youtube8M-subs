00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
I think it did decently there's some

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.660 
I think it did decently there's some
areas<00:00:36.870> where<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.170> can<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.710> saw<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.280> had<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.550> lot

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.230 
think you wrestled I felt like I was
more<00:01:36.829> offensive<00:01:37.829> than<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.070> have<00:01:38.310> been<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:39.090> in

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
more offensive than I have been like in

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.780 
more offensive than I have been like in
the<00:01:39.360> room<00:01:39.680> but<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.740> also<00:01:40.950> feel<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.310> could<00:01:41.640> be

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
the room but I also feel like I could be

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.700 
the room but I also feel like I could be
more<00:01:41.970> offensive<00:01:42.479> than<00:01:42.509> where<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.780> was<00:01:42.840> at<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
more offensive than where I was at the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.260 
more offensive than where I was at the
tournament<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:46.159> pretty<00:01:47.159> well<00:01:47.399> do<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.210> think

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
tournament so pretty well do you think

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.480 
tournament so pretty well do you think
you<00:01:48.540> got<00:01:48.750> better<00:01:49.110> match<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.799> math<00:01:49.979> did<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.369> get

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
you got better match to math did you get

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.260 
you got better match to math did you get
more<00:01:50.670> comfortable<00:01:51.380> yeah<00:01:52.380> as<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:53.340> turnaround<00:01:53.790> I

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
more comfortable yeah as a turnaround I

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.649 
more comfortable yeah as a turnaround I
felt<00:01:54.600> better<00:01:54.960> about<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.500> college<00:01:56.159> down

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
felt better about the college down

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.950 
felt better about the college down
College<00:01:57.280> more<00:01:58.280> of<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.520> college<00:01:58.850> timing<00:01:59.359> of

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
College more of the college timing of

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.499 
College more of the college timing of
the<00:02:00.170> matches<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:01.219> maybe<00:02:01.579> how<00:02:01.819> how<00:02:02.270> you're

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
the matches and maybe how how you're

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.029 
the matches and maybe how how you're
making<00:02:02.689> the<00:02:02.960> transitions<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:03.710> get<00:02:03.859> more

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
making the transitions you get more

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.959 
making the transitions you get more
confident<00:02:04.520> in<00:02:04.609> that<00:02:04.640> yeah

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
confident in that yeah

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.039 
confident in that yeah
what<00:02:07.969> can<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:08.269> work<00:02:08.450> on<00:02:08.599> it<00:02:08.720> from<00:02:08.840> another

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
what can you work on it from another

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:14.050 
what can you work on it from another
tournament<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:12.099> lot<00:02:13.099> of<00:02:13.250> bottom<00:02:13.670> work<00:02:13.819> and

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
tournament a lot of bottom work and

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.050 
tournament a lot of bottom work and
getting<00:02:14.299> off<00:02:14.450> bottom<00:02:14.840> immediately<00:02:15.440> and

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
getting off bottom immediately and

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.930 
getting off bottom immediately and
probably<00:02:17.060> more<00:02:18.049> offense<00:02:18.530> from<00:02:18.940> neutral

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
probably more offense from neutral

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.780 
probably more offense from neutral

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
and maybe and maybe it's not that
