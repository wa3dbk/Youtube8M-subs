then cutting off the remainder and

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.810 
then cutting off the remainder and
that's<00:05:09.389> what<00:05:09.570> I<00:05:09.600> did<00:05:10.250> for<00:05:11.250> this<00:05:11.460> application

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
that's what I did for this application

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.560 
that's what I did for this application
so<00:05:12.570> we'll<00:05:12.720> see<00:05:12.990> how<00:05:13.020> long<00:05:13.470> this<00:05:14.570> actually

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
so we'll see how long this actually

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.120 
so we'll see how long this actually
stays<00:05:15.870> down<00:05:18.169> this<00:05:19.169> typically<00:05:19.620> it<00:05:19.830> starts

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
stays down this typically it starts

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.180 
stays down this typically it starts
coming<00:05:20.460> up<00:05:20.610> after<00:05:20.849> a<00:05:21.060> day<00:05:21.830> so<00:05:23.479> you<00:05:24.479> will<00:05:24.660> see
