00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
wider so that is just for comparative

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.500 
wider so that is just for comparative
sake<00:00:58.170> they<00:00:58.890> really<00:00:59.160> fit<00:00:59.399> well<00:00:59.579> next<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.359> one

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
sake they really fit well next to one

so<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:02.579> doesn't<00:02:02.850> really<00:02:02.939> matter<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.390> it's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
so it doesn't really matter that it's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.109 
so it doesn't really matter that it's
revealed<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.439> guess<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.189> here's<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.880> actual

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119

most part you'll find them in the five
to<00:04:23.820> seven<00:04:24.180> hundred<00:04:24.210> range

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
to seven hundred range

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.070 
to seven hundred range
but<00:04:25.740> since<00:04:26.220> they're<00:04:26.370> so<00:04:26.550> rare<00:04:26.789> you<00:04:27.210> know<00:04:27.360> who

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
but since they're so rare you know who

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.320 
but since they're so rare you know who
knows<00:04:28.289> in<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:29.070> year's<00:04:29.370> time<00:04:29.430> with<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.060> Zelda

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
knows in a year's time with the Zelda

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.270 
knows in a year's time with the Zelda
series<00:04:30.360> it's<00:04:30.750> bigger

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
series it's bigger

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.499 
series it's bigger
obviously<00:04:32.280> this<00:04:32.759> will<00:04:32.940> become<00:04:33.210> even<00:04:33.479> more

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
obviously this will become even more

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.529 
obviously this will become even more
electable<00:04:34.229> but<00:04:35.009> so<00:04:35.550> it's<00:04:35.729> kind<00:04:35.940> of<00:04:36.030> rare<00:04:36.240> kind

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
electable but so it's kind of rare kind

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:37.820 
electable but so it's kind of rare kind
of<00:04:36.630> hard<00:04:36.840> to<00:04:36.870> find<00:04:37.110> even<00:04:37.470> though<00:04:37.620> there's

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
of hard to find even though there's

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.240 
of hard to find even though there's
2,500<00:04:38.190> of<00:04:38.610> them<00:04:38.759> it's<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:39.389> bit<00:04:39.539> pricey<00:04:40.250> that's

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
2,500 of them it's a bit pricey that's

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.040 
2,500 of them it's a bit pricey that's
pretty<00:04:41.430> much<00:04:41.520> going<00:04:41.729> to<00:04:41.789> do<00:04:41.880> it<00:04:42.000> so<00:04:42.419> stay<00:04:42.840> tuned

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
pretty much going to do it so stay tuned

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.629 
pretty much going to do it so stay tuned
next<00:04:43.259> week<00:04:43.380> for<00:04:43.680> another<00:04:43.710> collection<00:04:44.340> video
