the path is gone but you will notice
that<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.219> eyelashes<00:02:35.730> pretty<00:02:36.000> harsh<00:02:36.389> it's

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
that the eyelashes pretty harsh it's

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.259 
that the eyelashes pretty harsh it's
it's<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.739> little<00:02:37.950> bit<00:02:38.069> too<00:02:38.219> dark<00:02:38.489> so<00:02:39.150> we're

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
it's a little bit too dark so we're

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.809 
it's a little bit too dark so we're
going<00:02:39.359> to<00:02:39.480> change<00:02:39.719> the<00:02:39.959> blending<00:02:40.530> mode<00:02:40.560> to

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
going to change the blending mode to

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.970 
going to change the blending mode to
soft<00:02:41.819> light<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.480> turn<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.349> opacity<00:02:43.650> down

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
soft light and turn the opacity down

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.330 
soft light and turn the opacity down
whoops<00:02:44.579> turn<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.209> opacity<00:02:45.450> down<00:02:45.689> to<00:02:46.049> around

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
whoops turn the opacity down to around

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.270 
whoops turn the opacity down to around
seventy<00:02:47.340> percent<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:48.650> now<00:02:49.650> we<00:02:49.709> have<00:02:49.829> a<00:02:49.950> pretty

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
seventy percent and now we have a pretty

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.479 
seventy percent and now we have a pretty
realistic<00:02:51.060> eyelash<00:02:51.480> now<00:02:51.720> obviously

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
realistic eyelash now obviously

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.379 
realistic eyelash now obviously
depending<00:02:53.489> on<00:02:53.700> I'm<00:02:54.000> going<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.180> turn<00:02:54.299> the

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
depending on I'm going to turn the

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.390 
depending on I'm going to turn the
opacity<00:02:54.629> down<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.959> little<00:02:55.109> bit<00:02:55.260> more<00:02:55.439> depending

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
opacity down a little bit more depending

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.030 
opacity down a little bit more depending
on<00:02:56.639> the<00:02:57.120> current<00:02:57.689> state<00:02:58.049> of<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.590> current

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
going to group these in a in a folder

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.119 
going to group these in a in a folder
just<00:04:01.409> like<00:04:01.590> so<00:04:02.060> and<00:04:03.319> if<00:04:04.319> we<00:04:04.439> look<00:04:04.590> at<00:04:04.709> what<00:04:05.009> it

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
just like so and if we look at what it

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.229 
looked like before this is what it

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.080 
looked like before this is what it
looked<00:04:07.349> like<00:04:07.409> before<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:08.159> this<00:04:08.729> is<00:04:08.849> what<00:04:09.000> it

looked<00:04:09.269> like<00:04:09.359> after<00:04:10.099> so<00:04:11.099> it's<00:04:11.280> pretty

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
looked like after so it's pretty

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.240 
looked like after so it's pretty
realistic<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.359> we<00:04:12.449> zoom<00:04:12.659> out<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:13.349> definitely

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
realistic and we zoom out it definitely

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.779 
realistic and we zoom out it definitely
looks<00:04:14.639> pretty<00:04:15.599> realistic<00:04:16.139> for<00:04:16.829> very<00:04:17.340> quick

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
bit more realistic and of course you can

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.180 
bit more realistic and of course you can
add<00:04:24.029> a<00:04:24.060> lot<00:04:24.419> more<00:04:24.779> I'm<00:04:25.560> going<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.740> very<00:04:25.979> quickly
