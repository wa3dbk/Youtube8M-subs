00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
it's slightly interesting

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.300 
it's slightly interesting
I<00:02:21.830> think<00:02:22.310> it's<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:23.000> maxi<00:02:23.390> scary<00:02:23.750> but<00:02:24.470> it's<00:02:25.040> got

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
I think it's a maxi scary but it's got

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.240 
I think it's a maxi scary but it's got
two<00:02:26.030> splits<00:02:26.900> don't<00:02:27.290> know<00:02:27.440> their<00:02:27.620> side<00:02:27.830> so<00:02:28.100> it's

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
two splits don't know their side so it's

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.460 
two splits don't know their side so it's
like<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.640> mrs.<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.090> Robert<00:02:29.450> but<00:02:30.050> it's<00:02:30.290> got<00:02:30.440> to

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
like to mrs. of Robert but it's got to

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.410 
like to mrs. of Robert but it's got to
split<00:02:30.650> on<00:02:30.860> one<00:02:31.040> side<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.430> split<00:02:32.120> on<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.300> other

split on one side and split on the other

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.470 
split on one side and split on the other
and<00:02:32.990> it<00:02:33.410> doesn't<00:02:33.740> come<00:02:33.920> with<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.480> skirt

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
and it doesn't come with this skirt

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.060 
and it doesn't come with this skirt
underneath<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:36.050> skirt<00:02:36.230> underneath<00:02:36.380> is<00:02:36.830> from

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
underneath the skirt underneath is from

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.970 
underneath the skirt underneath is from
H&amp;M<00:02:37.280> it's<00:02:37.670> one<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:37.880> those<00:02:37.970> like<00:02:38.590> 299<00:02:39.590> ones

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
H&amp;M it's one of those like 299 ones

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.650 
H&amp;M it's one of those like 299 ones
they're<00:02:40.190> really<00:02:40.430> thin<00:02:40.760> like<00:02:41.030> bodycon<00:02:41.630> skirt

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
they're really thin like bodycon skirt

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.790 
they're really thin like bodycon skirt
but<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.770> actual<00:02:43.280> skirt<00:02:43.460> has<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.700> black<00:02:44.000> and

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
but the actual skirt has a black and

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
but the actual skirt has a black and
waistband<00:02:45.800> which<00:02:45.980> I<00:02:46.070> think<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.370> makes<00:02:46.550> this

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
waistband which I think it makes this

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.180 
waistband which I think it makes this
either<00:02:47.030> look<00:02:47.300> like<00:02:47.450> it's<00:02:47.600> a<00:02:47.720> dress<00:02:47.960> and<00:02:48.350> that

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
either look like it's a dress and that

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.800 
either look like it's a dress and that
wasn't<00:02:49.340> my<00:02:49.580> intention<00:02:50.090> but<00:02:50.120> I<00:02:50.270> think<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.630> kind

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
wasn't my intention but I think it kind

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.120 
wasn't my intention but I think it kind
of<00:02:50.870> does<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.320> I<00:02:51.380> shall<00:02:51.500> my<00:02:51.620> boyfriend<00:02:52.040> you

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
of does and I shall my boyfriend you

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.710 
of does and I shall my boyfriend you
thought<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.430> was<00:02:52.520> a<00:02:52.550> dress<00:02:52.820> so<00:02:53.240> maybe<00:02:53.510> it's<00:02:53.660> not

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
thought it was a dress so maybe it's not

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.260 
thought it was a dress so maybe it's not
just<00:02:54.020> me<00:02:54.140> but<00:02:54.380> when<00:02:55.130> you<00:02:55.250> walk<00:02:55.490> you<00:02:55.880> can<00:02:56.060> see

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
just me but when you walk you can see

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.080 
just me but when you walk you can see
the<00:02:56.600> actual<00:02:56.720> splits<00:02:57.350> because<00:02:57.950> they're<00:02:58.640> kind

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
the actual splits because they're kind

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.370 
the actual splits because they're kind
of<00:02:59.150> subtle<00:02:59.390> of<00:02:59.660> your<00:02:59.780> sunnies<00:03:00.080> though<00:03:00.230> you

hopefully it doesn't like fill a white

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.710 
hopefully it doesn't like fill a white
too<00:03:09.710> much<00:03:09.950> because<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.460> was<00:03:10.580> very<00:03:10.850> long<00:03:11.180> as<00:03:11.570> I

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
too much because it was very long as I

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.870 
too much because it was very long as I
want<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:11.990> step<00:03:12.380> on<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.710> or<00:03:12.800> anything<00:03:12.830> but<00:03:13.820> I

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
want to step on it or anything but I

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.910 
want to step on it or anything but I
think<00:03:14.090> it's<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.240> lovely<00:03:14.450> skirt<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.290> then<00:03:15.500> feel

think it's a lovely skirt and then feel

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.130 
think it's a lovely skirt and then feel
very<00:03:16.130> girly<00:03:16.670> which<00:03:17.390> even<00:03:17.720> though<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:17.840> know<00:03:17.930> this
