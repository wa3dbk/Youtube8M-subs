extensions so one thing I wanted to
point<00:03:53.580> out<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.269> that<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:55.170> top<00:03:55.439> of<00:03:55.769> these

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
point out is that the top of these

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.820 
point out is that the top of these
