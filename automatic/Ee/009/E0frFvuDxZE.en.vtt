like that the the reasoning of

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.549 
like that the the reasoning of
increasing<00:00:08.519> difficulty<00:00:09.269> as<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:10.170> play<00:00:10.410> the

game like this game should be getting
progressively<00:00:13.559> harder<00:00:14.280> now<00:00:14.639> it's<00:00:15.540> easy<00:00:15.900> it's

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
progressively harder now it's easy it's

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.550 
progressively harder now it's easy it's
easy<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:16.800> super<00:00:17.310> fucking<00:00:17.580> hard<00:00:18.029> it's<00:00:18.960> normal

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
easy it's super fucking hard it's normal

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.929 
easy it's super fucking hard it's normal
it's<00:00:20.039> super<00:00:20.820> fucking<00:00:21.119> hard<00:00:21.570> like<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.580> not

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
it's super fucking hard like this is not

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
time and this amount of difficulty

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.939 
time and this amount of difficulty
