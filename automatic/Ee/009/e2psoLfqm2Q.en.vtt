outside<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.690> there<00:02:57.840> are<00:02:58.020> a<00:02:58.050> bunch<00:02:58.739> of<00:02:58.980> goblins

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
outside and there are a bunch of goblins

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.880 
outside and there are a bunch of goblins
actually<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.270> suggest<00:03:00.989> waiting<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.500> go<00:03:01.590> outside

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
actually I suggest waiting to go outside

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.440 
actually I suggest waiting to go outside
because<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.340> goblins<00:03:02.700> will<00:03:02.850> come<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.270> you

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
because the goblins will come to you

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.420 
because the goblins will come to you
pick<00:03:04.020> off<00:03:04.200> as<00:03:04.380> many<00:03:04.560> as<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:04.830> can<00:03:05.040> there<00:03:05.280> will

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
pick off as many as you can there will

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.490 
pick off as many as you can there will
be<00:03:05.520> two<00:03:05.730> goblin<00:03:06.150> majors<00:03:06.540> as<00:03:06.750> well<00:03:06.930> which<00:03:07.260> once

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
be two goblin majors as well which once

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.810 
be two goblin majors as well which once
again<00:03:07.620> these<00:03:07.920> are<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.190> ones<00:03:08.340> with<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.610> yellow

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
again these are the ones with the yellow

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.520 
again these are the ones with the yellow
health<00:03:09.060> bar<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.630> then<00:03:10.110> there's<00:03:10.290> on<00:03:10.470> a

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
health bar and then there's on a

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.830 
health bar and then there's on a
platform<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.540> hobgoblins<00:03:12.540> you're<00:03:12.660> going<00:03:12.780> to

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
platform to hobgoblins you're going to

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.540 
platform to hobgoblins you're going to
want<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.050> snipe<00:03:13.320> down<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.920> then<00:03:14.340> in<00:03:14.459> the

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
want to snipe down and then in the

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.610 
want to snipe down and then in the
center<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.360> outdoor<00:03:15.690> area<00:03:16.110> are<00:03:16.350> two

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
center of the outdoor area are two

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.680 
center of the outdoor area are two
minotaurs<00:03:17.160> now<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.430> mentors<00:03:17.970> have<00:03:18.150> void

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
minotaurs now the mentors have void

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.560 
minotaurs now the mentors have void
shields<00:03:19.380> so<00:03:19.830> this<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.250> third<00:03:20.880> potential

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
shields so this is a third potential

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.300 
shields so this is a third potential
shield<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.019> you<00:03:22.140> have<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.470> deal<00:03:22.680> with<00:03:22.860> if<00:03:23.130> you

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
shield that you have to deal with if you

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.280 
shield that you have to deal with if you
don't<00:03:23.549> happen<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.940> have<00:03:24.060> any<00:03:24.209> void<00:03:24.780> damage

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
don't happen to have any void damage

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.440 
don't happen to have any void damage
honestly<00:03:26.010> it's<00:03:26.250> fine<00:03:26.489> so<00:03:26.820> long<00:03:27.000> as<00:03:27.060> we<00:03:27.330> have

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
honestly it's fine so long as we have

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.330 
honestly it's fine so long as we have
solar<00:03:27.750> weaponry<00:03:28.260> you<00:03:28.500> deal<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:28.950> much<00:03:29.100> extra

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
solar weaponry you deal so much extra

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.280 
solar weaponry you deal so much extra
damage<00:03:29.610> you'll<00:03:30.239> take<00:03:30.480> out<00:03:30.630> their<00:03:30.870> shields

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
damage you'll take out their shields

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.830 
damage you'll take out their shields
fairly<00:03:31.830> quickly<00:03:32.160> once<00:03:33.090> finishing<00:03:33.570> off<00:03:33.660> the

ultimate right on top of them and blow
them<00:04:02.760> all<00:04:02.910> up<00:04:02.940> it's<00:04:03.480> not<00:04:03.750> worth<00:04:03.989> potentially

boss<00:04:08.220> fight<00:04:08.580> now<00:04:08.940> I've<00:04:09.090> seen<00:04:09.299> a<00:04:09.330> variety<00:04:09.900> of

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
boss fight now I've seen a variety of

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.810 
boss fight now I've seen a variety of
different<00:04:10.049> suggestions<00:04:10.980> in<00:04:11.190> terms<00:04:11.459> of<00:04:11.610> where

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
different suggestions in terms of where

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.789 
different suggestions in terms of where
to<00:04:11.940> stand<00:04:12.209> for<00:04:12.540> soloing<00:04:12.959> this<00:04:13.200> some<00:04:13.530> people

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
to stand for soloing this some people

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.590 
to stand for soloing this some people
say<00:04:14.010> stand<00:04:14.340> on<00:04:14.489> top<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:14.940> don't<00:04:15.120> even<00:04:15.329> go<00:04:15.450> into

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
say stand on top and don't even go into

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.080 
say stand on top and don't even go into
the<00:04:15.780> boss<00:04:15.959> room<00:04:16.290> some<00:04:16.890> people<00:04:17.220> have<00:04:17.519> you<00:04:17.729> stand

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
the boss room some people have you stand

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.360 
the boss room some people have you stand
on<00:04:18.359> this<00:04:18.690> little<00:04:18.930> platform<00:04:19.260> just<00:04:19.859> above<00:04:20.160> are

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
on this little platform just above are

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.400 
on this little platform just above are
the<00:04:20.489> boss<00:04:20.669> spawns<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.419> found<00:04:21.900> both<00:04:22.020> of<00:04:22.320> those

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
the boss spawns I found both of those

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.200 
the boss spawns I found both of those
areas<00:04:22.830> actually<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.250> bit<00:04:23.430> too<00:04:23.580> risky<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.120> I

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
areas actually a bit too risky and I

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.600 
areas actually a bit too risky and I
think<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.570> best<00:04:24.840> spot<00:04:25.320> is<00:04:25.530> actually<00:04:26.160> just<00:04:26.430> to

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
think the best spot is actually just to

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.440 
think the best spot is actually just to
the<00:04:26.760> west<00:04:27.060> of

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
the west of

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.940 
the west of
the<00:04:27.570> boss<00:04:27.810> spawn<00:04:28.290> so<00:04:28.590> what<00:04:28.710> you're<00:04:28.800> going<00:04:28.890> to

the boss spawn so what you're going to
want<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.220> do<00:04:29.340> is<00:04:29.550> once<00:04:29.760> you<00:04:29.880> head<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.390> boss
