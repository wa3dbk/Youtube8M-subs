recovered the articulation the wrist the
Boosters<00:01:49.619> move<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.310> there<00:01:51.119> these<00:01:51.710> not<00:01:52.710> really

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
Boosters move in there these not really

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.889 
Boosters move in there these not really
much<00:01:54.590> not<00:01:55.590> really<00:01:56.399> any<00:01:56.579> waist<00:01:56.909> movement<00:01:57.299> just

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.559 
never played with really but it's a
thruster<00:02:21.620> it's<00:02:21.739> like<00:02:21.859> an<00:02:21.980> escape<00:02:22.370> capsule<00:02:22.670> the

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
thruster it's like an escape capsule the

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.080 
thruster it's like an escape capsule the
pilot<00:02:24.469> stays<00:02:24.769> in<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.040> head<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.459> song<00:02:25.730> so

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
pilot stays in the head of the song so

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.520 
pilot stays in the head of the song so
when<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.299> body<00:02:26.480> gets<00:02:26.750> destroyed

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
when the body gets destroyed

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.530 
when the body gets destroyed
you<00:02:27.769> can<00:02:27.920> come<00:02:28.069> off<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.489> fire<00:02:28.819> our<00:02:29.030> couple

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
you can come off and fire our couple

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.839 
you can come off and fire our couple
shots<00:02:30.379> of<00:02:30.650> this<00:02:30.769> mouth<00:02:31.069> laser<00:02:33.159> pretty<00:02:34.159> cool<00:02:34.459> I

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
shots of this mouth laser pretty cool I

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.270 
shots of this mouth laser pretty cool I
can<00:02:35.659> go<00:02:35.750> all<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:35.930> way<00:02:36.079> around<00:02:36.409> things<00:02:37.069> like

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
can go all the way around things like

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.170 
can go all the way around things like
that<00:02:39.069> another<00:02:40.069> cool<00:02:40.310> thing<00:02:40.340> about<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.909> zeong

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
that another cool thing about the zeong

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.330 
that another cool thing about the zeong
which<00:02:41.920> sometimes<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:44.150> arms<00:02:44.659> are<00:02:45.340> resistant

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
which sometimes the arms are resistant

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.460 
which sometimes the arms are resistant
to<00:02:46.579> doing<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:47.359> especially<00:02:47.780> if<00:02:48.139> they<00:02:48.290> weren't

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
to doing this especially if they weren't

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.470 
to doing this especially if they weren't
played<00:02:48.829> with<00:02:49.069> but<00:02:50.030> um<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:51.530> comes<00:02:51.769> apart<00:02:52.239> not<00:02:53.239> at

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
played with but um it comes apart not at

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.360 
played with but um it comes apart not at
the<00:02:53.629> elbow<00:02:53.989> joint<00:02:54.260> on<00:02:54.650> purpose<00:02:55.120> but<00:02:56.120> um<00:02:57.370> let's

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
the elbow joint on purpose but um let's

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.149 
the elbow joint on purpose but um let's
see<00:02:59.200> maybe<00:03:00.200> one<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.500> these<00:03:00.650> is<00:03:00.859> a<00:03:00.889> little

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
see maybe one of these is a little

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.800 
see maybe one of these is a little
looser<00:03:01.430> I've<00:03:01.639> had<00:03:01.819> this<00:03:01.970> issue<00:03:02.180> with<00:03:02.450> several

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
looser I've had this issue with several

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.369 
looser I've had this issue with several
songs<00:03:03.609> that<00:03:04.609> it<00:03:05.180> can<00:03:05.419> be<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.569> little<00:03:05.810> tight

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
songs that it can be a little tight

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:17.790 
songs that it can be a little tight
this<00:03:06.799> turns<00:03:07.189> and

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.490 

if<00:03:18.220> I<00:03:18.370> can<00:03:18.550> just<00:03:18.790> get<00:03:19.120> it

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.720 

this<00:03:24.500> one<00:03:24.680> was<00:03:24.830> a<00:03:24.860> little<00:03:25.070> tighter<00:03:25.490> than

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
this one was a little tighter than

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.120 
this one was a little tighter than
average<00:03:26.270> I<00:03:26.540> mean<00:03:27.350> usually<00:03:27.560> they're<00:03:27.890> a<00:03:27.920> little

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
average I mean usually they're a little

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.430 
average I mean usually they're a little
hard<00:03:28.550> to<00:03:28.790> get<00:03:28.940> out<00:03:29.150> sometimes<00:03:29.690> but<00:03:30.080> this<00:03:30.260> one

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
hard to get out sometimes but this one

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.200 
hard to get out sometimes but this one
was<00:03:30.590> like<00:03:30.830> really<00:03:31.130> tough<00:03:31.400> for<00:03:31.700> some<00:03:31.910> reason

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
was like really tough for some reason

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.910 
was like really tough for some reason
but<00:03:33.140> um<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:34.250> arm<00:03:34.490> comes<00:03:35.240> off<00:03:35.540> or<00:03:36.410> at<00:03:36.560> least<00:03:36.770> it

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
but um the arm comes off or at least it

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
but um the arm comes off or at least it
comes<00:03:37.070> off<00:03:37.310> with<00:03:37.520> a<00:03:37.550> great<00:03:37.850> deal<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.120> work<00:03:39.940> but

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
comes off with a great deal of work but

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.210 
comes off with a great deal of work but
um<00:03:41.120> usually<00:03:41.600> it<00:03:41.690> just<00:03:41.840> comes<00:03:42.020> off<00:03:42.200> but<00:03:42.860> not<00:03:42.980> too

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
um usually it just comes off but not too

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.550 
um usually it just comes off but not too
easily<00:03:43.430> but<00:03:43.910> sometimes<00:03:44.660> a<00:03:44.870> little<00:03:44.900> too<00:03:45.290> hard

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
easily but sometimes a little too hard

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.010 
easily but sometimes a little too hard
it<00:03:45.770> comes<00:03:45.980> off<00:03:46.190> just<00:03:46.460> the<00:03:47.060> way<00:03:47.210> things<00:03:47.720> work

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
it comes off just the way things work

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.370 
it comes off just the way things work
sometimes<00:03:48.620> but<00:03:48.920> it<00:03:49.670> comes<00:03:49.850> off<00:03:50.060> and<00:03:50.540> then<00:03:51.260> you

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
sometimes but it comes off and then you

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.950 
sometimes but it comes off and then you
have<00:03:51.590> these<00:03:51.920> two<00:03:52.250> options<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:53.210> wavy<00:03:53.450> one<00:03:53.750> or

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
have these two options the wavy one or

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.290 
have these two options the wavy one or
the<00:03:54.050> straight<00:03:54.380> one<00:03:54.620> either<00:03:55.520> works<00:03:56.000> and<00:03:56.240> it

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
the straight one either works and it

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.230 
the straight one either works and it
works<00:03:56.510> on<00:03:56.660> both<00:03:56.930> arms<00:03:57.320> and<00:03:57.710> then<00:03:58.580> this<00:03:58.790> goes<00:03:59.030> in

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
works on both arms and then this goes in

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.640 
works on both arms and then this goes in
here<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.600> it's<00:03:59.840> it's<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.740> ball<00:04:00.950> joint<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:01.670> so

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
here and it's it's a ball joint and so

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.830 
here and it's it's a ball joint and so
this<00:04:03.650> arm<00:04:03.920> can<00:04:04.160> going<00:04:04.490> in<00:04:04.610> your<00:04:04.790> direction<00:04:04.910> put

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
this arm can going in your direction put

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.210 
this arm can going in your direction put
the<00:04:05.900> head<00:04:06.110> back<00:04:06.140> on<00:04:06.560> there<00:04:06.830> for<00:04:07.040> good<00:04:07.190> measure

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
the head back on there for good measure

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.740 
the head back on there for good measure
and<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:08.690> it<00:04:08.840> extends<00:04:10.120> it<00:04:11.120> made<00:04:11.270> the<00:04:11.420> shoulder

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
and so it extends it made the shoulder

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.610 
and so it extends it made the shoulder
angry<00:04:12.020> there<00:04:12.230> we<00:04:12.350> go<00:04:12.850> and<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:15.230> make<00:04:15.380> it<00:04:15.410> even

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
angry there we go and to make it even

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.250 
angry there we go and to make it even
cooler<00:04:16.040> you<00:04:16.580> can<00:04:16.610> even<00:04:16.940> put<00:04:17.270> them<00:04:17.540> into<00:04:18.140> each

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
cooler you can even put them into each

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.620 
cooler you can even put them into each
other<00:04:18.590> to<00:04:19.370> give<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.610> that<00:04:19.730> extra<00:04:19.910> range<00:04:22.630> now

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
other to give it that extra range now

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.590 
other to give it that extra range now
it's<00:04:23.810> a<00:04:23.900> little<00:04:24.020> hard<00:04:24.740> to<00:04:24.950> keep<00:04:25.460> up<00:04:25.760> when<00:04:26.390> it's

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
it's a little hard to keep up when it's

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.900 
it's a little hard to keep up when it's
that<00:04:26.870> long<00:04:27.370> but<00:04:28.370> you<00:04:28.820> get<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.120> idea<00:04:30.910> this

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
that long but you get the idea this

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.960 
that long but you get the idea this
young<00:04:32.090> can<00:04:32.420> attack<00:04:32.720> from<00:04:32.950> quite<00:04:33.950> a<00:04:34.190> distance

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
young can attack from quite a distance

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.320 
young can attack from quite a distance
and<00:04:35.300> with<00:04:36.170> two<00:04:36.380> arms<00:04:36.740> like<00:04:37.010> that<00:04:37.340> you<00:04:38.210> know

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
and with two arms like that you know

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
that pretty much covers our review of

that pretty much covers our review of
the<00:04:43.540> zeong<00:04:44.710> fairly<00:04:45.710> cool<00:04:45.950> toy<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.520> only<00:04:46.760> issue

the zeong fairly cool toy the only issue
sometimes<00:04:47.720> is<00:04:48.020> that<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.350> arm<00:04:48.560> is<00:04:48.770> a<00:04:48.830> little

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
sometimes is that the arm is a little
