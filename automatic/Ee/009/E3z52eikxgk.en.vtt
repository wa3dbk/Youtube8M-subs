00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.080
 I greet everyone with you Basilio and 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.850
 today is thursday or friday mean 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.970
 rubric I answer your questions and 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.250
 let's say that today we answer 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.559
 question about water consumption 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.900
 how much do we need to drink some water 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.750
 temperature should be water when in 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.490
 what time of day and if any myths and 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.490
 some features go 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.190
 and so water 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.250
 human body is understandable there from 60 to 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.250
 80 percent consists of water and on 20 of 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.489
 Food latter course a joke Well 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.480
 therefore overestimate the role of water in 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.300
 metabolism 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.770
 very very difficult water is very important 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.260
 so how much to drink question 1 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.850
 of course as much as you want so much and 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.699
 it is not allowed to drink 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.960
 yourself limit this lower threshold then 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.180
 you have to eat as much as you need 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.489
 I want to eat specifically 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.320
 dehydration and other rubbish and yes 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.940
 that is, well, here is an athlete in front 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.380
 competitions for a few hours or 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.030
 before weighing it yourself 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.130
 because itâ€™s very, very harmful 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.680
 don't know for the sake of anything in ordinary life no 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.540
 in no case should thirst be allowed to drink 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.410
 as much as fit if your body 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.450
 requires 3 liters of water to drink and 3 4 5 4 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.060
 please no one word to you 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.220
 I will say now about the maximum 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.590
 borders means the situation develop 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.649
 next I think that from our average 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.539
 man to man that's weight in there 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.100
 around 90 kilos plus or minus yes then 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:40.080
 have at least 2 liters 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.000
 no less than two is better than three three and a half 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.670
 here especially if you started with 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.740
 monday new life 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.229
 switched to a fractional power if you either 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.009
 lose weight or have already gone to school gave and 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.200
 train 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.300
 then I will explain because you run 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.759
 new processes in your body new 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.660
 metabolic processes you lose 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.940
 own fabrics 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.259
 which is somehow the breakdown of tissues he 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.640
 associated with a certain degree 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.979
 slagging you do that is something 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.500
 junk and hare, but there are always leftovers and 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.690
 the better it is through the lead naturally 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.400
 way will leave the body until 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.750
 through kidney filtering systems 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.940
 there, respectively, along with feces 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.590
 please forgive me but 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.360
 better so here's water consumption in 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.890
 our case is the case of people who 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.680
 start but survive from monday then 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.069
 I think that at least 2 liters 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.050
 but there's also an upper threshold 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.099
 unlimited your say is limited 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.099
 so hot feeling 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.300
 mean about when 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.860
 and what to drink while eating drink 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.010
 Lead not drink Lead 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.400
 and here the temperature limit I do not 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.900
 I recommend 15 minutes before meals 30-40 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.360
 minutes after eating and on time or drinking 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.610
 just cold chilled room 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.170
 temperature or warm quite how much 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.590
 wash down anything that you do not want 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.840
 cover it up 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.760
 the rest of the time you can safely 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.620
 consumers cash in chilled 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.630
 cool liquid can drink from 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.240
 Refrigerator Of course all water should 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.880
 be it exactly water no cafe juice 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.830
 of chief soda and so on it is not 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.350
 considered to be if you drink coffee 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.440
 by the way to the question of coffee yes if you drink 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.820
 coffee if you drink green tea on if you 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.740
 like this drinks you are not ready yet 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.090
 from the start of the shoot six 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.280
 need to do gradually keep in mind that 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.510
 these substances are not in essence 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.090
 natural diuretics 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.040
 in the case of coffee sometimes manufacturers then 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.840
 mix up such crap like that 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.850
 no longer even nature on non diuretics 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.220
 roughly speaking diuretics 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.020
 so if you drink it it leads to 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.790
 consider additional dehydration 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.790
 that you should drink more water 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.960
 if you train the article is special then 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.110
 eat during workout your rises 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.700
 body temperature rises 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.200
 perspiration this all leads to 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.480
 additional dehydration 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.330
 From thickening I will hide therefore if at you 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.250
 there are sores some blood thickening 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.500
 let's say so and so is not a good thing 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.130
 yes and if you have any sores 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.900
 which may be worsening which 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.370
 may be triggered by neglect 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.930
 except me on with apricot yes then 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.790
 have my favorite sores genetically 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.799
 due but here or some 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.930
 heart disease then it is even worse 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.150
 so it is during exercise to drink 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.010
 water must necessarily categorically itself 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.120
 do not limit although old school I still 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.820
 I remember the old school there 30-35 years ago 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.490
 there until about that is by no means 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.950
 you can not drink without driving on dry terrible 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.210
 but nevertheless such are such theories in 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.820
 their time existed 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.190
 that is, not very well, but here's about it 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.050
 was well so now to do 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.570
 absolutely not recommended drink 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.190
 Drink water as much as you will get 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.050
 what is called because of edema 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.940
 get rid of it if you drink it 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.990
 that the house model throughout the month is 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.640
 12 days is 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.200
 This is elementary, that is, if you 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.140
 need this form 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.630
 themselves to bring the form what is called but 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.669
 in order to prevent thickening 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.950
 blood in training, I recommend not 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.560
 less than one and a half liters per hour small 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.240
 sips of water to drink especially all 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.520
 depends even more the intensity of those 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.290
 more water consumption should be if 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.040
 you have after hours of power load 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:21.419
 drink card also nobody on cardio 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.419
 again don't limit you 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.800
 and so here are the things we have about 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.900
 water although it is strange that the issues are very 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.790
 a lot so the lower threshold never 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.880
 experiencing the victim as you fit 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.220
 so much to drink well here's the upper threshold I 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.200
 I think that we are from 890 there are 100 kilograms 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.290
 not less than two and a half liters 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.560
 water you have about temperature not 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.870
 drink 15 minutes forty minutes after and during 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.560
 eating cold water from the fridge 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:54.020
 warm or slightly warmer than room 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.150
 human body temperature on 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.490
 workouts must drink for 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.810
 hours no less there liter and a half liters 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.940
 water sip 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.940
 if you still have more cardiff 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.430
 why do you have to force yourself with age 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.230
 drink this last question mean have 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.620
 in view of the fact that the older a person becomes 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.720
 how can i get me over forty 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.850
 so our receptors are responsible for 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.470
 a feeling of fullness and including for 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.890
 feeling of thirst and so on they start 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.840
 to blunt 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.730
 that is, a signal that we want 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.310
 drink it comes later to 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.880
 Brains than required by our carcasses 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:35.400
 so sometimes it's better to drink before 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.860
 you wanted from began to experience sacrifice 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.090
 yes that is this here is another such moment 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.270
 that is, it is also very controversial 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:44.640
 statement well let's say my experience 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.170
 convinced by the experience of people with whom I 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.210
 advised that the results are better for 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.860
 those who drink before they feel 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.330
 this feeling of thirst is precisely because 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.140
 that the receptors start to blunt 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:57.410
 but that's okay too so that's it 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.130
 today was the answer about water 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.990
 subscribe to my channel 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.820
 ask a question get an answer to it 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:06.660
 Like this you can here ssylochka 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.370
 well here on my website

 google + account but you can't 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.800
