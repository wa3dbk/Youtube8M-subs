00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
bearings in my table saw so let's get

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.339 
bearings in my table saw so let's get
started

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:09.349 
started

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.140 
started
to<00:00:10.349> access<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.889> bearings<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.429> need<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.910> remove

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
to access the bearings I need to remove

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.450 
to access the bearings I need to remove
the<00:00:12.360> top<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.780> table<00:00:13.049> saw<00:00:13.230> that's<00:00:14.070> done<00:00:14.340> by

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
the top of the table saw that's done by

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.980 
the top of the table saw that's done by
removing<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.880> four<00:00:15.089> bolts<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.809> four

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
removing the four bolts in the four

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:25.270 
removing the four bolts in the four
corners<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.619> table

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:25.280 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.460 

with<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:25.970> bolts<00:00:26.270> removed<00:00:26.330> I<00:00:26.840> can<00:00:27.020> remove<00:00:27.290> the

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
with the bolts removed I can remove the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:35.500 
with the bolts removed I can remove the
top<00:00:27.650> and<00:00:27.980> set<00:00:28.820> it<00:00:28.910> aside<00:00:34.120> it<00:00:35.120> was<00:00:35.239> at<00:00:35.360> this

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
top and set it aside it was at this

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.390 
top and set it aside it was at this
point<00:00:35.750> that<00:00:35.930> I<00:00:36.050> realized<00:00:36.440> I<00:00:36.590> forgot<00:00:37.040> to<00:00:37.220> take

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
point that I realized I forgot to take

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.780 
point that I realized I forgot to take
off<00:00:37.580> the<00:00:37.730> switch<00:00:39.070> so<00:00:40.070> remove<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:40.489> two<00:00:40.640> bolts

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
off the switch so remove the two bolts

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.430 
off the switch so remove the two bolts
that<00:00:41.000> hold<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:41.239> switch<00:00:41.510> onto<00:00:41.840> the<00:00:41.930> rails<00:00:42.170> and

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
that hold the switch onto the rails and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.540 
that hold the switch onto the rails and
then<00:00:42.739> I<00:00:42.830> can<00:00:43.010> continue<00:00:43.280> removing<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:44.120> top

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
then I can continue removing the top

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.479 
then I can continue removing the top
there<00:00:46.550> were<00:00:46.670> gyms<00:00:47.030> under<00:00:47.420> two<00:00:47.600> of<00:00:47.629> the<00:00:47.840> bolts

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
there were gyms under two of the bolts

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.130 
there were gyms under two of the bolts
so<00:00:49.489> I've<00:00:49.610> set<00:00:49.790> those<00:00:49.910> aside<00:00:49.940> just<00:00:50.629> making<00:00:50.960> note

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
so I've set those aside just making note

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.369 
so I've set those aside just making note
of<00:00:51.170> where<00:00:51.440> they<00:00:51.620> go<00:00:51.800> I<00:00:53.019> thought<00:00:54.019> I<00:00:54.080> was<00:00:54.260> going

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
of where they go I thought I was going

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:55.540 
of where they go I thought I was going
to<00:00:54.440> have<00:00:54.559> to<00:00:54.650> remove<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.070> whole<00:00:55.220> trunion

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
to have to remove the whole trunion

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.299 
to have to remove the whole trunion
assembly<00:00:56.090> from<00:00:56.269> the<00:00:56.330> cabinet<00:00:57.140> in<00:00:57.950> order<00:00:58.190> to

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
assembly from the cabinet in order to

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.430 
assembly from the cabinet in order to
change<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:58.790> bearings<00:00:59.149> so<00:01:00.020> I<00:01:00.050> actually

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
change the bearings so I actually

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.110 
change the bearings so I actually
unbolted<00:01:01.100> it<00:01:01.190> from<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.460> cabinet<00:01:01.880> but<00:01:02.000> it

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
unbolted it from the cabinet but it

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.729 
unbolted it from the cabinet but it
turned<00:01:02.329> out<00:01:02.450> that<00:01:02.510> I<00:01:02.719> didn't<00:01:03.079> actually<00:01:03.379> need

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
turned out that I didn't actually need

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.010 
turned out that I didn't actually need
to<00:01:03.950> unbolt<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:04.640> at<00:01:04.790> all<00:01:04.940> and<00:01:05.149> this<00:01:05.869> whole

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
to unbolt it at all and this whole

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.749 
to unbolt it at all and this whole
operation<00:01:06.530> can<00:01:06.680> be<00:01:06.710> done<00:01:06.950> with<00:01:07.190> the<00:01:07.310> trunnion

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
operation can be done with the trunnion

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.870 
operation can be done with the trunnion
still<00:01:08.060> bolted<00:01:08.479> to<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.690> cabinet<00:01:09.610> so<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.670> first

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
still bolted to the cabinet so the first

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.270 
still bolted to the cabinet so the first
thing<00:01:11.090> to<00:01:11.300> do<00:01:11.450> is<00:01:11.630> remove<00:01:11.899> the<00:01:12.080> pulley<00:01:12.320> and<00:01:12.560> to

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
thing to do is remove the pulley and to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.010 
thing to do is remove the pulley and to
do<00:01:13.460> that<00:01:13.640> I<00:01:13.670> need<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.090> loosen<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.539> nut<00:01:14.810> that

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
do that I need to loosen the nut that

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:24.520 
do that I need to loosen the nut that
holds<00:01:15.080> it<00:01:15.380> on

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.530 

with<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.220> nut<00:01:25.400> removed<00:01:25.700> I<00:01:26.000> can<00:01:26.150> slide<00:01:26.420> the

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
with the nut removed I can slide the

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.280 
with the nut removed I can slide the
pulley<00:01:26.780> off<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.170> shaft<00:01:27.410> and<00:01:28.870> then<00:01:29.870> remove<00:01:30.110> the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
pulley off the shaft and then remove the

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.360 
pulley off the shaft and then remove the
key<00:01:32.200> there's<00:01:33.200> also<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:33.500> bushing<00:01:33.920> on<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.130> shaft

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
key there's also a bushing on the shaft

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.010 
key there's also a bushing on the shaft
we're<00:01:34.970> going<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.390> remove<00:01:37.720> next<00:01:38.720> there<00:01:38.960> are

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
we're going to remove next there are

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.330 
we're going to remove next there are
three<00:01:39.200> screws<00:01:39.410> that<00:01:39.530> hold<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:39.950> bearing<00:01:40.250> in

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
three screws that hold the bearing in

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.800 
three screws that hold the bearing in
place<00:01:45.490> next<00:01:46.490> I<00:01:46.580> can<00:01:46.729> tap<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.180> arbor<00:01:47.540> out<00:01:47.690> of

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
place next I can tap the arbor out of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:02:03.400 
place next I can tap the arbor out of
the<00:01:47.900> trunnion<00:02:01.720> and<00:02:02.720> you<00:02:02.780> can<00:02:02.930> really<00:02:03.050> see<00:02:03.290> how

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
the trunnion and you can really see how

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:10.120 
the trunnion and you can really see how
bad<00:02:03.649> this<00:02:03.800> bearing<00:02:04.160> is<00:02:08.619> now<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:09.649> can<00:02:09.830> remove<00:02:10.070> the

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
bad this bearing is now I can remove the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.460 
bad this bearing is now I can remove the
other<00:02:10.399> bearing<00:02:10.759> I<00:02:10.910> use<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.780> sleeve<00:02:12.200> that<00:02:12.230> was

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
other bearing I use a sleeve that was

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.130 
other bearing I use a sleeve that was
inside<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.830> arbor<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:14.239> socket<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.690> tap<00:02:14.989> it

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
inside the arbor and a socket to tap it

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:23.620 
inside the arbor and a socket to tap it
out<00:02:21.430> next<00:02:22.430> I<00:02:22.610> can<00:02:22.760> press<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.150> new<00:02:23.270> bearing

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
out next I can press it a new bearing

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.780 
out next I can press it a new bearing
and<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:24.800> do<00:02:24.920> that<00:02:25.070> I'm<00:02:25.190> using<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.520> parallel

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790

and<00:02:45.409> I<00:02:45.650> can<00:02:45.799> replace<00:02:46.099> those<00:02:46.370> three<00:02:46.640> screws<00:02:52.930> so

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
and I can replace those three screws so

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.809 
and I can replace those three screws so
now<00:02:54.110> I<00:02:54.140> need<00:02:54.349> to<00:02:54.409> remove<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:55.010> bearing<00:02:55.489> off<00:02:55.640> of

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
now I need to remove the bearing off of

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.210 
now I need to remove the bearing off of
the<00:02:55.909> arbor<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:57.230> do<00:02:57.379> that<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:57.980> my

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
the arbor and to do that this is my

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.240 
the arbor and to do that this is my
setup<00:02:58.519> I'm<00:02:58.760> going<00:02:58.909> to<00:02:58.970> use<00:02:59.799> the<00:03:00.799> size<00:03:01.040> of<00:03:01.190> the

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
setup I'm going to use the size of the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.770 
setup I'm going to use the size of the
wrench<00:03:01.459> contact<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.150> inter<00:03:02.360> chase<00:03:02.569> of<00:03:02.720> the

you'll<00:03:06.980> see<00:03:07.159> as<00:03:07.250> I'm<00:03:07.400> going<00:03:07.610> I'm<00:03:07.849> actually

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
you'll see as I'm going I'm actually

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.360 
you'll see as I'm going I'm actually
rotating<00:03:08.629> the<00:03:08.780> arbor<00:03:09.319> back<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:09.680> forth<00:03:09.860> that's

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
rotating the arbor back and forth that's

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.949 
rotating the arbor back and forth that's
just<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:10.700> apply<00:03:10.909> pressure<00:03:11.180> evenly<00:03:11.599> to<00:03:11.780> both

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
just to apply pressure evenly to both

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:26.710 
just to apply pressure evenly to both
sides<00:03:12.200> of<00:03:12.409> the<00:03:12.530> bearing<00:03:24.970> once<00:03:25.970> I<00:03:26.090> got<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.510> move

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
sides of the bearing once I got to move

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.539 
sides of the bearing once I got to move
a<00:03:26.840> little<00:03:26.870> bit<00:03:27.200> I<00:03:27.410> replace<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.190> wrench<00:03:28.400> with

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
a little bit I replace the wrench with

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:46.780 
a little bit I replace the wrench with
the<00:03:28.670> bigger<00:03:28.849> one<00:03:44.859> once<00:03:45.859> I<00:03:46.010> got<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.370> bearing

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
the bigger one once I got the bearing

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.420 
the bigger one once I got the bearing
loose<00:03:46.970> off<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.239> arbor<00:03:47.690> it<00:03:48.049> slid<00:03:48.799> down<00:03:49.069> and<00:03:49.310> has

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
loose off the arbor it slid down and has

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.039 
loose off the arbor it slid down and has
to<00:03:49.579> pass<00:03:49.819> over<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.329> spots<00:03:50.630> of<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.930> other

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
to pass over the spots of the other

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.319 
to pass over the spots of the other
bearing<00:03:51.410> so<00:03:52.190> I<00:03:52.220> repeat<00:03:52.579> the<00:03:52.669> same<00:03:52.849> process<00:03:53.299> to

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
bearing so I repeat the same process to

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:58.629 
bearing so I repeat the same process to
loosen<00:03:53.810> it<00:03:53.870> from<00:03:54.079> that<00:03:54.200> spot<00:03:54.500> as<00:03:54.680> well<00:03:57.639> and

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
loosen it from that spot as well and

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.949 
loosen it from that spot as well and
then<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:58.819> can<00:03:58.880> really<00:03:59.299> see<00:03:59.480> how<00:03:59.599> bad<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.840> shape

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
then you can really see how bad a shape

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.229 
then you can really see how bad a shape
that<00:04:00.169> one's<00:04:00.470> in<00:04:03.519> now<00:04:04.519> I<00:04:04.549> can<00:04:04.760> press<00:04:04.970> a<00:04:05.000> new

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239

see on the belt the uneven wear that was
caused<00:05:38.420> by<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:38.750> pulley<00:05:39.080> being<00:05:39.380> offset<00:05:39.650> too

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
caused by the pulley being offset too

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.040 
caused by the pulley being offset too
far<00:05:40.370> in<00:05:40.550> on<00:05:40.700> the<00:05:40.790> motor<00:05:41.000> so<00:05:41.600> I've<00:05:41.690> ordered<00:05:41.990> a

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
far in on the motor so I've ordered a

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.280 
far in on the motor so I've ordered a
new<00:05:42.170> belt<00:05:42.440> for<00:05:42.680> the<00:05:42.770> saw<00:05:43.010> as<00:05:43.070> well<00:05:43.340> and<00:05:44.290> while

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
new belt for the saw as well and while

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.020 
new belt for the saw as well and while
everything's<00:05:45.650> really<00:05:45.800> accessible<00:05:46.400> I<00:05:46.550> can<00:05:46.700> go

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
everything's really accessible I can go

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.630 
everything's really accessible I can go
ahead<00:05:47.150> and<00:05:47.390> I<00:05:47.420> can<00:05:47.450> lubricate<00:05:48.050> the<00:05:48.800> mechanisms

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
ahead and I can lubricate the mechanisms

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.610 
ahead and I can lubricate the mechanisms
that<00:05:49.820> raise<00:05:50.060> and<00:05:50.090> lower<00:05:50.300> and<00:05:50.750> tilt<00:05:51.260> the<00:05:51.380> saw

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
that raise and lower and tilt the saw

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.560 
that raise and lower and tilt the saw
blade<00:05:53.350> and<00:05:54.350> now<00:05:54.470> I<00:05:54.500> can<00:05:54.680> reinstall<00:05:55.070> the<00:05:55.130> top<00:05:55.570> so

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
blade and now I can reinstall the top so

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.330 
blade and now I can reinstall the top so
I<00:05:56.630> slide<00:05:56.930> it<00:05:57.050> on<00:05:57.140> top<00:05:57.350> of<00:05:57.530> the<00:05:57.620> base<00:05:57.830> and<00:05:58.100> then

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
I slide it on top of the base and then

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.340 
I slide it on top of the base and then
try<00:05:58.580> and<00:05:58.610> light<00:05:58.850> the<00:05:59.030> holes<00:05:59.270> and<00:05:59.570> insert<00:06:00.200> the

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
try and light the holes and insert the

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:06.840 
try and light the holes and insert the
screws

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.580 

and<00:06:07.850> I<00:06:08.150> can<00:06:08.300> replace<00:06:08.570> the<00:06:08.750> shims<00:06:08.990> on<00:06:09.260> the<00:06:09.440> right

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
and I can replace the shims on the right

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.020 
and I can replace the shims on the right
corners<00:06:11.830> since<00:06:12.830> I<00:06:12.950> remove<00:06:13.220> the<00:06:13.370> table<00:06:13.730> I<00:06:13.880> need

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
corners since I remove the table I need

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.850 
corners since I remove the table I need
to<00:06:14.180> realign<00:06:14.630> the<00:06:14.780> blade<00:06:15.050> to<00:06:15.230> the<00:06:15.260> miter<00:06:15.530> slot

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
to realign the blade to the miter slot

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.850 
to realign the blade to the miter slot

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
video while I'm calibrating my saw I'll

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.600 
video while I'm calibrating my saw I'll
take<00:06:24.320> the<00:06:24.410> time<00:06:24.620> to<00:06:24.800> make<00:06:24.950> sure<00:06:25.070> my<00:06:25.220> fences

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
take the time to make sure my fences

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.030 
take the time to make sure my fences
aligned<00:06:26.060> as<00:06:26.180> well<00:06:26.360> and<00:06:27.260> then<00:06:27.440> I<00:06:27.500> can<00:06:27.650> reinstall

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
aligned as well and then I can reinstall

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.740 
aligned as well and then I can reinstall
the<00:06:28.100> switch<00:06:28.840> and<00:06:31.060> fire<00:06:32.060> up<00:06:32.180> the<00:06:32.270> saw<00:06:32.480> for<00:06:32.660> the

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
the switch and fire up the saw for the

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.910 
the switch and fire up the saw for the
first<00:06:32.780> time<00:06:34.900> so<00:06:35.900> as<00:06:36.020> you<00:06:36.200> can<00:06:36.320> see<00:06:36.590> the<00:06:36.770> whole

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920 
first time so as you can see the whole

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.680 
first time so as you can see the whole
process<00:06:37.190> really<00:06:37.760> isn't<00:06:37.880> all<00:06:38.030> that<00:06:38.090> involved

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
process really isn't all that involved

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.390 
process really isn't all that involved
or<00:06:38.810> complicated<00:06:39.320> and<00:06:39.590> you<00:06:39.950> really<00:06:40.160> don't<00:06:40.310> need

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
or complicated and you really don't need

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.890 
or complicated and you really don't need
any<00:06:40.580> fancy<00:06:40.820> tools<00:06:41.270> to<00:06:41.510> do<00:06:41.690> it

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
any fancy tools to do it

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.660 
any fancy tools to do it
one<00:06:42.620> thing<00:06:42.800> that<00:06:42.830> would<00:06:43.010> obviously<00:06:43.430> really

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:43.670 
one thing that would obviously really

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.550 
one thing that would obviously really
help<00:06:43.880> if<00:06:44.120> you<00:06:44.150> have<00:06:44.360> it<00:06:44.450> around<00:06:44.690> is<00:06:45.020> a<00:06:45.050> puller

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 
help if you have it around is a puller

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.380 
help if you have it around is a puller
of<00:06:45.860> some<00:06:46.040> sorts<00:06:46.400> you<00:06:46.790> could<00:06:46.910> actually<00:06:47.030> pull

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.390 
of some sorts you could actually pull

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.600 
of some sorts you could actually pull
the<00:06:47.510> bearings<00:06:47.840> off<00:06:48.080> the<00:06:48.320> shafts<00:06:48.560> instead<00:06:49.520> of

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
the bearings off the shafts instead of

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.060 
the bearings off the shafts instead of
having<00:06:49.790> to<00:06:50.000> hammer<00:06:50.420> him<00:06:50.690> off<00:06:50.840> like<00:06:51.080> I<00:06:51.200> did<00:06:51.440> now

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.070 
having to hammer him off like I did now

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.550 
having to hammer him off like I did now
this<00:06:52.190> whole<00:06:52.370> process<00:06:52.610> including<00:06:53.450> the

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
this whole process including the

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.290 
this whole process including the
calibration<00:06:54.560> alignment<00:06:55.100> of<00:06:55.160> the<00:06:55.280> saw<00:06:55.460> took<00:06:56.180> me

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300 
calibration alignment of the saw took me

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.270 
calibration alignment of the saw took me
about<00:06:56.420> three<00:06:56.720> and<00:06:56.810> a<00:06:56.870> half<00:06:57.020> hours<00:06:57.440> and<00:06:57.650> a<00:06:58.130> lot

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 
about three and a half hours and a lot

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.210 
about three and a half hours and a lot
of<00:06:58.400> that<00:06:58.520> time<00:06:58.760> was<00:06:58.970> spent<00:06:59.620> mostly<00:07:00.620> kind<00:07:01.130> of

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.220 
of that time was spent mostly kind of

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.410 
of that time was spent mostly kind of
figuring<00:07:01.550> out<00:07:01.580> what<00:07:01.820> I<00:07:01.850> was<00:07:01.970> trying<00:07:02.240> to<00:07:02.270> do

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:02.420 
figuring out what I was trying to do

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.180 
figuring out what I was trying to do
because<00:07:02.660> I<00:07:02.720> didn't<00:07:02.930> really<00:07:03.410> consult<00:07:03.980> the

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190 
because I didn't really consult the

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.090 
because I didn't really consult the
internet<00:07:04.760> or<00:07:05.030> my<00:07:05.420> manual<00:07:05.870> for<00:07:06.020> my<00:07:06.110> saw<00:07:06.320> on<00:07:06.590> how

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:07.100 
internet or my manual for my saw on how

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.620 
internet or my manual for my saw on how
to<00:07:07.160> get<00:07:07.370> in<00:07:07.520> there<00:07:07.700> and<00:07:07.850> get<00:07:08.000> the<00:07:08.120> Arbor

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:08.630 
to get in there and get the Arbor

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.350 
to get in there and get the Arbor
removed<00:07:09.140> from<00:07:09.260> the<00:07:09.440> saw<00:07:09.850> so<00:07:10.850> a<00:07:10.880> lot<00:07:11.120> of<00:07:11.240> that

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 
removed from the saw so a lot of that

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.640 
removed from the saw so a lot of that
time<00:07:11.600> we've<00:07:11.750> been<00:07:11.900> kind<00:07:12.170> of<00:07:12.230> fiddling<00:07:12.560> around

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:12.650 
time we've been kind of fiddling around

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.050 
time we've been kind of fiddling around
trying<00:07:13.010> to<00:07:13.040> figure<00:07:13.190> out<00:07:13.310> which<00:07:13.490> screws<00:07:13.850> to

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
trying to figure out which screws to

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.210 
trying to figure out which screws to
remove<00:07:14.180> to<00:07:14.780> get<00:07:14.990> in<00:07:15.140> there<00:07:15.350> obviously<00:07:15.860> this

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:16.220 
remove to get in there obviously this

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.010 
remove to get in there obviously this
process<00:07:16.670> is<00:07:16.790> going<00:07:16.970> to<00:07:17.060> vary<00:07:17.300> from<00:07:17.390> sawdust

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 
process is going to vary from sawdust

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.620 
process is going to vary from sawdust

off for manufacturer to manufacture but
I<00:07:20.690> really<00:07:20.930> wanted<00:07:21.170> this<00:07:21.320> to<00:07:21.380> show<00:07:21.710> how<00:07:21.950> easy<00:07:22.370> it

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:22.640 
I really wanted this to show how easy it

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.940 
I really wanted this to show how easy it
is<00:07:22.760> or<00:07:23.060> how<00:07:23.180> straightforward<00:07:23.510> is<00:07:24.080> to<00:07:24.380> change
