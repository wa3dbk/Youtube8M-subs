difference in timing things so we start

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.029 
difference in timing things so we start
off<00:00:17.910> with<00:00:17.970> W<00:00:18.240> 12<00:00:18.480> SW<00:00:18.900> 13<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.800> we're<00:00:19.890> going<00:00:20.010> to

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
look at the arc own both accounts there

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.689 
look at the arc own both accounts there
you<00:00:22.320> go<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:22.710> there's<00:00:22.980> an<00:00:23.070> RKO

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
you go so there's an RKO

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.340 
you go so there's an RKO
as<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.390> can<00:00:24.480> imagine<00:00:24.570> they<00:00:24.840> both<00:00:25.050> be<00:00:25.199> down

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
as you can imagine they both be down

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.679 
as you can imagine they both be down
after<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.830> on<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.310> left<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.640> can<00:00:26.699> see<00:00:26.820> W<00:00:27.300> 12

after that on the left you can see W 12
and<00:00:27.900> on<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> right<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.380> can<00:00:28.470> see<00:00:28.619> WWE<00:00:29.220> 13<00:00:29.490> and

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
and on the right you can see WWE 13 and

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.620 
and on the right you can see WWE 13 and
I<00:00:31.529> thought<00:00:31.980> as<00:00:32.189> much<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.550> thought<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.880> WWE<00:00:33.420> 13

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
I thought as much I thought that WWE 13

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.209 
I thought as much I thought that WWE 13
a<00:00:33.930> priest<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.260> down<00:00:34.440> for<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.649> little<00:00:34.800> bit<00:00:35.040> longer

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
a priest a down for a little bit longer

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.670 
a priest a down for a little bit longer
and<00:00:35.550> they<00:00:35.640> do<00:00:35.700> think<00:00:36.660> I've<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:36.809> paused<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.350> W

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
and they do think I've just paused on W

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.979 
and they do think I've just paused on W
12<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.059> lot<00:00:39.480> much<00:00:39.600> longer<00:00:39.870> but

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
12 and it's a lot much longer but

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.389 
12 and it's a lot much longer but
there's<00:00:40.170> another<00:00:40.379> RKO<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.040> time<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
there's another RKO this time it's a

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.970 
there's another RKO this time it's a
Ryan<00:00:41.760> RKO<00:00:42.180> from<00:00:42.420> Orton<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
Ryan RKO from Orton and just the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.299 
Ryan RKO from Orton and just the
standard

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
standard

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.799 
standard
walks<00:00:44.640> down<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> one<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.120> get<00:00:45.210> under<00:00:45.420> B<00:00:45.539> 12

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
walks down the one you get under B 12

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.220 
walks down the one you get under B 12
and<00:00:46.399> I<00:00:47.450> thought<00:00:48.450> didn't<00:00:48.780> know<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:48.989> there<00:00:49.140> would

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
and I thought didn't know if there would

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.080 
and I thought didn't know if there would
be<00:00:49.260> kind<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.590> any<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.250> changes<00:00:50.879> if<00:00:51.059> you

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
be kind of any kind of changes if you

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.799 
be kind of any kind of changes if you
did<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> couple<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.350> finishes<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.309> row<00:00:53.489> and

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
did a couple of finishes in a row and

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.450 
did a couple of finishes in a row and
but<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.020> didn't<00:00:55.559> occur<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> looks<00:00:56.340> like

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
but it didn't occur so it looks like

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.250 
but it didn't occur so it looks like
that<00:00:56.670> roughly<00:00:57.149> still<00:00:57.480> about<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.690> same<00:00:57.809> try

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that roughly still about the same try

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.830 
that roughly still about the same try
and<00:00:58.590> make<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.730> even<00:00:59.969> guessing<00:01:00.300> at<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> same

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
and make that even guessing at the same

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.450 
and make that even guessing at the same
time<00:01:01.079> even<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> second<00:01:02.219> if<00:01:02.309> different

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
time even in the second if different

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.060 
time even in the second if different
Freddy<00:01:02.940> there's<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.510> third<00:01:03.719> one<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.170> third<00:01:04.589> RKO

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
Freddy there's a third one a third RKO

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.130 
Freddy there's a third one a third RKO
surely<00:01:05.939> shameless<00:01:06.360> couldn't<00:01:06.689> get<00:01:06.780> up<00:01:06.900> after

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
surely shameless couldn't get up after

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.950 
surely shameless couldn't get up after
that<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.920> but<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:08.939> obviously<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.659> long<00:01:09.810> as<00:01:09.900> you

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
more interesting but that just didn't

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.800 
more interesting but that just didn't
happen

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
happen

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.699

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
get there because the pin system on the

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.980 
get there because the pin system on the
right<00:03:34.920> compared<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.550> left<00:03:35.610> look<00:03:36.510> much

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990
