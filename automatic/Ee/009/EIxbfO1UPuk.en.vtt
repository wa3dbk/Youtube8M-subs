description if it helps it may be the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.660 
description if it helps it may be the
phils<00:02:40.020> Marta<00:02:40.410> fine<00:02:40.620> shouldn't<00:02:41.430> be<00:02:41.490> too<00:02:41.520> hard

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
phils Marta fine shouldn't be too hard

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.120 
phils Marta fine shouldn't be too hard
to<00:02:41.880> find<00:02:41.970> though<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:43.260> yeah<00:02:43.380> just<00:02:43.620> uploaded<00:02:44.040> to

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
to find though so yeah just uploaded to

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.710 
to find though so yeah just uploaded to
your<00:02:44.220> storefront<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.940> then<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.240> guess<00:02:45.390> every

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
your storefront and then I guess every

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.110 
your storefront and then I guess every
Thursday<00:02:46.200> I'll<00:02:47.040> just<00:02:47.250> look<00:02:47.400> up<00:02:47.580> for<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.970> boy

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
Thursday I'll just look up for the boy

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.670 
Thursday I'll just look up for the boy
21<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.810> then<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:48.990> should<00:02:49.140> be<00:02:49.170> able<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.500> see<00:02:49.590> your

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
21 and then I should be able to see your

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.250 
21 and then I should be able to see your
video

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.710 

so<00:02:53.860> here<00:02:54.099> we<00:02:54.220> have<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.640> audi<00:02:55.060> r8<00:02:55.480> which<00:02:55.629> i

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
so here we have the audi r8 which i

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.030 
so here we have the audi r8 which i
believe<00:02:55.780> is<00:02:55.989> making<00:02:56.439> about<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.650> thousand

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
believe is making about a thousand

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.300 
believe is making about a thousand
horsepower<00:02:58.620> overtaking<00:02:59.620> on<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.829> top<00:03:00.010> speed

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
horsepower overtaking on the top speed

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.220 
horsepower overtaking on the top speed
but<00:03:00.579> i'm<00:03:01.269> pretty<00:03:01.569> sure<00:03:01.689> it's<00:03:01.840> only<00:03:02.019> because

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
but i'm pretty sure it's only because

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.800 
but i'm pretty sure it's only because
the<00:03:02.709> gear<00:03:03.010> ratio<00:03:03.159> of<00:03:03.519> my<00:03:03.640> GTR<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.329> don't<00:03:04.569> have<00:03:04.720> it

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
the gear ratio of my GTR I don't have it

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.920 
the gear ratio of my GTR I don't have it
set<00:03:04.989> for<00:03:05.019> straight-line<00:03:05.799> speed<00:03:06.040> I<00:03:06.780> used<00:03:07.780> to

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
set for straight-line speed I used to

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.149 
set for straight-line speed I used to
drive<00:03:08.230> us<00:03:08.409> over<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.829> art<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.340> class<00:03:09.610> division

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
drive us over the art to class division

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.069 
drive us over the art to class division
so<00:03:12.159> yeah<00:03:12.370> they'll<00:03:13.150> fail<00:03:13.420> hitting<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.930> wall

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
so yeah they'll fail hitting the wall

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.500 
so yeah they'll fail hitting the wall
because<00:03:14.590> he<00:03:14.860> doesn't<00:03:15.069> know<00:03:15.250> him<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.549> turn<00:03:15.760> and

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
because he doesn't know him to turn and

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.899 
because he doesn't know him to turn and
this<00:03:16.629> one<00:03:16.780> was<00:03:16.870> interesting<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.590> thought<00:03:17.909> won't

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
this one was interesting I thought won't

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.270 
this one was interesting I thought won't
spoil<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.269> to<00:03:19.420> you<00:03:19.540> but<00:03:19.810> I<00:03:20.079> thought<00:03:20.859> one<00:03:21.069> car

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
spoil it to you but I thought one car

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.470 
spoil it to you but I thought one car
was<00:03:21.430> going<00:03:21.609> to<00:03:21.670> win<00:03:21.760> because<00:03:21.909> they<00:03:22.150> had<00:03:22.299> more

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
was going to win because they had more

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:31.200 
was going to win because they had more
horsepower<00:03:23.079> I<00:03:24.629> didn't

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210
