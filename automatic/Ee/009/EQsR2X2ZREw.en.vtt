this report is on water quality it's a

this report is on water quality it's a
follow-up<00:00:07.700> to<00:00:07.970> my<00:00:08.090> earlier<00:00:08.450> report<00:00:08.840> on<00:00:08.959> the

follow-up to my earlier report on the

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:11.560 
follow-up to my earlier report on the

science of water quality the focus this

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.570 
science of water quality the focus this
time<00:00:11.629> is<00:00:12.080> on<00:00:12.230> the<00:00:12.349> two<00:00:12.559> nutrients<00:00:13.100> pollutants

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
time is on the two nutrients pollutants

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.870 
time is on the two nutrients pollutants
of<00:00:13.850> nitrogen<00:00:14.420> and<00:00:14.570> phosphorus<00:00:14.980> on<00:00:15.980> land<00:00:16.430> of

of nitrogen and phosphorus on land of

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.340 
of nitrogen and phosphorus on land of
course<00:00:17.119> there<00:00:17.330> they<00:00:17.660> are<00:00:17.689> nutrients<00:00:18.260> that

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
course there they are nutrients that

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.019 
course there they are nutrients that
very<00:00:18.529> valuable<00:00:18.890> they<00:00:19.189> help<00:00:19.369> plants<00:00:19.760> to<00:00:19.880> grow

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
very valuable they help plants to grow

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.090 
very valuable they help plants to grow
but<00:00:20.780> when<00:00:20.930> they<00:00:21.020> get<00:00:21.170> into<00:00:21.289> water<00:00:21.590> and<00:00:21.950> there's

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
but when they get into water and there's

at how land-use change changes in type

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.100 
at how land-use change changes in type
of<00:01:12.920> farming<00:01:13.250> it's<00:01:13.400> done<00:01:13.580> is<00:01:14.420> driven<00:01:14.869> by

of farming it's done is driven by

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.730 
of farming it's done is driven by
changes<00:01:16.070> in<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.640> prices<00:01:16.909> of<00:01:17.380> Worland<00:01:18.380> meat

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.899 
and milk and logs and the second part
looks<00:01:22.490> at<00:01:22.790> how<00:01:23.030> that<00:01:23.090> land-use<00:01:23.869> change<00:01:24.909> means

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
looks at how that land-use change means

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.030 
looks at how that land-use change means
different<00:01:26.450> amounts<00:01:27.020> of<00:01:27.200> nitrogen<00:01:27.740> and

different amounts of nitrogen and

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.890 
different amounts of nitrogen and
phosphorus<00:01:28.250> actually<00:01:28.970> getting<00:01:29.270> into<00:01:29.479> water

and<00:01:30.830> what<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.729> modeling<00:01:32.060> shows<00:01:32.299> very<00:01:32.659> clearly

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
and what the modeling shows very clearly

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.760 
and what the modeling shows very clearly
is<00:01:33.369> that<00:01:34.780> when<00:01:35.780> is<00:01:35.930> a<00:01:35.960> shifter<00:01:36.350> dairying

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
is that when is a shifter dairying

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.499 
is that when is a shifter dairying
there's<00:01:37.070> a<00:01:37.130> big<00:01:37.340> increase<00:01:37.670> in<00:01:37.939> nitrogen<00:01:38.090> and

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
there's a big increase in nitrogen and

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.630 
there's a big increase in nitrogen and

phosphorus and water winners an increase

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.580 
phosphorus and water winners an increase
to<00:01:40.670> forestry<00:01:41.390> that<00:01:41.869> goes<00:01:42.049> the<00:01:42.259> other<00:01:42.290> way

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
to forestry that goes the other way

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.140 
to forestry that goes the other way
there's<00:01:43.040> a<00:01:43.100> decrease<00:01:43.810> I<00:01:44.810> do<00:01:45.080> acknowledge<00:01:46.150> the

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
there's a decrease I do acknowledge the

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.249 
there's a decrease I do acknowledge the
great<00:01:47.360> effort<00:01:47.689> that's<00:01:47.840> going<00:01:48.079> on<00:01:48.140> to

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
great effort that's going on to

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.350 
great effort that's going on to
mitigation<00:01:48.970> particularly<00:01:49.970> on<00:01:50.030> dairy<00:01:50.270> farms

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
mitigation particularly on dairy farms

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.840 
mitigation particularly on dairy farms
to<00:01:50.900> reduce<00:01:51.259> these<00:01:51.500> nutrients<00:01:52.100> getting<00:01:52.670> under

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
to reduce these nutrients getting under

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.450 
to reduce these nutrients getting under
water<00:01:53.060> it's<00:01:53.689> relatively<00:01:54.140> rare<00:01:54.470> in<00:01:54.740> much<00:01:55.250> the

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
water it's relatively rare in much the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.219 
water it's relatively rare in much the
country<00:01:55.820> now<00:01:56.000> to<00:01:56.060> find<00:01:56.720> if<00:01:56.840> we<00:01:56.990> went<00:01:57.140> to

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
country now to find if we went to

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.190 
country now to find if we went to
putting<00:01:57.409> being<00:01:57.920> put<00:01:58.100> directly<00:01:58.490> into<00:01:58.909> water

putting being put directly into water

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.460 
putting being put directly into water
but<00:02:00.340> unfortunately<00:02:01.659> the<00:02:02.659> problem<00:02:02.899> is<00:02:03.290> the

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
but unfortunately the problem is the

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.859 
but unfortunately the problem is the
scale<00:02:03.829> of<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.189> change<00:02:04.610> that<00:02:05.119> is<00:02:05.240> taking<00:02:05.420> place

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
scale of the change that is taking place

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.380
