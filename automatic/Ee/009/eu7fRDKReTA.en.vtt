00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.909 
and they specifically designed this
filter<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:10.990> champion<00:05:11.500> actually<00:05:11.770> does<00:05:11.889> a

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
filter and champion actually does a

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.310 
filter and champion actually does a
manufacturing<00:05:12.669> and<00:05:12.880> of<00:05:13.449> course<00:05:13.720> this<00:05:13.930> created

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
manufacturing and of course this created

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.439 
manufacturing and of course this created
a<00:05:14.380> buzz<00:05:14.560> on<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:14.770> internet<00:05:14.860> because<00:05:15.699> champion

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
a buzz on the internet because champion

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.960 
a buzz on the internet because champion
does<00:05:17.080> a<00:05:17.380> bunch<00:05:17.680> of<00:05:17.800> different<00:05:17.979> brands<00:05:18.490> of<00:05:18.759> oil

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
does a bunch of different brands of oil

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.730 
does a bunch of different brands of oil
filters<00:05:19.479> and<00:05:19.810> not<00:05:19.960> just<00:05:20.169> the<00:05:20.320> royal<00:05:20.530> purple

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
filters and not just the royal purple

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.920 
filters and not just the royal purple
one<00:05:21.039> and<00:05:21.250> some<00:05:21.820> people<00:05:21.970> were<00:05:22.240> suggesting<00:05:22.930> that

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
one and some people were suggesting that

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.270 
one and some people were suggesting that
maybe<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:24.520> royal<00:05:25.030> purple<00:05:25.330> filter<00:05:25.810> is<00:05:26.280> similar

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
maybe the royal purple filter is similar

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.070 
maybe the royal purple filter is similar
to<00:05:27.430> another<00:05:27.550> Champion<00:05:28.240> filter<00:05:28.599> but<00:05:28.780> it's<00:05:28.900> just

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
to another Champion filter but it's just

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.170 
to another Champion filter but it's just
painted<00:05:29.500> purple<00:05:29.740> and<00:05:30.160> maybe<00:05:30.550> that's<00:05:30.789> the<00:05:31.000> big

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
painted purple and maybe that's the big

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.689 
painted purple and maybe that's the big
difference<00:05:31.229> so<00:05:32.229> we<00:05:32.650> read<00:05:32.889> that<00:05:32.919> and<00:05:33.310> decided

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
difference so we read that and decided

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.330 
difference so we read that and decided
to<00:05:34.110> to<00:05:35.110> really<00:05:35.320> find<00:05:35.680> out<00:05:35.830> what's<00:05:36.010> going<00:05:36.070> on

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340
