 you can play better there all your 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.460

 to see if I can at least play it 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.509
 without even taking with the gamer bust and 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:33.930
 remembering the next me the processor is 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:37.659

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.049

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.530
 good have 12 xp 32 bits come on 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:49.180
 o xii paulo vi here social club 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.909
 only the game just to show you 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.979
 besides the game and booster I'm using 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.409
 here in gta possession will show to 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.560
 You and everyone here until on the agenda of gt 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:09.310
 By the time you can see I'm using here, I 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:11.800
 I had to use a business called 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.940
 he would give a tit every time he would give a 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.860
 error 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.610
 a mistake that if I remember correctly was a mistake 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.630
 55 something is to put a mistake there 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.060
 of the application 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.280
 I had to download this closed team that 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.860
 came to know dll file and there I 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.280
 I managed to shoot and good to go later. 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.780
 try to improve oleg is the bass i did 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.300
 this command command enac 7 and botei 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.310
 here and put the windows 7 that is 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.340
 to leave window mode that decreases in 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.190
 game arrest is she saying that I 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.270
 I think decreases the weight of the game and put 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.420
 This is what bull should be and I put it. 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.370
 10.0 that this causes the game 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.290
 recognize much more memory of your 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.700
 video card than he would recognize 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.900
 normal without it 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.230
 so besides I made all that effort 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.060
 right 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.410
 I found the game for a couple of weeks. 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:11.050
 with acm internet crap of 2 mega without 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.600
 be low optical fiber it 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.390
 five days more or less the tabloid and 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.989
 I installed since I was supposed to do it 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.550
 I tried to pack lag and that's where the game goes. 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:29.230
 show you how he's running 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:31.840
 here in my pc cent because the game is 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.410
 search it gets an end in problem having 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.900
 eugenio bucci it accelerates the game more 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.610
 still the problem because it 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.230
 Remember when you were trying to play me. 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.580
 it was getting very light is the game 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:49.070
 Search and played good in some silly 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.500
 so here is the first video 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.960
 of the bug reports that I'm going to make 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.420
 here on the channel talking there because I bring 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.480

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.370
 Do you know how long it takes here? 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.090
 beauty things the graphics are all in 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.160

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.470
 lots of my time here trying to show 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.209
 for you but it's okay just to 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.080
 show you how such graphs 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:24.470
 here will be transmitted is graphic beauty 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:28.640
 is all sign and everything in one of them can 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.680
 see 861 as little as possible and there 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.210
 below you see how much you recognize 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.700
 my video card 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.430
 Okay, now I'm going back there for the first time. 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:45.980
 Civil teacher screen rotated normally 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:49.190
 good, quiet, normal sound , and you 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.380
 24 gta on the wheel or not 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:58.730
 gt runs very good even better than 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:05:01.010
 many other processors out there 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.650
 knows that when the game can be changed to 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.320
 my cabin 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:10.550
 depending on how you use it if you can 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:14.870
 walk and hb cute little foot but have a 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:17.870
 thing apart from hd thing that black hd that 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.270
 It's much better than normal and full 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.850
 hd also shake his head and I can 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.450
 give into practice here good even in 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.410
 local 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.410
 we will see 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:34.040
 There was no way to get in the game. 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.980
 and if you can see the match between 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:42.890
 you can go see there already this feat to 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:45.980
 black hdl very little is each one looks lonely 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:48.980
 is ground wheel affinity in a 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:58.250
 pentium 4 processor and a memory card 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:06:03.140
 video of 56 or 2gb ram and hd is 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:07.450
 so turn the power hd you are 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.450
 very good for the wonderful drawer 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.470
 Grace now will seem like a joke there. 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.680
 underneath the Swiss Xavier going 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:24.590
 0 appear of money up there is 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.900
 very good resolution of both 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:30.830
 elements on the screen 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:34.400
 Look at the marvel game wonder 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.230
 resolution wonder of us and it is 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.210
 so it gets my pc does not show up any more 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:43.780
 absolutely nothing that implies the chain 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:46.820
 totally and that 's how it runs on my pc 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:49.290
 because it is 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.450
 so the staff was just summed up there to 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.910
 show crap that runs on my pc does not 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.950
 pentium 4 to tell you the truth, I 'm not going 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.050
 getting me out of the head of the people saying 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.760
 that will run on a video card is a 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.310
 trash and a teacher who is also trash 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.310
 that will not run into much trouble 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.980
 low in five days but went by 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.470
 a good way for a good cause since 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.700
 now it's on the wheel and now I know 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:16.110
 I need 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:19.110
 Haide to run at least there a good 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.960
 processor and a good video card 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:24.240
 I'll go after what's possible 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.830
 and it sure does not matter when I go 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.190
 bring this game yes 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:31.020
 already as better settings and etc. 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.850
 it was not just to show and not to run 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.740
 wheel and do not rotate 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:38.160
 if you have a very configuration 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.360
 Forget that it is not going to run this 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.700
 filth 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.380

 run on your pc and god
