the ball like oh the snowball this it's

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.189 
the ball like oh the snowball this it's
probable<00:06:03.289> right<00:06:04.009> no<00:06:04.580> you<00:06:04.909> know<00:06:04.940> it's<00:06:05.840> it's

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 
probable right no you know it's it's

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.769 
probable right no you know it's it's
fake<00:06:06.650> it's<00:06:06.979> like<00:06:07.159> WWF<00:06:07.909> wrestling<00:06:08.539> you<00:06:08.750> know

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:08.779 
fake it's like WWF wrestling you know

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.110 
fake it's like WWF wrestling you know
I'm<00:06:09.349> sure<00:06:09.590> that<00:06:09.800> those<00:06:09.949> misconceptions<00:06:10.370> still

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
I'm sure that those misconceptions still

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.260 
I'm sure that those misconceptions still
exist<00:06:11.599> out<00:06:11.779> there<00:06:11.810> but<00:06:12.469> I<00:06:12.500> think<00:06:12.919> that<00:06:13.270> anybody

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
exist out there but I think that anybody

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.870 
exist out there but I think that anybody
that's<00:06:14.479> come<00:06:14.659> to<00:06:14.690> a<00:06:14.870> game<00:06:15.110> at<00:06:15.319> this<00:06:15.440> point

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
that's come to a game at this point

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.610 
that's come to a game at this point
understands<00:06:16.880> that<00:06:16.969> that's<00:06:17.120> not<00:06:17.389> it<00:06:17.870> you<00:06:17.930> know

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
understands that that's not it you know

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.550 
understands that that's not it you know
it's<00:06:18.860> not<00:06:19.210> WWF<00:06:20.210> it's<00:06:20.419> not<00:06:20.599> staged<00:06:20.990> it's<00:06:21.380> not

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
it's not WWF it's not staged it's not

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:28.959 
it's not WWF it's not staged it's not
fake

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:28.969 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:31.909 

so<00:06:29.969> roller<00:06:30.360> derby<00:06:30.449> is<00:06:30.749> a<00:06:30.869> full<00:06:31.199> contact<00:06:31.409> sport

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
so roller derby is a full contact sport

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.629

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
her helmet cover you can imagine the

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.019 
her helmet cover you can imagine the
jammer<00:06:48.599> sort<00:06:49.050> of<00:06:49.139> a<00:06:49.349> ball<00:06:49.649> with<00:06:49.889> a<00:06:49.919> brain<00:06:50.249> she's

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:51.029 
jammer sort of a ball with a brain she's

the girl who scores the points and her
teammates<00:06:55.379> are<00:06:55.499> helping<00:06:55.830> her<00:06:55.979> score<00:06:56.309> points

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:05.239 

the<00:07:03.599> rule<00:07:03.809> of<00:07:03.839> the<00:07:03.990> game<00:07:04.199> that<00:07:04.409> adds<00:07:04.589> strategy

00:07:05.239 --> 00:07:05.249 
the rule of the game that adds strategy

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:07.549 
the rule of the game that adds strategy
to<00:07:05.819> roller<00:07:05.999> derby<00:07:06.089> is<00:07:06.509> that<00:07:06.839> the<00:07:07.020> first<00:07:07.259> jammer

00:07:07.549 --> 00:07:07.559 
to roller derby is that the first jammer

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:10.429 
to roller derby is that the first jammer
to<00:07:07.860> get<00:07:08.039> through<00:07:08.309> the<00:07:08.430> pack<00:07:08.669> legally<00:07:09.439> without

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:10.439 
to get through the pack legally without

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:12.230 
to get through the pack legally without
committing<00:07:10.889> any<00:07:11.069> penalties<00:07:11.580> are<00:07:11.879> stepping<00:07:12.149> on

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 
committing any penalties are stepping on

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.659 
committing any penalties are stepping on
a<00:07:12.270> bound<00:07:12.509> can<00:07:13.020> become<00:07:13.259> a<00:07:13.289> lead<00:07:13.589> jammer<00:07:13.889> and<00:07:14.189> she

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:14.669 
a bound can become a lead jammer and she

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.089 
a bound can become a lead jammer and she
basically<00:07:14.999> has<00:07:15.300> control<00:07:15.749> over<00:07:16.050> when<00:07:16.529> the<00:07:16.889> jam

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:17.099 
basically has control over when the jam

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:20.760 
basically has control over when the jam
ends

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:20.770 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.380 

so<00:07:21.770> the<00:07:21.920> ideal<00:07:22.460> situation<00:07:22.610> if<00:07:23.150> you're<00:07:23.210> the

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:23.390 
so the ideal situation if you're the

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.040 
so the ideal situation if you're the
lead<00:07:23.570> jammer<00:07:25.390> you'll<00:07:26.390> come<00:07:26.600> out<00:07:26.630> of<00:07:26.840> the<00:07:26.900> pack

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.050 
lead jammer you'll come out of the pack

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.960 
lead jammer you'll come out of the pack
first<00:07:27.380> you<00:07:27.650> come<00:07:27.860> around<00:07:28.010> you<00:07:28.520> score<00:07:28.850> your

first you come around you score your

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.940 
first you come around you score your
four<00:07:29.180> points<00:07:29.690> for<00:07:29.840> all<00:07:29.930> the<00:07:30.110> four<00:07:30.380> opponents

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:30.950 
four points for all the four opponents

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.280 
four points for all the four opponents
in<00:07:31.100> the<00:07:31.160> pack<00:07:32.090> and<00:07:32.420> then<00:07:32.630> you<00:07:32.750> call<00:07:32.930> off<00:07:33.140> the

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:33.290 
in the pack and then you call off the

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:38.670 
in the pack and then you call off the
jam<00:07:33.500> so<00:07:33.890> the<00:07:34.070> other<00:07:34.190> jammer<00:07:34.460> can't<00:07:34.760> score
