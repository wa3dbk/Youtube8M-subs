00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.590
 hello everyone with you tomatoes and often not 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.810
 ask a question here I downloaded bandicam 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.949
 rented and I can not hear there why me 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.710
 I can not hear and all that 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.980
 seems to be all set up but i don't care 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.529
 I can not hear that there is a man something 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.630
 speak microphone but no video 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.190
 but in fact this is all easily solved 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.400
 I do not know why they ask me such questions 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.280
 it's actually very easy well here 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.250
 downloaded so bandicam opened it and 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.040
 you have a window like this 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.650
 she's the main company 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.590
 Cabinet only have different sections 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:56.820
 go means in the video section and further 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.010
 settings click the adapter here on 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.180
 sound if for example you have opened on 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.380
 logo you go to the sound here it is ours 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.380
 sound and here will be the main device 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.270
 additional device under the main 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.970
 device you must set your 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.790
 microphone that you really work well 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.760
 under the optional device you must 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.400
 build a stereo mixer why so 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.080
 what is a stereo mixer these for 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.570
 to be heard by the system sounds 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.720
 for example you play a game let's say 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.710
 same 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:36.520
 maynkravta do not know your helmet there 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.680
 Now they play here and so that was some 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.660
 sound then for example a sharp sound of shooting 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.250
 you need to turn on the stereo misha and add it 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.140
 here but the main microphone is actually 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.240
 microphone through which you are talking 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.590
 there by skype and generally define 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.450
 if you know what your microphone is 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.180
 Primary if you do not have a microphone 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.090
 go buy and shop for the season have you 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.560
 have you need to click on this one 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:10.690
 an arrow if I may say so and 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.720
 here find such a sound manager here 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.620
 click on it with the right button and 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.170
 push the sound pitch 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.900
 sound devices and here there is 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.990
 playback recording teeth connection on but 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.420
 long record and just you something 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.670
 say yes and you 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.670
 here for example my microphone here it is 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.110
 that is, there is such a green scale 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.840
 loudness well i mean i have a working one 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.000
 megaphone so there is a stereo mixer 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.319
 by the way it you may initially not 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.420
 it will be seen but we'll talk 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:53.680
 the next lesson on recording sounds in the game 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.110
 system sound system using 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.730
 bandits but here you are 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.010
 microphone for example here it would be him 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.100
 remember and expose here 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.010
 initially you will stand win7 something 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.450
 there you just rearrange on your 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.410
 working microphone my case is 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.680
 the microphone that works well for me 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.709
 actually all this is all very easy 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.160
 configured and actually something like this 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.680
 if you have a microphone yes he you 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.410
 stuck in the computer but you like it 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.440
 doesn't work so let's say that there is 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.590
 green volume bar does not move 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.239
 you need to right click on it 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.560
 here you will not have to disable and enable 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.620
 on the contrary, that is 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.340
 Well, somehow, so I really 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.519
 everything is easy 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.750
 as I said on whose give again 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.130
 here we have bandicam on which 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.560
 now actually shoot further we 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.840
 click here is not on these settings here on 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.049
 these namely here on these which are top 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.250
 record click sound settings and here 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.790
 choose a microphone 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.859
 actually everything is easy so i think you 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.560
 the more you will understand not such 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.690
 comments will not write because 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.340
 I made a video specially well, 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.019
 actually like like subscribe to 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.239
