00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.859
 certainly worth the celebration for the 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.849
 history prepare an equipment of 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.099
 theater some publications courses of 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.130
 specialization but the main course is 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.179
 the staging of maracanazo 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.859
 Maracanazo is a very position 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.289
 interesting mix two cultures the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.930
 Brazilian and the Greek and this is because 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.000
 the story of the play speaks 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.400
 about that historic football match 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.849
 between Brazil and Uruguay we will see 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.849
 that is 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.800
 but never 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.410
 addressing the Greek gods were 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.490
 expelled from Greece after the wars 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.950
 of the Peloponnese and Chicanas Brazil 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:53.610
 what was the first thing that the 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.610
 Brazilians sow a year to the championship 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.450
 actually we thought that when 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.400
 they told us that it was going to be a musical that 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:05.229
 It would be like cabaret but not 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.740
 reality the music that Gabriela composed 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.600
 it's amazing he 's very father I do not know if 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.280
 could be considered a musical as such 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.720
 not because it does not look like the musical ones 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.230
 that I have seen so far 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.800
 but 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.800
 or not 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.650
 and Maracana was ready to take his 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.310
 Brazil's first World Cup was the 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.890
 undisputed winner but the gods 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.130
 they intervened so that the Uruguayan value 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.130
 will enter your goal 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.590
 of this struggle who suffered the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.509
 consequences his shroud 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.509
 murcia barbosa 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.480
 plus 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.570
 ah 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.360
 the point is not so much that he had not stopped 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.320
 the bowl but the point is that in Brazil 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.810
 a murderer treat him like decent people 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.660
 and that in Brazil crime is not crime 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:18.080
 is to kill someone but is not to stop a 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.189
 punishment stroke 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.069
 43 arrived 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:25.810
 to the absurd within the banality of 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.790
 world of the universe and that is a 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.540
 banality that the work raises but it is the 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.540
 world situation
