00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:07.230
 tomtom rider unboxing said it 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.150
 I love the boxes and just review those 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.900
 let's see what we have next 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.789
 in this little box there is the tom tom che 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.660
 is the motorcycle navigator in the rich 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:29.220
 package 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:32.369
 here is a bit of librettos part explains 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.160
 let's say the pc ruth management ea 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.780
 suit that the interactive software 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.680
 dedicated tomtom rider that allows you 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.899
 to save configure and search for 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.770
 roads on your pc 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.559
 and this is where I am the manual of 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.170
 first installation with all that 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.649
 is used to configure the beginning 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.469
 your browser the congratulations in 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.629
 more languages ​​and then the box which is the 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.110
 most interesting part then here 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.820
 we have the installation cable that 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.760
 for the motorcycle for powering the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:17.159
 motorcycle USB and mini USB charging cable 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.130
 not micro usb 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.130
 let's say so angular because then we'll see 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.240
 it installs better on the navigator the two 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.340
 British outlets is that it is Anglo-Saxon 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.869
 sum what is our anchor 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.509
 used by us this is the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.850
 charger where you go to install 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:43.439
 bayonet one of the two one of the two 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:46.320
 plug versions this also comes in 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.619
 this bayonet here so it seems not 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.470
 but in my opinion it is what 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.360
 actually he would like to enter because 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.659
 year but the normal unit not mine 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.100
 that's how it fits together here 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.420
 equally easily removed 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.310
 that is, pulling here without breaking it ok 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.610
 let's put back in place 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.950
 then in the box in the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.100
 package there is all those that are 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.630
 brackets to mount it on the bike with 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.670
 this head that is practically 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:25.030
 nothing but a kind of knowing how to do 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.540
 rotate the installation plate 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.880
 computer the screws are sealed and therefore 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.400
 now we before reviewing it 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.530
 task of putting it back into the box thing 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.330
 impossible 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.700
 before doing our review that 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.769
 we will show you in a few days 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.670
