00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
out of your roundoff do the same thing

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.050 
out of your roundoff do the same thing
when<00:01:27.970> you<00:01:28.060> do<00:01:28.180> a<00:01:28.210> real<00:01:28.480> roundoff<00:01:30.060> whenever

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
shoulders up instead of down

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.610

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
because if you bend your arms then you

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.820 
because if you bend your arms then you
could<00:01:41.530> hit<00:01:41.680> your<00:01:41.800> head<00:01:43.230> this<00:01:44.230> is<00:01:44.290> a<00:01:44.560> bad

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
way too far the farther back your head

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.050 
way too far the farther back your head
is<00:01:52.780> your<00:01:53.350> back<00:01:53.620> will<00:01:53.830> arch<00:01:54.010> more<00:01:54.370> so<00:01:54.730> try<00:01:55.030> not

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
is your back will arch more so try not
