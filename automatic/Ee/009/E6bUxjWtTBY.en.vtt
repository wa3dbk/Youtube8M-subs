00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.190 
brochure with my son the other day and
we<00:01:43.700> were<00:01:43.820> picking<00:01:44.120> out<00:01:44.180> concerts<00:01:44.660> he<00:01:44.870> wants<00:01:45.080> to

but a great orchestral showpiece I think
the<00:02:16.850> piece<00:02:17.000> I'm<00:02:17.180> most<00:02:17.420> looking<00:02:17.630> forward<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:18.140> is

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
the piece I'm most looking forward to is

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.770 
the piece I'm most looking forward to is
the<00:02:18.590> Bartok<00:02:19.070> concerto<00:02:19.520> for<00:02:19.640> Orchestra<00:02:20.120> which

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
the Bartok concerto for Orchestra which

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.050 
the Bartok concerto for Orchestra which
this<00:02:20.990> Orchestra<00:02:21.530> does<00:02:21.709> quite<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.070> bit<00:02:22.130> as<00:02:22.550> it

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
this Orchestra does quite a bit as it

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.690 
this Orchestra does quite a bit as it
was<00:02:23.239> born<00:02:23.510> on<00:02:23.660> this<00:02:23.840> stage<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:25.160> I<00:02:25.430> feel<00:02:25.670> a

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
was born on this stage and I feel a

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.820 
was born on this stage and I feel a
great<00:02:25.880> responsibility<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.050> sense<00:02:27.739> of

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
great responsibility to that sense of

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.860 
great responsibility to that sense of
history<00:02:28.220> but<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.209> other<00:02:29.330> reason<00:02:29.660> I'm<00:02:29.750> really

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
history but the other reason I'm really

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.970 
history but the other reason I'm really
looking<00:02:30.200> forward<00:02:30.380> to<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.709> is<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:30.920> the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
looking forward to it is that the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.220 
looking forward to it is that the
instrument<00:02:31.550> that<00:02:31.640> I'm<00:02:31.760> playing<00:02:32.030> now<00:02:32.390> we

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.230 
think it's the mark of a great
civilization<00:05:39.650> when<00:05:40.010> we<00:05:40.190> have<00:05:40.700> great<00:05:40.910> music

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.540 
the orchestra and they're excited about
hearing<00:06:05.630> it<00:06:05.750> so<00:06:06.320> I<00:06:06.650> think<00:06:06.740> once<00:06:07.220> you<00:06:07.370> ignite

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
hearing it so I think once you ignite

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.570 
hearing it so I think once you ignite
that<00:06:07.760> passion<00:06:08.560> they<00:06:09.560> there<00:06:09.950> may<00:06:10.100> be<00:06:10.130> a<00:06:10.250> period

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
that passion they there may be a period

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.620 
that passion they there may be a period
of<00:06:10.669> time<00:06:10.880> when<00:06:11.120> they're<00:06:11.240> raising<00:06:11.419> their

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
of time when they're raising their

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.750 
of time when they're raising their
families<00:06:12.139> and<00:06:12.620> you<00:06:12.979> know<00:06:13.100> dealing<00:06:13.340> with<00:06:13.460> crazy

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
families and you know dealing with crazy

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.969 
families and you know dealing with crazy
schedules<00:06:14.240> that<00:06:14.840> they<00:06:14.990> don't<00:06:15.440> come<00:06:15.710> to<00:06:15.889> the

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
schedules that they don't come to the

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:17.860 
schedules that they don't come to the
orchestra<00:06:16.250> but<00:06:16.669> they<00:06:16.789> come<00:06:17.000> back<00:06:17.030> to<00:06:17.510> it<00:06:17.660> later

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
orchestra but they come back to it later

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.830 
orchestra but they come back to it later
on

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
on

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.689 
on
and<00:06:18.930> I<00:06:19.290> think<00:06:19.350> that's<00:06:19.830> what's<00:06:20.280> happened

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 
and I think that's what's happened

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:22.250 
and I think that's what's happened
through<00:06:21.060> the<00:06:21.150> years<00:06:21.389> the<00:06:21.750> thing<00:06:22.080> that

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
through the years the thing that

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.659 
through the years the thing that
concerns<00:06:22.410> me<00:06:22.680> the<00:06:22.860> most<00:06:22.889> is<00:06:23.400> that<00:06:23.430> we're

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
concerns me the most is that we're

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.000 
concerns me the most is that we're
losing<00:06:23.880> it<00:06:24.180> in<00:06:24.300> our<00:06:24.419> schools<00:06:24.690> and<00:06:24.930> I<00:06:25.710> think

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
losing it in our schools and I think

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.090 
losing it in our schools and I think
that<00:06:26.520> is<00:06:26.820> that's<00:06:27.449> the<00:06:27.660> problem<00:06:27.900> and<00:06:28.260> one<00:06:29.070> that

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
that is that's the problem and one that

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.879 
that is that's the problem and one that
I<00:06:29.430> I<00:06:29.729> think<00:06:30.150> the<00:06:30.240> DSO<00:06:30.570> is<00:06:30.600> starting<00:06:31.590> to<00:06:31.740> do<00:06:31.860> a

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
I I think the DSO is starting to do a

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.010 
I I think the DSO is starting to do a
very<00:06:32.190> wonderful<00:06:32.460> job<00:06:32.880> of<00:06:32.910> addressing<00:06:33.870> them

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
very wonderful job of addressing them

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.390 
very wonderful job of addressing them
getting<00:06:34.320> in<00:06:34.440> there<00:06:34.590> and<00:06:34.740> getting<00:06:34.800> musicians

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
getting in there and getting musicians

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.360 
getting in there and getting musicians
in<00:06:35.699> playing<00:06:36.660> for<00:06:36.960> kids<00:06:37.169> firsthand<00:06:37.860> so<00:06:38.280> they

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
in playing for kids firsthand so they

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.930 
in playing for kids firsthand so they
can<00:06:38.550> see<00:06:38.910> us<00:06:38.940> and<00:06:39.360> realize<00:06:39.960> we're<00:06:40.919> people<00:06:41.130> we

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
can see us and realize we're people we

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.909 
can see us and realize we're people we
love<00:06:42.270> to<00:06:42.419> play<00:06:42.660> this<00:06:43.110> is<00:06:43.290> what<00:06:43.440> it<00:06:43.530> sounds<00:06:43.889> like

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 
love to play this is what it sounds like

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:45.590 
love to play this is what it sounds like
and<00:06:44.220> get<00:06:44.370> them<00:06:44.520> excited<00:06:44.610> about<00:06:45.300> what<00:06:45.479> they're

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
and get them excited about what they're

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.570 
and get them excited about what they're
seeing<00:06:45.840> and<00:06:46.169> once<00:06:46.800> you<00:06:46.949> do<00:06:47.070> that<00:06:47.100> once<00:06:47.460> you

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
seeing and once you do that once you

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.390 
seeing and once you do that once you
light<00:06:47.790> that<00:06:47.820> fire<00:06:48.330> then<00:06:48.660> the<00:06:48.780> rest<00:06:48.960> of<00:06:49.110> it<00:06:49.400> over

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
light that fire then the rest of it over

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.300 
light that fire then the rest of it over
time<00:06:50.580> I<00:06:50.639> think<00:06:50.880> will<00:06:51.240> will<00:06:51.840> grow<00:06:52.440> and<00:06:52.860> take

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
time I think will will grow and take

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.629 
time I think will will grow and take
care<00:06:53.460> of<00:06:53.550> itself<00:06:54.800> in<00:06:55.800> my<00:06:56.010> free<00:06:56.160> time<00:06:56.190> when<00:06:56.490> I'm
