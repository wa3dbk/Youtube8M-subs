 quite a short time 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.260
 went out from 93 to 94 and has six 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.269
 numbers 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.879
 especially about such details and details 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.829
 Today I will not speak because these 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.259
 most details details are not so 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.050
 much better tell you about the plot 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.540
 all cool but as always the city 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.000
 sins same lead in this volume 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.280
 plays duight mccarthy this is the one 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.509
 the boy who played uncle Clive in 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.000
 the first part of the film 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.399
 if you first open the second volume that 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.340
 I do not understand what the joke of the protagonist and 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.479
 most likely ask yourself dressed 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.119
 descend mccarthy 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.009
 and here everything is not so easy because 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.770
 stories he appears to us bald 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.200
 muzhik but outflow how did he become hairy 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.800
 typical for us I will not tell 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.200
 now that's exactly the story like me 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.509
 already said earlier the main character duite in 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.520
 the past is a talented photographer but for his 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.530
 alcohol addiction and extremely 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.709
 rash acts his time he 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.440
 lost this job later settle down and 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:55.479
 holding himself he entered new now 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.310
 mccarthy private investigator who 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.069
 most often to photograph 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.830
 and spying on people who change 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:05.440
 each other one typical day to him in 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.319
 the cabinet is ringing on 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.000
 wire his great lady by the name of CSOs 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.580
 which his relationship ended 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.860
 pretty bad thing is that 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.860
 once she spat on him leaving 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.230
 trough a girl asks white 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.930
 so that he came to the local club who 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.330
 we can remember from the film this 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.300
 the place where the incomparable danced 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.209
 Jessica Alba 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.019
 but in the comics Nancy McCarthy leaned 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.150
 female charms 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.970
 and persuasion still decides to go 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.010
 there there they brew conversation in 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.769
 which turns out that you have huge 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.910
 problems but really duyte at all 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.370
 don't give a damn about them 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.160
 also she makes a hint that her 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.390
 want to kill but McCarthy is still not 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.360
 serious to her words 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.330
 but unthinkable love runs strong 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.180
 guy feelings for the lady make duyta 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.100
 still get into the mansion cover where 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.920
 she live with her husband who 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.990
 is also a big rich in the course 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.420
 security guards notice him 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.600
 which kvatsyat face of the poor lover 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.060
 idiot by the way about the security if their day 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.970
 one kid named coins or mana 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.920
 but this is such a two-meter man peaked caps 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.830
 who pulls around for protection 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.200
 ladies by the way this thug still 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.240
 the beginning of the comic when duite and both were in 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.880
 club disliked one familiar to us 7 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.870
 character and good familiar chief 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.230
 hero more 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.850
 yes the same brand from the first volume yes that 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.340
 which is fried on electric 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.530
 stool how did it happen that he ended up 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.290
 in this part if he died in the first volume 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.380
 well, just the action of this volume occur 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.530
 the middle of the first nonlinearity is just like that 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.740
 tarantino well we moved away from the plot so here 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.720
 after small ut libman 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.300
 say dyuyta smashed our hero 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.670
 it becomes uneasy slightly later he 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.700
 still able to get home there he 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.280
 found his rosette former duite angry 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.760
 very angry he even knocked once and 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.950
 face but love this thing is complicated and our 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.239
 the hero can not resist the beauty of 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.310
 they have sex i have a comedian of earth and they have 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.169
 there is sex after which th 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.320
 talks about what her husband is about 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.360
 kill her can find out where she is at home 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.540
 after some time comes to them in 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.120
 the house then as expected 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.890
 mccarthy gets fierce people on this 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.930
 times got twice an order of magnitude more 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.690
 but now it is configured a little 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.340
 stronger McCarthy goes to the club and 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.400
 asks for power support from 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.340
 margot but that one without much persuasion 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.530
 agrees now their two strengths are chances 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.360
 salvation and you increase but 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.630
 work together or in a team of these two 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.230
 guys it and not only that you can 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.630
 find out if you read the comics 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.790
 I personally adore the universe of the city of sins I 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.310
 love drawing miller love all these 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.590

 my where much more than in 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.800
 the rest of the publication is not particularly talk 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.620
 I will be compared with the first volume 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.560
 there is no real change unless 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.930
 change the font specifically so changed 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.780
 instead of a sloppy printed 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.730
 beautiful and peculiar comic you though 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.830
 many in the preview of the did not like but 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.200

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.570
 minutes 15 you obviously get used to 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.660
