00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.080
 Y 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.080
 i 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.620
 jose ramon we just attended the 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.700
 presentation of the new 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.520
 s1000rr of 2015 and when I say new it's 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.490
 new so it is about a motorcycle 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.779
 completely renovated both outside 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.950
 as inside as you can see the 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.560
 design of the bike has changed 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.899
 completely maintains the essence of 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.270
 rr model characteristic of the brand 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.610
 but it includes a large number of novelties 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.710
 it is emphasized more in the dynamic aspect and 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.200
 sports motorcycle has a motorcycle 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.340
 199 horses in 6 horses more than 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.680
 previous model therefore the power 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.780
 increased torque curve too 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.210
 it has been optimized 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.020
 and has an electronic accelerator 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.789
 not all are the benefits 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.790
 aesthetically the bike has also 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.680
 changed like this is the bike keeps the 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.420
 typical characteristics of the model rr 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.129
 as are the ascending line from your 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.739
 Front to your tail side 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.050
 asymmetric or the asymmetrical front but 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.920
 all this has undergone a redesign 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.860
 quite important and what the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.200
 aesthetic meets dynamically this is 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.020
 a bike that we can buy us and 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.340
 go straight to the circuit to 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.660
 me is one of the features 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.550
 main of this model is a motorcycle 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.810
 which factory you can go directly 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.320
 to the circuit and to any fan 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.270
 to the racing world to compete 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.450
 Perfect vale is the ideal motorcycle is 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.130
 complicated to summarize 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.930
 Limited time all news 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.759
 that the bike includes but good for me 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.920
 the main thing is that series incorporates 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.520
 three driving modes incorporates a 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.310
 built-in traction control the abs and 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.450
 additionally if we need something more 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.280
 we can also have the option of 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.569
 expand is a driving mode to the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.909
 pro driving modes with one mode 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.530
 sleep and a user mode that allows you 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.909
 parameterize each and every one of the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.530
 motorcycle components so 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.689
 Both options are practically 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.520
 unlimited I counted in the presentation 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.170
 which are five driving modes against 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.619
 of the two optionals and there's something like that 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.190
 as 45 parameters to control you can 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.349
 Modify how dynamic adjustment works 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.329
 of the suspension in the ve is the control 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.430
 of traction the power curves and 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:15.930
 all this as standard or with the option of 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.019
 the driving modes therefore if 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.690
 the customization is total because 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.829
 you know this is the new bmw s1000rr 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.829
 for the year 2015 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.520
 and more 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.020
 and
