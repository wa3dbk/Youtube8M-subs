00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
upgrades and hopefully we can take them

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.469 
upgrades and hopefully we can take them
into<00:00:50.070> Darwin<00:00:50.489> next<00:00:50.699> round<00:00:50.879> because<00:00:51.239> you've

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.479 
into Darwin next round because you've

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:52.789 
into Darwin next round because you've
been<00:00:51.540> really<00:00:51.809> testing<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.290> friday<00:00:52.530> practice

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:52.799 
been really testing on friday practice

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:54.139 
been really testing on friday practice
haven't<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.280> yeah<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:53.789> we've<00:00:54.000> been

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
haven't you yeah we have we've been

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.459 
haven't you yeah we have we've been
struggling<00:00:54.420> friday<00:00:54.750> practice<00:00:54.960> because<00:00:55.320> we

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
struggling friday practice because we

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.810 
struggling friday practice because we
sort<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.739> lose<00:00:55.890> our<00:00:56.070> way<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.399> i<00:00:56.489> think<00:00:56.670> that's

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
sort of lose our way and i think that's

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.279 
sort of lose our way and i think that's
a<00:00:56.879> lot<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.180> do<00:00:57.269> with<00:00:57.299> our<00:00:57.539> race<00:00:57.719> pace<00:00:57.930> as<00:00:58.110> well

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
a lot to do with our race pace as well

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.410 
a lot to do with our race pace as well
we<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:59.159> you<00:00:59.519> know<00:00:59.610> we<00:00:59.729> try<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> lot<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.239> things

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
we we you know we try a lot of things

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.329 
we we you know we try a lot of things
and<00:01:00.629> then<00:01:00.719> we<00:01:00.809> actually<00:01:01.079> lose<00:01:01.229> track<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.680> where

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
and then we actually lose track of where

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.310 
and then we actually lose track of where
the<00:01:02.460> tracks<00:01:02.699> actually<00:01:02.969> going<00:01:03.119> but<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.229> know

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the tracks actually going but you know

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.919 
the tracks actually going but you know
now<00:01:04.619> today<00:01:05.100> we're<00:01:05.549> able<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.659> know<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.899> a

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:06.929 
now today we're able to you know have a

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:08.960 
now today we're able to you know have a
full-on<00:01:07.200> practice<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.069> CN<00:01:08.460> try<00:01:08.670> some<00:01:08.850> new

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
full-on practice and CN try some new

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:17.930 
full-on practice and CN try some new
parts<00:01:09.179> and<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.509> good

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.440 

a<00:01:18.000> frosty<00:01:18.990> testing<00:01:19.770> when<00:01:19.920> you're<00:01:20.070> winning<00:01:20.450> why

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
a frosty testing when you're winning why

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.110 
a frosty testing when you're winning why
go<00:01:21.630> testing<00:01:22.080> if<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.320> do<00:01:22.440> it<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.770> well<00:01:22.800> oh<00:01:23.220> it's

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
go testing if you do it so well oh it's

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.980 
go testing if you do it so well oh it's
it's<00:01:24.780> definitely<00:01:25.380> about<00:01:25.680> moving<00:01:26.400> forward<00:01:26.820> we

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
it's definitely about moving forward we

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.210 
it's definitely about moving forward we
every<00:01:27.990> team's<00:01:28.200> going<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.470> testing<00:01:28.830> this<00:01:28.920> break

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
every team's going to testing this break

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.220 
every team's going to testing this break
so<00:01:29.640> we've<00:01:30.090> got<00:01:30.330> bits<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.660> we<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.900> try<00:01:31.080> on<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
so we've got bits that we can try on the

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.870 
so we've got bits that we can try on the
car<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.800> know<00:01:31.980> we<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.250> go<00:01:32.370> quicker<00:01:32.640> at

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
car that we know we can go quicker at

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.030 
car that we know we can go quicker at
our<00:01:33.390> cars<00:01:33.690> aren't<00:01:33.930> perfect<00:01:34.380> buying<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.740> by<00:01:34.890> any

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
our cars aren't perfect buying it by any

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.490 
our cars aren't perfect buying it by any
means<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.660> everyone<00:01:36.660> will<00:01:37.080> boost<00:01:37.290> out<00:01:37.470> of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
means so everyone will boost out of

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.080 
means so everyone will boost out of
these<00:01:37.710> tests<00:01:38.070> i'm<00:01:38.220> sure<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.760> know<00:01:38.880> five

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
these tests i'm sure you know five

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.240 
these tests i'm sure you know five
percent<00:01:39.480> ten<00:01:39.720> percent<00:01:40.050> teams<00:01:40.260> will<00:01:40.440> find<00:01:40.710> we

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
percent ten percent teams will find we

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.770 
percent ten percent teams will find we
need<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.460> make<00:01:41.610> sure<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.910> get<00:01:42.090> ten<00:01:42.360> percent<00:01:42.690> to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
need to make sure we get ten percent to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.650 
need to make sure we get ten percent to
stay<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.050> front<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.350> everyone<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.660> yeah

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
stay in front of everyone so yeah

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.480 
stay in front of everyone so yeah
testings<00:01:46.350> massively<00:01:46.710> important<00:01:47.190> you<00:01:47.250> never

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
testings massively important you never

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.100 
testings massively important you never
think<00:01:47.760> you're<00:01:47.850> ahead<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.180> motorsports<00:01:48.810> so

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
think you're ahead in motorsports so

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.260 
think you're ahead in motorsports so
more<00:01:49.830> tests<00:01:50.220> we've<00:01:50.340> got<00:01:50.460> things<00:01:50.580> to<00:01:50.760> try<00:01:51.000> and

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
more tests we've got things to try and

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.600 
more tests we've got things to try and
hopefully<00:01:51.960> make<00:01:52.050> the<00:01:52.170> car<00:01:52.320> quicker<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.860> make

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
hopefully make the car quicker and make

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.520 
hopefully make the car quicker and make
our<00:01:53.790> cars<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.150> I'm<00:01:54.240> more<00:01:54.390> competitive<00:01:54.630> Chris

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
our cars if I'm more competitive Chris

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.290 
our cars if I'm more competitive Chris
you<00:01:55.650> only<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:55.980> four<00:01:56.220> days<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.490> year<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:57.090> come

you only get four days a year that come

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.750 
you only get four days a year that come

it much more viable also you've got to

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.010 
it much more viable also you've got to
give<00:02:35.700> your<00:02:35.820> co-drivers<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.510> run<00:02:36.780> they've<00:02:36.989> got
