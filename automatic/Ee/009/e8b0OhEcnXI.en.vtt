check<00:03:04.100> out<00:03:04.220> how<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.520> sounds<00:03:04.940> I'm<00:03:05.420> going<00:03:05.690> to

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
check out how it sounds I'm going to

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.750 
check out how it sounds I'm going to
start<00:03:06.110> by<00:03:06.230> demonstrating<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.830> guitar<00:03:07.160> using

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
start by demonstrating the guitar using

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.820 
start by demonstrating the guitar using
just<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.390> straight<00:03:08.630> pickup<00:03:09.049> sound<00:03:09.290> going

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
just the straight pickup sound going

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.620 
just the straight pickup sound going
straight<00:03:10.250> through<00:03:10.430> this<00:03:10.700> Fishman<00:03:11.180> lockbox

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
straight through this Fishman lockbox

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:24.720 
straight through this Fishman lockbox
100

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.020 

as<00:03:25.239> you<00:03:26.050> can<00:03:26.170> tell<00:03:26.440> it's<00:03:27.069> not<00:03:27.159> a<00:03:27.280> bad<00:03:27.519> sound<00:03:27.819> at

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
as you can tell it's not a bad sound at

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.970 
as you can tell it's not a bad sound at
all<00:03:28.150> but<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:28.870> does<00:03:29.019> have<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.260> very<00:03:29.500> direct

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
all but it does have a very direct

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.009 
all but it does have a very direct
quality<00:03:30.489> so<00:03:30.730> let's<00:03:30.940> see<00:03:31.180> what<00:03:31.599> it<00:03:31.690> sounds<00:03:31.840> like

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
quality so let's see what it sounds like

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.539 
quality so let's see what it sounds like
when<00:03:32.290> I<00:03:32.349> dial<00:03:32.799> in<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:32.980> little<00:03:33.280> bit<00:03:33.370> of<00:03:33.430> the

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
when I dial in a little bit of the

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.119 
when I dial in a little bit of the
microphone<00:03:34.030> modeling<00:03:34.510> I've<00:03:34.959> got<00:03:35.349> the<00:03:35.560> switch

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
microphone modeling I've got the switch

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.190 
microphone modeling I've got the switch
on<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.640> large<00:03:37.000> diaphragm<00:03:37.420> setting<00:03:37.989> right<00:03:38.140> now

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
on the large diaphragm setting right now

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.960 
on the large diaphragm setting right now
and<00:03:38.530> I'm<00:03:38.590> going<00:03:38.709> to<00:03:38.799> start<00:03:39.400> out<00:03:39.489> by<00:03:39.610> turning<00:03:39.760> it

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
and I'm going to start out by turning it

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.190 
and I'm going to start out by turning it
all<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.299> way<00:03:40.420> up<00:03:40.450> so<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:40.750> we<00:03:40.930> can<00:03:41.049> really

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
all the way up so that we can really

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.330 
all the way up so that we can really
hear<00:03:41.379> the<00:03:41.410> effect<00:03:41.830> so<00:03:42.099> one<00:03:42.280> more<00:03:42.430> time<00:03:44.250> here<00:03:45.250> it

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
hear the effect so one more time here it

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.580 
hear the effect so one more time here it
is<00:03:45.459> without<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:46.180> microphone<00:03:46.480> modeling<00:03:47.110> I'm

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
is without the microphone modeling I'm

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.289 
is without the microphone modeling I'm
going<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.400> turn<00:03:48.489> it<00:03:48.640> all<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.849> way<00:03:48.940> up<00:03:49.090> and

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
going to turn it all the way up and

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:50.940 
going to turn it all the way up and
we're<00:03:49.599> going<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.780> hear<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.049> with<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.260> large

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
we're going to hear it with the large

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:59.100 
we're going to hear it with the large
diaphragm<00:03:51.340> mic<00:03:52.180> setting

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.320 

you<00:04:00.100> can<00:04:00.220> immediately<00:04:00.670> hear<00:04:00.880> there's<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.150> lot

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
you can immediately hear there's a lot

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.080 
you can immediately hear there's a lot
more<00:04:01.480> air<00:04:01.810> it<00:04:02.110> has<00:04:02.170> kind<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.530> a<00:04:02.620> more<00:04:02.800> natural

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
more air it has kind of a more natural

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.490 
more air it has kind of a more natural
microphone<00:04:04.090> kind<00:04:04.330> of<00:04:04.420> quality<00:04:04.900> that's<00:04:05.110> added

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
microphone kind of quality that's added

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.530 
microphone kind of quality that's added
to<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.770> direct<00:04:06.070> pickup<00:04:06.460> system<00:04:07.440> if<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:08.680> switch

two other microphone settings I've got
the<00:04:38.880> blend<00:04:39.210> control<00:04:39.600> all<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:39.930> way<00:04:40.020> in<00:04:40.140> the<00:04:40.230> mic

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
the blend control all the way in the mic

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.770 
the blend control all the way in the mic
setting<00:04:41.130> right<00:04:41.280> now<00:04:41.340> this<00:04:42.060> is<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.360> small

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
setting right now this is the small

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:53.670 
setting right now this is the small
diaphragm<00:04:43.110> like

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.320 

and<00:04:54.680> now<00:04:54.860> let's<00:04:55.099> listen<00:04:55.219> to<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.639> Reuben<00:04:56.150> Mike

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
and now let's listen to the Reuben Mike

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:08.029 
and now let's listen to the Reuben Mike
simulation

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.469 

so<00:05:09.039> these<00:05:09.159> difference<00:05:09.580> might<00:05:10.090> sound<00:05:10.389> a<00:05:10.449> little

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
so these difference might sound a little

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.570 
so these difference might sound a little
bit<00:05:10.659> subtle<00:05:11.020> on<00:05:11.319> the<00:05:11.860> video<00:05:12.099> but<00:05:12.370> they<00:05:12.490> are

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
bit subtle on the video but they are

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.269 
bit subtle on the video but they are
quite<00:05:12.849> audible<00:05:13.300> here<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:13.749> on<00:05:14.229> stage<00:05:14.650> you

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:15.279 
quite audible here and on stage you

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:17.369 
quite audible here and on stage you
would<00:05:15.460> probably<00:05:15.939> experiment<00:05:16.569> with<00:05:16.779> fun<00:05:17.020> just

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:17.379 
would probably experiment with fun just

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:19.200 
would probably experiment with fun just
the<00:05:17.439> right<00:05:17.650> setting<00:05:18.099> and<00:05:18.249> just<00:05:18.279> the<00:05:18.999> right

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
the right setting and just the right

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.420 
the right setting and just the right
amount<00:05:19.629> of<00:05:19.779> blend<00:05:20.110> I<00:05:20.589> should<00:05:21.039> also<00:05:21.189> mention

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
amount of blend I should also mention

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.010 
amount of blend I should also mention
that<00:05:21.639> the<00:05:21.849> system<00:05:22.240> includes<00:05:22.689> an<00:05:22.900> automatic

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
that the system includes an automatic

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.679 
that the system includes an automatic
feedback<00:05:23.979> reduction<00:05:24.729> system<00:05:25.210> so<00:05:25.419> if<00:05:25.539> you're

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:25.689 
feedback reduction system so if you're

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:28.019 
feedback reduction system so if you're
playing<00:05:25.900> loud<00:05:26.229> on<00:05:26.499> stage<00:05:26.800> that<00:05:27.639> can<00:05:27.669> come<00:05:27.909> in

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:28.029 
playing loud on stage that can come in

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:30.869 
playing loud on stage that can come in
very<00:05:28.240> handy<00:05:28.330> to<00:05:28.839> fight<00:05:29.439> feedback<00:05:29.949> in<00:05:30.669> case

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:30.879 
very handy to fight feedback in case

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.299 
very handy to fight feedback in case
that<00:05:31.059> becomes<00:05:31.389> a<00:05:31.479> problem

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:32.309 
that becomes a problem

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:35.129 
that becomes a problem
Yamaha<00:05:33.309> also<00:05:33.669> includes<00:05:33.969> a<00:05:34.150> sound<00:05:34.659> hold<00:05:34.900> plug

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
Yamaha also includes a sound hold plug

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.390 
Yamaha also includes a sound hold plug
that<00:05:35.289> you<00:05:35.379> can<00:05:35.499> put<00:05:35.650> in<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:35.860> guitar<00:05:36.129> so<00:05:36.279> it's

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
that you can put in the guitar so it's

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.649 
that you can put in the guitar so it's
really<00:05:36.520> an<00:05:36.639> instrument<00:05:36.849> that's<00:05:37.180> very<00:05:37.509> well

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
really an instrument that's very well

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:39.709 
really an instrument that's very well
equipped<00:05:38.050> for<00:05:38.229> playing<00:05:38.439> on<00:05:38.620> loud<00:05:38.800> stages

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:39.719 
equipped for playing on loud stages

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.239 
equipped for playing on loud stages
perhaps<00:05:40.719> in<00:05:40.839> a<00:05:40.900> band<00:05:41.139> or<00:05:41.469> in<00:05:41.710> a<00:05:41.770> loud<00:05:41.919> solo

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:42.249 
perhaps in a band or in a loud solo

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:45.390 
perhaps in a band or in a loud solo
setting<00:05:42.669> so<00:05:43.629> that's<00:05:43.779> the<00:05:44.020> Yamaha<00:05:44.409> a3<00:05:44.889> R<00:05:45.039> as<00:05:45.279> you

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
setting so that's the Yamaha a3 R as you

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.309 
setting so that's the Yamaha a3 R as you
can<00:05:45.550> tell<00:05:45.699> it's<00:05:45.849> a<00:05:45.909> versatile<00:05:46.389> guitar<00:05:46.779> that

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
can tell it's a versatile guitar that

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:48.540 
can tell it's a versatile guitar that
would<00:05:47.469> work<00:05:47.650> well<00:05:47.860> a<00:05:47.889> lot<00:05:48.129> of<00:05:48.159> different

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
would work well a lot of different

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.369 
would work well a lot of different
musical<00:05:48.879> settings<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:49.569> it<00:05:49.719> doesn't<00:05:49.990> cost<00:05:50.199> a

00:05:50.369 --> 00:05:50.379
