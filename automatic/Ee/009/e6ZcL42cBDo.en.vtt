 you have not yet resolved. that is, as if 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:36.050
 of course with 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:44.200
 it's interesting to play a sentence of 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:46.329
 pockets of the latest events and 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:52.049

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.460
 serape in the sun again 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:03.590
 trained and pretty enough 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.110
 time for a decent performance 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:12.270
 how are we going to sing 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.670
 you know how to brush your pants so 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.570
 God forbid 100 will be all the guys turned out and 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.540
 everything will be our hands for the purpose of the show 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.920
 choosing and pro we coached 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.700
 not yet 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:30.510
 I know everyone and official matches probably 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.230
 besides matches which was qualifying on 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.250
 role and ride with for me personally not 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.790
 was that 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.920
 those feelings 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.940
 seriously ipad responsibility from tough 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:49.140
 composure exactly penetrate here 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.140
 I would like it to be really 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.610
 tournament what will be his 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.370
 and when i think that 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.890
 the whole team will take this show 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.330
 I show another moonite 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.420
 training sessions and in official matches and 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.950
 pool profits in principle we are so 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.660
 played decently with all teams 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.270
 new all lost here but I can say 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.910
 which at least can be concluded 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.680
 that we can win and the best teams 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.680
 such as iri games is the 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.580
 so 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.590
 I want to back here 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.340
 get dirty feel the atmosphere not 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.360
 they 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:32.620
 and show and 10 auto moscow again 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:40.980
 Here such a tour to be, or hurray so it will be 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:45.150
 aura office special plans top 223 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:49.360
 looked playing poles 8 1 grand prix 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.020
 the team itself is not bad but what the light 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.060
 sit down 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.660
 absolutely have the opportunity you look 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.860
 beat them 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.920
 what are you 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.010
 certainly interesting 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.280
 will be 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.489
 some such moments are related 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.849
 that sim card is one card game and 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.780
 it turns out generally unclear that is, I 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:15.900
 here we are not trained at all incomprehensible 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.570
 we will therefore here is interesting the truth is 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.699
 maybe with the Poles season 47 black 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.130
 orange suit 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:29.390
 so we have no experience 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.200
 these fronts here are generally long in principle 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.230
 I would say 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.230
 but 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.900
 on the laser there was no such thing 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.610
 so of course it will 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.810
 luck will be told that luck was 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.870
 how are you lucky for them worth the candle 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:51.550
 so therefore we must be lucky if 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.740
 we tense and all our fans are all people 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.350
 just support will also be tough 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.310
 with us I think 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:03.540
 and if i know 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:06.790
 since I don't support clearly 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.580
 I choose such plans 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.220
 Well, of course there is 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.660
 rachel now eat well and 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.590
 voting 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.230

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.890
 come out soup from mach 600 supra smoked 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:24.390
 on the street translate 8 number in italian 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.390

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.360
 although so that it tastes the same 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:33.680
 nice to be on and 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.680
