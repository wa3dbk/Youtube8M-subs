00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.500
 hello everyone served armed kitchen and 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.000
 for let's cook 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.949
 today I go to clemency 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.990
 she took a challenge from her friends 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.900
 a culinary challenge so let's see everything from 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:27.720
 what is it about yeah how's that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.400
 is it going my name was now ben 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.650
 that's why it's soon epiphany 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.369
 and I promised friends that I will do 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.380
 a galette of kings 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.850
 okay but I do not know at all 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.320
 all how one makes kitty kings 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.059
 frangipane stiller with the band of 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.649
 dahouët cake of the classic kings 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.540
 classic sees a stroke you go 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.280
 see if super easy we have for one 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.140
 half an hour max go go it's gone 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.610
 quickly learned puff pastry seems 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.350
 actually a star ingredient that's 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.480
 the almond powder at home 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.100
 can vary the toppings why 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.230
 not use a mixture of almond powder 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.430
 nuts or pistachios and 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.070
 will flavor it so you want to do it 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.030
 with rum is very very good then 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.230
 we do not feel the taste of alcohol 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.840
 really you have to know when 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.880
 the boiled alcohol is just the arums in 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.640
 made rum that will come out butter 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.020
 fanny sugar it's all and it's very 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.610
 simple it's a quick recipe 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.840
 we will start by preparing the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.580
 trim we will put the legs of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.049
 aside from elsewhere you can book them at 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.130
 fresh until the last moment because 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.900
 if you take out the puff pastries 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.220
 too soon they will soften with the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.630
 heat it will be difficult to spread 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.030
 so is there for the bottom trim this is 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.460
 very simple it is 125 g of sugar 125 g 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.110
 almond powder 3rd and we will do 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.750
 melt the butter as well at the microphone that you 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.780
 can mix and sugar with the 3rd and 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.540
 start beating your mix and the dr 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.740
 mixture it is well homogeneous and well 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.369
 light when you melt butter 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.079
 in the microwave 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.119
 cut them into small pieces and go for it 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.570
 gradually kind of everywhere 20 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.000
 seconds 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.790
 well, if you want it inside of me 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.149
 I mixed I add to powder 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.829
 almond 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.020
 do not hesitate to pass some 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.820
 minutes in the pan for the horrified ate 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.200
 and to bring out the aromas of 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.549
 the almond it gives even more taste to 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.259
 your cake is what you still have 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.329
 package of almond powder because in 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.979
 principle is good 150 g 1 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.210
 it's just 25 grams more but 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.829
 this is going to give a little more 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.960
 consistency to the dough and we will 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.429
 also add the vanilla seeds and 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.239
 naughty this mud this 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.980
 super not add a dress in general 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.049
 I put a plug this is very good 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.340
 leaves a slightly separating being yes 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.170
 it makes me think why not use 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.489
 grated coconut note also to make 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.530
 a cake of kings to ours coconut 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.139
 with rum and vanilla alike huh 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.849
 it's a little bit like Samoa 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:29.310
 we will begin to spread the legs 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.349
 so the frangipane we will preheat the 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.069
 oven at 200 ° she will cook exactly 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.060
 thirty minutes 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.010
 so when you will start to 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.480
 spread the cream on your dough 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.939
 puffed especially wanted it's a good 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.639
 centimeter at the edge of all sides 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.329
 to be able to welded the two of them 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.590
 puff pastry 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.549
 if you can run it in the middle 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.579
 then we are on the hour after 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:54.120
 edges it's going to be good there I think perfect 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:56.370
 we will cover is the edge 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.810
 these two make the most of it and with your 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.319
 just fingers you'll come to press 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.489
 for to solder the two parts you 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.200
 cut small strips to be well 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.840
 China and after you can come do 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.389
 patterns on it so for example we 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.909
 could try to venture to write 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:14.879
 the name of our favorite channel we are going 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.560
 gilded our galette des rois with a 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.720
 egg yolk and a small spoon to 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.280
 milk soup for example 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.989
 so your egg yolk a little bit of 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.269
 here you go with your little brush 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:32.069

 for a half-hour at 180 degrees 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.989
 and we will not find ourselves for the 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.459
 result we will see how 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.569
 unraveled knowing that our oven does 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.099
 cook and that from the top it is 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.500
