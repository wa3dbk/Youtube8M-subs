00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:08.189
 Yes, I do sometimes brake I 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:17.080
 It was or thought everyone 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:17.990
 It is commemorative to commemorate the breakthrough of the summer vacation tuberculosis and the number of registered subscribers over 5,000. 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:25.189
 Yeah 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:27.000
 The second audience participation type gta I think that I want to do the water like an exchange meeting of online 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.230
 I will 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.030
 And this time 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.030
 Do 2 days with both bsd pso 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.539
 Along with the participation 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:51.659
 I think that I want to explain some point 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:59.680
 First of all, ps 3 is from 1 pm on Tuesday, August 11th of August 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:01:05.150
 aps bar performs from 1:00 pm on Wednesday, August 12 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:08.050
 The end time is determined by the progress at that time 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:13.700
 It is participation condition, but 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:18.680
 Friends and me because I get together in a friend limited session 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:21.680
 People who are not friends yet up to 22 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:28.220
 fn please apply 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:30.080
 Well, it is better to subscribe to my channel as possible because it is participatory to the audience 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.450
 Ne 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.909
 So take a second video 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:44.400
 If id is good to move to video 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:48.510
 It is better to find a three-normal rough c 8 a bar not 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:54.700
 Participation conditions are these three 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:56.790
 It is not a difficult condition, so basically anyone can participate 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.590
 The problem is from here 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:07.280
 But what you, but I think that of course if those who are doing g companies 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.950
 The maximum number of sessions for ap 3 is 16 2 p 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:15.280
 The number of small people is a 30 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.550
 Currently the number of people in my year is 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.990
 I am at 1515 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:28.780
 I do not think such a thing , but the white year is the day 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:31.280
 In the case also amazing than you limited number of members to put in session Ritz is scheduled to participate in all 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:36.620
 It is expected to be 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.990
 So I painted exactly 1:00 pm to be able to participate fairly 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.409
 Once 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:49.180
 I start to make a friend limited session 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:53.230
 Please come in a limited session not touch freely the words that Mr. was from after not 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:58.030
 If I try to enter the session immediately because it is 1 o'clock 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:01.800
 Because you may not be able to load it during loading 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:06.760
 It may be better to enter after a while 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:15.030
 Well, it depends on your luck or scenery 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:15.030
 Even if you can not join at one time , remake a friend tax reduction session every time the job end 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:25.260
 next 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:29.230
 Since it is the job every time you start the job from making every time friend Genji session 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:35.450
 Well at that time you can join in the middle again 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:43.170
 It is also possible for someone to go out and join the vacant frame to participate 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:44.680
 Because absolutely I do not want to know anything from treatment or that person's priority from me absolutely 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.480
 That side is 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:55.209
 Don't worry, it's okay everyone's going into fairness 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:57.830
 Although it is how to enter a friend limited session after , I think that there are many people who know it 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.130
 In fact this is 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.540
 Display the monitor screen 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.540

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:12.760
 Previous 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:14.700

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.549

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.849

 That's an aside 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:29.810
 Before that, this again 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:32.400

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:37.889
