seven<00:01:06.909> thousand<00:01:07.360> copies<00:01:07.570> of<00:01:07.930> this<00:01:08.080> card<00:01:08.350> out

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
seven thousand copies of this card out

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.130 
seven thousand copies of this card out
there<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.310> limited<00:01:09.700> print<00:01:09.909> of<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.150> only<00:01:10.360> 7000

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
there the limited print of the only 7000

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.060 
there the limited print of the only 7000
that<00:01:11.590> seems<00:01:11.890> like<00:01:12.189> a<00:01:12.219> lot<00:01:12.609> I<00:01:16.679> had<00:01:17.679> that<00:01:17.890> there

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
that seems like a lot I had that there

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.099 
that seems like a lot I had that there
are<00:01:18.159> only<00:01:18.249> 150<00:01:18.939> in<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.240> world<00:01:19.420> so<00:01:19.600> it<00:01:19.719> makes<00:01:19.929> me

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:20.109 
are only 150 in the world so it makes me

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:22.080 
are only 150 in the world so it makes me
like<00:01:20.289> it<00:01:20.530> is<00:01:20.590> rare<00:01:21.159> but<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.520> reason<00:01:21.789> why<00:01:21.909> it's

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
like it is rare but the reason why it's

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.090 
like it is rare but the reason why it's
so<00:01:22.210> rare<00:01:22.450> is<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:23.109> timeframe<00:01:23.380> of<00:01:23.649> when<00:01:23.799> it<00:01:24.009> was

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
so rare is the timeframe of when it was

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.510 
so rare is the timeframe of when it was
given<00:01:24.369> out<00:01:24.490> it<00:01:25.149> was<00:01:25.329> given<00:01:25.630> out<00:01:25.749> in<00:01:26.009> 1999<00:01:27.009> in

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
given out it was given out in 1999 in

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.749 
given out it was given out in 1999 in
Japan<00:01:28.240> only<00:01:28.479> so<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.679> only<00:01:29.859> situation<00:01:30.460> so<00:01:30.609> it's

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
Japan only so the only situation so it's

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.520 
Japan only so the only situation so it's
like<00:01:30.880> it<00:01:30.999> was<00:01:31.149> only<00:01:31.270> distributed<00:01:31.990> there<00:01:32.229> and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
like it was only distributed there and

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.660 
like it was only distributed there and
