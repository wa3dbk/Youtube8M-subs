00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.149
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.850
 marakasi 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.480
 This is a rubric review mods for the game world 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.450
 of tanks 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.280
 in this section I show you a few 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.889
 mods which of course you can 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.029
 easy to download by reference in the description for 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:21.000
 youtube and so this is our 10th anniversary 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.550
 release and in this release would like 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.689
 show you very interesting fashions 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.250
 which will be useful to any tank driver 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:33.510
 the first mod will be especially useful 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.030
 newcomers to those players who are not quite 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.600
 still understand the mechanics of the game that have not yet 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.210
 understand how to act skills with 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.050
 This mod you can see the detailed 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.690
 information information for each skill 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.680
 and skill in the game so you just 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.010
 point and see how each acts 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.510
 skill here is also written tips like 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.489
 better to use this or that perk 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.350
 very useful information 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:11.250
 in principle, I myself even have something for myself 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.979
 here I found, of course, for experienced players 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.490
 who have long been in the game it's all already 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:22.740
 known long ago but for beginners 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.979
 there will be valuable information and that's basically 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.470
 very nice also wanted to note that with 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.380
 this mod you can see the detailed 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.560
 information on each type of the shells 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.570
 there you are pointing at a shell and see how 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.509
 he acts 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.229
 what he has pros and cons are very 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.509
 useful information for beginners and 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.119
 players who are not well versed in 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.640
 piles of shells for me personally this 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.540
 the information was also helpful because 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.630
 I personally did not know everything about the types of shells 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.130
 for example, I did not know what the maximum 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:06.350
 damage and armor-piercing more than that 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:10.560
 sub-caliber mod is extremely useful and 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.490
 if you just want to know about types 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.350
 shells 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:20.490
 and skills calmly swing and 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.770
 Enjoy the next mod done by yourself 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.790
 developers on the first of April 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:30.230
 you were such a joke on him later 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.640
 removed but this mod can be downloaded again and 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.460
 put it right now just you 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.430
 see when you destroy 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.650
 an enemy tank then there is such a soul 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.320
 Tank can choose there three options 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.920
 just dunk 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:50.430
 will dress such a departing or helicopter 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.520
 principle looks funny well of course 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.010
 maybe someone won't like it but I 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:01.510
 seems pretty cool 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.340
 and the truth is always visible this effect is sometimes 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.489
 at long range for some reason he 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.579
 disappear or just not noticeable in battle 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.140
 he does not distract 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.120
 next mod adds new damage 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.400
 panel that shows how much you 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.040
 strengths taken off in hit points and in 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.670
 percent and also this mod adds 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.049
 new dashboard and equipment and crews and 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.129
 new panel 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.700
 shells also you can see that 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:32.920
 strength bar transferred to the center 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.950
 Of course for oldfagov this could be 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.209
 a little uncomfortable and personal 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.989
 I will get used to it the same way if you press 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:49.780
 control it is possible to fix such Huslia 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:51.430
 clicking on the screen is very convenient and so 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.909
 if you can press 50 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:58.599
 card transfer to the center is very 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:04.590
 interesting mod that not only climb 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.590
 but also quite beautiful 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.450
 the next could have many asked me this 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.610
 famous mod which is probably familiar 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.120
 many players this mod adds 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.340
 the message that the enemy is detected when 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.310
 that message is pronounced pretty 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.280
 loud frankly too loud 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.950
 also this mod adds a bell 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.760
 covering up the enemy's modules for example you 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.290
 broke the cannon to the enemy and reproduced 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.870
 characteristic of winter 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.020
 which immediately makes it clear that something 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.479
 broke the enemy 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.810
 The fact is that this mod is installed 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.370
 not quite according to the standard need 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.800
 set it to her specifically to 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.350
 you are not confused now show how it 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.850
 our channel 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.389
 so showing how to install 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.650
 This mod go to the res-mods folder then 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.940
 084 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:06.040
 and here you need to copy the audio folder 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.900
 from the archive from the mod then come back 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.520
 back open the res folder 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:19.360
 and we need to open the folder again now 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:20.229
 084 and from the res folder we copy the folder 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.789
 audio 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:31.330
 in folder 084 I hope you understand just 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:35.860
 replace all but two rivers of files from 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:41.590
 fashion here they are not replaceable and now 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:45.520
 we in the game have all the sounds and sounds of it 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.660
 fashion that is bell cover and the enemy 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.690
 detected 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.960
 otherwise I do not know how to do 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:55.490
 maybe there are some other options 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.620
 The following small mod adds to 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.410
 hangar new sad music which 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.790
 will play before the fight 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.950
 principle, this could not do anything 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:07.280
 but it is possible to someone he and 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:09.770
 useful worth noting that 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.340
 install this sound mod worth 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:15.320
 same as previous next mod 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.740
 adds sound sos when you have 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.620
 triggered sciences sixth sense until you 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:25.220
 In the light of this sound further 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:29.000
 reproduced when you disappear for 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.700
 the light and sound ceases at the end here 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.560
 so here to paw 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:40.600
 Of course the mod is basically useful but personally 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.600
 this sound annoys me a little 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.280
 the next mod is small it is only 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:49.490
 changes some standard icons you 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:52.610
 you see that now medium tanks are highlighted 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:56.630
 in yellow light and green tanks 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:07:00.500
 there is also a tank level and name 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:02.120
 in principle, the change in a bit but it and 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.100
 better because standard icons 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:10.250
 i like the mod the most 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:12.350
 not bad last mod which was 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:16.669
 made by the developers on the first 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:20.930
 April change all the signs in the game here 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:24.500
 such are the signs with deer very much 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.900
 funny sign that warns you 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:31.440
 what can ahead 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:35.039
 deer and that's it thanks for watching 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:39.930
 I hope you enjoy this water 

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:39.930
 good battle plan and friends for now
