00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.189
 farmer practice test 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.170
 more than 20 models two 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.660
 trim levels three different 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.360
 Wheelbases normal and compact 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.190
 four and six-cylinder engines five 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.340
 various transmission variants a 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.970
 huge performance range from 90 to 255 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.830
 ps and of course made in germany the 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.570
 Series 6 tractors by John Deere 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.699
 leave hardly wishes open 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.260
 It does not surprise that they too 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.650
 belong to the most popular of their class 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.650
 at the end of 2014 , there was the last big update 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.309
 we have the current top model the 6 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.379
 He felt on his toes 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:56.940
 our test candidate belongs to the big 6s 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.070
 series from 175 ps forms the backbone 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.110
 a stable steel frame at almost 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.180
 the same dimensions are the tractors 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.140
 something stronger and heavier 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.299
 our well equipped 6 215 r brought 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.369
 good 89 tons on the scales 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.260
 john deere also has the permissible 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.710
 total weight after laid so that 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.360
 still high payloads are possible 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.490
 under the big bonnet works one 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.600
 modern six-cylinder engine from 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.240
 john deere will be converted from 6 to 8 liters 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.490
 215 ps mobilizes the chest is included 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.620
 it takes another 40 ps 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.690
 in practice and at the test bench 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.790
 convinced the engine with very good 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.650
 Performance is consumed by the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.260
 spritzigkeit when our test drivers 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.090
 excited next to a diesel 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.070
 oxidation catalyst and a 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.200
 particle filter already uses the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.090
 now also the scr technique 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.070
 only then could the manufacturer the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.170
 strict exhaust gas regulations of the stage 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.640
 keep four 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.810
 He also leaves six with the lifting power 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.150
 do not burn anything 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.190
 the hack force lift is consistent throughout 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.630
 six tons high up front, it is scarce 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.820
 3.2 tons 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.560
 the driver now looks much better 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.530
 on the cultivation points 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.450
 the maximum six rear-mounted control units are 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.760
 wandered closer to the cabin 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.130
 Practical detail of the spring force 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.950
 held upper handlebars are easy 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.180
 disengage from the seat when the gear has 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.250
 the agony of choice 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.099
 john offers five different variants 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.380
 deere on of the simple power quad plus 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.930
 to the stepless car manufacturer 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.599
 our test candidate indeed with the new 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.430
 direct drive on the way 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.349
 double clutch transmission with 100 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.870
 mechanical power transmission 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.700
 the three groups and eight courses are good 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.890
 they match each other 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.780
 simply by keystroke and with the 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.060
 manually change the small shift lever 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.190
 press the rocker switch to the right 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.530
 The gears are changed automatically 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.690
 the maximum driving speed provides 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.750
 with the little advice on the shift lever 1 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.650
 numerous presets and 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.049
 automatic functions boost that 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.310
 still comfortable to the 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.950
 possibilities of a stepless 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.280
 gearbox does not come the direct drive 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.780
 very close 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.220
 in the cabin you will find the new one 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.220
 Armrest with a programmable 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.290
 joystick and the command center display 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.959
 It corresponds to the Berlin concept of 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.880
 larger series of 7 and 8 r 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.890
 The terminal can be like a 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.020
 using a smartphone or a tablet 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.610
 With the buttons you can quickly on 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.950
 Access important functions 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.540
 who intensively with the operation 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.610
 busy learns the many 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.080
 possibilities soon and can appreciate 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.390
 to make the job easier 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.489
 The new seat has a big twist 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.650
 area swings the complete armrest 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.840
 with just as the dashboard on the 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.010
 Steering column in the cabin, there are many 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.590
 practical shelves 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.019
 the space is good the noise level 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.000
 pleasantly low a comfortable one 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.220
 passenger seat and electrically adjustable 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.709
 and heated wide-angle mirrors 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.900
 complete the good overall impression 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.660
 the high level of comfort is ensured by the 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.550
 sprung cab and the 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.370
 hydropneumatic tls plus front axle 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.430
 suspension in our test has become the 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.319
 john deere 6 215 r no bigger ones 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.000
 Weakened neither at the test bench 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.610
 still in practical use 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.950
 he scores with top motor become one 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.660
 Good transmission upgrade with high reputation 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.180
 forces and a modern operation 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.130
 concept the german quality standard 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.530
 can John Deere but pay well 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.039
 our well-equipped test machine 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.210
 should be more than 200 37,000 euros included 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.840
 VAT costs 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.430
 the entry price is close 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.560
 183,000 euros 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.420
