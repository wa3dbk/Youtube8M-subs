 Hello friends! 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:13.130
 My name is Sandra Fayad, I have a website: www.sandrafayad.prosaeverso.net. 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:23.120
 I am here at this moment, showing you a plant whose fruit is known 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.680
 like Melon of SÃ£o Caetano. 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:36.640
 This plant was trrazida by the escrvos for the region of Mariana, in Minas Gerais 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:45.010
 and then spread throughout the country.This fruit is considered miraculous. 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:56.860
 It has numerous medicinal applications and is also edible and used in cooking. 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:04.780
 I would like you to see the size of this fruit, because the information that comes to me 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:14.500
 about him is that he fights malaria and that cultivated in the north of the country he is well 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.349
