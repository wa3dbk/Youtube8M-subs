00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.120
 well here we are counting 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.780
 things that you ask us today we come to talk 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.690
 of the brand cam is an Italian brand in 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.210
 concrete is a brand takes a lot 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.570
 years working and manufacturing hardware 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.750
 for the mountaineering of come to present 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:35.000
 the minimum 2 super light is a store 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.530
 that its great peculiarity is its little 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.170
 we are talking about a store a 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.969
 kilo 300 and few grams we are talking 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.339
 which is also a two-seater store 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.219
 which thing turns it into a store 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.980
 frankly light that we can more 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.559
 tell about this store because we can 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.239
 tell you that your packaging is very very 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.149
 compressed and that is very easy to 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.429
 store in our backpack more 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.739
 details the inside part of this 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:03.499
 store this store mounts the part 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.320
 inside a mesh a mesh that goes 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:09.920
 to preserve that will protect us from the 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.049
 insects the truth is that in summer 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.659
 it's frankly interesting since 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.400
 these are stores that you're basically going to 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.490
 be forced to use them in summer 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.330
 since in winter it is such a store 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.710
 only of three stations and that if there 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.229
 precipitation in snow with certain 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.210
 volume one would say and we would break 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.289
 it is also true that it is not intended 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.420
 to support 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.219
 strong winds im not talk about a 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.340
 expedition store but if we talk about 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:41.140
 a good trekking shop both 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.960
 interior squares are two squares a 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.469
 little bit fair but they allow us to spend 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.990
 The night with all guarantees are also 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:52.640
 stores with an impermeability index 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.159
 very very good 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.800
 it must be taken into account that the indices 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:01.070
 of impermeability in stores are 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.740
 indexes that do not need to be counted 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.880
 with columns of water so high that they do not 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.890
 pressures are generated on the awnings 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.650
 what else to tell you comes with your game 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.720
 labels made also in aluminum their 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.950
 Rods are obviously made in 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:23.120
 aluminum and the price-quality ratio is 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.690
 exceptional little thing more minimum 2 super 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.780
 light one kilo 350 grams affordable to 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.320
 level that any good amateur 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.130
 have the money to invest 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.519
 a gem like this it has heard 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.519
 see you
