touchgrind skate which was released
quite<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> few<00:00:19.590> years<00:00:19.710> ago<00:00:19.890> about<00:00:20.070> five<00:00:20.400> years

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
quite a few years ago about five years

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.609 
quite a few years ago about five years
ago<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:22.519> what<00:00:23.519> we<00:00:23.730> have<00:00:24.000> now<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:25.080> much<00:00:25.410> more

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
ago and what we have now is a much more

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.490 
ago and what we have now is a much more
mature<00:00:25.830> game<00:00:26.460> even<00:00:27.449> though<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:28.170> going<00:00:28.439> to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
mature game even though it's going to

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.439 
mature game even though it's going to
look<00:00:28.920> similar<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.609> some<00:00:29.820> ways<00:00:29.880> it's

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
look similar in some ways it's

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.639 
look similar in some ways it's
definitely<00:00:31.189> way<00:00:32.189> improved<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.120> has<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:34.469> much

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
definitely way improved and has so much

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.340 
definitely way improved and has so much
more<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.030> see<00:00:36.239> one<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
more going on so you can see one of the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.520 
more going on so you can see one of the
things<00:00:37.530> about<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:39.290> takes<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.410> little

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
things about this is that takes a little

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.200 
things about this is that takes a little
time<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.010> get<00:00:41.100> used<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.550> controls<00:00:42.680> and<00:00:44.090> even<00:00:45.090> if

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
time to get used to controls and even if

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.799 
time to get used to controls and even if
you<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.510> learn<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.170> basic<00:00:46.590> moves<00:00:47.809> you're

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
you can learn the basic moves you're

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.209 
you can learn the basic moves you're
still<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.440> take<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> long<00:00:49.890> time<00:00:50.160> to

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
still going to take a long time to

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.310 
still going to take a long time to
master<00:00:50.910> some<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.270> them<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.570> because<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
master some of them just because of the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.810 
master some of them just because of the
way<00:00:52.410> you're<00:00:52.980> using<00:00:53.190> your<00:00:53.430> fingers<00:00:53.789> and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
way you're using your fingers and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.220 
way you're using your fingers and
non-traditional<00:00:54.539> ways<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.699> essential

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
non-traditional ways so the essential

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.209 
non-traditional ways so the essential
thing<00:00:58.230> that's<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.160> that

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
thing that's going on here is that

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.770 
thing that's going on here is that
you're<00:00:59.370> holding<00:00:59.489> two<00:00:59.940> fingers<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
you're holding two fingers on the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.840 
you're holding two fingers on the
skateboard<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.530> when<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.280> hold<00:01:02.579> them<00:01:02.699> on

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
skateboard and when you hold them on

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.109 
skateboard and when you hold them on
there<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.210> goes<00:01:03.390> forward<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.080> then<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.850> have

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
there it goes forward and then you have

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.780 
there it goes forward and then you have
a<00:01:06.150> series<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.780> options<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.560> lift<00:01:07.950> off<00:01:08.159> one

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
a series of options to lift off one

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.969 
a series of options to lift off one
finger<00:01:09.210> or<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.479> other<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.960> as<00:01:10.500> you're<00:01:10.740> doing

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
finger or the other and as you're doing

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.060 
finger or the other and as you're doing
so<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.400> swipe<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.080> get<00:01:13.260> spins<00:01:13.710> as

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
so you can swipe and so you get spins as

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.980 
so you can swipe and so you get spins as
you<00:01:14.189> swipe<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.000> flip<00:01:15.299> them<00:01:15.479> around<00:01:15.540> and

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
you swipe and you flip them around and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.410 
you swipe and you flip them around and
as<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.340> do<00:01:17.460> all<00:01:17.670> these<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.060> things<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.360> that

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
as you do all these and things like that

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.640 
as you do all these and things like that
it's<00:01:18.780> because<00:01:19.049> you're<00:01:19.140> lifting<00:01:19.380> off<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
it's because you're lifting off the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.520 
it's because you're lifting off the
first<00:01:20.189> front<00:01:21.150> finger<00:01:21.540> first<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
first front finger first and then the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.660 
first front finger first and then the
other<00:01:23.040> finger<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.920> takes<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.310> little<00:01:26.430> time

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
other finger so it takes a little time

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.179 
other finger so it takes a little time
to<00:01:26.750> really<00:01:27.750> master<00:01:28.140> those<00:01:28.470> moves<00:01:28.860> now<00:01:29.009> they<00:01:29.130> do

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
to really master those moves now they do

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.770 
to really master those moves now they do
have<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> set<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.939> comprehensive<00:01:30.630> tutorial

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780

some of those it's still like okay let

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.590 
some of those it's still like okay let
me<00:01:37.710> think<00:01:37.860> about<00:01:37.979> what<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.759> have<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.030> do<00:01:39.210> here

me think about what I have to do here

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.600 
me think about what I have to do here
and<00:01:39.780> then<00:01:40.290> your<00:01:40.439> word<00:01:40.619> with<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.770> timing<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.430> it

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
and then your word with the timing of it

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.690 
and then your word with the timing of it
and<00:01:42.170> some<00:01:43.170> things<00:01:43.409> are<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.680> lot<00:01:44.159> more<00:01:44.189> easier

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
and some things are a lot more easier

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.859 
and some things are a lot more easier
now<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.420> doing<00:01:45.689> basic<00:01:46.280> jumps<00:01:47.509> those<00:01:48.509> type<00:01:48.840> of

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
now just doing basic jumps those type of

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.359 
now just doing basic jumps those type of
things<00:01:48.990> are<00:01:49.290> actually<00:01:49.649> some<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.189> more

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
things are actually some of the more

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.590 
things are actually some of the more
easier<00:01:50.820> tasks<00:01:51.680> but<00:01:53.090> doing<00:01:54.090> some<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.420> other

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
easier tasks but doing some of the other

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.670 
easier tasks but doing some of the other
things<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:55.969> doing<00:01:56.969> grinds<00:01:57.540> going<00:01:58.439> on<00:01:58.560> to

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
things like doing grinds going on to

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.889 
things like doing grinds going on to
rails<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.340> type<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.700> stuff<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.509> getting

exterior area as well the gameplay is

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.870 
exterior area as well the gameplay is
totally<00:02:38.380> smooth<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:39.160> was<00:02:39.610> really<00:02:39.730> impressed

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
totally smooth I was really impressed

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.759 
totally smooth I was really impressed
with<00:02:40.239> that<00:02:40.360> one<00:02:40.930> thing<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.500> thought

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
with that one thing that I thought

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.770 
with that one thing that I thought
actually<00:02:42.150> just<00:02:43.150> thinking<00:02:43.239> about<00:02:43.450> this<00:02:43.630> right

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
actually just thinking about this right

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.050 
actually just thinking about this right
now<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.500> sound<00:02:44.800> is<00:02:45.100> not<00:02:45.459> as<00:02:45.670> good<00:02:45.940> as

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
now is that the sound is not as good as

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
now is that the sound is not as good as
I<00:02:46.150> wished<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:46.569> was<00:02:47.220> some<00:02:48.220> of<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.750> sound<00:02:49.750> of<00:02:49.989> the

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
I wished it was some of the sound of the

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.289 
I wished it was some of the sound of the
skateboard<00:02:50.590> on<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:51.280> different<00:02:51.610> surfaces<00:02:52.090> are

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
skateboard on the different surfaces are

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.330 
skateboard on the different surfaces are
pretty<00:02:52.540> generic<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.830> you<00:02:53.920> can<00:02:54.069> tell<00:02:54.310> that

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
pretty generic and you can tell that

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.009 
pretty generic and you can tell that
they're<00:02:54.610> doing<00:02:54.730> one<00:02:55.030> sound<00:02:55.450> at<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.690> time<00:02:55.989> a

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
they're doing one sound at the time a

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.900 
they're doing one sound at the time a
lot<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.319> times<00:02:56.620> you'll<00:02:56.799> hear<00:02:57.040> like<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.700> wheel

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
lot of times you'll hear like the wheel

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.150 
lot of times you'll hear like the wheel
sound<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.569> then<00:02:59.200> you'll<00:02:59.380> hear<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.650> grounds<00:02:59.980> a

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
sound and then you'll hear it grounds a

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.430 
sound and then you'll hear it grounds a
grind<00:03:00.819> sound<00:03:01.209> where<00:03:01.750> you'll<00:03:01.930> hear<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:02.110> jump

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
grind sound where you'll hear a jump

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.050 
grind sound where you'll hear a jump
sound<00:03:02.620> or<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:02.890> hit<00:03:03.069> sound<00:03:03.340> but<00:03:03.549> it's<00:03:03.819> like

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
sound or a hit sound but it's like

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.150 
sound or a hit sound but it's like
there's<00:03:04.630> not<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:04.870> lot<00:03:05.080> of<00:03:05.110> overlap<00:03:05.680> here<00:03:05.709> not<00:03:06.130> a

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
there's not a lot of overlap here not a

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.449 
there's not a lot of overlap here not a
lot<00:03:06.340> of<00:03:06.430> things<00:03:06.610> going<00:03:06.700> on<00:03:06.970> simultaneously<00:03:08.459> so

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
lot of things going on simultaneously so

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.699 
lot of things going on simultaneously so
the<00:03:09.640> sound<00:03:09.880> is<00:03:10.090> one<00:03:10.299> thing<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.660> wish<00:03:11.470> was<00:03:11.680> a

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
the sound is one thing that I wish was a

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.280 
the sound is one thing that I wish was a
little<00:03:11.980> better<00:03:12.190> but<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.269> actual<00:03:13.569> physics<00:03:14.110> and

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
little better but the actual physics and

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.050 
little better but the actual physics and
the<00:03:14.350> gameplay<00:03:14.860> are<00:03:15.100> really<00:03:15.519> cool<00:03:15.820> and<00:03:16.560> as

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
the gameplay are really cool and as

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.520 
the gameplay are really cool and as
you're<00:03:19.060> going<00:03:19.209> through<00:03:19.359> this<00:03:19.630> world<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:20.350> mean

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
you're going through this world I mean

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.289 
you're going through this world I mean
I'm<00:03:21.040> really<00:03:21.370> thinking<00:03:21.459> about<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.820> tricks<00:03:22.120> I'm

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
I'm really thinking about the tricks I'm

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.720 
I'm really thinking about the tricks I'm
not<00:03:22.420> thinking<00:03:22.810> about<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.829> interface<00:03:24.340> and

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
not thinking about the interface and

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.729 
not thinking about the interface and
what's<00:03:25.390> going<00:03:25.690> on<00:03:25.840> i'm<00:03:26.049> thinking<00:03:26.350> like<00:03:26.380> it

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
what's going on i'm thinking like it

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.530 
what's going on i'm thinking like it
would<00:03:26.980> what<00:03:27.250> finger<00:03:27.459> dining<00:03:27.850> move<00:03:28.000> where<00:03:28.269> and

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
would what finger dining move where and

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.199 
would what finger dining move where and
how's<00:03:29.140> that<00:03:29.170> going<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.620> work<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:30.130> so<00:03:30.880> that's

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
how's that going to work and so that's

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.479 
how's that going to work and so that's
where<00:03:31.630> a<00:03:31.959> lot<00:03:32.230> of<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.560> beauty<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.040> this<00:03:33.130> comes

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
where a lot of the beauty of this comes

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.080 
where a lot of the beauty of this comes
in<00:03:33.730> i<00:03:35.850> will<00:03:36.850> say<00:03:37.120> this<00:03:37.299> was<00:03:37.480> totally<00:03:37.810> addictive

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
in i will say this was totally addictive

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.069 
in i will say this was totally addictive
meaning<00:03:40.090> that<00:03:40.239> as<00:03:40.390> soon<00:03:40.540> as<00:03:40.660> i<00:03:40.750> started

playing it and i played previous

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.640 
playing it and i played previous
versions<00:03:43.120> i<00:03:43.209> haven't<00:03:43.510> had<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.140> original<00:03:44.230> one

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.810 
definitely got it but I saw this came
out<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.150> had<00:03:49.359> to<00:03:49.450> see<00:03:50.160> exactly<00:03:51.160> what<00:03:51.519> was<00:03:51.549> new

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
out I had to see exactly what was new

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.080 
out I had to see exactly what was new
and<00:03:51.880> improved<00:03:52.329> and<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:53.680> can<00:03:53.859> see<00:03:54.160> a<00:03:54.430> lot<00:03:55.060> of

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
and improved and you can see a lot of

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.620 
and improved and you can see a lot of
things<00:03:55.480> I'm<00:03:55.630> trying<00:03:55.660> here<00:03:56.260> end<00:03:56.500> up<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:56.890> fails

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
things I'm trying here end up and fails

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.380 
things I'm trying here end up and fails
but<00:03:59.250> there's<00:04:00.250> still<00:04:00.430> quite<00:04:00.850> a<00:04:00.910> bit<00:04:01.000> of<00:04:01.209> things

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
but there's still quite a bit of things

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.970 
but there's still quite a bit of things
that<00:04:01.600> are<00:04:01.750> successes<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:02.470> think<00:04:02.650> it'll<00:04:02.799> get

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
that are successes I think it'll get

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.670 
that are successes I think it'll get
better<00:04:03.130> now<00:04:04.000> especially<00:04:04.299> in<00:04:04.840> some<00:04:05.470> of<00:04:05.500> these

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
better now especially in some of these

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.009 
better now especially in some of these
pools<00:04:06.069> like<00:04:06.340> this<00:04:06.609> you<00:04:07.329> have<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.630> really

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
pools like this you have to really

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.660 
pools like this you have to really
quickly<00:04:08.260> switch<00:04:08.799> your<00:04:09.010> perspective<00:04:09.549> it

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
quickly switch your perspective it

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.210 
quickly switch your perspective it
doesn't<00:04:09.700> automatically<00:04:10.450> always<00:04:10.840> switch<00:04:11.019> your

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
doesn't automatically always switch your

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.830 
doesn't automatically always switch your
perspective<00:04:12.220> it'll<00:04:12.459> go<00:04:12.609> backwards<00:04:13.150> and

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
perspective it'll go backwards and

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.360 
perspective it'll go backwards and
you're<00:04:13.930> going<00:04:14.049> to<00:04:14.139> do<00:04:14.230> like<00:04:14.380> a<00:04:14.410> full<00:04:14.739> swipe<00:04:15.160> to

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
you're going to do like a full swipe to

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.360 
you're going to do like a full swipe to
side<00:04:15.579> to<00:04:15.730> side<00:04:15.910> to<00:04:16.120> switch<00:04:16.389> that<00:04:17.250> probably<00:04:18.250> in

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
side to side to switch that probably in

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.000 
side to side to switch that probably in
the<00:04:18.459> habit<00:04:18.760> of<00:04:18.789> that<00:04:18.910> pretty<00:04:19.180> quick<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:20.799> see

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
the habit of that pretty quick you see

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.010 
the habit of that pretty quick you see
every<00:04:21.310> time<00:04:21.340> it<00:04:21.760> does<00:04:21.789> that<00:04:22.240> full<00:04:22.479> switch<00:04:22.780> it's

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
every time it does that full switch it's

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.410 
every time it does that full switch it's
me<00:04:23.200> swiping

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
me swiping

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.450 
me swiping
okay<00:04:24.870> now<00:04:25.380> here's<00:04:25.740> another<00:04:25.950> thing<00:04:26.190> I<00:04:26.310> had<00:04:26.430> a

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
okay now here's another thing I had a

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.820 
okay now here's another thing I had a
hard<00:04:26.730> time<00:04:26.900> when<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:27.930> got<00:04:28.110> in<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.260> corners<00:04:28.680> like

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
hard time when I got in the corners like

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.940 
hard time when I got in the corners like
this<00:04:28.970> to<00:04:29.970> get<00:04:30.150> out<00:04:30.390> of<00:04:30.420> them<00:04:30.690> so<00:04:31.650> that<00:04:31.830> was

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
this to get out of them so that was

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.100 
this to get out of them so that was
something<00:04:32.040> else<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.430> was<00:04:32.640> a<00:04:32.670> little<00:04:32.790> bit

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
something else that was a little bit

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.930 
something else that was a little bit
interesting<00:04:34.110> but<00:04:34.290> he'll<00:04:35.040> manage<00:04:35.520> as<00:04:35.700> well

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
interesting but he'll manage as well

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.310 
interesting but he'll manage as well
just<00:04:36.750> takes<00:04:36.990> a<00:04:37.050> little<00:04:37.140> getting<00:04:37.230> used<00:04:37.650> to

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
just takes a little getting used to

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.780 
just takes a little getting used to
flying<00:04:40.320> around<00:04:42.650> do<00:04:43.650> some<00:04:43.680> cool<00:04:44.160> around<00:04:44.670> the

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
flying around do some cool around the

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.490 
flying around do some cool around the
edges<00:04:44.970> there's<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.450> little<00:04:45.750> bit<00:04:45.900> of<00:04:45.960> almost<00:04:46.320> a

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
edges there's a little bit of almost a

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.330 
edges there's a little bit of almost a
crime<00:04:48.890> and<00:04:50.510> then<00:04:51.590> flipping<00:04:52.590> around<00:04:52.770> jumping

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
crime and then flipping around jumping

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.600 
crime and then flipping around jumping
back<00:04:53.550> in<00:04:57.440> this<00:04:58.440> is<00:04:58.620> a<00:04:58.680> really<00:04:58.890> cool<00:04:59.040> area<00:04:59.400> see

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
back in this is a really cool area see

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.490 
back in this is a really cool area see
you<00:05:00.180> have<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.420> flip<00:05:00.660> around<00:05:00.780> otherwise<00:05:01.170> you'll

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
you have to flip around otherwise you'll

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.660 
you have to flip around otherwise you'll
do<00:05:01.650> that<00:05:01.890> where<00:05:02.100> it<00:05:02.160> just<00:05:02.310> goes<00:05:02.460> right

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
do that where it just goes right

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.820 
do that where it just goes right
backwards<00:05:05.360> but<00:05:06.360> sometimes<00:05:06.900> you'll<00:05:07.110> see<00:05:07.320> how<00:05:07.560> I

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
backwards but sometimes you'll see how I

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.660 
backwards but sometimes you'll see how I
flipped<00:05:08.550> out<00:05:08.760> I<00:05:09.030> was<00:05:09.390> on<00:05:09.540> the<00:05:09.720> edge<00:05:09.870> there<00:05:10.670> and

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
flipped out I was on the edge there and

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.060 
flipped out I was on the edge there and
it<00:05:11.850> was<00:05:11.970> going<00:05:12.210> so<00:05:12.240> slow<00:05:12.840> that's<00:05:13.560> another

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
it was going so slow that's another

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.980 
it was going so slow that's another
little<00:05:14.430> bit<00:05:14.760> of<00:05:14.850> an<00:05:14.940> interesting<00:05:15.210> physics

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
little bit of an interesting physics

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.290 
little bit of an interesting physics
scene<00:05:16.140> because<00:05:16.500> it<00:05:17.280> can<00:05:17.460> be<00:05:17.550> sometimes<00:05:17.790> hard

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
scene because it can be sometimes hard

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.030 
scene because it can be sometimes hard
to<00:05:18.360> aim<00:05:18.600> and<00:05:18.870> get<00:05:18.990> right<00:05:19.170> on<00:05:19.380> the<00:05:19.560> things<00:05:19.800> which

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
to aim and get right on the things which

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.100 
to aim and get right on the things which
I<00:05:20.130> think<00:05:20.340> if<00:05:20.580> you're<00:05:20.760> on<00:05:20.850> a<00:05:20.880> skateboard<00:05:21.150> and

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
I think if you're on a skateboard and

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.480 
I think if you're on a skateboard and
you<00:05:22.320> have<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:22.590> skills<00:05:22.860> it's<00:05:23.130> probably<00:05:23.430> a

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
you have the skills it's probably a

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.620 
you have the skills it's probably a
little<00:05:23.580> easier<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.060> aim<00:05:24.470> but<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:26.510> aiming<00:05:27.510> was

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
little easier to aim but the aiming was

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.330 
little easier to aim but the aiming was
a<00:05:27.660> little<00:05:27.960> more<00:05:28.110> difficult<00:05:28.290> but<00:05:28.740> you<00:05:29.070> could<00:05:29.220> do

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
a little more difficult but you could do

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.640 
a little more difficult but you could do
super<00:05:29.760> slow<00:05:29.790> unrealistic<00:05:30.750> Grimes<00:05:31.170> like<00:05:31.440> that

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
super slow unrealistic Grimes like that

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.230 
super slow unrealistic Grimes like that
so<00:05:32.640> that<00:05:32.790> was<00:05:32.910> kind<00:05:33.060> of<00:05:33.120> interesting<00:05:34.700> and<00:05:35.700> you

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
so that was kind of interesting and you

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.820 
so that was kind of interesting and you
can<00:05:36.390> see<00:05:36.630> there's<00:05:36.840> all<00:05:37.020> kinds<00:05:37.590> of<00:05:37.620> things

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
can see there's all kinds of things

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.700 
can see there's all kinds of things
being<00:05:38.040> updated<00:05:38.310> as<00:05:38.760> we<00:05:38.910> play<00:05:39.230> so<00:05:40.230> that's<00:05:40.470> one

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
being updated as we play so that's one

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.900 
being updated as we play so that's one
of<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:40.830> things<00:05:40.860> I<00:05:41.040> really<00:05:41.070> liked<00:05:41.460> about<00:05:41.550> this

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
of the things I really liked about this

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.940 
of the things I really liked about this
the<00:05:42.120> complexity<00:05:42.810> of<00:05:42.840> learning<00:05:43.560> new<00:05:43.710> tricks

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
the complexity of learning new tricks

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.280 
the complexity of learning new tricks
and<00:05:44.280> the<00:05:44.340> rewards<00:05:44.820> you<00:05:44.940> get<00:05:45.120> for<00:05:45.420> it<00:05:45.450> and<00:05:45.720> the

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
and the rewards you get for it and the

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.050 
and the rewards you get for it and the
way<00:05:46.440> that<00:05:46.590> it<00:05:46.710> reinforces<00:05:46.920> those<00:05:47.610> things<00:05:47.880> is

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
way that it reinforces those things is

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.440 
way that it reinforces those things is

which<00:05:59.430> make<00:05:59.640> this<00:05:59.820> a<00:05:59.880> more<00:06:00.150> complex<00:06:00.800> instead

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
which make this a more complex instead

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.930 
which make this a more complex instead
of<00:06:01.950> just<00:06:02.310> being<00:06:02.670> kind<00:06:03.630> of<00:06:03.870> this<00:06:04.550> experiment<00:06:05.550> in

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
of just being kind of this experiment in

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.050 
of just being kind of this experiment in
the<00:06:06.360> physics<00:06:06.870> world<00:06:07.520> where<00:06:08.520> you<00:06:08.700> can<00:06:08.880> go

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
the physics world where you can go

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.150 
the physics world where you can go
around<00:06:09.180> and<00:06:09.420> do<00:06:09.630> things<00:06:09.900> this<00:06:10.500> actually<00:06:10.980> makes

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
around and do things this actually makes

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.580 
around and do things this actually makes
it<00:06:11.340> more<00:06:11.490> of<00:06:11.580> a<00:06:11.610> competition<00:06:12.090> and<00:06:12.480> that<00:06:13.380> I

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
it more of a competition and that I

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.190 
it more of a competition and that I
think<00:06:13.860> adds<00:06:14.070> a<00:06:14.250> lot<00:06:14.460> to<00:06:14.520> this<00:06:14.880> game<00:06:15.180> so<00:06:15.870> that

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
think adds a lot to this game so that

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.130 
think adds a lot to this game so that
instead<00:06:16.980> of<00:06:17.310> just<00:06:17.700> doing<00:06:18.540> it<00:06:18.720> for<00:06:18.810> the<00:06:18.870> fun<00:06:19.080> of

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.140 
instead of just doing it for the fun of

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.960 
instead of just doing it for the fun of
it<00:06:19.320> you<00:06:19.470> actually<00:06:19.800> have<00:06:19.920> goals<00:06:20.250> and<00:06:20.670> things<00:06:20.760> to

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
it you actually have goals and things to

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.960 
it you actually have goals and things to
accomplish<00:06:21.180> I<00:06:21.540> think<00:06:21.720> that's<00:06:21.870> really<00:06:22.050> cool<00:06:22.970> ok

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
accomplish I think that's really cool ok

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.900 
accomplish I think that's really cool ok
