 usually allied in this win here and 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.100
 This one will always seem like propaganda. 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:25.300
 it was good but you want to disable 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:28.320
 advertisement here and mixer ms icon here 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:35.910
 You called me

 You can be here at the beginning of the game. 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:47.890
 He will start the beauty eye for 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:05:05.850
 You're the one who's going to want to connect. 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:05:05.850

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:27.300
 maximum of users already connected systems 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:27.300
 someone here with one of them 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.880
 at first nobody has anyone then 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.880
 is saying that he has 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:44.190
 click here and asked to put it like this 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:52.770
 You'll put the same rock outline 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.770
 will appear here 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.160
 It's jewelry jumping garden reminding you 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:05.260
 when does the game start 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:08.949
 and I advised first the stench of the 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:12.760
 Sergio will start before others to 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:23.350
 start it here with the button on the 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:29.470
 main menu of the active game is the 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:31.860
 local lan options do not know how 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.889
 your club language will stay 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:38.500
 applause so with other users the 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:42.580
 other players will do the same 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:48.840
 process even appeared with icons and 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:52.720
 so the connected side is normal 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:55.600
 which is the first time users in 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:59.760
 their faces that their creeds observe 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.760
 then the place and it may not work out 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:18.280
 the first time you leave the angel for the 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:28.750
 that they are not going to be the rock they are going to enter 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:31.150
 in one of the novation game done that I think 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:35.349
 That will not be a problem, was not it? 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:38.770
 It's going to be pretty fast as you saw it. 

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:41.200
 The process is simple but sometimes it is so 

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:44.760
 simple that you can not even imagine 

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:49.870
 this is not a simple fact of renaming 

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:51.340
 the file actually works and it was 

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.050
 proven by me 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:56.789
 There are a lot of people who are doing this already 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.789
 that's it, thank you 

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.720
 looks
