the hair dry with some coconut oil on it
I'm<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.579> alex<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.000> its<00:00:45.149> natural<00:00:45.300> state

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
I'm so this is alex in its natural state

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.529 
I'm so this is alex in its natural state
it<00:00:45.899> used<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> big<00:00:46.649> s<00:00:46.829> curl<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.730> now

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
it used to have a big s curl to it now

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.729 
it used to have a big s curl to it now
it's<00:00:48.719> just<00:00:48.809> like<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> natural<00:00:49.500> by<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.620> way

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
it's just like a natural by the way

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.920 
it's just like a natural by the way
which<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.039> actually<00:00:50.190> like<00:00:50.610> better<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:51.780> it's

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
which I actually like better like it's

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.740 
which I actually like better like it's
really<00:00:52.110> pretty<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> really<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.940> um<00:00:54.690> I

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
really pretty so I really like it um I

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.330 
really pretty so I really like it um I
didn't<00:00:55.140> even<00:00:55.230> use<00:00:55.440> three<00:00:55.680> bundles<00:00:55.890> which<00:00:56.219> is

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
didn't even use three bundles which is

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.130 
didn't even use three bundles which is
surprising<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.510> peruvian<00:00:57.989> hair

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
surprising because this is peruvian hair

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.979 
surprising because this is peruvian hair
so<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.710> thicker<00:00:59.449> version<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
so it's not a thicker version like the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.619 
so it's not a thicker version like the
brazilian<00:01:01.469> hair<00:01:01.590> would<00:01:01.770> be<00:01:02.000> so<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.270> was<00:01:03.449> this

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
brazilian hair would be so that was this

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.200 
brazilian hair would be so that was this
so<00:01:04.229> that's<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.070> hair<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.580> then<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> actually

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
so that's this hair and then I actually

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.899 
so that's this hair and then I actually
curled<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.960> few<00:01:07.170> curls<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.460> side<00:01:08.670> too<00:01:08.820> so

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
curled a few curls on this side too so

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
curled a few curls on this side too so
you<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.060> see<00:01:09.240> how<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.390> curls<00:01:09.780> really<00:01:10.170> nice<00:01:10.380> and

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
you can see how it curls really nice and

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.700 
you can see how it curls really nice and
pretty<00:01:11.030> if<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.439> really

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
