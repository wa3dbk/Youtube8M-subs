00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
about the whole thing I bought the bike

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.280 
about the whole thing I bought the bike
for<00:00:21.830> $100<00:00:22.400> from<00:00:22.550> a<00:00:22.640> garage<00:00:22.790> sale<00:00:23.180> a<00:00:23.540> couple<00:00:24.230> of

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 
for $100 from a garage sale a couple of

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.920 
for $100 from a garage sale a couple of
kids<00:00:24.440> owned<00:00:24.680> it<00:00:24.860> headed<00:00:25.760> out<00:00:25.880> on<00:00:26.060> a<00:00:26.090> farm<00:00:26.390> and<00:00:26.630> I

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
kids owned it headed out on a farm and I

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.200 
kids owned it headed out on a farm and I
pretty<00:00:27.560> much<00:00:27.650> just<00:00:27.740> trashing<00:00:28.550> it<00:00:28.610> and<00:00:28.790> bashing

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
pretty much just trashing it and bashing

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.029 
pretty much just trashing it and bashing
it<00:00:29.330> as<00:00:29.570> kids<00:00:29.810> do<00:00:30.020> didn't<00:00:30.560> really<00:00:30.710> look<00:00:30.830> after

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
it as kids do didn't really look after

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.369 
it as kids do didn't really look after
it<00:00:31.340> so<00:00:32.090> it<00:00:32.180> was<00:00:32.300> in<00:00:32.419> very<00:00:32.540> poor<00:00:32.660> condition<00:00:33.230> when

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
it so it was in very poor condition when

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.260 
it so it was in very poor condition when
I<00:00:33.410> got<00:00:33.620> it<00:00:33.739> but<00:00:34.160> what<00:00:34.460> can<00:00:34.610> you<00:00:34.640> expect<00:00:34.700> from<00:00:35.000> a

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
I got it but what can you expect from a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.619 
I got it but what can you expect from a
1981<00:00:35.780> model<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:36.800> for<00:00:37.070> $100<00:00:37.580> I<00:00:37.699> guess<00:00:40.600> when<00:00:41.600> I

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
1981 model and for $100 I guess when I

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:42.910 
1981 model and for $100 I guess when I
got<00:00:41.809> a<00:00:41.840> home<00:00:42.050> here<00:00:42.260> I<00:00:42.290> stripped<00:00:42.860> down

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
got a home here I stripped down

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.700 
got a home here I stripped down
completely<00:00:43.340> back<00:00:44.270> to<00:00:44.420> a<00:00:44.449> bare<00:00:44.629> frame<00:00:44.840> the

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
completely back to a bare frame the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.740 
completely back to a bare frame the
frame<00:00:45.980> was<00:00:46.129> in<00:00:46.250> good<00:00:46.370> order<00:00:46.570> there's<00:00:47.570> no<00:00:47.720> rust

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
frame was in good order there's no rust

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.130 
frame was in good order there's no rust
so<00:00:50.750> a<00:00:51.230> big<00:00:51.470> blast<00:00:51.680> of<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:51.980> frame<00:00:52.250> swingarm

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
so a big blast of the frame swingarm

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.600 
so a big blast of the frame swingarm
rims<00:00:54.140> handlebars<00:00:54.920> pretty<00:00:55.220> much<00:00:55.340> anything

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
rims handlebars pretty much anything

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.130 
rims handlebars pretty much anything
that<00:00:55.730> could<00:00:56.059> have<00:00:56.149> been<00:00:56.270> big<00:00:56.540> blast<00:00:56.809> that<00:00:57.050> I

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
that could have been big blast that I

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
that could have been big blast that I
did<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:57.820> respray<00:00:58.820> it<00:00:58.850> all<00:00:59.030> that<00:00:59.360> I<00:01:00.160> stripped

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
did and respray it all that I stripped

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.530 
did and respray it all that I stripped
the<00:01:01.250> engine<00:01:01.520> down<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.910> bottom<00:01:02.149> end<00:01:02.329> was

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
the engine down the bottom end was

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.740 
the engine down the bottom end was
actually<00:01:02.899> in<00:01:03.160> reasonably<00:01:04.160> good<00:01:04.220> order

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
actually in reasonably good order

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.050 
actually in reasonably good order
surprisingly<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:06.680> kick<00:01:07.280> starter<00:01:07.610> mechanism

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
surprisingly the kick starter mechanism

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.680 
surprisingly the kick starter mechanism
needed<00:01:08.330> to<00:01:08.390> be<00:01:08.509> replaced<00:01:10.000> it<00:01:11.000> was<00:01:11.149> worn<00:01:11.390> and

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
needed to be replaced it was worn and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.840 
needed to be replaced it was worn and
the<00:01:12.080> shaft<00:01:12.350> on<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:12.920> kick<00:01:13.130> starter<00:01:13.640> was

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
the shaft on the kick starter was

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.469 
the shaft on the kick starter was
actually<00:01:14.830> worn<00:01:15.830> as<00:01:16.100> well<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.330> kick

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
actually worn as well and the kick

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.450 
actually worn as well and the kick
starter<00:01:17.780> just<00:01:17.990> been<00:01:18.170> welded<00:01:18.979> onto<00:01:19.100> there<00:01:19.369> at

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
starter just been welded onto there at

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.350 
starter just been welded onto there at
some<00:01:19.640> stage<00:01:19.909> so<00:01:20.659> I<00:01:20.690> replaced<00:01:21.049> all<00:01:21.229> of<00:01:21.290> that

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
some stage so I replaced all of that

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.850 
some stage so I replaced all of that
putting<00:01:23.360> your<00:01:23.390> piston<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:23.869> rings<00:01:24.080> in<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.680> top

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
putting your piston and rings in the top

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.800 
putting your piston and rings in the top
end<00:01:25.040> of<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.250> engine<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:25.700> put<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:26.720> back

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
end of the engine and put it back

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.130 
end of the engine and put it back

again<00:02:12.940> yes<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:14.209> might<00:02:14.480> give<00:02:14.959> it<00:02:14.989> a<00:02:15.079> start<00:02:15.290> up<00:02:15.470> and

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
again yes I might give it a start up and

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:47.160 
again yes I might give it a start up and
let<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.340> listen<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.579> it<00:02:16.730> run

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.020 

one<00:02:48.170> thing<00:02:48.319> I<00:02:48.410> did<00:02:48.560> do<00:02:48.710> with<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.130> bike<00:02:49.400> was

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
one thing I did do with this bike was

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.420 
one thing I did do with this bike was
remove<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.750> oil<00:02:51.050> pump<00:02:51.470> these<00:02:52.010> little<00:02:52.280> peewee

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
remove the oil pump these little peewee

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.630 
remove the oil pump these little peewee
50<00:02:52.790> round<00:02:53.270> run-off<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.930> oil<00:02:54.709> injection<00:02:55.040> I

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
50 round run-off a oil injection I

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.070 
50 round run-off a oil injection I
remove<00:02:56.569> that<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:57.890> can<00:02:58.069> run<00:02:58.520> with<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:59.080> premix

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
remove that so I can run with a premix

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.650 
remove that so I can run with a premix
two-stroke<00:03:00.709> fuel<00:03:01.040> I'm<00:03:01.459> mixing<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:01.940> up<00:03:02.000> at<00:03:02.240> 40

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
two-stroke fuel I'm mixing that up at 40

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.080 
two-stroke fuel I'm mixing that up at 40
to<00:03:02.720> 1<00:03:02.959> I'll<00:03:03.590> find<00:03:03.860> it<00:03:04.070> if<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:04.520> run<00:03:04.670> them<00:03:04.850> any

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
to 1 I'll find it if you run them any

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.940 
to 1 I'll find it if you run them any
richer<00:03:05.420> than<00:03:05.600> that<00:03:05.780> they<00:03:06.470> just<00:03:06.650> fail<00:03:06.830> the

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
richer than that they just fail the

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.030 
richer than that they just fail the
plugs<00:03:07.190> up<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.900> they<00:03:08.900> run<00:03:09.080> really<00:03:09.380> slow<00:03:09.680> really

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
plugs up and they run really slow really

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.400 
plugs up and they run really slow really
sluggish<00:03:11.860> so<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:12.890> found<00:03:13.190> 40<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.610> 1

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
sluggish so I found 40 to 1

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.340 
sluggish so I found 40 to 1
to<00:03:15.410> be<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.560> good<00:03:15.770> mix<00:03:16.930> one<00:03:17.930> good<00:03:18.080> thing<00:03:18.110> I<00:03:18.320> found
