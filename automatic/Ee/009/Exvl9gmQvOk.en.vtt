00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.830
 pokemon channel episode very well 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.380
 this time I bring you we love wine as 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.740
 you can see in the image of the good video 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.780
 before commenting I want to say two things 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.000
 The first is that you put me down 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.170
 pokemons that you want for the next pro 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.870
 that stain the since I'm running 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.910
 no ideas and good in the description 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.740
 You will see the list of reproductions of the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.510
 pokemon charlene so you can not 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.770
 because we see that I have already done 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.050
 there are many people who put me because we have 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.269
 repeated and second the video has to 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.839
 develop as always 50 likes for 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:39.300
 daily video and good let's start now 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:40.800
 we will see with baby babies 252 points 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.090
 in attack 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 You have 252 points in ps and the remaining 6 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.480
 in speed very well firm nature 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.129
 has a good attack this pokemon there 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.420
 to exploit it to the maximum since it is 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.010
 a slow pokémon skill bait bait that 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.079
 makes life cbol as the movements 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.030
 of type ice type game just you 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.580
 will produce three quarters of normal damage 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.460
 a pokémon with this skill is worth or 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.590
 be the two attacks of type I'm the type 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.880
 that I want and fire are not reduced to the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.880
 half 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.740
 the band focus object will go very well 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.289
 because surely there is some pokemon that 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.030
 it destroys us with a touch so 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.200
 least we can put the traps rocks 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.720
 what you see next in the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.479
 movements ok we start with the ones with 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.710
 the earthquake movements learn it by 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.140
 emt avalanche does not learn puts puts song 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.159
 Ice cream learns it being a swain up to 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.750
 level 24 suffering a dream remember and 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.850
 traps rocks he learns by the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.380
 movement egg and the father in the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.470
 daycare has to be a smart world 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.179
 it's worth it if he's my TV being pokemones 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.119
 so ugly that it has a tail that paints 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.349
 good that it has like a brush and good 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.179
 now let's see the statistics 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:55.920
 ends of mamos when it reaches the 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.599
 level 100 here we have the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.849
 final statistics of go wayne 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:05.490
 when it reaches level 100 it is worth 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:08.340
 we started ps 424 is very good is a 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.739
 large tank that will stand quite 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.470
 although we have focus band just in case 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.629
 to be able to put traps rocks and then 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.209
 with as much side as attacked with 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:23.370
 priority can attack then attack 394 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:28.620
 incredible attack if you have seen almost 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:32.190
 the 400 defense 196 justita attack 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.670
 special 156 does not matter of thoughts 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.440
 special 156 very justita but good with 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.019
 the bait skill that reduces attacks 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.840
 of fire type and that fire type is 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.500
 Most iguanas are sometimes worth if smith 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.430
 in the physical but equally flamethrower 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.310
 for example we would reduce it so by 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.319
 luck with bait skill we can 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.640
 cover quite the type of game that is 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:03.150
 what really hurts us and speed 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.700
 197 that to be a physical tank the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.549
 truth that is fast by at between 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.290
 quotes so it's not bad with 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.510
 hand mammon way what we have to do 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.240
 is to put back traps rocks 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.820
 if they do not attack us then earthquakes 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.380
 then if we are about to die singing 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.210
 ice cream because we attack with priority or 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.710
 it is very well there are people who 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.360
 use with life wait but good yo 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.680
 I prefer band focus to make sure 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.000
 that does not die and good as I told you 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.670
 50 álex for daily video I hope that you 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.850
