00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
actually a pretty good deal it's pretty

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.259 
actually a pretty good deal it's pretty
frustrating<00:00:25.800> when<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.340> clean<00:00:26.640> something<00:00:26.939> and

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
frustrating when you clean something and

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.630

it<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> concern<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:39.960> you're<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.170> a

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
it this is a concern if you're in a

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.540 
it this is a concern if you're in a
competition<00:00:40.379> where<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:40.980> need<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> wonder
