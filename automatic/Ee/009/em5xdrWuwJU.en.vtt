00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
servicing the Machine I'm not sure but

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.639 
servicing the Machine I'm not sure but
it's<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.610> size<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.910> nickel<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.980> in<00:00:41.540> anyways

it's the size of a nickel and in anyways

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.060 
it's the size of a nickel and in anyways
it'll<00:00:43.649> operate<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.190> machine<00:00:44.809> so<00:00:45.829> let's<00:00:46.829> see

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
it'll operate the machine so let's see

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.420 
it'll operate the machine so let's see
let's<00:00:47.100> make<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.700> selection<00:00:48.239> I'm<00:00:48.690> going<00:00:49.079> to

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
let's make the selection I'm going to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.639 
let's make the selection I'm going to
crank<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> handle<00:00:50.760> around<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.870> number<00:00:52.350> three

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
crank the handle around to number three

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:02.920 
crank the handle around to number three
and<00:00:57.050> then<00:00:58.340> proceed<00:00:59.340> to

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.969 

start<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:04.010> machine

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
start the machine

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.600 
start the machine
and<00:01:06.520> once<00:01:06.880> again

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.490 

path<00:01:10.150> nut<00:01:10.450> is<00:01:10.660> proceeding<00:01:11.230> into<00:01:11.350> the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
path nut is proceeding into the

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.230 
path nut is proceeding into the
reversing<00:01:12.040> cam

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
reversing cam

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.060 
reversing cam
which<00:01:14.660> will<00:01:14.840> pull<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.260> carriage<00:01:15.500> in<00:01:15.710> reverse

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
which will pull the carriage in reverse

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.920 
which will pull the carriage in reverse
you<00:01:16.690> can<00:01:17.690> see<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.020> little<00:01:18.170> beaded<00:01:18.470> chain<00:01:18.860> is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
you can see the little beaded chain is

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.170 
you can see the little beaded chain is
connected<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:21.050> another<00:01:21.260> arm<00:01:21.590> which<00:01:22.180> then

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
connected to another arm which then

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.340 
connected to another arm which then
proceeds<00:01:24.400> to<00:01:25.400> pull<00:01:25.580> the<00:01:25.790> carriage<00:01:26.030> forward<00:01:26.870> so

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
proceeds to pull the carriage forward so

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.070 
proceeds to pull the carriage forward so
that<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.680> record<00:01:27.890> we<00:01:28.190> selected<00:01:28.760> goes<00:01:29.720> into

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
that the record we selected goes into

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.110 
that the record we selected goes into
the<00:01:30.170> playing<00:01:30.440> position

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.240 

as<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.870> carriage<00:01:36.170> traverses<00:01:36.800> down<00:01:37.010> the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
as the carriage traverses down the

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.890 
as the carriage traverses down the
course<00:01:37.550> feed<00:01:38.030> screw<00:01:39.850> thread<00:01:40.850> it<00:01:41.300> goes<00:01:41.660> into

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
course feed screw thread it goes into

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.190 
course feed screw thread it goes into
another<00:01:42.020> reversing<00:01:42.740> cam<00:01:42.980> and<00:01:43.250> moves<00:01:43.460> forward

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.280 

pretty<00:01:49.200> ingenious<00:01:49.350> little<00:01:49.799> device

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.110 

now<00:01:53.770> that's<00:01:53.980> being<00:01:54.280> left<00:01:54.550> out<00:01:54.670> onto<00:01:55.030> the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
now that's being left out onto the

00:01:55.120 --> 00:05:21.650 
now that's being left out onto the
record<00:01:55.300> and<00:01:55.660> of<00:01:55.750> course<00:01:55.960> it's<00:01:56.110> going<00:01:56.260> to<00:01:56.320> play

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.790 

okay<00:05:22.470> and<00:05:22.650> that<00:05:22.800> ends<00:05:23.070> the<00:05:23.220> record<00:05:24.650> and<00:05:25.650> of

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
okay and that ends the record and of

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.129 
okay and that ends the record and of
course<00:05:26.040> it<00:05:26.220> will<00:05:26.280> take<00:05:26.340> a
