00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello to all guys well found by 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.700
 francesco siciliani the new video 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.790
 weblog iphoneitalia.com we go to 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.460
 see some covers made by italy 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.349
 independent is pure for our iphone 6 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.599
 advance iphone 6 plus already 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.060
 let's talk about some covers a lot 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.699
 intriguing on the fashion side though 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.570
 they have a rather simple design and 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.279
 linear 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.859
 let's go and discover them well let's see why 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.859
 give a touch of style to ours 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.440
 we got to try these 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.970
 cases for iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.380
 let's start with a case that we have 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.760
 tried only for iphone 6 but it is 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.420
 available of course also for iphone 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.610
 6 plus 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.340
 we are talking about the custody sense that one 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.370
 housing with a rigid back is the 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.590
 frontal we say semitransparent in 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.540
 soft material that will allow us to 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.780
 go and watch the screen even without 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.760
 in short, to open the frontal flap 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.740
 then the case wraps well 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.960
 device and as you can see in 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.290
 transparency we can also see the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.450
 our device from the frontal flap 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.369
 therefore without necessarily going to 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.610
 open it to perform all operations 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.229
 maybe we're just reading a message 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.940
 we use this feature or 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.290
 we simply want to follow a slide 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.720
 for the call because as you can 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.490
 see above are the holes for 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.040
 the speaker so we can very well 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.530
 talk on the phone without problems for 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.810
 the rest connections are available 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.060
 without problems then the doors below 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.490
 They are free from impediments also 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.880
 buttons are not coated therefore not 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.920
 generate any kind of friction and 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.990
 camera is free even with flash 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.420
 so the flash is not crushed e 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.310
 the case works pretty well 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.010
 in the end it does not change too much 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.650
 device size makes it 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.159
 however very simple to keep in 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.799
 but no 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.900
 unfortunately it lacks any kind of 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.960
 hook on the back side that makes 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.130
 let's say the frontal flap a little 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.580
 wobbly when using the device 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.430
 obviously without the front cover 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.780
 let's move on to the other cover for this one 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.200
 once we tested it for iphone 6 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.330
 plus 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.750
 let's talk about the beast cover that a cover 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.860
 with a soft and velvety material 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.989
 as if we really had a cover in 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.239
 velvet this cover will wrap ours 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.209
 device at best leaving the 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.290
 free end only let's say the area 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.390
 back then only the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.549
 the side where we go to insert the jack 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.760
 headphone and lightning cable this 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.319
 may be a thing we say a point of 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.390
 strength for those who want to use the 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.060
 adapters or more jack cables 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.439
 big but maybe not a point not 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.510
 too positive for those who want one 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.280
 protection let's say integral also i 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.620
 buttons are covered but the friction and 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.019
 good don't weigh that much 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.250
 on the experience of use because they are pressed 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.139
 very easily 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.489
 the rest of the edges are protected by the 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.560
 inside there is a gem 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.639
 very interesting that is practically the 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.709
 logo of the wheel the characteristic phrase 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.189
 of the company that the company 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.260
 produces 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:12.269
 and even the camera we tested 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.419
 works well so flash does not come 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.069
 absolutely say compressed 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.379
 crushed the protection offered by 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.909
 scratches and bumps and good 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.370
 obviously comparable to that of the 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.810
 cover sense even if the one on the side 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.669
 frontal but not hooking any 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.310
 so if the iPhone should fall and 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:31.349
 maybe you should even open a moment 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.590
 the custody we would not say the 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.120
 frontal protection but let's move on to 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.000
 definitely the most interesting line 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.449
 of the italia independent custodies or 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.310
 let's talk about the chevron style case 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:47.790
 this case is really very much 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.680
 beautiful because it has a very fashionable design 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.109
 very interesting and is available in 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.019
 two variants one says silver and 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.510
 the other gold even if in the end it's enough 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.400
 change the light and the nuances a bit 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.129
 they are really very interesting because 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.049
 the cover is almost metallic, let's say 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.229
 that this case is very thin 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.030
 light is certainly the least we say 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:10.979
 invasive to the iphone design level 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.709
 because it always keeps it thin and 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:15.870
 light compared to the others leaves all 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.880
 the free doors then leave the door 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.419
 top part down side 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.520
 let's say open also leaves the buttons 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.139
 free and even the camera area not 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.580
 it comes absolutely in no way 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.699
 let's say 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.789
 invaded there are no problems 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:35.580
 here too scratches and bumps on the part 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:37.770
 later they are avoided ie we don't say 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.110
 we are protected as well as on the edges 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.090
 shame about the small parts of course 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.930
 free however it was always the same story 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.159
 if one wants maybe he can more than 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.289
 ease of use of being able to use 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:51.599
 adapters maybe in the lower part 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.430
 or a slightly larger jacko or 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.090
 also use the keys without one 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.129
 coverage 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.439
 this is let's say the price to pay but 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.969
 like all the covers of this style 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:01.409
 in short, these cases are really 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:03.750
 interesting regarding the 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.759
 designs are made by a company that 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.520
 however, it has made itself known quite a lot 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.110
 in the fashion and glamor world and therefore 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.569
 give an extra touch to ours 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.659
 any color device maybe 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:19.590
 we chose for our iphone 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:21.300
 small advice the velvet cover maybe 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.919
 blue is perhaps the ideal solution 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.840
 because the other colors are not 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.550
 bad though this is really one 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.520
 particular shade not found 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.169
 very easily around if you want more 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.360
 information on these cases you can 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.400
 visit our review that 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.979
