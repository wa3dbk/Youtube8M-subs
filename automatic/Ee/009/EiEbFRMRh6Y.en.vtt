00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.500
 Every cloud has a silver lining 

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:55.601
 everyone has their moment 

00:00:56.902 --> 00:00:58.702
 She said... 

00:00:59.503 --> 00:01:01.903
 "Do not say anything... 

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:05.003
 ... if you do not have something nice to say " 

00:01:08.504 --> 00:01:11.304
 The hard ones keep going ... 

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.305
 ... when to continue is hard 

00:01:16.506 --> 00:01:18.006
 But for you 

00:01:18.207 --> 00:01:22.757
 the best of me was never enough 

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:29.658
 Do not try a home run ... 

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:33.859
 ... if you're worth a little 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.060
 She said... 

00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:40.761
 "Remember, whoever abandons never wins. 

00:01:42.562 --> 00:01:44.562
 And a winner never abandons " 

00:01:46.763 --> 00:01:48.363
 The sun does not shine 

00:01:48.364 --> 00:01:50.764
 in the ass of the sleepers 

00:01:51.865 --> 00:01:54.565
 ... and all that roll 

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:57.366
 But for you 

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:02.117
 the best of me was never enough 

00:02:05.718 --> 00:02:08.118
 Well, if life gives you lemons 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.919
 she said "well, make lemonade" 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.220
 Early bird catches the fucking worm first 

00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:23.521
 Rome was not made in a day 

00:02:25.222 --> 00:02:27.322
 Life is like a box of chocolates 

00:02:27.323 --> 00:02:29.523
 you never know what is going to touch you 

00:02:30.124 --> 00:02:32.524
 Silly is the one who does nonsense 

00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:34.825
 and all those shits ... 

00:02:35.526 --> 00:02:40.726
 Come on, baby, tell me the bluff 

00:02:43.506 --> 00:02:45.006
 Because for you 

00:02:45.007 --> 00:02:49.557
 the best of me was never enough
