00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 the contact program is a program 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.370
 who denies fifteen years ago in 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.450
 collaboration with the ministry 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.510
 immigration and communities 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.090
 of Quebec is the goal 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.860
 referred to it was the Frenchization of 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.840
 families starting with toddlers 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.279
 and we started so fifteen years ago to 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.590
 to present in clinics 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:28.080
 vaccination of clsc in m6 waters 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.820
 and as here at saint amand different 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.880
 places where we had a good chance 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:43.200
 to meet parents and all 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:46.770
 small 0 5 years old I'm walking with a 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.690
 bag a backpack with a blanket and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.210
 a lot of books in my bag 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.250
 so when I get somewhere I read 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.750
 the stories so that gives an idea to 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.120
 parents how can they 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.129
 a master the intonation as they can 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.750
 use the book for the child but 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.430
 the idea is not to tell 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.580
 stories is rather to discover the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.990
 pleasure that there are in the books so we 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.729
 encourages parents to start as early as 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.799
 birth to read for kids but 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.700
 also leave them books that this 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.320
 be accessible 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.760
 we are told that the books must 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.200
 maybe pretty much like a toy 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.299
 the child will try to play 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.710
 he can also pick up a student 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.689
 to get an idea 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.820
 as a mom what I'm looking for in 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.729
 this particular activity is that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.320
 My baby is more comfortable with 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.890
 books and they know it's a 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.950
 tool to discover the world for 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.610
 discover life to discover the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.960
 language is the brief communication the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.570
 children are able to fetch 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.500
 later books by a m 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.540
 they no longer have the blockage they have anymore 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.610
 the courage to go to the front for 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.940
 touching books and flipping through them 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.729
 it's no longer the sacred book 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.020
 that this program there attracts more than twenty 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.450
 thousand people a year 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.170
 his sister who adjusts the positive in 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.170
 this experience
