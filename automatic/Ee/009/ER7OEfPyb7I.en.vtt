it's<00:01:27.000> still<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> same<00:01:27.570> AI<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.900> me<00:01:28.170> whenever

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
it's still the same AI to me whenever

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.679 
it's still the same AI to me whenever
the<00:01:29.159> QB<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.640> throwing<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> ball<00:01:30.240> towards<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the QB is throwing the ball towards the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.420 
the QB is throwing the ball towards the
receiver<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.290> always<00:01:31.530> take<00:01:31.860> control<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
receiver I always take control of the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.249 
receiver I always take control of the
cornerback<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> want<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.780> make<00:01:33.840> sure<00:01:33.960> i

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
cornerback because I want to make sure i

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.020 
cornerback because I want to make sure i
get<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> interception<00:01:35.280> because<00:01:35.759> want<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> let

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
get the interception because want to let

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.940 
get the interception because want to let
the<00:01:36.150> cpu<00:01:36.630> try<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> handle<00:01:37.170> its<00:01:37.320> business<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
the cpu try to handle its business the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
the cpu try to handle its business the
cpu<00:01:38.430> player<00:01:38.700> will<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.270> ball<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.509> their

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
cpu player will have the ball in their

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.420 
cpu player will have the ball in their
hands<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.409> all<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> sudden<00:01:40.650> drop<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.280> I

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
hands and all of a sudden drop it I

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.490 
hands and all of a sudden drop it I
guess<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.880> offensive<00:01:42.329> CPU<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.960> still<00:01:43.259> kind

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
guess that offensive CPU is still kind

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.289 
guess that offensive CPU is still kind
of<00:01:43.560> stupid<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.189> don't<00:01:44.850> really<00:01:45.000> see<00:01:45.180> how<00:01:45.210> to

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
of stupid I don't really see how to

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.090 
of stupid I don't really see how to
improve<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.899> maybe<00:01:46.170> they<00:01:46.380> did<00:01:46.560> maybe<00:01:46.860> I'm

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
improve that maybe they did maybe I'm

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.679 
improve that maybe they did maybe I'm
the<00:01:47.250> only<00:01:47.369> loser<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.970> realize<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.570> maybe

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
the only loser to realize that maybe

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.450 
the only loser to realize that maybe
it's<00:01:48.899> online<00:01:49.049> lag<00:01:49.470> or<00:01:49.619> something<00:01:49.950> let<00:01:50.340> me<00:01:50.369> know

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
it's online lag or something let me know

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.460 
it's online lag or something let me know
guys<00:01:50.759> if<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.149> guys<00:01:51.180> notice<00:01:51.659> any<00:01:51.810> defensive

feature<00:01:59.700> but<00:02:00.060> what<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.210> didn't<00:02:00.540> notice<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
feature but what I didn't notice is the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.109 
feature but what I didn't notice is the
amount<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.590> features<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.250> updates<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:03.000> all

amount of features and updates and all
this<00:02:03.270> cool<00:02:03.509> stuff<00:02:03.570> they<00:02:04.020> added<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.290> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
this cool stuff they added to the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.499 
this cool stuff they added to the
franchise<00:02:04.890> mode<00:02:05.189> apparently<00:02:05.820> they've<00:02:06.240> added

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
franchise mode apparently they've added

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.240 
franchise mode apparently they've added
hundreds<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.960> features<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.649> obviously<00:02:07.979> wasn't

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
hundreds of features I obviously wasn't

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.919 
hundreds of features I obviously wasn't
able<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.700> go<00:02:08.819> through<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.390> hundreds<00:02:09.750> they

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
able to go through the hundreds they

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.300 
able to go through the hundreds they
added<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.440> did<00:02:10.709> notice<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.099> few<00:02:11.250> things

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
added but I did notice a few things

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.360 
added but I did notice a few things
right<00:02:11.730> away<00:02:11.879> like<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
right away like the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.100 
right away like the
franchise<00:02:13.879> mode<00:02:14.239> dynamic<00:02:14.870> player

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
franchise mode dynamic player

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.960 
franchise mode dynamic player
performance<00:02:15.709> when<00:02:16.159> I<00:02:16.190> first<00:02:16.489> started<00:02:16.670> playing

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
performance when I first started playing

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.520 
performance when I first started playing
a<00:02:17.209> few<00:02:17.360> games<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.720> never<00:02:17.900> some<00:02:18.080> players<00:02:18.319> were

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
a few games I never some players were

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.100 
a few games I never some players were
playing<00:02:19.190> in<00:02:19.549> consistently<00:02:20.360> or<00:02:20.569> differently

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
playing in consistently or differently

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.809 
playing in consistently or differently
one<00:02:21.620> game<00:02:21.830> there'd<00:02:22.069> be<00:02:22.069> really<00:02:22.400> beast<00:02:22.640> in<00:02:22.760> the

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
one game there'd be really beast in the

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.160 
one game there'd be really beast in the
next<00:02:23.030> time<00:02:23.180> they<00:02:23.299> wouldn't<00:02:23.659> so<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:23.870> was<00:02:23.989> kind<00:02:24.140> of

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
next time they wouldn't so I was kind of

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.110 
next time they wouldn't so I was kind of
looking<00:02:24.260> at<00:02:24.680> up<00:02:24.830> came<00:02:25.010> across<00:02:25.310> this<00:02:25.549> the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
looking at up came across this the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.910 
looking at up came across this the
franchise<00:02:26.659> mode<00:02:26.930> dynamic<00:02:27.590> player

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
franchise mode dynamic player

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.589 
franchise mode dynamic player
performance<00:02:28.489> they<00:02:28.760> did<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.120> create<00:02:29.450> an

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
performance they did it to create an

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.960 
performance they did it to create an
unpredictable<00:02:30.409> feeling<00:02:30.890> in<00:02:31.010> franchise<00:02:31.640> mode

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
unpredictable feeling in franchise mode

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.149 
unpredictable feeling in franchise mode
and<00:02:32.209> basically<00:02:33.019> what<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.200> does<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:33.620> each<00:02:33.799> week

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
and basically what it does is each week

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:35.949 
and basically what it does is each week
every<00:02:34.519> player's<00:02:34.760> ratings<00:02:35.209> will<00:02:35.420> be<00:02:35.450> different

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
every player's ratings will be different

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.649 
every player's ratings will be different
from<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.200> week<00:02:36.349> before<00:02:36.379> and<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.909> skill<00:02:38.329> sets

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
from the week before and the skill sets

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.089 
from the week before and the skill sets
and<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.870> traits<00:02:39.140> are<00:02:39.290> different<00:02:39.680> based<00:02:39.890> on

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
and the traits are different based on

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.100 
and the traits are different based on
the<00:02:40.190> player<00:02:40.459> who<00:02:41.329> he<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.659> if<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.959> guys

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
the player who he is if the guys

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.720 
the player who he is if the guys
inconsistent<00:02:43.010> he's<00:02:43.370> going<00:02:43.519> to<00:02:43.579> have

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
inconsistent he's going to have

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.789 
inconsistent he's going to have
inconsistent<00:02:44.150> games<00:02:44.690> on<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.870> consistent<00:02:45.200> basis

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
inconsistent games on a consistent basis

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.520

the<00:02:46.400> example<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:46.940> EA<00:02:47.239> gave<00:02:47.540> was<00:02:47.750> in<00:02:47.930> one<00:02:48.260> game

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
the example that EA gave was in one game

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.289 
the example that EA gave was in one game
you<00:02:48.560> might<00:02:48.769> have<00:02:49.010> Michael<00:02:49.400> Vick<00:02:49.579> at<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.849> 90

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
you might have Michael Vick at a 90

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.970 
you might have Michael Vick at a 90
overall<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:50.930> then<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.290> next<00:02:51.319> week<00:02:51.769> you<00:02:51.799> might

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
overall and then the next week you might

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.220 
overall and then the next week you might
have<00:02:52.310> Michael<00:02:52.640> Vick<00:02:52.790> at<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:52.940> 70<00:02:53.420> overall<00:02:53.810> just

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
have Michael Vick at a 70 overall just

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.839 
have Michael Vick at a 70 overall just
because<00:02:54.590> let's<00:02:55.099> just<00:02:55.160> say<00:02:55.280> Michael<00:02:55.700> Vick

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
because let's just say Michael Vick

roster<00:03:35.900> additions<00:03:36.290> they'd<00:03:36.410> added<00:03:36.739> all<00:03:36.980> that

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
small stuff to men and 12 so they were

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.890

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
game needed but i think the dynamic

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.970 
game needed but i think the dynamic
player<00:03:44.690> performance<00:03:45.079> was<00:03:45.260> a<00:03:45.290> great<00:03:45.530> idea<00:03:45.560> and

of<00:04:28.069> 10<00:04:28.430> just<00:04:28.879> because<00:04:29.180> sometimes<00:04:29.689> the<00:04:29.870> actual

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
of 10 just because sometimes the actual

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:31.899 
of 10 just because sometimes the actual
game<00:04:30.409> play<00:04:30.620> of<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.800> game<00:04:30.830> does<00:04:31.370> feel<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.639> lot

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:31.909

like<00:04:32.120> some<00:04:32.449> previous<00:04:32.900> madden<00:04:33.289> games

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530
