00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
together and we made a cardboard boat I

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.240 
together and we made a cardboard boat I
don't<00:00:36.570> know<00:00:36.660> why<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> problem<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.100> though

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
don't know why but the problem is though

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:50.110

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.990 
so there's one problem when you have to
build<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.410> cardboard<00:01:02.650> duct-tape<00:01:03.400> boat<00:01:03.640> in<00:01:03.850> your

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
free time and that's that you have to

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.800 
free time and that's that you have to
keep<00:01:06.220> it<00:01:06.430> out<00:01:06.610> of<00:01:06.670> sight<00:01:06.850> when<00:01:07.570> you're<00:01:07.690> at<00:01:07.780> work
