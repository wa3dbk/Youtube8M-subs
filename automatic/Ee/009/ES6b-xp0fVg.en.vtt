00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:34.599
 of harmony it is practically the 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:37.510
 whole song in you flat out 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.640
 this is not in the minor backsight 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.150
 I'm going to play the wagah solo and you're going to 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:47.370
 accompany tablature down here and I 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.370

 well what do you think we can call? 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.720
 the attention here is when I do the 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:36.450
 right here on 15th 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:39.780
 I make a cap here at 18 I pull the toe and 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:46.650
 then I give them to the good that is left of this 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:50.550
 way is to get an interesting effect 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:54.900
 here is good then we have the second 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:04:03.150
 nec soil under half step in the right music is 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:06.269
 so it 's mocó and bemol me less does the 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.890
 Chorus and then that ground goes in that 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.959
 touches the end of my videos that is 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.959
 This song stays this way. 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:25.720
 an is 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:27.750

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.750
 O 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.229

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:13.479

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:15.370
 very large percussion what this 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.580
 The band here has to be fine. 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.280
 expressive right 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:25.229
 it goes back and forth and ends with a vibrato 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.229
 and then have the repetitions right 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:36.430
 14 13 11 and 14 on the rope if he repeats this 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:39.400
