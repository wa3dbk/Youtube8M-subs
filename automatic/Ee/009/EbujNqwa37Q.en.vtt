nightmare<00:02:42.159> difficulty<00:02:42.519> I<00:02:42.940> believe<00:02:43.239> also<00:02:43.810> this

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
nightmare difficulty I believe also this

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.440 
nightmare difficulty I believe also this
is<00:02:44.260> where<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.799> tearful<00:02:45.099> accessory<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.269> new

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
is where the tearful accessory and a new

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.479 
is where the tearful accessory and a new
rare<00:02:47.049> high-level<00:02:47.650> weapons<00:02:48.040> will<00:02:48.159> come<00:02:48.370> into

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
rare high-level weapons will come into

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.390 
rare high-level weapons will come into
play<00:02:48.700> with<00:02:49.420> these<00:02:49.659> I<00:02:49.930> assume<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.530> nightmare

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
play with these I assume that nightmare

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.220 
play with these I assume that nightmare
difficulty<00:02:51.730> might<00:02:52.360> be<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.569> bit<00:02:52.780> more<00:02:52.900> doable

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
difficulty might be a bit more doable

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.080 
difficulty might be a bit more doable
this<00:02:53.980> seems<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.340> be<00:02:54.370> following<00:02:54.609> the<00:02:54.910> same

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
this seems to be following the same

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.640 
this seems to be following the same
footsteps<00:02:55.390> as<00:02:55.629> what<00:02:55.989> they<00:02:56.109> did<00:02:56.260> for<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.500> mass

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.289 
of an even harder mode heartbreaker mode
there's<00:03:23.290> only<00:03:23.500> for<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.190> most<00:03:24.400> insane<00:03:25.120> of

players or most organized of teams all
that<00:03:28.780> I<00:03:28.810> said<00:03:29.139> regarding<00:03:29.799> nightmare<00:03:30.250> mode

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
that I said regarding nightmare mode

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.970 
that I said regarding nightmare mode
applies<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.269> heartbreaker<00:03:31.810> mode<00:03:32.139> but<00:03:32.709> even

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
applies to heartbreaker mode but even

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.830 
applies to heartbreaker mode but even
more<00:03:33.160> so<00:03:33.489> this<00:03:34.120> should<00:03:34.329> provide<00:03:34.569> the<00:03:34.720> greatest

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
more so this should provide the greatest

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.589
