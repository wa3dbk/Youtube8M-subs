00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.440
 hello marc for guardian's universe 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.610
 points like your online store 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.860
 football goalkeepers 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.419
 today we present you the new 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.910
 glove or at aura or pro sgss 2014 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:23.029
 so we want that replacing the 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.619
 argos range so the look huaorani on 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.449
 will also see on the world cup 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.859
 2014 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:31.360
 so all the rich gloves this year on 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:35.930
 this look the loco will have nor the majority have 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:40.520
 these colors there in yellow green white with 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:47.870
 palms of colors so you have a 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:49.460
 textile glove body and mesh one 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.390
 new closure system has been 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.390
 studied by rech 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.149
 so that's the closing system is 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.440
 not elastic it's a wide band 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.740
 at this time closing system 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.420
 simple well serves it and that's enough 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.990
 stable 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.220
 there is this new small option 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.099
 allows to remove from the bench easily 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.390
 we have the second hand taken removed there 

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:23.869
 the bandage so the pompom sgc the la 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.880
 softgrip palm of schieren it's a little 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.220
 the equivalent of the super soft from home 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.450
 chai where sport for but with a good 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.160
 grip that will wear out pretty evenly 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.140
 of course it's the same for us really 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.989
 order on a synthetic ground that 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.399
 am still going pretty fast but c 

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:46.520
 is there she still has a good grip back 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.950
 of death being and latex so everything 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.179
 back of the hand there is latex so the 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.890
 body of the bench as I already told you 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:56.330
 textile and mesh 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:00.590
 you have the proflex system that allows 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.770
 to have the flexibility of the glove on 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.000
 especially on the backbone the system is s 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:12.280
 so it's a little ergonomics that at home 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.820
 of schieren good good feelings of 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.990
 to enter the glove a good flexibility 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.970
 new some closing systems 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.380
 as I told you it's a bit of the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.110
 seat belt is still 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.930
 wide 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.900
 we would have liked a second a second 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.459
 scratch for well tight the glove 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.650
 even by squeezing it well we are we are 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.830
 still relatively maintained it's 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.150
 not bad here it was mark for 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.150
