00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
I don't know I'm wondering how many how

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.570 
I don't know I'm wondering how many how
much<00:00:09.330> bulk<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.500> world<00:00:10.710> put<00:00:10.950> up<00:00:11.070> with<00:00:11.280> or

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
much bulk and the world put up with or

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.180 
much bulk and the world put up with or
nature<00:00:12.240> just<00:00:12.389> breaks<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.799> look<00:00:13.980> how

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
nature just breaks that that look how

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.070 
nature just breaks that that look how
much<00:00:14.400> illusion<00:00:15.030> can<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> world<00:00:15.540> suffer

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
much illusion can the world suffer

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.250 
much illusion can the world suffer
before<00:00:16.199> nature<00:00:16.949> just<00:00:17.340> snaps<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:17.850> half<00:00:18.230> well<00:00:19.230> I

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
before nature just snaps in half well I

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.390 
before nature just snaps in half well I
spent<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.590> lot<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.770> time<00:00:19.949> with<00:00:20.100> indigenous

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
spent a lot of time with indigenous

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.609 
spent a lot of time with indigenous
people<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.029> places<00:00:21.330> like<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.630> Amazon<00:00:22.080> they

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
people in places like the Amazon they

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.050 
people in places like the Amazon they
don't<00:00:22.800> do<00:00:23.070> anything<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.609> isn't<00:00:23.760> sustainable

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
don't do anything that isn't sustainable

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.640 
don't do anything that isn't sustainable
you<00:00:24.480> just<00:00:24.660> don't<00:00:24.840> do<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.109> there<00:00:25.439> isn't

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
you just don't do it there isn't

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.980 
you just don't do it there isn't
sustainable<00:00:25.830> it's<00:00:26.670> not<00:00:26.939> even<00:00:27.240> possible<00:00:27.539> a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
sustainable it's not even possible a

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.679 
sustainable it's not even possible a
conceivable<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.830> would<00:00:29.099> do<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.000> so

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
conceivable that you would do it and so

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.359 
conceivable that you would do it and so
now<00:00:30.900> here<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.199> are<00:00:31.320> at<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.590> time<00:00:31.830> where<00:00:32.189> we've

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
now here we are at a time where we've

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.729 
now here we are at a time where we've
we've<00:00:32.730> come<00:00:32.969> through<00:00:33.140> several<00:00:34.140> hundred<00:00:34.469> years

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
we've come through several hundred years

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.880 
we've come through several hundred years
of<00:00:35.070> history<00:00:35.489> doing<00:00:36.450> non<00:00:36.809> sustainable<00:00:37.649> things

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
of history doing non sustainable things

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.470 
of history doing non sustainable things
and<00:00:38.219> we're<00:00:38.370> all<00:00:38.460> sitting<00:00:38.640> around<00:00:38.790> now<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
and we're all sitting around now the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.180 
and we're all sitting around now the
corporation's<00:00:40.290> are<00:00:40.440> getting<00:00:40.739> together<00:00:40.860> for

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
corporation's are getting together for

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.670 
corporation's are getting together for
conferences<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.879> sustainability<00:00:42.540> should<00:00:43.469> we

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
conferences on sustainability should we

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.770 
conferences on sustainability should we
become<00:00:44.040> sustainable<00:00:44.480> can<00:00:45.480> we<00:00:45.600> become

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
become sustainable can we become

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.080 
become sustainable can we become
sustainable<00:00:46.260> well<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.399> obvious<00:00:47.550> answer<00:00:47.879> is

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
sustainable well the obvious answer is

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.910 
sustainable well the obvious answer is
if<00:00:48.480> we<00:00:48.690> don't<00:00:48.809> think<00:00:49.020> I'm<00:00:49.110> sustainable<00:00:49.710> by

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
if we don't think I'm sustainable by

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.790 
if we don't think I'm sustainable by
definition<00:00:50.780> we're<00:00:51.780> not<00:00:51.930> here<00:00:52.199> any<00:00:52.379> longer<00:00:52.710> at

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
definition we're not here any longer at

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:03.819 
definition we're not here any longer at
some<00:00:52.980> point

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.100 

so<00:01:04.820> here<00:01:05.120> we<00:01:05.269> have<00:01:05.390> we<00:01:05.659> have<00:01:05.780> all<00:01:05.930> these

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
so here we have we have all these

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.910 
so here we have we have all these
structures<00:01:06.740> on<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.220> planet<00:01:08.920> meaning

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
structures on the planet meaning

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.500 
structures on the planet meaning
different<00:01:10.550> corporations<00:01:10.909> different

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
different corporations different

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.010 
different corporations different
companies<00:01:11.900> different<00:01:12.200> ways<00:01:13.100> of<00:01:13.930> using<00:01:14.930> our

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
companies different ways of using our

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.410 
companies different ways of using our
resources<00:01:15.619> and<00:01:15.860> so<00:01:16.040> forth<00:01:16.090> none<00:01:17.090> of<00:01:17.240> it<00:01:17.330> is

humanity a planet or the animal kingdom

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.340 
humanity a planet or the animal kingdom
it's<00:01:23.390> all<00:01:24.040> driven<00:01:25.040> by<00:01:25.220> money<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:27.020> make<00:01:27.170> more

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
it's all driven by money to make more

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.109 
it's all driven by money to make more
money<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.800> have<00:01:28.040> more<00:01:28.250> control<00:01:28.550> more<00:01:28.880> power

and to be better than someone else

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:39.670 
and to be better than someone else
that's<00:01:31.220> basically<00:01:31.670> their<00:01:31.820> driving<00:01:32.030> force
