00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
constantly up there so it's gonna really

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.390 
constantly up there so it's gonna really
benefit<00:01:15.479> for<00:01:15.659> today<00:01:15.960> see<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.170> are<00:01:16.400> right

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
shooting at him yeah that's not really

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.780 
shooting at him yeah that's not really
mandatory<00:03:33.020> but<00:03:33.500> it's<00:03:33.950> very<00:03:34.190> helpful<00:03:34.430> if<00:03:34.700> you

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
if they have a silencer on their gun now

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.660 
if they have a silencer on their gun now
