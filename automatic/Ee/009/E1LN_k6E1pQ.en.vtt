00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.770 
click back and go into gestures but
I'm<00:02:27.280> not<00:02:27.370> going<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:27.580> go<00:02:27.670> into<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.940> lot<00:02:28.300> of<00:02:28.450> detail

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
I'm not going to go into a lot of detail

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.720 
I'm not going to go into a lot of detail
about<00:02:28.990> gestures<00:02:29.350> but<00:02:29.800> instead<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.250> using<00:02:30.430> one

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
about gestures but instead of using one

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.730 
about gestures but instead of using one
of<00:02:30.760> two<00:02:31.030> fingers<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.990> can<00:02:32.020> go<00:02:32.170> ahead<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.440> use

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
of two fingers you can go ahead and use

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.520 
of two fingers you can go ahead and use
one<00:02:32.950> finger<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.910> operate<00:02:34.600> as<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:35.140> would<00:02:35.320> with

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
one finger to operate as you would with

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.890 
one finger to operate as you would with
three<00:02:35.830> fingers<00:02:36.040> on<00:02:36.460> an<00:02:36.670> iOS<00:02:36.760> device<00:02:37.030> it's

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
three fingers on an iOS device it's

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.260 
three fingers on an iOS device it's
really<00:02:38.170> confusing<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:39.040> me<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.400> seems<00:02:39.760> pretty

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
really confusing to me and seems pretty

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.050 
really confusing to me and seems pretty
hard<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.810> use<00:02:41.020> so<00:02:41.260> here<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:42.070> three<00:02:42.760> finger

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
hard to use so here is the three finger

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.780 
hard to use so here is the three finger
controls<00:02:43.510> with<00:02:43.780> only<00:02:44.080> one<00:02:44.470> finger<00:02:45.040> I'm<00:02:45.700> going

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
controls with only one finger I'm going

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.520 
controls with only one finger I'm going
to<00:02:45.850> go<00:02:45.940> ahead<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.180> show<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.750> favorites

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
to go ahead and show you favorites

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.280 
to go ahead and show you favorites
favorites<00:02:48.010> has<00:02:48.220> things<00:02:48.610> like<00:02:48.760> pinch<00:02:49.480> which<00:02:49.870> is

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
favorites has things like pinch which is

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.010 
favorites has things like pinch which is
obviously<00:02:51.250> so<00:02:51.490> representing<00:02:52.030> beta<00:02:52.240> and<00:02:52.510> then

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
obviously so representing beta and then

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.540 
obviously so representing beta and then
of<00:02:53.170> course<00:02:53.200> your<00:02:53.590> swipe<00:02:53.920> which<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.370> what

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
of course your swipe which is what

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.850 
of course your swipe which is what
you're<00:02:54.700> on<00:02:55.000> as<00:02:55.420> default<00:02:56.050> but<00:02:56.560> I'm<00:02:56.620> going<00:02:56.740> to<00:02:56.800> go

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
you're on as default but I'm going to go

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.050 
you're on as default but I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.070> go<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.160> pinch<00:02:57.460> and<00:02:57.760> show<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:57.970> guys

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
ahead and go to pinch and show you guys

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.030 
ahead and go to pinch and show you guys
how<00:02:58.120> this<00:02:58.390> uses<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:58.960> it's<00:02:59.470> actually<00:02:59.770> pretty

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
how this uses and it's actually pretty

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.010 
how this uses and it's actually pretty
hard<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.700> use<00:03:00.970> as<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.270> guys<00:03:01.420> can<00:03:01.570> see<00:03:01.630> I'm

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
hard to use as you guys can see I'm

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.110 
hard to use as you guys can see I'm
zooming<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.710> all<00:03:02.860> works<00:03:03.070> out<00:03:03.310> but<00:03:03.850> then<00:03:03.970> when

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
zooming in all works out but then when

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.360 
zooming in all works out but then when
it's<00:03:04.270> time<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.510> actually<00:03:04.810> scroll<00:03:05.320> along<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:06.100> is

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
it's time to actually scroll along it is

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.480 
it's time to actually scroll along it is
very<00:03:06.760> hard<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.270> do<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:07.990> without<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:09.040> saying

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
very hard to do so without it saying

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.280 
very hard to do so without it saying
basically<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:10.030> don't<00:03:10.450> want<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:10.690> zoom<00:03:10.840> anymore

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
basically I don't want to zoom anymore

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.920 
basically I don't want to zoom anymore
and<00:03:11.530> every<00:03:12.400> time<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.610> touch<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.390> screen<00:03:13.600> it

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
and every time I touch the screen it

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.050 
and every time I touch the screen it
makes<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.620> zoom<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:15.100> as<00:03:15.520> you<00:03:15.670> guys<00:03:15.730> can<00:03:16.000> see

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
makes it zoom and as you guys can see

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.840 
makes it zoom and as you guys can see
just<00:03:16.540> crashed<00:03:16.960> out<00:03:17.290> of<00:03:17.650> safari<00:03:18.190> which<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.580> does

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
just crashed out of safari which it does

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.000 
just crashed out of safari which it does
do<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.240> in<00:03:19.390> beta<00:03:19.660> every<00:03:20.050> now<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.320> then<00:03:20.410> so

do that in beta every now and then so

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.430 
do that in beta every now and then so
assistive<00:03:21.490> touch<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:22.030> seems<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.900> be<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.140> very

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
assistive touch it seems to be a very

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.760 
assistive touch it seems to be a very
very<00:03:24.340> mixed<00:03:25.270> up<00:03:25.420> feature<00:03:25.780> but<00:03:26.350> at<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.500> same

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
very mixed up feature but at the same

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.200 
very mixed up feature but at the same
time<00:03:26.950> it's<00:03:27.310> also<00:03:27.610> pretty<00:03:28.120> cool
