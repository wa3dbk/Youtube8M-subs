 Today is the future 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.400
 I would like to introduce the basic practice of drums 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:19.320
 Store at around 70 in the metronome 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.320
 I'm doing 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.750

 How is it already? 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:07.260
 Next I will practice by raising the tempo 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:07.260
 Although it was about 70 detection a little while ago, I will try to store 100 this time 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.950
 The 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.760
 Yes i did it now 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:41.170
 This is the score of Bran's basic practice 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:46.440
 Eh first 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.440
 Underneath we practice the score 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:56.060
 Stakes gotten to in the first eighth note the right hand 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:04:03.489
 Right hand left only over Te Te right in such a way that the left-to-right 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:03.489
