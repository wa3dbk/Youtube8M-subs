 we are already here in the game we are going to 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.620
 it here as you see the class threw him 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.270
 some small changes as you see I have 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.729
 put to the trunk so that two advantages 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.079
 of these streak because I realize 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.190
 that I have never used the train of 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:10.950
 attack like that 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.340
 that when you use it you can just like 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.500
 say it straight for enemies to throw you 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.280
 to him and of course it is not just plan 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.200
 use it for a once that payment 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.860
 safe 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.689
 on this earth not expecting to use them 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.950
 only for a low then I have 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.090
 put that so that I can bloat a 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.320
 a little more videos and well, well, tell you 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.850

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.929
 description pass you that are a content 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:44.179

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.969
 let's get serious pussies because 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.500
 I have to get us a game of people 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.140
 at least lest society say this 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.000

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.000
 payment there that was not seen by the bushes 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.220

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.810
 ok, we're going well, we're on a roll 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.189
 good to remember that I'm man thing I'm 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.659
 still with the cheese in his hand so 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.159
 well, it's also a difficulty 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.650
 that human beings a is a great a 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.659

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.739
 few excuses 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:39.230
 hand and such and that makes it difficult for me 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.230
 pretty good 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:57.230
 1 - there are two with the knife not always 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.230

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.370

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.030
