hey guys Paul talking comm here today

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.029 
hey guys Paul talking comm here today
we're<00:00:10.020> going<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.199> talk<00:00:10.350> about<00:00:10.379> two<00:00:10.830> new

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:11.039 
we're going to talk about two new

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.180 
we're going to talk about two new
gasoline<00:00:11.309> engines<00:00:11.969> these<00:00:12.539> are<00:00:12.750> from<00:00:13.049> NGH<00:00:13.680> they

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
gasoline engines these are from NGH they

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.679 
gasoline engines these are from NGH they
are<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.699> GT<00:00:15.180> 17<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.350> GT<00:00:16.710> 25<00:00:17.460> engine<00:00:18.029> now

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
are the GT 17 and the GT 25 engine now

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.749 
are the GT 17 and the GT 25 engine now
these<00:00:19.230> engines<00:00:19.679> are<00:00:19.769> meant<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.189> be<00:00:20.369> glow

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
these engines are meant to be glow

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.109 
these engines are meant to be glow
engine<00:00:20.999> replacements<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.259> they<00:00:22.410> do<00:00:22.470> feature

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
engine replacements so they do feature

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.419 
engine replacements so they do feature
beam<00:00:24.119> type<00:00:24.419> motor<00:00:24.779> mount<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.919> two<00:00:26.070> engines

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:26.429 
beam type motor mount the two engines

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.839 
beam type motor mount the two engines
like<00:00:26.669> I<00:00:26.699> said<00:00:26.910> are<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.359> 17<00:00:27.839> CC<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.890> 25<00:00:29.339> cc

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
like I said are the 17 CC and the 25 cc

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.130 
like I said are the 17 CC and the 25 cc
so<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.390> would<00:00:30.599> be<00:00:30.749> a<00:00:31.669> 1.0<00:00:32.669> 3<00:00:33.360> cubic<00:00:33.750> inch<00:00:33.900> and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
so that would be a 1.0 3 cubic inch and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.470 
so that would be a 1.0 3 cubic inch and
a<00:00:34.380> 1.5<00:00:35.010> 2<00:00:35.460> cubic<00:00:35.880> inch<00:00:36.030> displacement<00:00:36.590> they<00:00:37.590> are

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
a 1.5 2 cubic inch displacement they are

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.350 
a 1.5 2 cubic inch displacement they are
1.8<00:00:39.480> horsepower<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.910> 2.7<00:00:41.910> horse<00:00:42.120> power

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
1.8 horsepower and 2.7 horse power

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.110 
1.8 horsepower and 2.7 horse power
respectively<00:00:43.200> between<00:00:43.560> the<00:00:43.650> two<00:00:43.800> engines<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
respectively between the two engines the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.820 
respectively between the two engines the
cool<00:00:45.300> thing<00:00:45.510> about<00:00:45.540> these<00:00:45.840> engines<00:00:46.290> is<00:00:46.440> they
