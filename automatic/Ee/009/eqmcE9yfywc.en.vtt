00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.620
 ingredients and how you prepare it 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.410
 We may need one for the day 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:41.309
 daily that corresponds to a cup 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.590
 tea glass of fresh then help 200 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.800
 milliliter rarely half town 1 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.640
 tablespoon of sugar we have until 1 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.890
 tablespoon salt 1 1 comes in the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.309
 pasta and with the yolk you can 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.079
 then delete your prayers and join 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.469
 you can then need them with 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.409
 black cumin or season not pure and 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.200
 million depending on need so i will 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.200
 her first, will all the trimmings 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.130
 mix and then just prepare the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.130
 dough shape 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.510
 Now I'll cover the dough 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.330
 to go for a warm one out of 45 minutes 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.280
 to let 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.229
 please fill this time with garlic 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.900
 Chest taken and then easy 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.640
 I decide from now on 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.640
 Price which part 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.800
 great 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:15.040
 I then suffer the pages of 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:18.760
 outside so the middle stays 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.960
 closed only the outer sides are 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.960
 then cut out 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.340
 Now I give a club la france and 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:34.030
 then close the pages together 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.690
 then give the next disc then too 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.690
 only on it 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.840
 and so on 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.000
 that then and a rod looks 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.420
 You can keep doing that as well 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.420
 also 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.790
 Now I'll leave that on the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.340
 so go about 15 to 20 minutes 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.770
 you will then brush with egg yolks 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.890
 I have the press through with algae and 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:22.470
 will this then at 180 degrees 30 only for 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:25.020
 button and so many events from something 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.540
 others try it out 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.370
 offers to me really delicious 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.410
 Of course I hope that you too 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.050
 This concept has been of her, the 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.190
 just fool us we would like that 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.530
 simply replace the filling 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.100
 garlic horst alarms poultry sausage 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.000
 or cheese I would not take that is 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.890
 do not fit at all 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.960
 I wish you much fun while 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.800
 try and say that until the 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.800
