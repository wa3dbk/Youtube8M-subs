00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.700
 and then guys who described your kart whistle 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.710
 We have to face it today. 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.759
 highlight I'll teach you to send 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.849
 beaten 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.010
 then you should learn to 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.510
 send a beat 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.630
 first you have to learn to 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.260
 move the skateboard on the ground climb up 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.720
 skateboard begin to move skateboard there 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.969
 the skate moves and with this production 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.770
 start trying the first of the active 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.809
 so after you will learn 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.629
 to move the iscte in the sun 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.480
 A lot of people are more 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.989
 backside or frontside of the beat is 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.329
 a choice of you so start 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.969
 teaching the backside beat the beat 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.760
 This backside goes against the wall and 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.600
 Look who's turning the skateboard is from the beat 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.420
 first you have to twist your body before 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 skateboard because a lot of people try to turn the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.320
 skate before the body and ends up running or 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.560
 falling is not harder then I say 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.400
 you first turn the body after 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.400
 of cheeses 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.479
 the slaughter of chicken site is almost the same 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.700
 something that I have to leave 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.630
 only everything will be on your back in the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.869
 wall 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.680
 so you'll have to look first 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:57.410
 where will the maneuver come back and 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.210
 first body game after the ground 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.210
 I got more or less like this 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.800
 that was what beck beat istat 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.250

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.250
