that's<00:01:54.270> much<00:01:54.630> more<00:01:54.869> efficient

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
that's much more efficient

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.930 
that's much more efficient
with<00:01:57.140> all<00:01:57.380> that<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.890> more<00:01:58.100> this<00:01:58.550> truck<00:01:58.790> now

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
with all that and more this truck now

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.730 
with all that and more this truck now
gets<00:01:59.150> the<00:01:59.240> best-in-class<00:01:59.600> 25<00:02:00.380> miles<00:02:00.680> per

gallon so that I can do what it has to
do<00:02:02.990> but<00:02:03.830> it<00:02:03.920> lets<00:02:04.070> you<00:02:04.160> do<00:02:04.400> more<00:02:04.430> of<00:02:04.700> what<00:02:04.940> you

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
do but it lets you do more of what you

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.750 
do but it lets you do more of what you
want<00:02:05.510> to<00:02:05.570> do<00:02:05.840> it's<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.620> best<00:02:06.890> of<00:02:07.070> both<00:02:07.250> worlds

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760
