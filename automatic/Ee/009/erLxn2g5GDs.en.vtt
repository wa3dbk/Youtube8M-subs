00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.150
 hi in this video i'm going to you 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.010
 show how to clean the inside of 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.519
 his computer 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.679
 so me it hp to see him then all 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.590
 first you go the tender ones we do 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.340
 even the cases of behind finally you 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.150
 must remove that pretty much recommended but 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.630
 I 'm not going to take it off 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:29.570
 as we just want the current it's 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:35.570
 all so we will start with high schools 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:41.730
 that a vis Ã  vis and the skin see it 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:44.329
 it's by a little you do it 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.329
 with the back 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.120
 that's how is life I do not think 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.719
 that it's the same in all here it is 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:04.300
 is how the stars so now 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.300
 that we had pulled back 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:18.350
 So here we will put aside you 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:21.350
 go take pq m yes so cdpq but 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.210
 could take six other things so 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.360
 it must not be wet much 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.080
 a lot because it can touch them and 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:40.550
 running here that can be dangerous 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:43.819
 here you go if there is more signal 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.420
 and more dust because when the engine 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.409
 stops dust falling back if they 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.170
 not come here 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:02:01.100
 I cleaned my room to try 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:03.399
 handle here is the fan that the 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.399
 right here 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:12.290
 managed to include theater but not 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.030
 so loot his shower but like that here 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.680
 as well 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.690
 and side so did not really touch 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.070
 right here 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.930
 if you have a bit like this loan so 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.070
 for engines so can use that 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:32.600
 I do not have our hearts paid 1 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:36.530
 everywhere and these have the skin so 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.860
 often sellers who are dirty so 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:45.920
 to turn a little near that falls the victim 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:51.050
 dust that goes to the floor so after 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:54.100
 we will have to put them in 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:03:05.870
 to put it back these initials is the opposite 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:08.650
 he was like that, even life is the same 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.650
 here 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:22.780
 the guest also showed that lives alone I 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.780
 I'm not really here and it's over 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.370
 you just have to press the 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.190
 button to turn it on and that's what it 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.200
 will be cleaner than before thank you 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.000
 to have watched this video 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.930
 so I would like the next one for a 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.930
