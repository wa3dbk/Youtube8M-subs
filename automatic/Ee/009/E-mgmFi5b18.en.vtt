hmm<00:04:17.570> it's<00:04:18.019> very<00:04:18.320> carbonated<00:04:19.570> it's<00:04:20.570> quite<00:04:21.260> well

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
hmm it's very carbonated it's quite well

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.680 
hmm it's very carbonated it's quite well
carbonated<00:04:22.130> so<00:04:22.370> that's<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.389> first<00:04:23.600> thing
