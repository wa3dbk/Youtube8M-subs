00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
like that of that nature I believe that

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.440 
like that of that nature I believe that
a<00:05:40.000> small<00:05:40.330> a<00:05:40.540> smaller<00:05:40.990> guy<00:05:41.520> with<00:05:42.520> with<00:05:42.880> higher

skill level than a big guy with a little

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.700 
skill level than a big guy with a little
bit<00:05:45.550> less<00:05:45.730> skill<00:05:46.000> can<00:05:46.330> win<00:05:46.540> but<00:05:47.380> this<00:05:47.500> is<00:05:47.590> not

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
bit less skill can win but this is not

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.680 
bit less skill can win but this is not
the<00:05:47.770> case<00:05:48.010> guys<00:05:48.310> I<00:05:48.610> mean<00:05:48.910> Eddie<00:05:49.180> chambers<00:05:49.450> a

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
the case guys I mean Eddie chambers a

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.120 
the case guys I mean Eddie chambers a
lot<00:05:49.870> of<00:05:49.990> skill<00:05:50.200> but<00:05:50.650> some<00:05:50.800> of<00:05:50.890> the<00:05:50.950> clinical

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
lot of skill but some of the clinical

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.620 
lot of skill but some of the clinical
brothers<00:05:51.720> I<00:05:53.520> believe<00:05:54.520> that<00:05:54.730> if<00:05:54.850> Lattimore

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
brothers I believe that if Lattimore

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.720 
brothers I believe that if Lattimore
clinch<00:05:55.900> go<00:05:56.080> with<00:05:56.230> his<00:05:56.380> skill<00:05:56.500> was<00:05:57.430> the<00:05:57.520> same

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
clinch go with his skill was the same

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.690 
clinch go with his skill was the same
size<00:05:57.970> as<00:05:58.180> Eddie<00:05:58.330> chambers<00:05:58.570> height<00:05:59.440> wise<00:05:59.700> I

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
size as Eddie chambers height wise I

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.520 
size as Eddie chambers height wise I
believe<00:06:01.690> that<00:06:01.720> in<00:06:01.900> chambers<00:06:02.140> can<00:06:02.290> beat<00:06:02.410> them

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
believe that in chambers can beat them

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.830 
believe that in chambers can beat them
but<00:06:03.310> that's<00:06:03.370> not<00:06:03.520> the<00:06:03.700> case<00:06:03.880> guys<00:06:04.180> he's<00:06:04.660> going

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
but that's not the case guys he's going

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.930 
but that's not the case guys he's going
in<00:06:05.050> there<00:06:05.169> against<00:06:05.470> a<00:06:05.680> monster<00:06:05.919> he's<00:06:06.789> all
