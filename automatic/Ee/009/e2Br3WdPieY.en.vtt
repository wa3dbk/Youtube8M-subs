00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.220 

over<00:00:06.910> the<00:00:07.000> years<00:00:07.270> I've<00:00:07.480> learned<00:00:07.720> a<00:00:07.930> lot<00:00:07.960> of

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.230 
over the years I've learned a lot of

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.959 
over the years I've learned a lot of
fast<00:00:08.500> ways<00:00:08.770> to<00:00:09.100> unpick<00:00:10.200> seem<00:00:11.200> such<00:00:11.680> as<00:00:11.980> the

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
fast ways to unpick seem such as the

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.130 
fast ways to unpick seem such as the
blind<00:00:13.540> hem<00:00:13.959> on<00:00:14.020> a<00:00:14.260> pair<00:00:15.010> of<00:00:15.039> trousers<00:00:16.080> or<00:00:17.080> a

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
blind hem on a pair of trousers or a

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.400 
blind hem on a pair of trousers or a
skirt<00:00:17.710> or<00:00:17.950> a<00:00:18.010> dress<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:19.240> easiest<00:00:19.660> way<00:00:19.930> is<00:00:19.960> to

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
skirt or a dress the easiest way is to

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.919 
skirt or a dress the easiest way is to
actually<00:00:20.530> slide<00:00:21.010> the<00:00:21.220> quick<00:00:21.429> unpick<00:00:21.929> into

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:22.929 
actually slide the quick unpick into

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.919 
actually slide the quick unpick into
in-between<00:00:23.830> a<00:00:24.429> couple<00:00:25.000> of<00:00:25.090> the<00:00:25.210> stitches<00:00:25.660> and

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:25.929 
in-between a couple of the stitches and

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.009 
in-between a couple of the stitches and
then<00:00:26.740> you'll<00:00:27.369> find<00:00:27.730> that<00:00:28.089> the<00:00:28.480> stitches

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019 
then you'll find that the stitches

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.150 
then you'll find that the stitches
actually<00:00:29.560> it<00:00:30.369> it<00:00:30.789> goes<00:00:31.150> through<00:00:31.660> a<00:00:31.839> loop<00:00:32.380> and

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
actually it it goes through a loop and

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.340 
actually it it goes through a loop and
if<00:00:33.400> you<00:00:33.580> release<00:00:33.790> the<00:00:34.240> loop<00:00:34.480> the<00:00:34.870> thread<00:00:34.900> from

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
if you release the loop the thread from

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.220 
if you release the loop the thread from
the<00:00:35.440> loop<00:00:35.770> then<00:00:36.280> the<00:00:36.640> whole<00:00:37.570> thing<00:00:37.960> will

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
the loop then the whole thing will

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.560 
the loop then the whole thing will
unravel<00:00:38.469> I'm<00:00:39.460> just<00:00:39.730> showing<00:00:40.059> you<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.360> loop

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
unravel I'm just showing you the loop

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.040 
unravel I'm just showing you the loop
this<00:00:40.870> you<00:00:41.289> can<00:00:41.469> see<00:00:41.680> that<00:00:41.710> loop<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.840> that's

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
this you can see that loop so that's

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.630 
this you can see that loop so that's
where<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.410> thread<00:00:44.680> was<00:00:44.890> actually<00:00:45.399> caught

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
where the thread was actually caught

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.790 
where the thread was actually caught
through<00:00:45.969> and<00:00:46.629> once<00:00:46.840> it's<00:00:47.079> released<00:00:47.289> from

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
through and once it's released from

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.150 
through and once it's released from
there<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:49.329> unravels<00:00:49.930> and<00:00:50.590> I'm<00:00:50.739> sure<00:00:50.920> you've

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
there it unravels and I'm sure you've

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.000 
there it unravels and I'm sure you've
all<00:00:51.309> had<00:00:51.550> hems<00:00:51.820> fall<00:00:52.149> down<00:00:52.449> on<00:00:52.660> you<00:00:52.870> because<00:00:53.620> of

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
all had hems fall down on you because of

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.639 
all had hems fall down on you because of
it<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:58.300> I'm<00:00:58.390> just<00:00:58.600> going<00:00:58.840> to<00:00:59.019> show<00:00:59.230> you<00:00:59.260> that

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
it so I'm just going to show you that

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.500 
it so I'm just going to show you that
again<00:00:59.980> and<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:03.219> this<00:01:03.429> instance<00:01:03.699> so<00:01:04.269> I'm

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
again and in this instance so I'm

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.270 
again and in this instance so I'm
flicking<00:01:04.840> the<00:01:05.110> stitch<00:01:05.410> up<00:01:05.650> and<00:01:06.010> then<00:01:06.130> I'm

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
flicking the stitch up and then I'm

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.820 
flicking the stitch up and then I'm
flicking<00:01:06.730> it<00:01:06.880> out<00:01:07.090> of<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.540> loop<00:01:07.830> grabbing

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
flicking it out of the loop grabbing

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.300 
flicking it out of the loop grabbing
hold<00:01:09.009> of<00:01:09.220> it<00:01:09.430> and<00:01:09.729> pulling<00:01:10.979> these<00:01:11.979> trousers

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
hold of it and pulling these trousers

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.020 
hold of it and pulling these trousers
had<00:01:12.759> been<00:01:13.000> tacked<00:01:13.360> down<00:01:13.509> just<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:15.000> make<00:01:16.000> sure

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
had been tacked down just to make sure

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.520 
had been tacked down just to make sure
that<00:01:16.390> if<00:01:16.509> it<00:01:16.630> didn't<00:01:16.869> come<00:01:17.020> down<00:01:17.200> then<00:01:17.439> the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
that if it didn't come down then the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.410 
that if it didn't come down then the
side<00:01:17.740> seams<00:01:18.100> wouldn't<00:01:18.460> drop<00:01:18.850> which<00:01:19.090> is<00:01:19.270> that

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
side seams wouldn't drop which is that

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.319 
side seams wouldn't drop which is that
which<00:01:19.600> is<00:01:19.720> a<00:01:19.750> good<00:01:19.930> idea<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:23.970> then<00:01:24.970> all<00:01:25.150> it's

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
which is a good idea and then all it's

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.719 
which is a good idea and then all it's
just<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.630> matter<00:01:25.810> of<00:01:26.009> pulling<00:01:27.009> it<00:01:27.280> through<00:01:27.310> so

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
just a matter of pulling it through so

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.760 
just a matter of pulling it through so
that's<00:01:27.939> a<00:01:28.060> good<00:01:28.270> thing<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.229> know<00:01:29.409> when<00:01:29.710> you're

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
that's a good thing to know when you're

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.469 
that's a good thing to know when you're
shortening<00:01:30.280> trousers<00:01:30.909> and<00:01:31.060> it's<00:01:31.180> owning

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
shortening trousers and it's owning

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.539 
shortening trousers and it's owning
going<00:01:31.780> up<00:01:31.960> say<00:01:32.290> one<00:01:32.560> here<00:01:32.829> more<00:01:33.040> half<00:01:33.220> for<00:01:33.430> him

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
going up say one here more half for him

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.230 
going up say one here more half for him
and<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.960> know<00:01:35.079> you<00:01:35.140> have<00:01:35.439> to<00:01:35.560> undo<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.159> hem<00:01:36.399> to

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
and you know you have to undo the hem to

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.840 
and you know you have to undo the hem to
actually<00:01:37.979> mark<00:01:38.979> it

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.060 

so<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.330> next<00:01:45.570> seam<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.170> we're<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.800> to

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
so the next seam that we're going to

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.149 
so the next seam that we're going to
undo<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.940> called<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.330> chain<00:01:48.570> stitch<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.290> you'll

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
undo is called a chain stitch and you'll

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.219 
undo is called a chain stitch and you'll
notice<00:01:50.370> that<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.820> one<00:01:51.060> side<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.659> quite<00:01:51.930> thick

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
notice that on one side it's quite thick

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.690 
notice that on one side it's quite thick
and<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> other<00:01:52.710> side<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.250> looks<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.550> a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
and on the other side it looks like a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.910 
and on the other side it looks like a
normal<00:01:53.970> stitch<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:55.350> when<00:01:55.500> you're<00:01:55.680> undoing

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
normal stitch so when you're undoing

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.890 
normal stitch so when you're undoing
chain<00:01:56.250> stitch<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.790> undoes<00:01:57.150> from<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.510> left<00:01:57.690> to

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
chain stitch it undoes from the left to

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.310 
chain stitch it undoes from the left to
the<00:01:57.990> right<00:01:58.190> always<00:01:59.190> undo<00:02:00.150> where<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.960> want<00:02:01.170> it

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the right always undo where you want it

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.120 
the right always undo where you want it
to<00:02:01.470> stop

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
to stop

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.550 
to stop
first<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.690> don't<00:02:03.900> start<00:02:04.050> and<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
first so that you don't start and the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.649 
first so that you don't start and the
whole<00:02:04.710> thing<00:02:04.920> unravels<00:02:05.009> then<00:02:05.610> come<00:02:05.880> back<00:02:05.909> to

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
whole thing unravels then come back to

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.810 
whole thing unravels then come back to
the<00:02:06.780> beginning<00:02:07.039> slide<00:02:08.039> your<00:02:08.280> quick<00:02:08.429> unpick

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
the beginning slide your quick unpick

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.669 
the beginning slide your quick unpick
underneath<00:02:09.330> then<00:02:09.570> slide<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.289> second

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
underneath then slide it in a second

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.470 
underneath then slide it in a second
time<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.130> it<00:02:11.190> will<00:02:11.310> release<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.700> little<00:02:12.150> thread

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
time and it will release a little thread

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.170 
time and it will release a little thread
and<00:02:12.750> then<00:02:13.560> just<00:02:13.770> pull<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.010> thread<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.850> the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
and then just pull that thread and the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.850 
and then just pull that thread and the
whole<00:02:15.360> thing<00:02:15.570> unravels<00:02:15.750> come<00:02:16.440> around<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.770> the

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
whole thing unravels come around to the

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.979 
whole thing unravels come around to the
other<00:02:16.980> side<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.730> there<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.450> go<00:02:18.660> it's<00:02:18.900> done

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
other side and there you go it's done

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.110 
other side and there you go it's done
now<00:02:19.920> I'm<00:02:20.010> going<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.400> actually<00:02:20.519> do<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.060> a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
now I'm going to actually do that a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.710 
now I'm going to actually do that a
little<00:02:21.480> bit<00:02:21.630> slower<00:02:21.930> for<00:02:22.290> you

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
little bit slower for you

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.800 
little bit slower for you
so<00:02:25.010> clip<00:02:26.010> where<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.280> want<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.790> stop<00:02:27.090> back

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
so clip where you want it to stop back

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.330 
so clip where you want it to stop back
to<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.140> beginning<00:02:28.290> remember<00:02:29.070> it's<00:02:29.220> always

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
to the beginning remember it's always

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.759 
to the beginning remember it's always
left<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.209> right<00:02:30.450> with<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.019> fix<00:02:31.260> seam<00:02:31.500> facing

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
left to right with the fix seam facing

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.699 
left to right with the fix seam facing
you<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.489> there<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.300> go<00:02:33.480> it's<00:02:33.840> undone<00:02:36.709> this

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
you and there you go it's undone this

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.740 
you and there you go it's undone this
one<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.100> called<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.459> cover<00:02:38.670> stitch<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.510> looks

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
one is called a cover stitch it looks

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
stitches on the right hand side you'll

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.640 
stitches on the right hand side you'll
also<00:02:50.850> notice<00:02:51.299> that<00:02:51.600> I've<00:02:51.750> got<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.049> fold<00:02:52.350> of

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650

the garment in my left hand and I've got
these<00:02:56.970> stitches<00:02:57.269> going<00:02:57.870> towards<00:02:58.350> me<00:02:58.850> then

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
these stitches going towards me then

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.610 
these stitches going towards me then
you're<00:03:00.030> going<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.329> turn<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.720> back<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.290> give<00:03:01.590> it

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
you're going to turn it back and give it

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.100 
you're going to turn it back and give it
a<00:03:01.769> little<00:03:01.920> bit<00:03:02.160> of<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.340> pull<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.910> then<00:03:03.480> release

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
a little bit of a pull and then release

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.270 
a little bit of a pull and then release
the<00:03:04.820> stitch<00:03:05.820> on<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.360> left<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.920> then<00:03:07.920> give<00:03:08.250> it

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
the stitch on the left and then give it

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.190 
the stitch on the left and then give it
a<00:03:08.430> little<00:03:08.640> bit<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.090> tug<00:03:09.329> and<00:03:09.630> you'll<00:03:09.989> see

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
a little bit of a tug and you'll see

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.560 
a little bit of a tug and you'll see
that<00:03:10.440> again<00:03:10.829> everything<00:03:11.400> so<00:03:11.640> loops<00:03:11.970> inside

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
that again everything so loops inside

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.590 
that again everything so loops inside
something<00:03:13.320> so<00:03:14.010> if<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.489> release<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:15.239> loop

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
something so if you release that loop

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.120 
something so if you release that loop
then<00:03:16.350> it<00:03:16.980> will<00:03:17.600> unravel<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:19.110> so<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:19.829> can<00:03:19.950> see

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
then it will unravel and so you can see

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.580 
then it will unravel and so you can see
it<00:03:20.250> just<00:03:20.310> got<00:03:20.670> caught<00:03:20.970> because<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.780> fabrics<00:03:22.410> a

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
it just got caught because the fabrics a

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.710 
it just got caught because the fabrics a
little<00:03:22.829> bit<00:03:22.950> fluffy<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:24.030> give<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.360> slight

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
little bit fluffy to give it a slight

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.890 
little bit fluffy to give it a slight
pull<00:03:25.350> now<00:03:26.130> some<00:03:26.549> fabrics<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.360> don't<00:03:27.630> want<00:03:27.810> to

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
pull now some fabrics you don't want to

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.710 
pull now some fabrics you don't want to
do<00:03:28.049> that<00:03:28.260> too<00:03:28.530> because<00:03:28.769> it<00:03:29.070> will<00:03:29.220> ladder<00:03:29.459> so<00:03:30.269> be

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
do that too because it will ladder so be

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.300 
do that too because it will ladder so be
very<00:03:30.989> aware<00:03:31.170> of<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.680> fabric<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.070> you're

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
very aware of the fabric that you're

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.270 
very aware of the fabric that you're
doing<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.850> on<00:03:34.160> before<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.400> begin<00:03:35.970> pulling<00:03:36.690> it

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
doing it on before you begin pulling it

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.099 
doing it on before you begin pulling it
and<00:03:38.280> then<00:03:38.549> once<00:03:38.820> you've<00:03:39.090> done<00:03:39.299> a<00:03:39.329> bit<00:03:39.600> come

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
and then once you've done a bit come

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.900 
and then once you've done a bit come
back<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:41.100> should<00:03:41.130> be<00:03:41.459> able<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.700> just

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
back and you should be able to just

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.819 
back and you should be able to just
release<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.450> stitching<00:03:42.720> if<00:03:43.109> you've<00:03:43.590> got<00:03:43.799> a

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
release that stitching if you've got a

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.710 
release that stitching if you've got a
three<00:03:44.160> third<00:03:44.430> your<00:03:44.700> three<00:03:45.090> thread<00:03:45.390> then<00:03:45.570> you'd

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
three third your three thread then you'd

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.990 
three third your three thread then you'd
have<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:46.049> take<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.380> third<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:47.280> stitch<00:03:47.760> out

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
have to take the third the stitch out

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.360 
have to take the third the stitch out
from<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.420> middle<00:03:48.690> first<00:03:51.709> and<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.950> last<00:03:53.160> one

from the middle first and the last one
we're<00:03:53.519> going<00:03:53.550> to<00:03:53.849> undo<00:03:54.239> is<00:03:54.480> over<00:03:54.750> locking<00:03:54.930> this

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
we're going to undo is over locking this

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.160 
we're going to undo is over locking this
it<00:03:55.980> has<00:03:56.280> actually<00:03:56.760> been<00:03:56.910> over<00:03:57.300> locked<00:03:57.600> with<00:03:57.990> an

overlocker that's got four threads on it

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.410 
overlocker that's got four threads on it
generally<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:01.770> wouldn't<00:04:02.040> over<00:04:03.030> lock<00:04:03.210> the

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
generally you wouldn't over lock the

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.150 
generally you wouldn't over lock the

edge of something with four threads in
your<00:04:05.190> overlocker<00:04:05.760> just<00:04:06.150> convert<00:04:06.510> it<00:04:06.540> back<00:04:06.870> to

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
your overlocker just convert it back to

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.900 
your overlocker just convert it back to

stitch<00:04:12.330> when<00:04:12.630> you're<00:04:12.900> sewing<00:04:13.560> or<00:04:14.040> creating

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
stitch when you're sewing or creating

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.360 
stitch when you're sewing or creating
stretch<00:04:15.300> fabric<00:04:16.489> so<00:04:17.489> with<00:04:18.060> this<00:04:18.480> there's<00:04:19.019> a

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
stretch fabric so with this there's a

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.310 
stretch fabric so with this there's a
stitch<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.700> looks<00:04:21.060> very<00:04:21.330> much<00:04:21.660> well<00:04:22.110> very

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
stitch it looks very much well very

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.600 
stitch it looks very much well very
similar<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:22.980> normal<00:04:23.520> stitch<00:04:23.840> on<00:04:24.890> the<00:04:25.890> very

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
similar to a normal stitch on the very

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.240 
similar to a normal stitch on the very
edge<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:27.420> you're<00:04:28.200> going<00:04:28.410> to<00:04:28.650> just<00:04:28.860> release

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
edge and you're going to just release

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.810 
edge and you're going to just release
that<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:30.720> once<00:04:31.380> you've<00:04:31.560> got<00:04:31.740> hold<00:04:32.040> of<00:04:32.160> it<00:04:32.340> just

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
that and once you've got hold of it just

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.190 
that and once you've got hold of it just
give<00:04:33.000> it<00:04:33.090> a<00:04:33.150> pulse<00:04:33.390> you<00:04:33.630> notice<00:04:33.960> that<00:04:34.140> I

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
give it a pulse you notice that I

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.800 
give it a pulse you notice that I
actually<00:04:34.670> clipped<00:04:35.670> off<00:04:35.940> one<00:04:36.240> end<00:04:36.510> where<00:04:36.750> I

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
actually clipped off one end where I

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.930 
actually clipped off one end where I
want<00:04:37.170> it<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.470> stop<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.070> then<00:04:38.280> I'm<00:04:38.460> just<00:04:38.520> going

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.430 
want it to stop and then I'm just going
to<00:04:39.000> pull<00:04:39.270> that<00:04:39.480> through<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:40.110> once<00:04:40.290> you've

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
to pull that through and once you've

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.520 
to pull that through and once you've
done<00:04:40.620> that<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:41.070> overlocking<00:04:41.460> comes<00:04:41.820> away<00:04:42.530> so

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
done that the overlocking comes away so

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.410 
done that the overlocking comes away so
I'm<00:04:43.710> going<00:04:43.920> to<00:04:43.980> do<00:04:44.160> that<00:04:44.370> again<00:04:44.670> for<00:04:44.700> you<00:04:45.120> just

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
actually to release the thread that's in

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.700 
actually to release the thread that's in
the<00:04:52.890> middle<00:04:54.830> which<00:04:55.830> is<00:04:56.010> the<00:04:56.160> fourth<00:04:56.430> thread<00:04:57.710> or

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
are going to do this there's actually a

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.540 
are going to do this there's actually a
right<00:05:07.200> side<00:05:07.440> in<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.620> wrong<00:05:07.800> side<00:05:08.040> to<00:05:08.070> do<00:05:08.340> this

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
right side in the wrong side to do this

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.400 
right side in the wrong side to do this
so<00:05:08.850> if<00:05:09.090> you<00:05:09.240> started<00:05:09.660> to<00:05:09.750> try<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:10.050> do<00:05:10.169> it<00:05:10.290> on

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
so if you started to try and do it on

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.900 
so if you started to try and do it on
the<00:05:10.500> other<00:05:10.530> side<00:05:10.919> like<00:05:11.130> I'm<00:05:11.340> showing<00:05:11.669> you<00:05:11.760> now

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
the other side like I'm showing you now

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.430 
the other side like I'm showing you now
see<00:05:12.180> how<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.390> overlocking<00:05:12.900> pulls<00:05:13.230> together

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
see how the overlocking pulls together

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.520 
see how the overlocking pulls together
you<00:05:14.340> know<00:05:14.520> that<00:05:14.700> that's<00:05:14.910> wrong<00:05:15.320> so<00:05:16.320> come

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
you know that that's wrong so come

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.040 
you know that that's wrong so come
around<00:05:16.830> to<00:05:17.160> this<00:05:17.490> side<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:18.180> then<00:05:18.480> just<00:05:18.780> grab

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
around to this side and then just grab

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.810 
around to this side and then just grab
the<00:05:19.080> hold<00:05:19.530> of<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:20.280> right<00:05:20.490> stitch<00:05:21.210> just<00:05:22.820> that

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
the hold of the right stitch just that

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.760 
the hold of the right stitch just that
one<00:05:24.000> there<00:05:24.270> and<00:05:24.570> you'll<00:05:25.110> see<00:05:25.290> because<00:05:25.650> it

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
one there and you'll see because it

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.610 
one there and you'll see because it
loops<00:05:26.010> through<00:05:26.190> all<00:05:26.760> the<00:05:26.970> others<00:05:27.300> and<00:05:27.620> then

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
loops through all the others and then

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.100 
loops through all the others and then
just<00:05:28.950> give<00:05:29.130> that<00:05:29.340> a<00:05:29.370> pull<00:05:29.870> all<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:31.080> way

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
just give that a pull all the way

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.440 
just give that a pull all the way
through<00:05:31.590> and<00:05:31.950> then<00:05:32.580> the<00:05:32.760> overlocking<00:05:33.180> will

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
through and then the overlocking will

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:43.439 
through and then the overlocking will
come<00:05:33.600> off<00:05:34.340> happy<00:05:35.340> all<00:05:35.460> tureen

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.509 

you
