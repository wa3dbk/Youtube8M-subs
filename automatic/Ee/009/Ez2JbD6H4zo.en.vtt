00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
hi my name is Mark Peterson I'm coming

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.850 
hi my name is Mark Peterson I'm coming
from<00:00:23.759> Switzerland<00:00:24.390> here<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.110> nowhere<00:00:25.560> for<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
from Switzerland here in nowhere for a

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.249 
from Switzerland here in nowhere for a
couple<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.279> days<00:00:26.460> fishing<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.060> tying<00:00:27.329> so<00:00:28.079> what

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
couple of days fishing and tying so what

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.380 
couple of days fishing and tying so what
I'm<00:00:28.380> going<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.680> show<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.009> now<00:00:29.340> it's<00:00:29.759> three

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
I'm going to show you now it's three

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.290 
I'm going to show you now it's three
different<00:00:30.960> pattern<00:00:31.469> using<00:00:31.919> CDC<00:00:32.489> very<00:00:32.790> simple

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
different pattern using CDC very simple

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.840 
different pattern using CDC very simple
you<00:00:33.510> will<00:00:33.660> see<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:34.079> easy<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:35.309> first<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.730> all

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
you will see it's easy so first of all

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.540 
you will see it's easy so first of all
we<00:00:36.120> will<00:00:36.239> start<00:00:36.420> by<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> caddis<00:00:37.350> pattern<00:00:37.800> for

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
we will start by a caddis pattern for

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.180 
we will start by a caddis pattern for
that<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:39.000> will<00:00:39.480> use<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.950> short<00:00:40.950> hook<00:00:41.420> which<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
that I will use a short hook which is a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.229 
that I will use a short hook which is a
tempo<00:00:44.190> 100<00:00:45.120> size<00:00:45.899> 14<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.730> we<00:00:47.730> will<00:00:47.910> make<00:00:48.210> a

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
tempo 100 size 14 and we will make a

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.350 
tempo 100 size 14 and we will make a
very<00:00:48.810> basic<00:00:49.290> pattern<00:00:50.010> using<00:00:50.460> three<00:00:50.820> CDC

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
very basic pattern using three CDC

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.979 
very basic pattern using three CDC
feathers<00:00:51.770> so<00:00:52.770> first<00:00:53.130> of<00:00:53.280> all<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:54.329> start<00:00:54.390> with

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
feathers so first of all you start with

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.330 
feathers so first of all you start with
tying<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.950> thread<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.720> okay<00:00:57.720> now<00:00:58.070> I<00:00:59.070> will

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
tying the thread in okay now I will

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.789 
tying the thread in okay now I will
select<00:01:00.030> one<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.750> those<00:01:01.370> base<00:01:02.630> CDC<00:01:03.630> now<00:01:04.439> another

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
select one of those base CDC now another

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.090 
select one of those base CDC now another
one<00:01:05.070> which<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.869> blue<00:01:06.869> done<00:01:07.759> like<00:01:08.759> this<00:01:09.090> and

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
one which is a blue done like this and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.020 
one which is a blue done like this and
then<00:01:11.100> we'll<00:01:11.579> use<00:01:12.210> another<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.350> which<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
then we'll use another one which is the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.599 
then we'll use another one which is the
darker<00:01:15.450> one<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:16.530> one<00:01:16.799> Col<00:01:19.850> like<00:01:20.850> dark<00:01:21.420> brown

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:22.609 
darker one this one Col like dark brown

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.940 
darker one this one Col like dark brown
so<00:01:23.609> the<00:01:23.969> idea<00:01:24.389> is<00:01:24.450> very<00:01:24.630> simple<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.530> pretty

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
so the idea is very simple it's pretty

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.520 
so the idea is very simple it's pretty
hard<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.459> use<00:01:26.789> CDC<00:01:27.420> feathers<00:01:27.929> because<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
hard to use CDC feathers because the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.830 
hard to use CDC feathers because the
stem<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.039> very<00:01:29.069> conical<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.209> can<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:30.600> very

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
stem is very conical and it can be very

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.789 
stem is very conical and it can be very
weak<00:01:31.380> at<00:01:31.649> this<00:01:31.950> point<00:01:32.279> and<00:01:32.579> very<00:01:33.200> stick<00:01:34.200> here

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
weak at this point and very stick here

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.730 
weak at this point and very stick here
very<00:01:35.130> strong<00:01:35.249> at<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.819> point<00:01:36.149> so<00:01:36.869> what<00:01:37.109> I<00:01:37.139> do<00:01:37.289> I

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
very strong at this point so what I do I

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.639 
very strong at this point so what I do I
use<00:01:38.249> the<00:01:38.459> magic<00:01:38.819> tool<00:01:39.029> which<00:01:39.600> allows<00:01:39.990> us<00:01:40.380> in

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
use the magic tool which allows us in

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.789 
use the magic tool which allows us in
fact<00:01:41.039> to<00:01:41.759> use<00:01:41.789> all<00:01:42.209> the<00:01:42.389> barbs<00:01:42.779> and<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.289> get<00:01:43.469> rid

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
fact to use all the barbs and to get rid

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.160 
fact to use all the barbs and to get rid
of<00:01:43.859> the<00:01:44.159> stem<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.479> first<00:01:45.749> thing<00:01:45.929> you<00:01:46.079> have

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
of the stem so the first thing you have

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.179 
of the stem so the first thing you have
to<00:01:46.380> do<00:01:46.529> is<00:01:46.709> to<00:01:46.979> take<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:48.289> CDC<00:01:49.289> by<00:01:49.469> the<00:01:49.529> small

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
to do is to take the CDC by the small

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.489 
to do is to take the CDC by the small
section<00:01:50.639> here<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.119> with<00:01:51.749> your<00:01:51.959> two<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.349> the

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:52.499 
section here and with your two of the

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:55.370 
section here and with your two of the
fingers<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.670> put<00:01:53.700> about<00:01:54.240> 90<00:01:54.810> degrees<00:01:55.170> from

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
fingers you put about 90 degrees from

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.279 
fingers you put about 90 degrees from
the<00:01:55.469> stand<00:01:55.889> you<00:01:56.819> repeat<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.479> same<00:01:57.749> procedure

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
the stand you repeat the same procedure

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.120 
the stand you repeat the same procedure
on<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.770> second<00:01:59.219> feather<00:01:59.459> and<00:02:00.619> then<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:01.889> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
on the second feather and then on the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.669 
on the second feather and then on the
third<00:02:02.159> feather<00:02:02.929> like<00:02:03.929> this<00:02:04.579> now<00:02:05.749> you<00:02:06.749> put<00:02:07.079> the

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
third feather like this now you put the

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.059 
third feather like this now you put the
all<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.729> feather<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> same<00:02:09.690> position<00:02:10.530> so

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
all the feather in the same position so

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.600 
all the feather in the same position so
that<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.520> like<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.599> like<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.560> kind<00:02:14.459> of

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
that is like this like this kind of

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.199 
that is like this like this kind of
natural<00:02:15.030> curve<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.349> now<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:16.739> use<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.760> table

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
natural curve and now I use the table

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.420 
natural curve and now I use the table
clip<00:02:18.480> which<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.080> most<00:02:19.290> appropriate<00:02:19.530> to

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
clip which is the most appropriate to

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.630 
clip which is the most appropriate to
the<00:02:20.550> side<00:02:20.819> of<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.810> feather<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.250> little

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
the side of the feather this is a little

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.420 
the side of the feather this is a little
bit<00:02:23.820> too<00:02:24.000> small<00:02:24.270> put<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.870> on<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.140> side<00:02:25.440> this<00:02:26.250> is

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
bit too small put it on the side this is

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
bit too small put it on the side this is
the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.140 
the
perfect<00:02:28.050> table<00:02:28.560> according<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.700> length<00:02:29.910> of

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
perfect table according to the length of

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.220 
perfect table according to the length of
the<00:02:30.840> feathers<00:02:31.459> pull<00:02:32.459> on<00:02:32.640> both<00:02:32.670> sides<00:02:33.209> drop<00:02:34.020> in

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
the feathers pull on both sides drop in

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.400 
the feathers pull on both sides drop in
and<00:02:34.470> as<00:02:35.099> you<00:02:35.310> see<00:02:35.520> here<00:02:35.940> both<00:02:36.720> sides<00:02:37.050> gets

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
and as you see here both sides gets

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.130 
and as you see here both sides gets
together<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:39.000> only<00:02:39.180> thing<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.450> have<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:39.780> do<00:02:39.930> now

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
together the only thing I have to do now

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.449 
together the only thing I have to do now
is<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.650> trim<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.220> excess<00:02:41.610> here<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.660> here<00:02:43.410> now

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
is to trim the excess here and here now

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.979 
is to trim the excess here and here now
we<00:02:44.970> transfer<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:46.250> transparent<00:02:47.250> clip<00:02:47.989> like

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
we transfer to the transparent clip like

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.190 
we transfer to the transparent clip like
this<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.590> as<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.640> see<00:02:50.880> here<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.660> stems<00:02:51.989> are

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
this and as you see here the stems are

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.620 
this and as you see here the stems are
nicely<00:02:52.470> line<00:02:52.980> up<00:02:53.160> that's<00:02:53.730> mean<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.420> will

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
nicely line up that's mean that it will

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.870 
nicely line up that's mean that it will
be<00:02:54.780> very<00:02:55.110> easy<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.500> frame<00:02:55.950> all<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.400> stem<00:02:56.640> at

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
be very easy to frame all the stem at

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.220 
be very easy to frame all the stem at
once<00:02:57.330> like<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.819> and<00:02:59.819> now<00:03:00.150> we<00:03:00.209> are<00:03:00.480> ready<00:03:00.720> to

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
once like this and now we are ready to

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.930 
once like this and now we are ready to
tie<00:03:01.440> in<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:02.630> material<00:03:04.489> personally<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.519> do<00:03:05.670> not

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
tie in the material personally I do not

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.479 
tie in the material personally I do not
use<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.390> dubbing<00:03:06.750> loop<00:03:06.780> technique<00:03:07.440> because<00:03:08.130> I

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
use the dubbing loop technique because I

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.150 
use the dubbing loop technique because I
prefer<00:03:09.000> much<00:03:09.360> better<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:10.319> split<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.890> thread

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
prefer much better to split the thread

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.979 
prefer much better to split the thread
this<00:03:11.850> is<00:03:12.030> what<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:12.239> do<00:03:12.390> now

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
this is what I do now

this is what I do now
so<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.620> flap<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.250> thread<00:03:14.549> and<00:03:14.790> then<00:03:15.360> using

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
so you flap the thread and then using

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.390 
so you flap the thread and then using
your<00:03:17.090> needle<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.720> can<00:03:18.750> split<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:20.100> thread

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
your needle you can split the thread

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.759 
your needle you can split the thread
like<00:03:20.819> this<00:03:22.910> now<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:23.970> introduce<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.260> Akal

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
like this now you introduce the Akal

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.130 
like this now you introduce the Akal
substitute<00:03:26.519> that<00:03:27.360> way<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:28.489> very<00:03:29.489> important

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
substitute that way and very important

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.130 
substitute that way and very important
first<00:03:31.400> just<00:03:32.400> do<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.570> secure<00:03:33.989> that

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
first just do that to secure that

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.569 
first just do that to secure that
everything<00:03:34.680> will<00:03:34.859> stay<00:03:35.100> together

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
everything will stay together

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.289 
everything will stay together
now<00:03:36.359> I<00:03:36.720> can<00:03:37.530> take<00:03:37.769> 10<00:03:38.100> centimeters<00:03:38.790> out<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.150> the

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
now I can take 10 centimeters out of the

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.170 
now I can take 10 centimeters out of the
bobbin<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.780> spin<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.500> bobbin<00:03:40.799> holder<00:03:41.180> when

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
bobbin and spin the bobbin holder when

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.650 
bobbin and spin the bobbin holder when
you've<00:03:42.359> got<00:03:42.600> enough<00:03:42.989> twists<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:44.040> stop<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.730> as

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
you've got enough twists you stop and as

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.440 
you've got enough twists you stop and as
the<00:03:46.530> twists<00:03:46.950> are<00:03:47.130> from<00:03:47.400> here<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.850> here<00:03:48.120> now<00:03:48.420> I

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
the twists are from here to here now I

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.150 
the twists are from here to here now I
want<00:03:49.320> to<00:03:49.410> add<00:03:49.709> them<00:03:49.950> here<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.489> just<00:03:51.060> do<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:52.160> if

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
want to add them here I just do that if

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.840 
want to add them here I just do that if
I<00:03:53.370> release<00:03:53.790> they<00:03:54.420> are<00:03:54.540> gone<00:03:54.750> so<00:03:55.140> I<00:03:55.459> rewind<00:03:56.459> in

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
I release they are gone so I rewind in

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.420 
I release they are gone so I rewind in
the<00:03:57.269> bobbin<00:03:57.720> holder<00:03:57.750> like<00:03:58.290> this<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.859> as<00:03:59.400> you

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
the bobbin holder like this and as you

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.140 
the bobbin holder like this and as you
see<00:03:59.880> they<00:04:00.150> stay<00:04:00.390> stacked<00:04:00.870> here<00:04:01.670> so<00:04:02.670> now<00:04:02.910> let's

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
see they stay stacked here so now let's

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.840 
see they stay stacked here so now let's
go<00:04:03.329> you<00:04:03.540> go<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:04.049> little<00:04:04.350> bit<00:04:04.650> backward<00:04:05.250> create

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
go you go a little bit backward create

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.090 
go you go a little bit backward create
the<00:04:06.030> body<00:04:06.269> like<00:04:06.570> this<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.019> then<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.890> finish

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
the body like this and then to finish

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.390 
the body like this and then to finish
the<00:04:08.880> wing<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.359> use<00:04:09.989> your<00:04:10.230> two<00:04:10.500> fingers<00:04:10.980> to

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
the wing you use your two fingers to

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.789 
the wing you use your two fingers to
invite<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:12.000> fibers<00:04:12.569> to<00:04:12.810> go<00:04:12.959> backward<00:04:13.470> that

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
invite the fibers to go backward that

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.960 
invite the fibers to go backward that
way<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:14.280> now<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.329> have<00:04:15.750> a<00:04:16.019> nice<00:04:16.970> silhouette

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
way and now you have a nice silhouette

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.009 
way and now you have a nice silhouette
of<00:04:18.479> a<00:04:19.140> caddis<00:04:19.859> pattern<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:20.489> this<00:04:21.060> is<00:04:21.299> really

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
of a caddis pattern and this is really

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.440 
of a caddis pattern and this is really
quick<00:04:24.410> use<00:04:25.410> your<00:04:25.440> finisher<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.360> couple<00:04:27.360> of

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
quick use your finisher a couple of

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.540 
quick use your finisher a couple of
wraps

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
wraps

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.830 
wraps
then<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.450> second<00:04:30.960> one<00:04:31.130> it's<00:04:32.130> always<00:04:32.550> good<00:04:32.850> you

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
then a second one it's always good you

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.870 
then a second one it's always good you
can<00:04:34.050> pull<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.350> little<00:04:34.770> bit<00:04:34.950> more<00:04:35.220> on<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.460> second

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
can pull a little bit more on the second

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.660 
can pull a little bit more on the second
one<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.450> so<00:04:37.170> if<00:04:37.440> it<00:04:37.650> breaks<00:04:37.920> you<00:04:38.280> still<00:04:38.520> have

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
one and so if it breaks you still have

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.910 
one and so if it breaks you still have
something<00:04:39.290> now<00:04:40.700> trim<00:04:42.260> you<00:04:43.260> can<00:04:43.440> now<00:04:43.650> adjust

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
something now trim you can now adjust

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.540 
something now trim you can now adjust
the<00:04:44.250> length<00:04:44.840> all<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:46.170> fibers<00:04:46.590> together<00:04:46.800> one

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
the length all the fibers together one

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.800 
the length all the fibers together one
cut<00:04:47.820> and<00:04:48.560> if<00:04:49.560> you<00:04:49.950> are<00:04:50.100> on<00:04:50.310> I<00:04:50.850> would<00:04:51.420> say<00:04:51.630> very

cut and if you are on I would say very

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.140 
cut and if you are on I would say very

calm water I prefer much better to fly

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.250 
calm water I prefer much better to fly
