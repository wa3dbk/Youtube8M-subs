00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.950
 to the girls how are they on this occasion 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.870
 I want to show you how to do this 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.820
 hairstyle is a hairstyle made with 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.740
 braids for you to go out on the street 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.450
 very very cool in these times where already 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.430
 does a little more heat this is a 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.199
 collaboration with my friend and like 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.850
 down in the description of the video you 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.860
 I leave all the links to your channel and your 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.689
 video we decided to do something inspired by 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.460
 spring I happened to do 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.589
 reign and she made us a beautiful 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.719
 makeup I recommend you obviously in 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:40.789
 your channel the truth that has some videos 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.559
 very very nice and especially the videos 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.659
 of makeup makes some makeups 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.920
 incredible now let's see how it 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:48.570
 does this hairstyle 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.280
 let's leave an ice cream party and 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.199
 we separated the lock in front of 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.199
 work behind our ear 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.420
 We will keep this lock for a 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.659
 I've done all your hair back 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.040
 and make a French braid for your neck 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.710
 begins separating a lock and what 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.590
 you divide in three the one below you take it to 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.259
 in the middle then the one above also to 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.830
 in the middle and repeat the bottom half 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:20.229
 if you add hair to this one and then 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.229
 the one above adding hair too 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.490
 and you keep doing this with all the rest 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.180
 see that the hair is always added 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.630
 to the lock of middle from above and 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.630
 from below 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.869
 and you end up weaving a normal braid 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.119
 hold this braid with a garter I will use 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.039
 the same one that I had in the other lock of 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.960
 preference uses one of those leagues that 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.240
 they are like plastic so super 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.750
 little ones, the more discreet the better 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.049
 there will be a braid similar to this one 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.510
 in the other strand we will make another braid 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:16.060
 this time it will be this normal of these 3 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.129
 but taking care that it is loose and 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.310
 while we weave it we do it towards 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.310
 behind 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.150
 this time I was without leagues to the hand like this 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.890
 that holds my braid with pins but 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.460
 same is better with a league of those 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.460
 little girls 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.840
 let's take the first braid and go 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.770
 to take backwards thus making a 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.770
 very nice chongo 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:48.230
 You must ensure your hairstyle very well so 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.230
 that I will use enough pins 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.470
 when you have put all the braid on you 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.470
 the tips will be free 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.390
 it is not necessary that you remove the league 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.030
 unless, as in my case, you have used 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.520
 a discrete nothing then you should 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.340
 remove it 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.250
 enter your index finger in this way 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.370
 and pull those tips to leave them hidden 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.140
 between your chongo if you want to make sure 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.390
 that they will not make an appearance 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.530
 improper place the is another pin for 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.530
 that they stay in their place 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.090
 the other braid we are going to take 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.830
 above the above and also the 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.830
 we hold using pins 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.600
 then we will do the same to hide the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.600
 tips of this other braid 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.489
 and ready something like that you have the hairstyle 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.190
 it will allow you to feel very fresh 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.900
 female with bohemian chic touch 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.849
 you liked the hairstyle you liked the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.650

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.840

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.340
 that we have the id light video is not 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.659

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.280
 true that you will love the 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.930
 makeup that she prepared us but 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.760
