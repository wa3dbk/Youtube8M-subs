 only the prince 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.759
 the vizier and the princess farah remain unchanged thanks to their possessions 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.119
 behind the prince 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.660

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.250

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.510

 the prince to find her fighting with some sand monsters she is 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.300
 pushed but the prince tries to save the one from a fall to death 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.710
 failing 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.790
 then the parade appears and tells the prince to give him the fairies but 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.620
 furious he says 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.850
 we follow 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.850
 yes this joint effort 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.500
 10 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:14.400
 Bulls 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.999
 returning the time to the moment just before the battle against the low majÃ¡ 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:22.180
 goes to warn farah about the betrayal of the vizier 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.019
 explaining in this part the beginning of the game where it appears is outside of 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.979
 farah's room when you put a new game 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:32.519
 When he finished telling him everything, the vizier and the prince arrived 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.040
 willing to defend for 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.180
 since I was still in love with her 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.239
 he wins 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.840
 in the end Farah asks why he had invented this story so 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.769
 childish to what the prince kisses but farras annoys so the 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.040
 Prince recoils the time before the kiss hahahaha 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.959
 that stupid and he feels like it 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.719
 that's where the story ended 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:55.319
 now let's go to make an analysis about the characteristics of the game 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:56.989
 the graphics 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.489
 many would think that now these graphics are not a big deal 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.089
 but in their times they were very innovative and of very high quality 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:07.519
 the gameplay here is nothing to say more than perfect 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.849
 the acrobatics and attacks that can be done in the game are impressive 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.999
 the sound the soundtrack is very set at every moment and it makes you 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.909
 feel part of the story about the dubbing was also very good 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.049
 the voices will be the guests and add a feeling to the game 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.129
 they even sometimes added humor 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.599
 as when the prince renegaba de farah 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.329
 The only thing I did not like about the game was the camera 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.029
 it often made me confuse 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:36.079
 but hey that was safe because he was a rookie 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.930
 there's nothing more to say, you just realize that 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:40.669
 play it and 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:41.819
 if it does not play 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.949
 do yourself a favor and do not be subnormal 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.069
 but low but that's all 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.849
 I hope you enjoyed the video as much as I enjoyed playing the game 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.340
 'See you later' xd
