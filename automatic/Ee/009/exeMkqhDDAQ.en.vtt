00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.020
 good 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.289
 If I were a judge, I would ask myself how 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.759
 judge 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.070
 forget that I won the minister 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:27.090
 clean and all that and let's say that 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.820
 as a judge I feel and I wonder what 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.089
 body I want to have that is what I sum 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.910
 everything and I think Cedric had a 

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:39.120
 very beautiful body was so proportionate 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.130
 which I think should have been more 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.440
 high of what was left 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:48.060
 and unless we change the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.500
 procedure for assessing the 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:55.140
 judges and unless we do something to 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.800
 to stop rewarding athletes 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.130
 the thickest necks and muscles 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.440
 bigger ones that are not so nice to 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.070
 see why look at the old days 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.700
 when steve reluctance when steve 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.640
 reluctance and see him on the beach he said 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.150
 sat and same I would love to have the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.370
 body of that uncle 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:24.370
 wow look how beautiful that man is 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.720
 but that is not a thing that can be 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.840
 say now of those who earn the 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.750
 competitions and then what I 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.940
 I tried to say to the judges is that they have 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:39.010
 to look and consider everything for example 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.700
 now many of the contestants have 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.190
 the gut pulled out what is that 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.390
 used to be that the body had to have 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:52.660
 a form of v now what I know is how 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.680
 a type of body shaped like a bottle or 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.230
 something like that is it 's a weird thing that's 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.170
 happening that the scenario that nobody can 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:05.650
 have or put in your stomach 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.450
 for a long period of time and be 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.340
 on stage with an abdominal vacuum 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.350
 with the shoulders out and look athletic 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.900
 then it's like all this that the 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.650
 stomach is pulled out and that 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.720
 everything else that is no longer correct by 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.220
 we have to make sure that 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.140
 we reward the right people 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.330
 since if we reward people 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.310
 correct everyone will return to 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.770
 train to have a beautiful body other 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.770
 instead of a body of power gift 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.290
 we have given him a prize of 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.799
 recognition to yemanjÃ¡ 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.950
 but that does not mean we have to 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.280
 agree with him because he is 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.549
 in charge of the evaluation of the judges 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.040
 he is responsible for choosing the judges and 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:00.760
 we all have to talk to him to 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.950
 through magazines over the internet or 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.299
 by any means of communication that 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.180
 let's talk about him and the judges 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:13.269
 because that's how the change is created 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.680
 talking about getting involved and saying that 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.920
 the way the 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.239
 Bodybuilding is unacceptable we do not want 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.900
 see the biggest ones up there 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:26.340
 we want to see the most beautiful man more 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.340
 athletic on stage
