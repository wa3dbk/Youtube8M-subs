00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the first versions the Japanese only I

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.999 
the first versions the Japanese only I

American<00:01:26.520> versions<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.060> these<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.479> think<00:01:27.509> there

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
American versions of these I think there

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.539 
American versions of these I think there
might<00:01:28.080> be<00:01:28.140> an<00:01:28.500> American<00:01:28.890> blue<00:01:29.100> eyes<00:01:29.280> they

were<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.750> two<00:01:57.750> people<00:01:57.990> would<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.229> I

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
were like a two people would have I

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.399 
were like a two people would have I
guess<00:01:58.560> forty<00:01:58.920> card<00:01:59.100> decks<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.670> these<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.409> they

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.050 
guess forty card decks of these and they
battled<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.950> course<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.250> know<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:02.909> do
