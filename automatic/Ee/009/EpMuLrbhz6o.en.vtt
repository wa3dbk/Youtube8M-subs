now why say specialist is because if

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.020 
now why say specialist is because if
you're<00:02:03.899> getting<00:02:04.229> an<00:02:04.350> 8<00:02:04.560> killstreak<00:02:05.100> average

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you're getting an 8 killstreak average

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.350 
you're getting an 8 killstreak average
per<00:02:06.659> game<00:02:06.960> with<00:02:07.590> your<00:02:07.740> gun<00:02:08.149> definitely<00:02:09.149> run

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
per game with your gun definitely run

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.820 
per game with your gun definitely run

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
getting 50 kill of 50 points for a kill

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.480 
getting 50 kill of 50 points for a kill
and<00:02:20.970> kill<00:02:21.720> confirmed<00:02:21.990> for<00:02:22.440> example<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.070> will

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
and kill confirmed for example you will

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.000 
and kill confirmed for example you will
get<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.640> hundred<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:25.050> this<00:02:25.410> stacks<00:02:25.800> up

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
get a hundred and so this stacks up

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.040 
get a hundred and so this stacks up
really<00:02:26.400> quickly<00:02:26.730> if<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.180> are<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.360> solid<00:02:27.660> player

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
really quickly if you are a solid player

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.770 
really quickly if you are a solid player
and<00:02:28.260> can<00:02:28.410> get<00:02:28.560> high<00:02:29.100> killstreaks<00:02:29.780> specialist

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
and can get high killstreaks specialist

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.570 
and can get high killstreaks specialist
is<00:02:30.900> definitely<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.530> way<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.650> go<00:02:31.770> if<00:02:32.190> you're

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580
