00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.139
 a super cool story with you 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.920
 the speedlite transmitter one 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.970
 lightning device and a canon 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.470
 can make as spiegelreflexkamera 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.830
 I'll show you this movie now 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.330
 important at the camera or very much 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.600
 helpful if it is a camera 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.279
 which appeared on the market in 2012 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.840
 if you are with an older camera 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.740
 they still need to do something 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.180
 additional cable that here the 650 daddys in 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.180
 Published in 2012 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.190
 that means it goes without saying 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.930
 accessories and although the trick is the following 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.180
 in the speedlite transmitter the stables 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.170
 much on the radio mode an see 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.260
 that up here on the little symbol 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.239
 all devices and flash mode etl 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.010
 that's all there is to it 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.100
 and then they can do that 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.289
 transmitters are stuck on the cameras 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.059
 there somewhere a flashgun in the 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.020
 must be near what the radio connection 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.970
 already taken up 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.770
 you can see that up here on the green 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.830
 light leyen at the link symbol is the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.020
 So I'm preparing for that 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.170
 camera on it and locks that 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.390
 of course, although the danger 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.069
 when the camera is on the table that 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.280
 Of course, there's nothing falling down now 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:27.080
 it is great but it is always best 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.640
 to do the same then they can 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.590
 be sure if you always the same 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.630
 Do not make a mistake on the device 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.110
 camera on it is then it is synonymous 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.679
 locked that is ready to look now 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.069
 we look at the lightning in the now 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:46.399
 Group a that 's ok because yes the 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:48.619
 transmitter on all channels at all 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.910
 is set the group is that is the 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.190
 receive the signal that we have now 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.470
 here also on the flash unit that the 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.970
 just the connection to the 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.070
 has built up transmitter it is green 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.650
 the radio link the symbol we have 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.520
 up here in the corner so far is yes 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.540
 everything is still normal and I could 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.500
 now also from the camera trigger and 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:14.760
 I can do that 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.440
 and the lightning flashes that's the normal one 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.960
 applications so i can light up 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.120
 keep my motive to make 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.770
 any stand on it and stood 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.030
 I go to the camera and flash and if 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.740
 The exposure is not great now 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.110
 that I say I would like one 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.010
 correction then i can do that on the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.709
 set and correct the transmitter 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.590
 but the contribution is about one 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:41.010
 special function you go into the menu of 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.520
 lightning device and not in the first 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.970
 but find the second menu and there 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.810
 you have a position on the far left 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.120
 there is then rell on it and the button 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.920
 is crucial in this position if 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.770
 Now this button 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.510
 I can now press on that 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.170
 lightning the camera trigger 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.540
 an incredibly cool thing namely 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.800
 if you are further away from the camera 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.910
 Can you handle larger items 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.940
 take pictures by doing what you do 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.459
 at the beginning of the analogue photography 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.440
 Wander light called it going around 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.480
 motivate and illuminate it from all over 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.190
 press different angles 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.320
 Every time here on the on the 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.549
 trigger button becomes virtually every time 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.620
 a shot taken with the 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.000
 different light situations and 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.709
 then you can at the computer 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.019
 these photos with the part 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.840
 Composing an exposure that works 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.700
 quite simply because the pictures only 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.769
 distinguish that where the 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.840
 lightning fell hit the picture is part 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.640
 what element of what the lightning illuminates 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.140
 that's brighter than everyone else 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.150
 For example , they can be in there 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.860
 photoshop if you can use that 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.440
 they lighten the mode at the levels 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.959
 use modes and then it goes with the 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.299
 FÃ¼ll way it goes quickly and so 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.040
 add practically the details to the 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.780
 they have lit up with the lightning and 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.690
 It is a technology that makes power 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.010
 unbelievably fun and vale 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.190
 stop synonymous through the radio connection 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.750
 a wide range of 20 to 30 meters 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.210
 they are actually possible 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.140
 even bigger items are unbelievable 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.600
 great light 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.549
 it is also possible indoors to do it 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.560
 So instead of building a giant 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.810
 You can also clear rooms in 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.270
 to illuminate this technology quickly 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.340
 It's so much fun when I do that 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.990
 I tried it the first time 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.120
 I can hardly believe my luck and I have that 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.580
 tried out there and also 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.930
 walkers passed by because of the 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.850
 have wondered what happens when 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.730
 Father with his daughter Lisa makes something 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.110
 the man as the father could that too 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.230
 not i could saxony would have been 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:46.630
 So great pictures with the technology 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.630
 trigger camera from lightning
