glossy on the front

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.869

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
maybe the matte on the back let me move

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.100 
can tell the new space gray color
contrasts<00:01:29.520> pretty<00:01:29.850> nicely<00:01:30.299> with<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.600> it's

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
contrasts pretty nicely with this it's

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.490 
contrasts pretty nicely with this it's
also<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.650> sides<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.369> covers<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.880> sides

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
also on the sides it covers the sides

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.149 
also on the sides it covers the sides
the<00:01:34.500> top<00:01:34.740> here<00:01:36.170> this<00:01:37.170> side<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.770> actually<00:01:37.950> a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the top here this side is actually a

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.649 
the top here this side is actually a
little<00:01:38.369> bit<00:01:38.460> difficult<00:01:38.700> because<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.390> three

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
little bit difficult because it's three

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.510 
little bit difficult because it's three
pieces<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.409> piece<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.920> little<00:01:41.310> tiny

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
pieces it's this piece a little tiny

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.969 
pieces it's this piece a little tiny
piece<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.119> then<00:01:42.210> another<00:01:42.420> piece<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.049> then<00:01:43.860> on

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
piece and then another piece and then on

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.859 
piece and then another piece and then on
the<00:01:44.070> bottom<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.970> probably<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.659> most

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
the bottom this is probably the most

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.569 
the bottom this is probably the most
difficult<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.560> apply<00:01:46.799> because<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.340> want<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
difficult to apply because you want to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.310 
difficult to apply because you want to
keep<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.939> water<00:01:48.149> out<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> speakers<00:01:49.110> and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
keep the water out of the speakers and

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.649 
keep the water out of the speakers and
then<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.490> front<00:01:50.670> as<00:01:50.909> well<00:01:50.939> it

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
then I have it on the front as well it

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.749 
then I have it on the front as well it
leaves<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.259> top<00:01:52.470> open<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:53.310> your<00:01:53.399> forward

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
leaves the top open for your forward

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.910 
leaves the top open for your forward
facing<00:01:53.970> camera<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.600> sensors<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:55.590> other<00:01:55.770> than

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
facing camera and sensors but other than

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.280 
facing camera and sensors but other than
that<00:01:56.009> you've<00:01:56.369> got<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.909> nice<00:01:57.479> screen<00:01:57.780> protector

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
that you've got a nice screen protector

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.319 
that you've got a nice screen protector
and<00:01:58.320> then<00:01:58.590> access<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.280> touch<00:01:59.460> ID<00:01:59.700> now<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
and then access to the touch ID now the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.969 
and then access to the touch ID now the
matte<00:02:00.570> finish<00:02:00.600> that's<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.350> front<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.740> not

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
matte finish that's on the front is not

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.859 
matte finish that's on the front is not
my<00:02:02.189> favorite<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.939> does<00:02:03.090> keep<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.570> screen

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
my favorite but it does keep the screen

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.109 
my favorite but it does keep the screen
from<00:02:04.079> having<00:02:04.409> glare<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.100> under<00:02:05.880> bright

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
from having glare on it under bright

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.270 
from having glare on it under bright
lights<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.570> we<00:02:06.689> have<00:02:06.810> here<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.320> can<00:02:07.560> see<00:02:07.799> you

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
lights like we have here you can see you

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.190 
lights like we have here you can see you
can<00:02:08.429> still<00:02:08.700> see<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.090> screen<00:02:09.390> nicely<00:02:09.810> even<00:02:09.989> in

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
can still see the screen nicely even in

can still see the screen nicely even in
glare<00:02:10.500> if<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.979> don't<00:02:11.160> like<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.550> can<00:02:11.849> use

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
glare if you don't like that you can use

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.350 
glare if you don't like that you can use
the<00:02:12.450> glossy<00:02:12.959> screen

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.320 
I've had no problems with it whatsoever
now<00:02:24.100> obviously<00:02:24.550> it's<00:02:24.700> not<00:02:24.820> going<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.150> offer

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
now obviously it's not going to offer

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.470 
now obviously it's not going to offer
much<00:02:25.930> protection<00:02:26.230> if<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.310> drop<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.640> but<00:02:28.330> it

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
much protection if you drop it but it

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.050 
much protection if you drop it but it
will<00:02:28.600> keep<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:29.080> from<00:02:29.380> being<00:02:30.010> scratched<00:02:30.220> it

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
will keep it from being scratched it

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.790 
will keep it from being scratched it
doesn't<00:02:31.420> cover<00:02:31.660> this<00:02:31.870> chamfered<00:02:32.410> edge<00:02:32.530> but<00:02:32.770> I

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
doesn't cover this chamfered edge but I

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.830 
doesn't cover this chamfered edge but I
haven't<00:02:33.040> seen<00:02:33.310> one<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.550> does<00:02:33.760> yet<00:02:34.210> and<00:02:34.450> you

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
haven't seen one that does yet and you

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.910 
haven't seen one that does yet and you
really<00:02:35.050> don't<00:02:35.140> have<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.350> worry<00:02:35.560> about<00:02:35.680> that

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
really don't have to worry about that

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.800 
really don't have to worry about that
too<00:02:36.160> much<00:02:36.190> as<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:36.910> have<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.120> little<00:02:37.360> bit<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.570> a

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
too much as you have a little bit of a

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.170 
too much as you have a little bit of a
extra<00:02:38.680> layer<00:02:38.860> on<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.190> side<00:02:39.430> here<00:02:39.700> in<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:39.880> back

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
extra layer on the side here in the back

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.030 
extra layer on the side here in the back
so<00:02:40.209> you<00:02:40.510> don't<00:02:40.750> really<00:02:40.900> tend<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.260> bump<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.770> I

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
so you don't really tend to bump that I
