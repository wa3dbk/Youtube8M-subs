 treated 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.040
 the judiciary is convinced that the main suspect had been planning for some time

 dirk post to bring life 

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:13.429
 and he did that in November 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.609
 when they and four boys were acquainted with each other in the tub forest 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:18.730
 body of the church 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.210
 with a day later found it was a murder says premeditated 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.679
 advice 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.060

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.650
 the fact that this moment has had to come to think and those two aspects 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.690
 sell together separately from each other 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.970
 It's just to get the suspects released 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.979
 he has it face to face or said the day himself 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:52.120
 days to be picked up here 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.360
 there is a difference moment that the city 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.840
 the boy's death caused a lot of emotions because it is about team first 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.750
 according to justice it is unclear why the suspect immediately died 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.690
 there are many motives in the us 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.010
 and it is difficult to say after which motive is true or not 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.320

 according to his lawyer was a part and the reason 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.720
 in a very remarkable way 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.940
 the boys 12 meet regularly on the skating track 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.210
 but they did say suspect sometimes on culture games

 turn the glass as it is called 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.340
 and that afternoon in the forest 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.460
 should have called upon themselves 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.460
 the four of us went into the forest 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.960

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.180
 Mr. Wilders finally got it afterwards 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.600
