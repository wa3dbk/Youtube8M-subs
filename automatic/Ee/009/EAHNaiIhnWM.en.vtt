the<00:00:14.509> lump<00:00:14.750> amps<00:00:15.139> if<00:00:15.320> you<00:00:15.519> have<00:00:16.519> a<00:00:16.550> key<00:00:16.939> there

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
the lump amps if you have a key there

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.620 
the lump amps if you have a key there
that<00:00:18.170> means<00:00:18.380> you<00:00:18.529> know<00:00:18.949> when<00:00:19.490> the<00:00:19.670> long<00:00:20.240> pimps

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
that means you know when the long pimps

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.820 
that means you know when the long pimps
push<00:00:21.080> it's<00:00:21.830> no<00:00:22.070> spin<00:00:22.400> and<00:00:22.609> you<00:00:23.599> loop<00:00:23.869> they<00:00:24.529> top

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
push it's no spin and you loop they top

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.419 
push it's no spin and you loop they top
back<00:00:25.039> is<00:00:25.310> backspin<00:00:26.090> so<00:00:27.050> okay<00:00:27.890> we're<00:00:28.279> going<00:00:28.369> to

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
back is backspin so okay we're going to

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.910 
back is backspin so okay we're going to
show<00:00:28.640> some<00:00:28.689> so<00:00:29.689> when<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:29.990> long<00:00:30.199> pimps<00:00:30.619> push

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
show some so when the long pimps push

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.000 
show some so when the long pimps push
this<00:00:31.310> one<00:00:31.609> that's<00:00:32.480> a<00:00:32.660> no<00:00:32.809> spin<00:00:35.680> this<00:00:36.680> one's

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
this one that's a no spin this one's

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.270 
this one that's a no spin this one's
bottom<00:00:37.550> spin<00:00:37.760> this<00:00:38.660> one's<00:00:38.960> no<00:00:39.260> spin<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:40.250> you

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
bottom spin this one's no spin so you

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.720 
bottom spin this one's no spin so you
are<00:00:40.579> they<00:00:40.789> know<00:00:40.820> it<00:00:41.260> now<00:00:42.260> I<00:00:42.590> try<00:00:43.219> to<00:00:43.250> push<00:00:43.700> you

looking for that that that's pinball
if<00:00:59.480> the<00:01:00.140> ball<00:01:00.379> that's<00:01:00.710> been<00:01:00.829> both<00:01:01.100> come<00:01:01.280> in

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
if the ball that's been both come in

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.060 
if the ball that's been both come in
you're<00:01:01.969> going<00:01:02.120> to<00:01:02.180> try<00:01:02.329> cue<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:02.989> game<00:01:03.199> oh<00:01:03.530> wait

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
you're going to try cue the game oh wait

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.270 
you're going to try cue the game oh wait
just<00:01:04.160> like<00:01:04.580> this<00:01:05.260> so<00:01:06.260> this<00:01:06.530> is<00:01:06.710> a<00:01:06.740> no<00:01:06.980> spin

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
just like this so this is a no spin

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.450 
just like this so this is a no spin
quantum<00:01:10.280> spin<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.690> this<00:01:11.930> one<00:01:12.280> you're<00:01:13.280> looking

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
quantum spin so this one you're looking

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.860 
quantum spin so this one you're looking
for<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:14.750> chopper<00:01:15.460> they<00:01:16.460> just<00:01:16.730> push<00:01:17.060> back<00:01:17.270> that

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
for the chopper they just push back that

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.310 
for the chopper they just push back that
one<00:01:18.140> is<00:01:18.320> that<00:01:18.650> it's<00:01:19.460> a<00:01:19.610> dead<00:01:19.820> spin<00:01:20.420> right<00:01:20.690> so

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
one is that it's a dead spin right so

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.800 
one is that it's a dead spin right so
deep<00:01:21.530> you<00:01:22.460> can<00:01:22.610> look<00:01:22.790> looking<00:01:23.240> for<00:01:23.420> this<00:01:23.570> one

or<00:02:16.430> kind<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.580> top<00:02:17.790> spin<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.630> you're<00:02:18.750> just

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
or kind of a top spin so you're just

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.670 
or kind of a top spin so you're just
looking<00:02:19.170> for<00:02:19.470> this<00:02:19.620> one<00:02:20.390> then<00:02:21.390> try<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.260> attack

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
looking for this one then try to attack

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.820 
looking for this one then try to attack
against<00:02:23.460> no<00:02:24.120> spin<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:25.200> no<00:02:25.380> spin<00:02:27.380> because<00:02:28.380> you

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
against no spin so no spin because you

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.940 
against no spin so no spin because you
know<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.340> long<00:02:29.550> pimps<00:02:30.320> when<00:02:31.320> they<00:02:31.440> push<00:02:31.650> back
