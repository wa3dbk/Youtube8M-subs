00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.490
 good not to depend on the big press 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.219
 and neither of the major publishers 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.570
 cartoonists end up investing in web 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.240
 comics published only on the internet 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:24.960
 like the acidic series of the gaucho 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:28.619
 cool milk to make comics 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.300
 for the web is the contact many times direct 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.260
 that we have with users with the 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.200
 readers 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.660
 then you often receive praise 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.489
 receives criticism 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.710
 also direct the right social networks 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.079
 and this very cool exchange for the chance 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.930
 and mother business, a lot of people from here 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.629
 Brazil has an art has all the blue guys 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.239
 economic but I like much more of a 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.489
 of the characters is a bit of a merican 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.980
 we have chario brown heel on the heel 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.809
 or dowry it is difficult to speak because it has one 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.280
 A lot of people who inspire us are not just 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.140
 comics that inspire are movies that 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.140
 inspire like tim burton very much 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.580
 destroy here comic matter 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.610
 always something critical that has the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.070
 see with my opinion of course you are 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.540
 approximately 240,000 followers in the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.409
 facebook is having a great time 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.030
 repercussion from the outset only 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.610
 have any am interested in the increase 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.439
 so I'll probably throw in a 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.539
 free and I've done it with 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.680
 two other projects I only have books 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.750
 independent 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.950
 Was this the way it used to be? 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.729
 a parody of the knights of the zodiac 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.649
 had at that time 34 years ago was 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.420
 a phenomenon on the internet 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:52.830
 I have another book here where to play. 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:55.619
 some focused off to Mom and 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.580
 monetize a site on my website 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.830
 so comics are having a 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.659
 repercussion has a good monthly average 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.610
 of visits but all that people 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.100
 got away with money with 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.959
 the advertiser is very little with what 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.269
 compare because I earn as the 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.690
 advertising illustration freelancer 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.790
 then launch a book to launch products from 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.709
 series is a possibility to achieve 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.130
 make money but to emphasize what you 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.130
 likes 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.390
 I dropped the production of advertising for 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.890
 to do this was in the sense that I am 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.200
 the less stressed the happier I am 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.010
 poorer but much happier that's not it 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.010
 You must tell a thing. 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.860
 very good
