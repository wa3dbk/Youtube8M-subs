 the shirt of the season 2010 2011 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.690
 you have a series of novelties with respect to the t-shirt of the season 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:11.929
 previous 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.599
 I would highlight mainly percent as 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:20.859
 Novelty more more prominent is the back of the shirt 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.349
 a window has been incorporated 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.749
 just as he has had more doing on the competition shirts 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:30.630
 European in the previous seasons 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.260
 another important detail that day the neck 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.650
 the last neck of closed red 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.740
 i popo what 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.610
 It's going to be a bridge 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.250
 White 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.850
 butcher and v-shaped a technological novelty that has ported in here to 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 the official kit as well as the rest of 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.410
 Teams of other clubs and teams tired during this year 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.280
 of the world 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.090
 has been 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.050
 good ecological use of recycling ie 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.930
 the one that these shirts have been made 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.650
 from d a recycling of plastic bottles also p are 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.650
 those 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.690
 what does it mean that 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.600
 the shirt absorbs 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.590
 the sweat that the athlete cd knew ready 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.650
 and it expels you this sweat through the venues of the pores of the fabric leaving 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.100
 to the player cd dry 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.490
 the leader without the shirt sticking to the body in short 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.970
 p the movement in each shirt we always like to make a wink hobby 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.200
 because the hobby is a very important part of our club let's say what 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.840
 that the hobby is this is the basis 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.680
 in which of us we sustain 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.120
 i always like to make this nod to the fictions we have incorporated 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.100
 in the back of the shield 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.950

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.270
 the emblem in which the position of 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.279
 we explain what at the level of hobby his visit to the club 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:16.069
 the phrase is a feeling a passion a pride 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:21.119
 it's true that the shirts have turned out 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:26.099

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.919
