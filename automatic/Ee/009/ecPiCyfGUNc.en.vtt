00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:10.839
 That's the way it was 168 she likes to post a lot. 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.679
 and make wall videos I played in the 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:14.499
 my 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:17.080
 this is just the case of serious 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.830
 There are six serious ones I decided to do 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.480
 way 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.970
 from what i saw on youtube it does not have any 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.420
 video showing clearly neither like you 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.880
 assemble well in every detail step by step 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.880
 so I decided to create one that as did 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.420
 This video improvise around here you go 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.109
 maybe damage a video and see how I 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.019
 did that this film wall 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:43.629
 for the time being only at first it does not have a 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:47.050
 how to go into detail how was it all in 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:51.819
 Assembly but I'll show you 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:54.789
 This is done here with notebook 

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:55.899
 old men that you have a school until 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.909
 hard skins 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:01.929
 I think that here in the video should be well 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:06.250
 right in the pieces 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:07.450
 Just like I used cardboard and it's a dog. 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.420
 very soft 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.560
 it turned out to be both uneven 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.900
 Then I created this part I put mass 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.630
 according to him to give the finish I 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.500
 I'm on this mount here hand using 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.550
 hot glue guns passed in each 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.140
 side and pasted as you can go 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.690
 for the terrain is that this not only the 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.170
 pieces that I counted whole piece at 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.260
 side and I went that way here 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.190
 as he calls it a finish up 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:45.280
 now for the moment just left the kneading 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.220
 here inside the finish that in the 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.380
 front to leave straight as it got 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.260
 very unequal if this contact does not 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.390
 low corner between these details in ok 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.820
 Ideally, if you are doing with these 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.550
 material here with a cardboard cover 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:05.340
 notebook you should use this kind of 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.340
 garbage here is sandpaper 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.310
 number 50 which is thicker and you 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:17.470
 make it strong enough to let him 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:20.380
 to my right and gives the overall finish 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.190
 so I can paint later on but the 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.280
 law missing right make these corner 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.770
 here logical after having in point team 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.900
 for it to be completed 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.730
 I 'll show you some later. 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.860
 videos in detail how I am doing 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.370
 this principle is this same wall oo 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.940
 horror at 4 this is my father was 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.940
 red
