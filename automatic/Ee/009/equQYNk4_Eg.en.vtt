00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
doesn't comes with the Charter so only

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.230 
doesn't comes with the Charter so only
comes<00:01:33.090> with<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.450> council<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.579> all<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.909> US

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
versions comes with the Charter so

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.270 
versions comes with the Charter so
that's<00:01:38.310> how<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:39.060> box<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> larger<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:43.280> so

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
that's how the box is a larger and so

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.249 
that's how the box is a larger and so
that's<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.729> first<00:01:45.030> thing<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.869> second

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259
