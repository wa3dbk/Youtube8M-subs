cleaning process the cleaning agent I'm
going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.519> use<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.939> rocklers<00:01:06.450> pitch<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.900> resin

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
going to use is rocklers pitch and resin

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.200 
going to use is rocklers pitch and resin
remover<00:01:07.530> I've<00:01:08.220> been<00:01:08.460> using<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.820> stuff<00:01:08.939> for

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
remover I've been using this stuff for

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.789 
remover I've been using this stuff for
years<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.630> works<00:01:09.840> great<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.200> I've<00:01:10.409> never<00:01:10.560> had<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
years it works great so I've never had a

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.070 
years it works great so I've never had a
need<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.159> look<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.490> anything<00:01:11.670> else<00:01:11.970> but<00:01:12.869> it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
need to look for anything else but it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.080 
need to look for anything else but it
smells<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.740> me<00:01:13.770> like<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.100> citrus<00:01:14.549> cleaner<00:01:14.820> so

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
smells to me like a citrus cleaner so

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.460 
smells to me like a citrus cleaner so
you<00:01:15.119> could<00:01:15.299> probably<00:01:15.450> use<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:16.049> those<00:01:16.229> or

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
you could probably use one of those or

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.800 
you could probably use one of those or
something<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:16.890> simple<00:01:17.310> green<00:01:17.580> for<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.330> so

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
something like simple green for this so

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.600 
something like simple green for this so
let's<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> router<00:01:19.619> bit<00:01:19.830> first<00:01:20.100> I'm<00:01:20.549> just

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
let's do the router bit first I'm just

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.080 
let's do the router bit first I'm just
going<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.850> grab<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.119> little<00:01:21.380> cup<00:01:22.380> here<00:01:22.909> or<00:01:23.909> some

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
going to grab a little cup here or some

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.320 
going to grab a little cup here or some
of<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.240> solution<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.780> there<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.820> then<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.090> will

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
of the solution in there and then I will

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.510 
of the solution in there and then I will
dip<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.320> router<00:01:28.530> bit<00:01:28.770> I'm<00:01:29.009> going<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.250> leave<00:01:29.400> it

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
dip the router bit I'm going to leave it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.120 
dip the router bit I'm going to leave it
in<00:01:29.579> there<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:29.790> about<00:01:30.030> five<00:01:30.360> minutes<00:01:30.540> now

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
in there for about five minutes now

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.770 
in there for about five minutes now
depending<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.220> how<00:01:32.340> caked<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.299> schmutz<00:01:33.570> is

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
depending on how caked on the schmutz is

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.260 
depending on how caked on the schmutz is
you<00:01:34.020> might<00:01:34.380> want<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.770> use<00:01:34.979> different<00:01:35.340> tools<00:01:35.579> to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
you might want to use different tools to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.999 
you might want to use different tools to
help<00:01:36.390> get<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.750> rest<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.200> material<00:01:37.829> off

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
help get the rest of this material off

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.859 
help get the rest of this material off
of<00:01:38.040> there<00:01:38.340> if<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.880> very<00:01:39.060> light<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.720> can

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
of there if it's very light you can

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.020 
of there if it's very light you can
usually<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.470> get<00:01:40.619> an<00:01:40.829> acid<00:01:41.430> brush<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:41.850> this

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
usually just get an acid brush like this

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.450 
usually just get an acid brush like this
and<00:01:42.320> wipe<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.500> surface<00:01:43.860> or<00:01:44.009> even<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.280> paper

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
and wipe the surface or even a paper

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.179 
and wipe the surface or even a paper
towel<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.630> should<00:01:45.869> get<00:01:46.710> most<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
towel and that should get most of the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.219 
towel and that should get most of the
stuff<00:01:47.250> off<00:01:47.579> now<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.540> case<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.049> is

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
stuff off now in this case this is

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.319 
stuff off now in this case this is
pretty<00:01:49.439> stubborn<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.579> what<00:01:50.939> I'm<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.210> do

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
pretty stubborn so what I'm going to do

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.410 
pretty stubborn so what I'm going to do
is<00:01:51.479> actually<00:01:51.630> use<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.350> scotch<00:01:52.950> brite<00:01:53.130> pad<00:01:53.420> dip

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
is actually use a scotch brite pad dip

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.109 
is actually use a scotch brite pad dip
that<00:01:54.570> into<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> solution<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.939> just<00:01:56.939> very

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
that into the solution and just very

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.760 
that into the solution and just very
carefully<00:01:58.880> wipe<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.060> schmutz<00:02:00.570> off<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.500> of

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
carefully wipe the schmutz off and of

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.830 
carefully wipe the schmutz off and of
course<00:02:02.009> be<00:02:02.159> very<00:02:02.310> careful<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> router

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
course be very careful this is a router

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.760 
course be very careful this is a router
bit<00:02:04.310> it<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.520> cut<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.049> and<00:02:07.049> when<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.409> do<00:02:07.500> this

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
bit it can cut you and when I do this

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.040 
bit it can cut you and when I do this
I'm<00:02:08.039> being<00:02:08.520> very<00:02:08.759> careful<00:02:09.000> not<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.390> actually

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
I'm being very careful not to actually

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.860 
I'm being very careful not to actually
rub<00:02:10.709> too<00:02:10.950> hard<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.700> cutting<00:02:12.060> edge

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
rub too hard on the cutting edge

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.820 
rub too hard on the cutting edge
right<00:02:12.989> because<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.200> don't<00:02:13.349> really<00:02:13.500> want<00:02:13.590> to

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
right because I don't really want to

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.380 
right because I don't really want to
dull<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.099> I<00:02:14.430> just<00:02:14.519> want<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:14.909> make<00:02:15.000> sure<00:02:15.060> that

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
dull it I just want to make sure that

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.350 
dull it I just want to make sure that
the<00:02:15.510> pad<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.799> under<00:02:16.799> the<00:02:17.099> blade<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.610> then<00:02:17.940> over

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
the pad is under the blade and then over

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.369 
the pad is under the blade and then over
the<00:02:18.659> blade<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:20.629> once<00:02:21.629> it<00:02:21.750> looks<00:02:21.840> pretty<00:02:22.110> clean

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
the blade and once it looks pretty clean

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.460 
the blade and once it looks pretty clean
just<00:02:22.920> wipe<00:02:23.069> off<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.580> excess<00:02:24.170> resin<00:02:25.170> remover

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
just wipe off the excess resin remover

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.180 
just wipe off the excess resin remover
with<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> dry<00:02:26.670> paper<00:02:26.879> towel<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:28.110> once<00:02:29.040> you're

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
with a dry paper towel and once you're

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.740 
with a dry paper towel and once you're
done<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.610> could<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:29.909> pour<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.239> solution

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
done you could just pour the solution

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.630 
done you could just pour the solution
back<00:02:31.140> into<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.650> container<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.190> could<00:02:32.280> reuse

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
back into the container you could reuse

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.660 
back into the container you could reuse
this<00:02:32.849> later<00:02:33.829> for<00:02:34.829> blades<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.370> can<00:02:35.400> pretty

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
this later for blades you can pretty

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.580 
this later for blades you can pretty
much<00:02:35.760> use<00:02:36.030> any<00:02:36.269> shallow<00:02:36.659> pan<00:02:37.019> that's<00:02:37.319> big

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
much use any shallow pan that's big

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.619 
much use any shallow pan that's big
enough<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.920> hold<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.340> blade<00:02:38.640> drop<00:02:39.329> the<00:02:39.480> blade

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
enough to hold a blade drop the blade

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.399 
enough to hold a blade drop the blade
down<00:02:39.900> inside<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:41.280> just<00:02:42.180> soak<00:02:42.959> it<00:02:43.140> with<00:02:43.170> some

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
down inside and just soak it with some

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.710 
down inside and just soak it with some
of<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.560> resin<00:02:43.829> remover<00:02:44.660> now<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
of the resin remover now the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.509 
of the resin remover now the
instructions<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.769> usually<00:02:47.760> indicate<00:02:48.209> to

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
instructions on this usually indicate to

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.530 
instructions on this usually indicate to
dilute<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.640> stuff<00:02:50.849> down<00:02:51.060> because<00:02:51.239> it<00:02:51.510> is

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
dilute the stuff down because it is

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.259 
dilute the stuff down because it is
concentrated<00:02:52.470> but<00:02:52.950> because<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.280> always<00:02:53.579> use<00:02:54.090> it

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
concentrated but because I always use it

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.729 
concentrated but because I always use it
on<00:02:54.359> the<00:02:54.450> blade<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.870> then<00:02:55.049> put<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.319> back<00:02:55.349> in<00:02:55.650> the

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
on the blade and then put it back in the

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.680 
on the blade and then put it back in the
container<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:56.430> actually<00:02:56.879> use<00:02:57.269> this<00:02:57.450> stuff<00:02:57.510> for

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
container I actually use this stuff for

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.210 
container I actually use this stuff for
years<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.349> I<00:02:58.379> like<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.620> keep<00:02:58.859> it<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.129> this

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
years so I like to keep it in this

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.280 
years so I like to keep it in this
concentrated<00:02:59.970> form<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.510> don't<00:03:00.900> know<00:03:01.140> that

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
concentrated form I don't know that

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.649 
concentrated form I don't know that
necessarily<00:03:01.519> improves<00:03:02.519> anything<00:03:02.909> but<00:03:03.150> I

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
necessarily improves anything but I

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.539 
necessarily improves anything but I
would<00:03:04.049> guess<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.260> more<00:03:04.680> concentrated<00:03:05.370> means

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
would guess that more concentrated means

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.030 
would guess that more concentrated means
it's<00:03:05.730> going<00:03:05.909> to<00:03:06.030> be<00:03:06.120> stronger<00:03:06.799> because<00:03:07.799> I'm

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
it's going to be stronger because I'm

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.680 
it's going to be stronger because I'm
not<00:03:08.159> throwing<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.579> out<00:03:08.700> after<00:03:09.060> each<00:03:09.209> use<00:03:09.239> I'm

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
not throwing it out after each use I'm

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.990 
not throwing it out after each use I'm
not<00:03:09.810> wasting<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.290> after<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.069> five-minute<00:03:11.430> soak

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
not wasting it after a five-minute soak

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.690 
not wasting it after a five-minute soak
I<00:03:12.030> can<00:03:12.720> usually<00:03:12.870> just<00:03:13.109> get<00:03:13.620> my<00:03:13.799> brush<00:03:14.190> here<00:03:14.549> and

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
I can usually just get my brush here and

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.839 
I can usually just get my brush here and
go<00:03:15.510> along<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.959> edges<00:03:16.340> all<00:03:17.340> right<00:03:17.489> and<00:03:17.669> once

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
go along the edges all right and once

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.670 
go along the edges all right and once
again<00:03:17.940> if<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.329> buildup<00:03:18.599> isn't<00:03:18.900> too<00:03:19.049> bad<00:03:19.290> a

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
again if the buildup isn't too bad a

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.220 
again if the buildup isn't too bad a
brush<00:03:20.430> should<00:03:20.700> do<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.030> trick<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:21.510> if<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.079> does

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
brush should do the trick and if it does

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.140 
brush should do the trick and if it does
wind<00:03:22.500> up<00:03:22.620> being<00:03:22.829> a<00:03:23.040> little<00:03:23.370> bit<00:03:23.579> too<00:03:23.669> stubborn

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
wind up being a little bit too stubborn

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.170 
wind up being a little bit too stubborn
I<00:03:24.450> just<00:03:25.079> go<00:03:25.200> back<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:26.220> little<00:03:26.489> scrub<00:03:26.910> pad

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
I just go back to the little scrub pad

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.839 
I just go back to the little scrub pad
and<00:03:28.079> do<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.379> same<00:03:28.590> thing<00:03:28.859> you<00:03:29.459> notice<00:03:29.700> I'm

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
and do the same thing you notice I'm

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.030 
and do the same thing you notice I'm
sort<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.180> going<00:03:30.329> with<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.989> directionality<00:03:31.650> of

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
sort of going with the directionality of

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.039 
sort of going with the directionality of
the<00:03:32.129> blades<00:03:32.819> if<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.090> go<00:03:33.180> this<00:03:33.540> way

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
the blades if you go this way

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.800 
the blades if you go this way
you're<00:03:34.379> going<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.590> have<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.739> much<00:03:34.859> harder<00:03:35.040> time

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
you're going to have a much harder time

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.030 
you're going to have a much harder time
you<00:03:36.810> know<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.290> might<00:03:37.440> even<00:03:37.470> wind<00:03:37.919> up

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
you know and you might even wind up

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:47.420 
you know and you might even wind up
dahling<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.090> edges<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:40.139> your<00:03:40.379> carbide<00:03:40.829> tips

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.100 

and<00:03:48.430> once<00:03:48.579> you<00:03:48.700> have<00:03:48.849> the<00:03:49.030> outside<00:03:49.209> edges<00:03:49.780> done

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
and once you have the outside edges done

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.390 
and once you have the outside edges done
you're<00:03:50.319> going<00:03:50.409> to<00:03:50.500> need<00:03:50.650> to<00:03:50.799> do<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.099> inside

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
you're going to need to do the inside

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.920 
you're going to need to do the inside
face<00:03:51.670> and<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.239> probably<00:03:52.360> want<00:03:52.599> to<00:03:52.689> do<00:03:52.810> the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
face and you probably want to do the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.410 
face and you probably want to do the
back<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.739> back<00:03:53.860> end<00:03:54.129> of<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.310> teeth<00:03:54.519> so<00:03:55.120> just

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
back the back end of the teeth so just

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.259 
back the back end of the teeth so just
keep<00:03:55.569> that<00:03:55.680> directionality<00:03:56.680> in<00:03:57.010> mind<00:03:57.280> it

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
keep that directionality in mind it

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.280 
keep that directionality in mind it
should<00:03:58.450> be<00:03:58.510> fairly<00:03:58.750> simple<00:04:00.989> for<00:04:01.989> the<00:04:02.049> front

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
should be fairly simple for the front

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.410 
should be fairly simple for the front
face<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.709> each<00:04:02.829> tooth<00:04:03.099> I<00:04:03.310> usually<00:04:03.640> just<00:04:03.879> spread

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
face of each tooth I usually just spread

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.069 
face of each tooth I usually just spread
the<00:04:04.659> pad<00:04:05.049> out<00:04:05.349> like<00:04:05.620> so<00:04:05.890> and<00:04:06.810> put<00:04:07.810> that<00:04:07.900> in

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
the pad out like so and put that in

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.789 
the pad out like so and put that in
between<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.829> space<00:04:09.340> between<00:04:09.670> each<00:04:09.730> tooth

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
between the space between each tooth

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.640 
between the space between each tooth
just<00:04:11.799> take<00:04:11.920> a<00:04:11.950> few<00:04:12.189> strokes<00:04:12.489> like<00:04:12.819> so<00:04:13.650> that's

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
just take a few strokes like so that's

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.990 
just take a few strokes like so that's
typically<00:04:15.159> enough<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.579> keep<00:04:15.730> it<00:04:15.849> nice<00:04:15.970> and

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
typically enough to keep it nice and

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.360 
typically enough to keep it nice and
clean<00:04:19.289> and<00:04:20.289> since<00:04:20.500> it<00:04:20.620> tends<00:04:20.799> to<00:04:20.889> get<00:04:21.100> pretty

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
clean and since it tends to get pretty

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.879 
clean and since it tends to get pretty
sudsy<00:04:21.850> I<00:04:22.030> like<00:04:22.300> to<00:04:22.389> take<00:04:22.570> a<00:04:22.600> spray<00:04:23.500> bottle<00:04:23.830> and

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
sudsy I like to take a spray bottle and

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.520 
sudsy I like to take a spray bottle and
just<00:04:24.330> rinse<00:04:25.330> it<00:04:25.510> off<00:04:25.600> a<00:04:25.630> little<00:04:25.840> bit<00:04:25.990> with<00:04:26.320> some

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
just rinse it off a little bit with some

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.210 
just rinse it off a little bit with some
water<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:28.840> now<00:04:29.289> I<00:04:29.350> can<00:04:29.560> pour<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.010> cleaner

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
water and now I can pour the cleaner

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.010 
water and now I can pour the cleaner
back<00:04:30.699> into<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.479> container<00:04:32.699> and<00:04:33.780> since<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:34.900> can

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
back into the container and since it can

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.570 
back into the container and since it can
be<00:04:35.050> tricky<00:04:35.350> to<00:04:35.650> get<00:04:35.770> all<00:04:35.919> of<00:04:36.039> the<00:04:36.130> liquid<00:04:36.280> out

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
be tricky to get all of the liquid out

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.070 
be tricky to get all of the liquid out
from<00:04:36.820> in<00:04:36.940> between<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.300> teeth<00:04:37.600> I<00:04:37.840> actually

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
from in between the teeth I actually

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.140 
from in between the teeth I actually
just<00:04:38.410> use<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:38.680> hair<00:04:39.039> dryer<00:04:39.070> to<00:04:39.880> make<00:04:39.910> sure

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
just use a hair dryer to make sure

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.730 
just use a hair dryer to make sure
everything<00:04:40.570> is<00:04:40.750> bone-dry

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.260 

of<00:04:47.740> course<00:04:47.979> the<00:04:48.130> additional<00:04:48.580> advantage<00:04:48.699> being

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
of course the additional advantage being

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.670 
of course the additional advantage being
that<00:04:49.389> I<00:04:49.570> can<00:04:49.780> make<00:04:49.900> sure<00:04:49.930> I<00:04:50.080> still<00:04:50.410> look<00:04:50.650> good

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
that I can make sure I still look good

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.749 
that I can make sure I still look good
for<00:04:50.979> my<00:04:51.099> close-up

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:57.029 

the<00:04:55.689> final<00:04:56.050> treatment<00:04:56.259> for<00:04:56.499> my<00:04:56.620> blades<00:04:56.860> and

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
the final treatment for my blades and

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:58.860 
the final treatment for my blades and
bits<00:04:57.219> is<00:04:57.460> to<00:04:57.699> give<00:04:57.909> it<00:04:57.999> a<00:04:58.150> coat<00:04:58.389> of<00:04:58.419> a<00:04:58.659> dry

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
bits is to give it a coat of a dry

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.719 
bits is to give it a coat of a dry
lubricant<00:04:59.499> that's<00:04:59.529> going<00:04:59.889> to<00:04:59.949> help<00:05:00.129> extend<00:05:00.430> a

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
lubricant that's going to help extend a

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.299 
lubricant that's going to help extend a
life<00:05:00.939> the<00:05:01.389> stuff<00:05:01.599> I<00:05:01.779> use<00:05:02.080> is<00:05:02.349> called<00:05:02.680> dry<00:05:03.039> coat

00:05:03.299 --> 00:05:03.309 
life the stuff I use is called dry coat

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:18.230 
life the stuff I use is called dry coat
just<00:05:04.120> spray<00:05:04.330> a<00:05:04.360> little<00:05:04.539> bit<00:05:04.779> on<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.589> teeth

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.179 

make<00:05:19.240> sure<00:05:19.389> I<00:05:19.419> get<00:05:19.599> both<00:05:19.749> sides<00:05:22.949> and<00:05:23.949> I<00:05:23.979> take<00:05:24.159> a

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:24.189 
make sure I get both sides and I take a

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:26.999 
make sure I get both sides and I take a
dry<00:05:24.400> paper<00:05:24.639> towel<00:05:24.939> and<00:05:25.270> I<00:05:26.259> just<00:05:26.439> rub<00:05:26.740> it<00:05:26.770> into

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
dry paper towel and I just rub it into

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:31.739 
dry paper towel and I just rub it into
the<00:05:27.189> metal<00:05:29.909> pretty<00:05:30.909> much<00:05:31.029> the<00:05:31.149> same<00:05:31.300> treatment

00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:31.749 
the metal pretty much the same treatment

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:41.309 
the metal pretty much the same treatment
for<00:05:31.899> the<00:05:31.960> router<00:05:32.169> bit<00:05:39.930> simple<00:05:40.930> routine

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 
for the router bit simple routine

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.899 
for the router bit simple routine
maintenance<00:05:41.559> like<00:05:41.949> this<00:05:42.159> can<00:05:42.490> really<00:05:42.729> save

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:42.909 
maintenance like this can really save

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:45.119 
maintenance like this can really save
you<00:05:43.029> a<00:05:43.059> lot<00:05:43.210> of<00:05:43.449> time<00:05:43.689> and<00:05:44.020> money<00:05:44.199> first<00:05:44.830> of<00:05:44.979> all

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:45.129 
you a lot of time and money first of all

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:46.889 
you a lot of time and money first of all
if<00:05:45.309> your<00:05:45.430> blades<00:05:45.669> and<00:05:45.819> bits<00:05:46.029> are<00:05:46.180> clean<00:05:46.479> they

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:46.899 
if your blades and bits are clean they

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:48.719 
if your blades and bits are clean they
just<00:05:47.139> cut<00:05:47.469> cleaner<00:05:47.919> and<00:05:48.219> that<00:05:48.339> means<00:05:48.550> better

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
just cut cleaner and that means better

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.760 
just cut cleaner and that means better
results<00:05:49.389> for<00:05:49.539> your<00:05:49.629> projects<00:05:50.139> the<00:05:50.349> other

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
results for your projects the other

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.320 
results for your projects the other
thing<00:05:51.009> is<00:05:51.219> without<00:05:51.430> all<00:05:51.729> that<00:05:51.849> pitch<00:05:52.120> and

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
thing is without all that pitch and

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.329 
thing is without all that pitch and
resin<00:05:52.449> on<00:05:52.839> there<00:05:53.110> we<00:05:53.469> don't<00:05:53.589> get<00:05:53.770> as<00:05:53.860> much<00:05:54.039> heat

00:05:54.329 --> 00:05:54.339 
resin on there we don't get as much heat

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:56.010 
resin on there we don't get as much heat
buildup<00:05:54.759> in<00:05:54.969> the<00:05:55.059> heat<00:05:55.300> is<00:05:55.509> what<00:05:55.839> really

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
buildup in the heat is what really

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.200 
buildup in the heat is what really
contributes<00:05:56.680> to<00:05:56.919> these<00:05:57.129> edges<00:05:57.580> becoming<00:05:57.939> dull

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
contributes to these edges becoming dull

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.459 
contributes to these edges becoming dull
which<00:05:58.419> means<00:05:58.629> you<00:05:58.719> have<00:05:58.839> to<00:05:58.870> then<00:05:59.050> send<00:05:59.379> them

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469 
which means you have to then send them

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:01.709 
which means you have to then send them
out<00:05:59.620> to<00:05:59.889> the<00:05:59.919> sharpener<00:06:00.459> now<00:06:00.879> I<00:06:00.909> send<00:06:01.300> my<00:06:01.449> stuff

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:01.719 
out to the sharpener now I send my stuff

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:03.480 
out to the sharpener now I send my stuff
out<00:06:01.870> to<00:06:02.020> a<00:06:02.050> professional<00:06:02.229> sharpener<00:06:03.009> and<00:06:03.189> the

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
out to a professional sharpener and the

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.550 
out to a professional sharpener and the
fewer<00:06:03.699> times<00:06:03.969> I<00:06:04.149> have<00:06:04.270> to<00:06:04.419> do<00:06:04.539> that<00:06:04.719> a<00:06:04.749> year<00:06:05.169> the

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
fewer times I have to do that a year the

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.260 
fewer times I have to do that a year the
more<00:06:05.740> money<00:06:05.919> I'm<00:06:06.069> going<00:06:06.249> to<00:06:06.310> save<00:06:06.520> so<00:06:06.969> this<00:06:07.149> is

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
more money I'm going to save so this is

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.670 
more money I'm going to save so this is
something<00:06:07.539> that<00:06:07.689> I<00:06:07.719> try<00:06:07.959> to<00:06:07.990> do<00:06:08.469> at<00:06:08.649> least

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
something that I try to do at least

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.889 
something that I try to do at least
monthly<00:06:09.189> and<00:06:09.580> if<00:06:09.789> I<00:06:09.879> have<00:06:09.999> a<00:06:10.029> big<00:06:10.240> project<00:06:10.509> like

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:10.899 
monthly and if I have a big project like

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:12.989 
monthly and if I have a big project like
my<00:06:11.020> workbench<00:06:11.499> that<00:06:11.709> uses<00:06:12.279> one<00:06:12.459> particular

00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:12.999 
my workbench that uses one particular

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:15.089 
my workbench that uses one particular
bit<00:06:13.209> heavily<00:06:13.659> I<00:06:13.810> may<00:06:14.199> even<00:06:14.349> clean<00:06:14.770> it<00:06:14.800> in<00:06:15.009> the

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
bit heavily I may even clean it in the

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:16.290 
bit heavily I may even clean it in the
middle<00:06:15.310> of<00:06:15.399> the<00:06:15.490> project<00:06:15.669> but<00:06:15.999> certainly

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
middle of the project but certainly

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.269 
middle of the project but certainly
after<00:06:16.509> the<00:06:16.689> project<00:06:17.169> is<00:06:17.259> done<00:06:17.469> that<00:06:18.009> bit<00:06:18.159> is

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:18.279 
after the project is done that bit is

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.980 
after the project is done that bit is
going<00:06:18.430> to<00:06:18.490> get<00:06:18.639> cleaned<00:06:18.969> up<00:06:19.120> and<00:06:19.360> hopefully<00:06:19.870> it

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
going to get cleaned up and hopefully it

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.779 
going to get cleaned up and hopefully it
will<00:06:20.110> extend<00:06:20.620> a<00:06:20.800> life

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
will extend a life

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.159 
will extend a life
the<00:06:21.999> other<00:06:22.120> thing<00:06:22.330> I<00:06:22.419> wanted<00:06:22.599> to<00:06:22.659> mention<00:06:22.839> is

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
all of the different cleaning solutions

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:26.670 
all of the different cleaning solutions
out<00:06:24.939> there<00:06:24.969> ranging<00:06:25.569> from<00:06:25.779> really<00:06:26.080> caustic

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
out there ranging from really caustic

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.129 
out there ranging from really caustic
stuff<00:06:26.949> which<00:06:27.189> I<00:06:27.309> try<00:06:27.580> to<00:06:27.610> avoid<00:06:27.849> -<00:06:28.689> the<00:06:28.930> stuff
