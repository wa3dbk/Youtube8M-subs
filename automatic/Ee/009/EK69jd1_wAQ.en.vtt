there<00:01:53.850> where<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.899> want<00:01:55.079> them<00:01:55.200> put<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.560> a

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
there where you want them put on a

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.319 
there where you want them put on a
little<00:01:55.860> bit<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.070> glossy<00:01:56.280> accents<00:01:56.759> kind<00:01:57.240> of

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
little bit of glossy accents kind of

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.469 
little bit of glossy accents kind of
cover<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:58.009> doesn't<00:01:59.009> take<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> ton<00:01:59.520> although<00:02:00.450> I

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
cover it doesn't take a ton although I

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.270 
cover it doesn't take a ton although I
used<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.140> ton<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.530> first<00:02:01.740> few<00:02:01.890> times<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.250> did

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
used a ton the first few times I did

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.990 
used a ton the first few times I did
this

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.450 

and<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:07.140> just<00:02:07.380> get<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.980> know<00:02:08.100> enough<00:02:08.430> to

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
and you just get it you know enough to

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.130 
and you just get it you know enough to
where<00:02:08.700> it's<00:02:09.090> gonna<00:02:09.330> stick<00:02:09.630> on<00:02:09.780> there<00:02:10.020> and

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
where it's gonna stick on there and

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.450 
where it's gonna stick on there and
hopefully<00:02:10.500> not<00:02:10.649> run<00:02:10.860> off<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.100> edge<00:02:11.220> like<00:02:11.430> that

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
hopefully not run off the edge like that

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.400 
hopefully not run off the edge like that
one's<00:02:11.820> probably<00:02:12.030> going<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.600> do<00:02:15.230> doesn't<00:02:16.230> take

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
one's probably going to do doesn't take

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.640 
one's probably going to do doesn't take
too<00:02:16.620> terribly<00:02:16.980> long<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.430> dry<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:18.500> think<00:02:19.500> also

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
too terribly long to dry I think also

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.110 
too terribly long to dry I think also
that<00:02:19.920> I'm<00:02:20.010> gonna<00:02:20.130> get<00:02:20.340> some<00:02:20.550> smaller<00:02:20.850> paper

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
that I'm gonna get some smaller paper

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.860 
that I'm gonna get some smaller paper
clips<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:22.410> try<00:02:23.070> that<00:02:23.280> out<00:02:23.480> so<00:02:24.480> that's<00:02:24.660> all<00:02:24.810> it

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
clips and try that out so that's all it

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.020 
clips and try that out so that's all it
takes<00:02:25.110> then<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:25.410> set<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.680> aside<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.950> dry<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.550> I

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
takes then you set it aside to dry and I

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.440 
takes then you set it aside to dry and I
have<00:02:27.410> quite<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.470> few<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.800> them<00:02:28.920> over<00:02:29.100> here<00:02:29.450> that

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
have quite a few of them over here that

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
have quite a few of them over here that
I<00:02:30.540> made<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:32.420> on<00:02:33.420> some<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.840> them<00:02:33.990> when<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.260> glue

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
I made and on some of them when the glue

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.930 
I made and on some of them when the glue
went<00:02:34.680> through<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.250> didn't<00:02:35.490> like<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.910> way

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
went through and I didn't like the way

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.700 
went through and I didn't like the way
it<00:02:36.120> looked<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.600> went<00:02:36.750> ahead<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:36.960> put<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> pearl

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
it looked I went ahead and put a pearl

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.020 
it looked I went ahead and put a pearl
on<00:02:38.000> top<00:02:39.000> there<00:02:39.240> like<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.660> one<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:40.790> have<00:02:41.790> quite

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
on top there like that one I have quite

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.790 
on top there like that one I have quite
a<00:02:42.090> few<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.480> them<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:43.080> I've<00:02:43.200> played<00:02:43.590> around

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
a few of them that I've played around

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.630 
a few of them that I've played around
with<00:02:47.570> again<00:02:48.570> that's<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:49.190> recollections<00:02:50.190> bling

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
with again that's a recollections bling

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.150 
with again that's a recollections bling
those<00:02:51.150> are<00:02:51.330> recollections<00:02:51.840> pearls<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:53.100> I

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
those are recollections pearls that I

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.990 
those are recollections pearls that I
added<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:55.910> have<00:02:56.910> quite<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.209> few<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:59.760> can<00:02:59.820> see

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
added I have quite a few you can see

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.260 
added I have quite a few you can see
they're<00:03:00.150> pretty<00:03:00.390> simple<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.780> make<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.880> those

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
they're pretty simple to make and those

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.830 
they're pretty simple to make and those
and<00:03:03.750> then<00:03:03.990> I<00:03:04.110> decided<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:05.450> would<00:03:06.450> try<00:03:06.600> something

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
and then I decided I would try something

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.740 
and then I decided I would try something
else<00:03:07.470> out<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.920> had<00:03:08.190> some<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.790> these<00:03:09.510> little

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
else out I had some of the these little

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.949 
else out I had some of the these little
prima<00:03:10.080> flowers<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:11.700> i<00:03:11.760> heerd<00:03:12.060> those<00:03:12.269> and<00:03:12.660> as

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
prima flowers so i heerd those and as

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.229 
prima flowers so i heerd those and as
you<00:03:13.110> can<00:03:13.200> see<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.470> dries<00:03:13.650> pretty<00:03:14.130> clear<00:03:14.580> if<00:03:15.060> you

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
you can see it dries pretty clear if you

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.310 
you can see it dries pretty clear if you
don't<00:03:15.390> like<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.600> way<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:15.780> looks<00:03:15.959> on<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.170> back

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
don't like the way it looks on the back

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.840 
don't like the way it looks on the back
you<00:03:16.590> could<00:03:16.739> always<00:03:16.890> add<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.190> little<00:03:17.610> piece<00:03:17.790> of

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
you could always add a little piece of

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.490 
you could always add a little piece of
felt<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.450> little<00:03:18.540> piece<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.840> pattern<00:03:19.260> paper

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
felt a little piece of pattern paper

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.710 
felt a little piece of pattern paper
something<00:03:20.010> else<00:03:20.280> back<00:03:21.060> there<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.360> cover<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.630> up

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
something else back there to cover it up

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.870 
something else back there to cover it up
but<00:03:21.959> most<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.860> mine<00:03:23.070> will<00:03:23.190> be<00:03:23.220> far<00:03:23.519> enough<00:03:23.700> down

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
but most of mine will be far enough down

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.910 
but most of mine will be far enough down
the<00:03:24.120> back<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.420> not<00:03:24.510> going<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.720> be<00:03:24.810> an<00:03:24.900> issue<00:03:24.989> and

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
the back is not going to be an issue and

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.220 
the back is not going to be an issue and
then<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:26.670> also<00:03:26.970> decided<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.600> pull<00:03:27.870> out<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:28.019> couple

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
then I also decided to pull out a couple

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.400 
then I also decided to pull out a couple
of<00:03:29.420> flowers<00:03:30.420> that<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:30.690> had<00:03:30.959> from<00:03:33.140> wild<00:03:34.140> orchid

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
of flowers that I had from wild orchid

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.360 
of flowers that I had from wild orchid
crafts<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.310> adhered<00:03:35.610> those<00:03:35.850> I<00:03:36.209> just<00:03:37.370> pushed

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
crafts and I adhered those I just pushed

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.890 
crafts and I adhered those I just pushed
the<00:03:38.489> wire<00:03:38.700> back<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.209> put<00:03:39.360> it<00:03:39.450> kind<00:03:39.630> of<00:03:39.720> around

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
the wire back and put it kind of around

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.840 
the wire back and put it kind of around
that<00:03:40.200> if<00:03:40.860> you<00:03:40.980> wanted<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.489> could<00:03:41.610> cut<00:03:41.820> it

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
that if you wanted to you could cut it

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.430 
that if you wanted to you could cut it
off<00:03:42.030> but<00:03:42.330> I<00:03:42.480> like<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.750> little<00:03:42.900> bit<00:03:43.110> of<00:03:43.230> greenery

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
off but I like a little bit of greenery

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.360 
off but I like a little bit of greenery
that<00:03:43.590> kind<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.010> pops<00:03:44.220> up<00:03:44.840> you<00:03:45.840> know<00:03:46.250> with<00:03:47.250> the

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
that kind of pops up you know with the

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.660 
that kind of pops up you know with the
little<00:03:47.519> wire<00:03:48.000> stems<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.980> then<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.010> packaged<00:03:50.580> it

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
little wire stems and then I packaged it

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.160 
little wire stems and then I packaged it
up<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.880> little<00:03:51.000> set<00:03:51.360> because<00:03:51.600> I'm<00:03:51.720> gonna<00:03:51.870> send

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
up a little set because I'm gonna send

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.509
