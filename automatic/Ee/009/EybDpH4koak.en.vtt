that it was a good break obviously for

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.290 
that it was a good break obviously for
my<00:00:37.300> natural<00:00:37.960> hair<00:00:38.079> to<00:00:38.230> grow<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.670> can<00:00:39.820> watch<00:00:40.000> my

my natural hair to grow you can watch my
all<00:00:40.780> my<00:00:40.960> previous<00:00:41.260> like<00:00:41.859> I<00:00:42.160> don't<00:00:42.550> know<00:00:42.699> 10<00:00:43.210> to

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
all my previous like I don't know 10 to

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.400 
all my previous like I don't know 10 to
20<00:00:43.840> videos<00:00:43.989> before<00:00:44.410> these<00:00:45.039> pasta<00:00:45.940> videos<00:00:46.410> it

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
20 videos before these pasta videos it

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.150 
20 videos before these pasta videos it
also<00:00:47.589> makes<00:00:47.769> tension<00:00:48.100> city

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
also makes tension city

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.770 
also makes tension city
so<00:00:49.670> you<00:00:49.730> can<00:00:49.880> see<00:00:50.030> how<00:00:50.060> long<00:00:50.420> my<00:00:50.450> hair<00:00:50.660> actually

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
so you can see how long my hair actually

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.950 
so you can see how long my hair actually
was<00:00:51.230> I<00:00:53.530> just<00:00:54.530> I<00:00:54.920> feel<00:00:55.430> like<00:00:55.489> this<00:00:56.330> is<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.630> best

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
was I just I feel like this is the best

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.720 
was I just I feel like this is the best
that<00:00:57.260> it's<00:00:57.380> ever<00:00:57.559> looked<00:00:57.890> because<00:00:58.130> my<00:00:58.400> hair

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
that it's ever looked because my hair

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.979 
that it's ever looked because my hair
actually<00:00:59.150> grew<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.650> I<00:01:01.270> recommend<00:01:02.270> if<00:01:02.690> you<00:01:02.809> have

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
actually grew so I recommend if you have

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.320 
actually grew so I recommend if you have
extensions<00:01:03.590> to<00:01:03.860> take<00:01:04.010> a<00:01:04.100> break<00:01:04.339> you<00:01:05.210> know

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
extensions to take a break you know

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.480 
extensions to take a break you know
every<00:01:05.960> once<00:01:06.350> in<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.650> while<00:01:06.860> for<00:01:07.190> a<00:01:07.250> couple

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
every once in a while for a couple

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.590 
every once in a while for a couple
months<00:01:07.640> just<00:01:08.000> so<00:01:08.119> your<00:01:08.270> hair<00:01:08.420> can<00:01:08.450> grow

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
months just so your hair can grow

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.120 
months just so your hair can grow
because<00:01:08.960> then<00:01:09.110> when<00:01:09.320> you<00:01:09.410> put<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.650> bucket<00:01:09.800> i

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
because then when you put the bucket i

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.060 
because then when you put the bucket i
mean<00:01:10.310> i<00:01:10.490> guess<00:01:11.119> like<00:01:11.290> it<00:01:12.290> kind<00:01:12.650> of<00:01:12.710> sounds<00:01:13.040> like

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
mean i guess like it kind of sounds like

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.980 
mean i guess like it kind of sounds like
it's<00:01:13.250> defeating<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.790> purpose<00:01:13.990> though

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
it's defeating the purpose though

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.040 
it's defeating the purpose though
because<00:01:15.320> you're<00:01:15.940> giving<00:01:16.940> your<00:01:17.180> hair<00:01:17.540> a<00:01:17.570> chance

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
because you're giving your hair a chance

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.330 
because you're giving your hair a chance
to<00:01:18.170> be<00:01:18.259> healthy<00:01:18.590> again<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:18.830> then<00:01:19.190> you're<00:01:19.310> just

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
to be healthy again and then you're just

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.749 
to be healthy again and then you're just
putting<00:01:19.640> these<00:01:19.910> things<00:01:20.780> in<00:01:21.050> your<00:01:21.140> hair<00:01:21.410> that

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
putting these things in your hair that

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.320 
putting these things in your hair that
can<00:01:22.759> kind<00:01:23.090> of<00:01:24.700> screw<00:01:25.700> up<00:01:25.820> your<00:01:26.000> hair<00:01:26.149> in<00:01:26.240> a

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
can kind of screw up your hair in a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.080 
can kind of screw up your hair in a
sense<00:01:26.540> I<00:01:26.780> don't<00:01:27.170> know<00:01:27.440> but<00:01:27.800> I<00:01:28.100> think<00:01:28.670> I'm

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
sense I don't know but I think I'm

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.300

overanalyzing<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:30.619> whole<00:01:30.830> hair<00:01:31.070> situation

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
overanalyzing the whole hair situation

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.029 
overanalyzing the whole hair situation
but<00:01:32.149> I'm<00:01:32.240> extremely<00:01:32.810> extremely<00:01:33.500> happy<00:01:34.009> with
