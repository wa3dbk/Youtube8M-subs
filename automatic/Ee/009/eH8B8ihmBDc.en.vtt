 hello my name is gabriel barrÃ³n del 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.799
 consultant technologies indicator 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.029
 computer dell implementer of new 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.249
 technologies for companies and 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.480
 professionals now presented this new 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.480
 tutorial I hope 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.730
 in this video we will measure the current 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.970
 of the output of a stabilizer 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.970
 for example in this case it's energy like 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.580
 we see here is national is made in 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.260
 argentina and let's take the flow 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.879
 directly from the shoes as 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.530
 we can see here directly the 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.840
 stabilizer is plugged into this 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.570
 sneaker and we will be taking the 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.030
 current from the same place of this 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.280
 sneaker so let's proceed by 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.769
 example here we are going to put the 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.630
 connectors on the shoes and how 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:54.700
 we can see there we have 222 224 a 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.370
 small fluctuation to get the 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.440
 connectors and we are going to put them here and as 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.700
 we can see we have less tension 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.520
 we have 115 118 as we can see our 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.500
 conclusion is that the stabilizer does not 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.560
 stabilizes very well that we say because 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.060
 instead of giving us 220 we are just 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.250
 giving less tension than what 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.979
 corresponds we have taken the measurement in 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.440
 other places and it has happened to us that by 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.080
 example if we have 220 just the 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.660
 stabilizer is sending 200 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.540
 that's why we always recommend using a 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.820
 fish that are much more stable and much 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.310
 more secure apart from when there is a 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.500
 cut even if it's 1 or 2 seconds 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.540
 computer will continue to work in 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.490
 change a common stabilizer when it 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.500
 cut the light even for a second 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.440
 the pc is going to turn off I hope you have them 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.420
 served this video and anything not 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.610
 hesitate to consult us I hope you have
