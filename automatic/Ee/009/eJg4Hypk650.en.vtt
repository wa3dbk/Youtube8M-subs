00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
to the situation that everything seemed

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:01.079 
to the situation that everything seemed
a<00:00:57.280> bit<00:00:57.309> too<00:00:57.670> similar<00:00:59.550> this<00:01:00.550> is<00:01:00.729> why<00:01:00.909> we

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
a bit too similar this is why we

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:03.599 
a bit too similar this is why we
designed<00:01:01.269> a<00:01:01.600> new<00:01:01.749> system<00:01:02.139> in<00:01:02.350> this<00:01:03.069> system<00:01:03.370> the

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
designed a new system in this system the

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.730 
designed a new system in this system the
player<00:01:03.940> level<00:01:04.360> is<00:01:04.479> far<00:01:04.780> more<00:01:04.960> elaborate<00:01:05.470> and

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
player level is far more elaborate and

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.460 
player level is far more elaborate and
uses<00:01:06.190> the<00:01:06.310> full<00:01:06.490> range<00:01:06.760> between<00:01:07.060> 0<00:01:07.270> and<00:01:07.840> 99

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
uses the full range between 0 and 99

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.620 
uses the full range between 0 and 99
which<00:01:09.010> allows<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:09.340> better<00:01:09.729> presentation<00:01:10.299> of

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
which allows a better presentation of

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.840 
which allows a better presentation of
the<00:01:10.720> differences<00:01:11.200> between<00:01:11.230> players<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:12.220> it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
the differences between players and it

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.610 
the differences between players and it
works<00:01:13.090> in<00:01:13.300> the<00:01:13.390> way<00:01:13.540> that<00:01:13.750> we<00:01:13.810> now<00:01:14.080> basically

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
works in the way that we now basically

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.650 
works in the way that we now basically
use<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.040> players<00:01:15.460> position<00:01:16.030> as<00:01:16.210> seventy

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
use the players position as seventy

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.870 
use the players position as seventy
percent<00:01:16.810> of<00:01:17.230> his<00:01:17.350> overall<00:01:17.740> level<00:01:18.160> the

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
percent of his overall level the

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.910 
percent of his overall level the
abilities<00:01:19.330> however<00:01:19.780> only<00:01:20.020> count<00:01:20.440> to<00:01:20.650> thirty

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
abilities however only count to thirty

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.310 
abilities however only count to thirty
percent<00:01:21.370> this<00:01:22.150> allows<00:01:22.450> us<00:01:22.480> to<00:01:22.690> say<00:01:23.020> that<00:01:23.290> a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
percent this allows us to say that a

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.620 
percent this allows us to say that a
player<00:01:23.620> can<00:01:23.740> have<00:01:24.130> a<00:01:24.160> low<00:01:24.520> heading<00:01:24.910> skill<00:01:25.240> but

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
player can have a low heading skill but

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.540 
player can have a low heading skill but
is<00:01:25.780> such<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.020> good<00:01:26.290> striker<00:01:26.650> that<00:01:26.860> he<00:01:27.130> can<00:01:27.250> still

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
is such a good striker that he can still

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.570 
is such a good striker that he can still
reach<00:01:27.790> level<00:01:28.180> 95<00:01:28.510> easily<00:01:29.290> this<00:01:30.070> is<00:01:30.220> a<00:01:30.250> huge

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
reach level 95 easily this is a huge

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.610 
reach level 95 easily this is a huge
improvement<00:01:30.760> making<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.810> possible<00:01:31.990> for<00:01:32.290> us<00:01:32.590> to

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
improvement making it possible for us to

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.890 
improvement making it possible for us to
assign<00:01:33.100> a<00:01:33.340> real<00:01:33.640> value<00:01:34.120> for<00:01:34.360> every<00:01:34.480> position

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
assign a real value for every position

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.840 
assign a real value for every position
on<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.260> pitch<00:01:35.440> this<00:01:36.040> means<00:01:36.370> that<00:01:36.460> in<00:01:36.730> the

of course was way too difficult and not

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.110 
of course was way too difficult and not
realistic<00:01:55.600> we've<00:01:56.170> turned<00:01:56.440> that<00:01:56.680> off<00:01:56.740> now<00:01:57.220> the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
realistic we've turned that off now the

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.820 
realistic we've turned that off now the
third<00:01:58.360> issue<00:01:58.570> we<00:01:58.870> tackled<00:01:59.290> was<00:01:59.440> gaining

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
third issue we tackled was gaining

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.070 
third issue we tackled was gaining
experience<00:02:00.280> in<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:01.390> past<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.840> players

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
experience in the past the players

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.840 
experience in the past the players
experience<00:02:02.560> was<00:02:02.950> a<00:02:02.980> value<00:02:03.400> that<00:02:03.430> somehow

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
experience was a value that somehow

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.210 
experience was a value that somehow
played<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:04.300> role<00:02:04.570> in<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.870> background<00:02:05.350> however

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
played a role in the background however

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.369 
played a role in the background however
what<00:02:06.730> it<00:02:06.850> influenced<00:02:07.420> was<00:02:07.570> not<00:02:07.750> very<00:02:07.900> evident

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
what it influenced was not very evident

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.919 
what it influenced was not very evident
now<00:02:09.159> you<00:02:09.220> can<00:02:09.459> directly<00:02:09.909> set<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.330> experience

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
now you can directly set the experience

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.780 
now you can directly set the experience
values<00:02:11.319> for<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.620> player<00:02:11.860> in<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.159> editor<00:02:12.610> and

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
values for the player in the editor and

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.699 
values for the player in the editor and
this<00:02:13.150> experience<00:02:13.540> has<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.959> direct<00:02:14.349> influence

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
this experience has a direct influence

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.340 
this experience has a direct influence
on<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.220> players<00:02:15.460> level<00:02:15.760> this<00:02:16.750> influence<00:02:17.230> can

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
on the players level this influence can

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.410 
on the players level this influence can
be<00:02:17.410> seen<00:02:17.500> with<00:02:17.860> older<00:02:18.160> players<00:02:18.400> for<00:02:18.970> example

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
be seen with older players for example

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.610 
be seen with older players for example
if<00:02:19.600> I<00:02:19.810> have<00:02:19.930> some<00:02:20.140> seasoned

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
if I have some seasoned

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.140 
if I have some seasoned
players<00:02:20.860> in<00:02:21.069> my<00:02:21.220> team<00:02:21.489> there<00:02:22.000> will<00:02:22.120> be

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
players in my team there will be

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.789 
players in my team there will be
corresponding<00:02:22.450> bonus<00:02:23.230> points<00:02:23.590> which<00:02:23.769> can

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
corresponding bonus points which can

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.949 
corresponding bonus points which can
amount<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.340> up<00:02:24.549> to<00:02:24.700> three<00:02:24.970> per<00:02:25.150> player<00:02:25.420> mother

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
amount to up to three per player mother

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.690 
amount to up to three per player mother
is<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.200> deduction<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.950> experience<00:02:27.519> for

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
is a deduction and experience for

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.000 
is a deduction and experience for
rookies<00:02:28.060> this<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.140> difference<00:02:29.500> of<00:02:29.620> seven

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
rookies this is a difference of seven

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.100 
rookies this is a difference of seven
points<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.580> obviously<00:02:31.180> is<00:02:31.390> good<00:02:31.599> to<00:02:31.720> have<00:02:31.840> two

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
points and obviously is good to have two

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.630 
points and obviously is good to have two
or<00:02:32.260> three<00:02:32.290> experienced<00:02:33.069> players<00:02:33.310> in<00:02:33.489> your

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
or three experienced players in your

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.130 
or three experienced players in your
team<00:02:33.879> who<00:02:34.150> may<00:02:34.360> not<00:02:34.659> have<00:02:34.900> that<00:02:35.080> much

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
team who may not have that much

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.110 
team who may not have that much
potential<00:02:35.709> for<00:02:35.890> further<00:02:36.129> development<00:02:36.819> after

potential for further development after

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.300 
potential for further development after
a<00:02:37.870> couple<00:02:38.079> of<00:02:38.200> years<00:02:38.440> they<00:02:38.890> can<00:02:39.040> then<00:02:39.190> be

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
a couple of years they can then be

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.069 
a couple of years they can then be
substituted<00:02:40.060> with<00:02:40.090> younger<00:02:40.480> up-and-coming
