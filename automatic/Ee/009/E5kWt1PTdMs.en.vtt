so<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.490> would<00:02:00.330> think<00:02:00.480> the<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.020> first<00:02:01.320> part<00:02:01.650> of

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
so I would think the the first part of

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.240 
so I would think the the first part of
getting<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.580> growly<00:02:02.940> sound<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:04.500> think<00:02:05.100> of

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
getting that growly sound is to think of

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.980 
getting that growly sound is to think of
the<00:02:05.400> fretboard<00:02:05.700> as<00:02:06.030> your<00:02:06.180> friend<00:02:06.479> or<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the fretboard as your friend or the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.370 
the fretboard as your friend or the
finger<00:02:07.229> boards<00:02:07.530> are<00:02:08.270> a<00:02:09.270> lot<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.200> times

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
finger boards are a lot of times

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.890 
finger boards are a lot of times
whenever<00:02:10.619> we<00:02:10.770> do<00:02:10.890> pit<00:02:11.100> Scotto<00:02:11.660> like<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.750> said

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
whenever we do pit Scotto like I said

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.570 
whenever we do pit Scotto like I said
you're<00:02:13.020> trying<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.290> get<00:02:13.380> this<00:02:13.470> pure<00:02:13.830> sound<00:02:14.130> a

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
need to really lay into the string

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.729 
need to really lay into the string
instead<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.880> playing<00:02:36.810> away<00:02:37.230> from<00:02:37.620> the

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
instead of playing away from the

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.790 
instead of playing away from the
fingerboard<00:02:38.660> what<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.780> play<00:02:40.020> sort<00:02:40.709> of

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
fingerboard what to play sort of

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.229 
fingerboard what to play sort of
parallel<00:02:41.310> with<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.489> fingerboard<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:45.030> what

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
parallel with the fingerboard so what

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.000 
parallel with the fingerboard so what
ends<00:02:45.420> up<00:02:45.480> happening<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:46.020> that<00:02:46.140> your<00:02:46.320> string<00:02:46.709> is

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
ends up happening is that your string is

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.640 
ends up happening is that your string is
moving<00:02:47.660> parallel<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.840> thing<00:02:49.020> board<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.440> ends

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
moving parallel the thing board it ends

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.350 
moving parallel the thing board it ends
up<00:02:49.739> kind<00:02:49.950> of<00:02:50.040> hitting<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.610> fingerboard<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:51.120> few

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
up kind of hitting the fingerboard a few

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.660 
up kind of hitting the fingerboard a few
times<00:02:51.920> that's<00:02:52.920> how<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.190> get<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.489> ground

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
times that's how you get the ground

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.020

that's

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030

so<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:08.270> technique<00:03:08.600> that<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:08.780> use<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.050> do<00:03:09.200> this

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
so the technique that I use to do this

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.750 
so the technique that I use to do this
is<00:03:09.410> very<00:03:09.860> similar<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.220> how<00:03:10.310> a<00:03:10.340> bass<00:03:10.580> player

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
is very similar to how a bass player

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.830 
is very similar to how a bass player
plays<00:03:11.150> where<00:03:11.840> instead<00:03:12.710> of<00:03:12.770> playing<00:03:13.100> a<00:03:13.280> way

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
plays where instead of playing a way

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.950 
plays where instead of playing a way
this<00:03:14.840> way<00:03:15.080> we<00:03:15.590> want<00:03:15.770> to<00:03:15.860> play<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:20.420> way<00:03:20.480> where

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
this way we want to play that way where

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.810 
this way we want to play that way where
what<00:03:21.110> I'm<00:03:21.230> doing<00:03:21.440> is<00:03:21.590> I'm<00:03:21.680> pressing<00:03:22.220> down<00:03:22.490> on

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
what I'm doing is I'm pressing down on

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.420 
what I'm doing is I'm pressing down on
the<00:03:23.060> string<00:03:23.390> into<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.960> fingerboard<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:24.830> then

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
the string into the fingerboard and then

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.830 
the string into the fingerboard and then
kind<00:03:25.670> of<00:03:25.730> rubbing<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:27.650> fingerboard<00:03:28.010> and

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
kind of rubbing the fingerboard and

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.940 
kind of rubbing the fingerboard and
letting<00:03:29.840> go<00:03:29.990> just<00:03:30.020> kind<00:03:30.380> of<00:03:30.410> like<00:03:30.590> like<00:03:30.860> a

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
letting go just kind of like like a

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.190 
letting go just kind of like like a
little<00:03:31.160> bow<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.460> arrow<00:03:31.610> as<00:03:31.790> you<00:03:31.880> go<00:03:32.000> boom<00:03:32.720> pull

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
little bow and arrow as you go boom pull

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.140
