00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
boat videos the last few that I had done

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.830 
boat videos the last few that I had done
I<00:00:36.340> was<00:00:36.880> complaining<00:00:37.180> about<00:00:37.390> how<00:00:37.600> it<00:00:37.660> was

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
I was complaining about how it was

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.990 
I was complaining about how it was
losing<00:00:38.050> speed<00:00:38.500> and<00:00:38.740> power<00:00:38.920> and<00:00:39.220> I<00:00:39.310> assumed<00:00:39.730> at

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
losing speed and power and I assumed at

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.140 
losing speed and power and I assumed at
the<00:00:40.120> time<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.160> motor<00:00:42.370> or<00:00:42.610> something<00:00:43.000> was

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
the time that the motor or something was

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.640 
the time that the motor or something was
just<00:00:43.300> getting<00:00:43.600> tired<00:00:43.780> right<00:00:44.140> whatever<00:00:44.410> the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
just getting tired right whatever the

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.770 
just getting tired right whatever the
case<00:00:44.830> motor<00:00:45.100> ESC<00:00:45.610> I<00:00:45.640> didn't<00:00:46.240> know<00:00:46.330> that<00:00:46.480> was<00:00:46.630> my

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
case motor ESC I didn't know that was my

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.530 
case motor ESC I didn't know that was my
guess<00:00:46.990> anyway<00:00:47.310> turned<00:00:48.310> out<00:00:48.460> down<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.240> road<00:00:49.390> I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
guess anyway turned out down the road I

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.820 
guess anyway turned out down the road I
had<00:00:49.660> to<00:00:49.750> take<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:50.050> Impella<00:00:50.350> row<00:00:50.530> because<00:00:50.800> a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
had to take the Impella row because a

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.950 
had to take the Impella row because a
bunch<00:00:51.010> of<00:00:51.160> crap<00:00:51.340> got<00:00:51.550> in<00:00:51.700> there<00:00:51.820> it<00:00:52.270> was<00:00:52.300> broken

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
bunch of crap got in there it was broken

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.040 
bunch of crap got in there it was broken
I<00:00:53.140> had<00:00:53.980> only<00:00:54.190> one<00:00:54.280> blade<00:00:54.790> on<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.150> impeller<00:00:55.450> out

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
I had only one blade on the impeller out

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.280 
I had only one blade on the impeller out
of<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.500> two<00:00:56.910> that's<00:00:57.910> why<00:00:58.300> it<00:00:58.360> slowed<00:00:58.840> down<00:00:58.870> and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
of the two that's why it slowed down and

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.850 
of the two that's why it slowed down and
lost<00:00:59.440> power<00:01:00.150> so<00:01:01.150> uh<00:01:01.180> I<00:01:01.810> got<00:01:02.200> the<00:01:02.350> new<00:01:02.470> ones<00:01:02.710> and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
lost power so uh I got the new ones and

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.060 
lost power so uh I got the new ones and
I<00:01:03.010> ordered<00:01:03.310> a<00:01:03.340> couple<00:01:03.550> of<00:01:03.760> in<00:01:03.880> so<00:01:04.860> flex<00:01:05.860> shaft

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
I ordered a couple of in so flex shaft

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.580 
I ordered a couple of in so flex shaft
this<00:01:06.369> time<00:01:06.610> versus<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:07.750> solid<00:01:08.140> shaft<00:01:08.320> so

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
this time versus the solid shaft so

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.830 
this time versus the solid shaft so
that's<00:01:08.770> cool<00:01:08.979> but<00:01:09.159> check<00:01:09.340> it<00:01:09.369> out

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
that's cool but check it out

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.240 
that's cool but check it out
the<00:01:10.840> new<00:01:10.990> ones<00:01:11.109> a<00:01:11.200> little<00:01:11.439> bit<00:01:11.530> longer<00:01:11.710> so<00:01:14.250> must

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
the new ones a little bit longer so must

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.310 
the new ones a little bit longer so must
be<00:01:15.369> multi-application<00:01:15.850> or<00:01:16.509> something<00:01:16.840> I<00:01:16.929> I'm

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
be multi-application or something I I'm

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.889 
be multi-application or something I I'm
not<00:01:17.619> sure<00:01:17.939> but<00:01:18.939> it<00:01:19.060> won't<00:01:19.240> fit<00:01:19.450> in<00:01:19.539> my<00:01:19.659> boat<00:01:19.869> for

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
not sure but it won't fit in my boat for

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:20.539 
not sure but it won't fit in my boat for

sure
not<00:01:21.549> without<00:01:21.700> spacing<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.359> motor<00:01:22.539> back<00:01:22.749> a

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
not without spacing the motor back a

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.380 
not without spacing the motor back a
whole<00:01:23.049> bunch<00:01:23.320> which<00:01:23.560> I<00:01:23.920> don't<00:01:24.520> have<00:01:24.759> to<00:01:24.999> do<00:01:25.179> now

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390

so I don't want to do it so I'm just

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.149 
so I don't want to do it so I'm just
going<00:01:28.299> to<00:01:28.390> cut<00:01:28.570> it<00:01:28.689> a<00:01:28.719> little<00:01:28.899> bit<00:01:29.079> and<00:01:29.229> then

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
going to cut it a little bit and then

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.359 
going to cut it a little bit and then
solder<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.759> end<00:01:31.679> the<00:01:32.679> end<00:01:32.829> of<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.009> flex<00:01:33.249> cable

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
solder the end the end of the flex cable

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:34.739 
solder the end the end of the flex cable
I'll<00:01:33.700> put<00:01:33.880> some<00:01:33.999> solder<00:01:34.210> on<00:01:34.329> there<00:01:34.539> I've<00:01:34.600> done

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:34.749 
I'll put some solder on there I've done

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:36.330 
I'll put some solder on there I've done
it<00:01:34.840> with<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.079> bigger<00:01:35.289> flex<00:01:35.619> cables<00:01:36.009> for<00:01:36.159> the

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
it with the bigger flex cables for the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.789 
it with the bigger flex cables for the
bigger<00:01:36.850> boat<00:01:37.090> so<00:01:37.450> shouldn't<00:01:38.049> be<00:01:38.200> too<00:01:38.619> much<00:01:38.740> of

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
bigger boat so shouldn't be too much of

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.719 
bigger boat so shouldn't be too much of
a<00:01:38.920> problem<00:01:39.130> but<00:01:39.420> anyway<00:01:40.499> so<00:01:41.499> a<00:01:41.920> basic<00:01:42.520> tear

well electronics wise so it's a mere Evo

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.770 
well electronics wise so it's a mere Evo
ESC<00:01:58.780> so<00:01:59.439> that's<00:01:59.829> the<00:02:00.039> what<00:02:00.459> is<00:02:00.549> it<00:02:00.639> the<00:02:00.670> VX<00:02:01.030> l3m

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
ESC so that's the what is it the VX l3m

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.590

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
receiver I just took it apart so that I

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.790

could<00:02:51.640> spray<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.590> get<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.709> all

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
could spray it and get it all

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.740 
could spray it and get it all
waterproofed<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.519> there<00:02:54.670> because<00:02:54.820> what<00:02:55.630> was

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
waterproofed in there because what was

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.240 
waterproofed in there because what was
happening<00:02:56.140> if<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.350> boat<00:02:56.500> would<00:02:56.650> get<00:02:56.800> water<00:02:57.040> in

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
happening if the boat would get water in

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.190 
happening if the boat would get water in
it<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.400> sometimes<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.480> would<00:02:58.540> cut<00:02:58.720> out<00:02:58.840> once<00:02:59.080> a

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
it and sometimes it would cut out once a

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.500 
it and sometimes it would cut out once a
receiver<00:02:59.530> got<00:02:59.739> wet<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.280> flipped<00:03:01.000> around<00:03:01.150> and

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
receiver got wet it flipped around and

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.850 
receiver got wet it flipped around and
the<00:03:01.750> water<00:03:01.959> would<00:03:02.200> roll<00:03:02.410> away<00:03:02.500> from<00:03:02.800> the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
the water would roll away from the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.320 
the water would roll away from the
receiver<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.489> work<00:03:03.730> again<00:03:04.000> you<00:03:04.150> know<00:03:04.239> what

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
receiver and it work again you know what

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.790 
receiver and it work again you know what
immediately<00:03:04.660> was<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:04.900> crazy<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:06.850> I<00:03:07.650> just<00:03:08.650> D

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
immediately was just crazy so I just D

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.460 
immediately was just crazy so I just D
cased<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.900> sprayed<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:10.930> down<00:03:11.200> with<00:03:11.440> some

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
cased it and sprayed it down with some

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.590 
cased it and sprayed it down with some
Plasti<00:03:12.430> Dip<00:03:12.459> spray<00:03:12.910> Plasti<00:03:13.420> Dip

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
Plasti Dip spray Plasti Dip

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.150 
Plasti Dip spray Plasti Dip
and<00:03:13.780> then<00:03:14.410> I'm<00:03:14.500> just<00:03:14.590> going<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.830> mount<00:03:15.040> it

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
and then I'm just going to mount it

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.229 
and then I'm just going to mount it
somewhere<00:03:15.400> probably<00:03:15.700> on<00:03:15.819> top<00:03:16.000> of<00:03:16.150> the

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
somewhere probably on top of the

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.290 
somewhere probably on top of the
receiver<00:03:16.390> top<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.440> servo<00:03:17.769> back<00:03:17.950> here<00:03:18.300> so

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
receiver top of the servo back here so

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.350 
receiver top of the servo back here so
and<00:03:19.769> then<00:03:20.769> I<00:03:20.890> run<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.220> on<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.850> cell<00:03:22.090> bats

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
and then I run it on to cell bats

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.110 
and then I run it on to cell bats
generally<00:03:22.930> I<00:03:22.959> think<00:03:23.160> 2,200<00:03:24.160> is<00:03:24.640> about<00:03:25.000> the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
generally I think 2,200 is about the

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.120 
generally I think 2,200 is about the
biggest<00:03:25.269> one<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.540> have<00:03:25.750> I've<00:03:26.320> run<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.650> on<00:03:26.739> two<00:03:26.920> so

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
biggest one I have I've run it on two so

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.970 
biggest one I have I've run it on two so
I've<00:03:27.280> run<00:03:27.430> about<00:03:27.640> three<00:03:27.820> cell<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.380> think<00:03:29.380> it's

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
I've run about three cell I think it's

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.340 
I've run about three cell I think it's
just<00:03:30.340> as<00:03:30.549> fast<00:03:30.850> on<00:03:31.180> two<00:03:31.450> cell<00:03:31.750> as<00:03:31.930> it<00:03:32.049> is<00:03:32.170> on

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
just as fast on two cell as it is on

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.840 
just as fast on two cell as it is on
three<00:03:32.650> cell<00:03:32.890> it<00:03:33.070> just<00:03:33.250> doesn't<00:03:33.549> make<00:03:33.670> as<00:03:33.820> much

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
three cell it just doesn't make as much

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.850 
three cell it just doesn't make as much
noise<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:34.510> know<00:03:34.630> what<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:34.780> mean<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.560> just

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
noise you know what I mean it just

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.600 
noise you know what I mean it just
screams<00:03:36.459> on<00:03:36.760> three<00:03:37.060> cell<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.890> I<00:03:39.040> don't<00:03:39.100> know

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
screams on three cell and I don't know

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.569 
screams on three cell and I don't know
that<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:40.030> generates<00:03:40.750> any<00:03:40.959> more<00:03:41.170> speed<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:42.010> think

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
that it generates any more speed I think

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.080 
that it generates any more speed I think
that<00:03:43.060> it<00:03:43.930> cavitate<00:03:44.590> smore<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.430> brings<00:03:45.820> more

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
that it cavitate smore so it brings more

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.970 
that it cavitate smore so it brings more
air<00:03:46.329> into<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.720> impeller<00:03:47.109> area<00:03:47.470> instead<00:03:47.859> of

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
air into the impeller area instead of

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.229 
air into the impeller area instead of
passing<00:03:48.370> water<00:03:48.519> through<00:03:48.940> so<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:50.500> 2<00:03:50.769> s<00:03:50.950> is<00:03:51.250> is

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
passing water through so the 2 s is is

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.090 
passing water through so the 2 s is is
awesome<00:03:52.900> any<00:03:53.019> of<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.260> most<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:53.829> videos

problem<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:01.959> boat<00:04:02.140> had<00:04:02.380> tons<00:04:02.739> of<00:04:02.920> power<00:04:03.100> even

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
problem the boat had tons of power even

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.819 
problem the boat had tons of power even
with<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.359> one<00:04:04.600> bladed<00:04:05.049> impeller<00:04:05.380> I<00:04:05.530> could

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
with the one bladed impeller I could

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.670 
with the one bladed impeller I could
still<00:04:06.130> I<00:04:06.370> could<00:04:07.090> still<00:04:07.450> do<00:04:08.109> it<00:04:08.140> but<00:04:08.410> it<00:04:08.530> was<00:04:08.650> a

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
still I could still do it but it was a

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.710 
still I could still do it but it was a
little<00:04:08.950> tougher<00:04:09.310> I<00:04:09.340> just<00:04:09.760> certainly<00:04:10.480> didn't

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
little tougher I just certainly didn't

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.780 
little tougher I just certainly didn't
have<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.989> roof<00:04:12.090> so<00:04:13.090> so<00:04:13.900> anyway<00:04:13.989> I'm<00:04:14.380> going<00:04:14.620> to

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
have the roof so so anyway I'm going to

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.420 
have the roof so so anyway I'm going to
cut<00:04:15.790> this<00:04:16.000> down<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.160> can<00:04:18.459> mount<00:04:18.640> it<00:04:18.760> in<00:04:18.940> there

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
cut this down so I can mount it in there

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.650 
cut this down so I can mount it in there
yeah<00:04:21.430> I<00:04:21.489> mean<00:04:21.700> that's<00:04:21.910> all<00:04:22.090> there<00:04:22.210> is<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.479> it

of the boat I haven't had any need to I
mean<00:05:36.700> I've<00:05:36.820> checked<00:05:37.120> this<00:05:37.300> motor<00:05:37.540> lots<00:05:37.870> of

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
mean I've checked this motor lots of

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.070 
mean I've checked this motor lots of
times<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:39.430> I<00:05:39.520> never<00:05:39.760> get<00:05:40.000> it<00:05:40.090> hot<00:05:40.270> now<00:05:40.810> maybe

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
times and I never get it hot now maybe

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.620 
times and I never get it hot now maybe
running<00:05:41.500> on<00:05:41.710> three<00:05:42.130> cell<00:05:42.460> perhaps<00:05:43.300> it<00:05:43.540> would

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
running on three cell perhaps it would

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.230

previously<00:05:46.930> I<00:05:47.160> don't<00:05:48.160> think<00:05:48.400> even<00:05:48.670> then<00:05:48.790> I<00:05:48.850> was

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
previously I don't think even then I was

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.690 
previously I don't think even then I was
having<00:05:49.360> heat<00:05:49.540> issues<00:05:49.870> but<00:05:50.140> you<00:05:51.100> know<00:05:51.250> to<00:05:51.550> each

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
having heat issues but you know to each

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.000 
having heat issues but you know to each
their<00:05:51.730> own<00:05:51.970> it<00:05:52.270> depends<00:05:52.540> on<00:05:52.690> the<00:05:52.810> setup<00:05:53.200> and

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
their own it depends on the setup and

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.460 
their own it depends on the setup and
everything<00:05:54.490> else<00:05:54.670> temperatures<00:05:55.380> here<00:05:56.380> in

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
everything else temperatures here in

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.740 
everything else temperatures here in
Calgary<00:05:56.740> I<00:05:57.010> mean<00:05:57.340> you<00:05:57.970> know<00:05:58.060> it's<00:05:58.240> pretty<00:05:58.510> warm

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
Calgary I mean you know it's pretty warm

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.470 
Calgary I mean you know it's pretty warm
when<00:05:58.900> I've<00:05:59.020> run<00:05:59.170> this<00:05:59.350> in<00:05:59.530> the<00:05:59.620> summer<00:05:59.860> at<00:06:00.100> the

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
when I've run this in the summer at the

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.300 
when I've run this in the summer at the
Harvey's<00:06:01.480> passage<00:06:01.960> and<00:06:02.140> stuff<00:06:02.380> but<00:06:02.650> like

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
Harvey's passage and stuff but like

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.710 
Harvey's passage and stuff but like
right<00:06:03.520> now<00:06:03.700> we're<00:06:03.970> looking<00:06:04.390> at<00:06:04.540> you<00:06:04.630> know

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
right now we're looking at you know

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.170 
right now we're looking at you know
three<00:06:05.050> degrees<00:06:05.380> Celsius<00:06:05.920> out<00:06:06.550> there<00:06:06.880> and<00:06:07.090> I'm

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
three degrees Celsius out there and I'm

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.940 
three degrees Celsius out there and I'm
thinking<00:06:07.270> of<00:06:07.690> taking<00:06:07.840> it<00:06:08.170> up<00:06:08.320> tonight<00:06:08.650> so

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
thinking of taking it up tonight so

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.560 
thinking of taking it up tonight so
it'll<00:06:09.130> probably<00:06:09.310> be<00:06:09.520> right<00:06:09.700> around<00:06:09.940> zero<00:06:10.060> so

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
it'll probably be right around zero so

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.780 
it'll probably be right around zero so
even<00:06:11.470> though<00:06:11.590> there's<00:06:11.770> no<00:06:11.890> water<00:06:12.130> cooling<00:06:12.610> the

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
even though there's no water cooling the

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.090 
even though there's no water cooling the
you<00:06:13.180> know<00:06:13.270> it's<00:06:13.570> cool<00:06:14.260> out<00:06:14.470> overall<00:06:14.890> but

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
you know it's cool out overall but

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.680 
you know it's cool out overall but
anyways<00:06:15.400> it's<00:06:15.910> just<00:06:16.090> simply<00:06:16.510> been<00:06:16.660> a

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
anyways it's just simply been a

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.550 
anyways it's just simply been a
non-issue<00:06:17.110> this<00:06:17.740> is<00:06:17.890> the<00:06:18.040> first<00:06:18.720> the<00:06:19.720> same<00:06:19.930> esc

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
non-issue this is the first the same esc

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.130 
non-issue this is the first the same esc

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.140 
a motor that i've used in it never heard

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.870 
a motor that i've used in it never heard
it<00:06:23.290> you<00:06:23.530> know<00:06:23.590> what<00:06:23.740> i<00:06:23.770> mean<00:06:23.800> this<00:06:24.040> it's<00:06:24.670> never

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
it you know what i mean this it's never

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.990 
it you know what i mean this it's never
had<00:06:25.090> a<00:06:25.120> problem<00:06:25.750> so<00:06:26.550> there<00:06:27.550> again<00:06:27.760> maybe

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
had a problem so there again maybe

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.910 
had a problem so there again maybe
constant<00:06:28.630> running<00:06:28.750> a<00:06:28.930> 3-cell<00:06:29.410> you<00:06:29.560> might<00:06:29.710> make

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:29.920 
constant running a 3-cell you might make

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.560 
constant running a 3-cell you might make
more<00:06:30.100> heat<00:06:30.340> than<00:06:30.550> to<00:06:30.730> sell<00:06:30.970> though<00:06:31.120> right<00:06:31.300> so

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
more heat than to sell though right so

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.480 
more heat than to sell though right so
