so<00:00:01.100> we're<00:00:01.250> gonna<00:00:01.339> carry<00:00:01.670> on<00:00:01.849> now<00:00:02.090> a<00:00:02.120> little<00:00:02.360> bit

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:02.510 
so we're gonna carry on now a little bit

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:03.910 
so we're gonna carry on now a little bit
more<00:00:02.690> about<00:00:02.840> the<00:00:02.990> RC<00:00:03.380> booster<00:00:03.560> with<00:00:03.890> a

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:03.920 
more about the RC booster with a

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.889 
more about the RC booster with a
humbucking<00:00:04.370> pickup<00:00:04.850> guitar<00:00:05.240> which<00:00:05.629> I<00:00:05.720> think

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:05.899 
humbucking pickup guitar which I think

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:07.869 
humbucking pickup guitar which I think
it's<00:00:06.019> important<00:00:06.439> to<00:00:06.620> all<00:00:07.580> right<00:00:07.700> you're

00:00:07.869 --> 00:00:07.879 
it's important to all right you're

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:19.419 
it's important to all right you're
playing<00:00:08.150> rhythm<00:00:08.600> you<00:00:08.840> know<00:00:18.220> doesn't<00:00:19.220> sound

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:19.429 
playing rhythm you know doesn't sound

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.249 
playing rhythm you know doesn't sound
bad<00:00:19.609> you<00:00:20.089> know<00:00:20.210> sounds<00:00:20.539> pretty<00:00:20.839> good<00:00:20.990> but<00:00:21.169> the

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:21.259 
bad you know sounds pretty good but the

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:22.929 
bad you know sounds pretty good but the
notes<00:00:21.499> kind<00:00:21.769> of<00:00:21.980> don't<00:00:22.160> give<00:00:22.339> me<00:00:22.429> quite<00:00:22.699> what<00:00:22.909> I

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
notes kind of don't give me quite what I

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:46.440 
notes kind of don't give me quite what I
need<00:00:23.259> hit<00:00:24.259> in<00:00:24.409> the<00:00:24.560> magical<00:00:25.039> RC<00:00:25.460> booster

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.900 

I<00:00:46.540> got<00:00:47.050> all<00:00:47.260> my<00:00:47.290> sustain<00:00:47.920> but<00:00:48.460> it's<00:00:48.640> still

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
I got all my sustain but it's still

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.230 
I got all my sustain but it's still
clear<00:00:49.630> sounding<00:00:50.350> so<00:00:50.890> I<00:00:51.340> mean<00:00:51.550> you<00:00:51.700> just<00:00:51.730> can't

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
clear sounding so I mean you just can't

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:00.510 
clear sounding so I mean you just can't
beat<00:00:52.510> it<00:00:56.070> with<00:00:57.070> it<00:00:57.220> off<00:00:58.860> it<00:00:59.860> just<00:00:59.920> kind<00:01:00.220> of<00:01:00.310> dies

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
beat it with it off it just kind of dies

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.510 
beat it with it off it just kind of dies
out<00:01:00.880> and<00:01:01.210> it's<00:01:01.390> harder<00:01:01.720> to<00:01:01.840> play<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.950> tone<00:01:03.250> is

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
out and it's harder to play the tone is

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.160 
out and it's harder to play the tone is
exactly<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:04.300> same<00:01:04.540> I<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:07.360> got<00:01:07.690> a<00:01:07.720> little<00:01:08.050> bit

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
exactly the same I just got a little bit

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.020 
exactly the same I just got a little bit
more<00:01:08.410> juice<00:01:08.740> it's<00:01:08.979> almost<00:01:09.250> like<00:01:09.460> my<00:01:09.640> it's<00:01:09.910> a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
more juice it's almost like my it's a

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.930 
more juice it's almost like my it's a
better<00:01:10.270> sounding<00:01:10.780> amp<00:01:10.990> so<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:12.010> RC<00:01:12.400> booster<00:01:12.580> to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
better sounding amp so the RC booster to

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.630 
better sounding amp so the RC booster to
me<00:01:13.120> is<00:01:13.300> an<00:01:13.690> essential<00:01:14.229> now<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:14.860> other<00:01:15.340> thing
