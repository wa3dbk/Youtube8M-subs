I'm sure they'll probably do reviews on
them<00:00:45.450> later<00:00:45.739> so<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.070> will<00:00:47.670> see<00:00:48.200> more<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.260> them

I mean I'm not very good with math but

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.879 
I mean I'm not very good with math but
that<00:05:29.270> was<00:05:29.450> a<00:05:29.479> little<00:05:29.810> late<00:05:29.990> and<00:05:30.229> as<00:05:30.680> you<00:05:30.800> can

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
that was a little late and as you can

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.100 
that was a little late and as you can
see<00:05:30.950> I<00:05:31.130> already<00:05:31.400> started<00:05:31.729> this<00:05:31.880> one<00:05:32.090> I'm<00:05:32.960> going

on<00:05:33.320> chapter<00:05:33.680> two<00:05:33.860> but<00:05:34.220> that's<00:05:34.970> because<00:05:35.150> I<00:05:35.360> was

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
on chapter two but that's because I was

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.900 
on chapter two but that's because I was
doing<00:05:35.599> a<00:05:35.720> lot<00:05:35.810> errands<00:05:36.169> today<00:05:36.440> and<00:05:36.680> last<00:05:37.639> time

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.730 
doing a lot errands today and last time
I<00:05:37.970> checked<00:05:38.360> it's<00:05:38.539> not<00:05:38.720> too<00:05:38.960> safe<00:05:39.260> to<00:05:39.289> read

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
that's pretty much it so it was kind of

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.150
