 we have a mod that will add just 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.559
 chic 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.070

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:19.590

 is a new ore to the city such here 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.099
 so she looks pretty pretty 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.560
 as you might notice looks on 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.050
 similar to this one 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.800
 stone from inter peace and yeah slept not 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.829
 only in the world that is in general 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.809
 only on the internet so to get there 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.870
 you will have to put a lot of effort into 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.789
 this let's get it to be myself 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.660
 pretty hard considering it's 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.789
 new pickaxe 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.329
 we get these crystals here 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.969
 dragon's he to me dragon of them we 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.340
 crafted not only have one, and Ender 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.339
 pearls and it was from the mouth 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.570
 well of these call to call you understand 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:13.950
 we get this anri find in der in 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:20.100
 god and then we overcook it 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:23.610
 enough mane and overcooked now he 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.330
 overcook a little wait wait see 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.900
 us a pig for example on pits on a sheep and 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.619
 everything 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.619
 and we get enter in god we've got here 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.950
 have scrolls gave them from see how 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.450
 fuck then scold out of these bullion 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.549
 we can but it seems like normal 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.610
 armor is only used ender ingots 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.610
 that is, here are these new ore neruda 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.700
 new scrolls 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:55.939
 like this we are crafting boots 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:59.810
 chest bib knives and helmet like this 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.490
 she looks like this armor 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.810
 I wonder how iron is just another 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.239
 colors and what's next 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:14.810

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.400
 Kravtsa bow here there before the bow 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.060
 here's a special window to be painted 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.549
 quite an interesting craft from him 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.130
 guys are not Siberian actually this 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.959
 special arrows for this bow that is 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.400
 usually arrows you will not be able to shoot a 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.319
 this dream 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.750
 especially for this bow, these arrows 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.700
 attack don't paint 1 was out of his mouth and he gives 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.860
 year and this is yan archer instrument all 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.959
 this is our purple stone blocks 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.910
 right here dragonstone they are smoked 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:52.459
 so here we have beautiful blocks too 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.350
 from ingots Ender's actually here it 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.660
 really beautiful blocks not that 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.269
 just a modified emerald and this one 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.810
 powerless beautiful blog and stealing a dream here 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.690
 and sender ingo then just add up 9 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:10.579
 ingots now let's check 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:13.420
 efficiency of tools we will look 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.420
 first ax 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.140
 well i can tell you right away i 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.350
 checked diamond 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.520
 and these these as if they are a little bit 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.500
 faster and durability they have more well in 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.640
 overall it's still better diamonds 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.950
 diamond tools and rooms knowing the armor 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.020
 Well, about armor, no armor 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.390
 to keep the same amount of damage and how much 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.810
 diamond but it is not tough and durable 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:46.490
 holding on longer so we fixed the pickaxe 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:49.810
 let's handle a shovel well hoe sense 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:57.920
 no hoe she and in africa model 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:04:03.670
 pretty quick great thing u 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:07.180
 we have a sword and a bow let's try everything 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.180
 first sword 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:22.090
 we have a sword for 10 no less no more 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:25.090
 as you can see 10 10 10 even from under the jump 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.090
 1010 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.180
 as you see children 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.010
 exactly 10 diamond swords in general he beats 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.100
 so many diamonds just always 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.210
 10 that is, as it were, intermediate rank 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.160
 let's say from 8 to 10 this will not happen 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.770
 it 's actually awesome now 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.080
 let's see onions onions with us 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.560
 looked guys flying well 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.930
 say onions we have medium recharge 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.080
 fast charge faster than normal 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:02.020
 also sets fire to his power 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.410
 in ordinary onion but as you can see in it 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:09.220
 recharge fast using and ignites 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.110
 and it actually heals cool 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.030
 remind me it seems or leaves further 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.760
 than ordinary bow I turn away and me 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:20.560
 it seems and shoots more than usual 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.540
 bow let's come our kill ben well 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.320
