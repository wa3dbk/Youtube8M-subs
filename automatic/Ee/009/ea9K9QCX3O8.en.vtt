00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
got a couple of shims that are out of

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.639 
got a couple of shims that are out of
specification<00:00:31.759> so<00:00:32.689> we're<00:00:33.290> just<00:00:33.440> gonna<00:00:33.560> show

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
specification so we're just gonna show

I'm<00:00:37.090> gonna<00:00:38.090> be<00:00:38.210> doing<00:00:38.390> this<00:00:38.570> handheld<00:00:39.500> so<00:00:40.010> just

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
I'm gonna be doing this handheld so just

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.869 
I'm gonna be doing this handheld so just
bear<00:00:40.670> with<00:00:40.699> me<00:00:40.910> just<00:00:42.489> looking<00:00:43.489> at<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:43.640> sheet

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
bear with me just looking at the sheet

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.040 
bear with me just looking at the sheet
we're<00:00:44.120> gonna<00:00:44.239> be<00:00:44.420> going<00:00:44.750> on<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:45.460> inlet<00:00:46.460> cam

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
we're gonna be going on the inlet cam

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.220 
we're gonna be going on the inlet cam
cylinder<00:00:48.050> five<00:00:48.469> on<00:00:49.219> the<00:00:49.910> right-hand<00:00:50.570> side<00:00:50.750> for

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
cylinder five on the right-hand side for

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.779 
cylinder five on the right-hand side for
one<00:00:52.570> which<00:00:53.570> is<00:00:53.780> this<00:00:53.960> one<00:00:54.199> here<00:00:54.640> so<00:00:55.640> we've

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
one which is this one here so we've

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.489 
one which is this one here so we've
already<00:00:55.940> done<00:00:56.089> the<00:00:56.269> measurements<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:56.929> they

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:57.499 
already done the measurements and they

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:00.400 
already done the measurements and they
should<00:00:58.239> should<00:00:59.239> match<00:00:59.449> up<00:00:59.480> with<00:01:00.140> what<00:01:00.320> I'm

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
should should match up with what I'm

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.509 
should should match up with what I'm
gonna<00:01:00.559> show<00:01:00.769> you<00:01:00.829> now<00:01:02.710> point<00:01:03.710> 20<00:01:04.159> feet<00:01:04.370> of

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
gonna show you now point 20 feet of

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.520 
gonna show you now point 20 feet of
gauge<00:01:04.670> goes<00:01:05.000> in<00:01:07.600> 20<00:01:08.600> goes<00:01:08.750> in<00:01:08.930> on<00:01:09.020> both<00:01:09.230> sides

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
gauge goes in 20 goes in on both sides

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.670 
gauge goes in 20 goes in on both sides
and<00:01:10.460> then<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:10.940> spec<00:01:11.270> is<00:01:11.480> a<00:01:11.510> point<00:01:11.870> whether<00:01:12.380> the

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
and then the spec is a point whether the

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.530 
and then the spec is a point whether the
top<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:13.160> highest<00:01:13.310> tolerance<00:01:13.910> you<00:01:14.000> can<00:01:14.210> find

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
top the highest tolerance you can find

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.460 
top the highest tolerance you can find
on<00:01:14.690> here<00:01:14.870> is<00:01:14.960> 0.23<00:01:15.800> and<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:17.210> next<00:01:17.480> gauge<00:01:17.690> up<00:01:17.930> is

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
on here is 0.23 and the next gauge up is

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.290 
on here is 0.23 and the next gauge up is
0.25<00:01:19.370> so<00:01:20.060> if<00:01:20.150> this<00:01:20.300> goes<00:01:20.510> in<00:01:21.940> yes<00:01:22.940> it<00:01:23.150> does

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
0.25 so if this goes in yes it does

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.240 
0.25 so if this goes in yes it does
albeit<00:01:23.720> very<00:01:23.900> tight<00:01:24.200> but<00:01:24.560> if<00:01:24.680> it<00:01:24.800> does<00:01:24.920> go<00:01:25.100> in

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
albeit very tight but if it does go in

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.970 
albeit very tight but if it does go in
it's<00:01:25.430> a<00:01:25.700> bit<00:01:26.600> showing<00:01:26.870> it's<00:01:27.110> out<00:01:27.290> of<00:01:27.320> spec<00:01:27.710> only

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
it's a bit showing it's out of spec only

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.230 
it's a bit showing it's out of spec only
very<00:01:28.160> slightly<00:01:28.430> it's<00:01:28.790> just<00:01:28.970> got<00:01:29.090> to

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
very slightly it's just got to

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.050 
very slightly it's just got to
borderline<00:01:29.690> but<00:01:29.960> rather<00:01:30.620> and<00:01:30.860> leave<00:01:31.010> that<00:01:31.250> we

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
borderline but rather and leave that we

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.940 
borderline but rather and leave that we
carry<00:01:32.300> the<00:01:32.420> shims<00:01:32.630> in<00:01:32.780> stop<00:01:33.080> so<00:01:33.380> we've

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
carry the shims in stop so we've

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.520 
carry the shims in stop so we've
replaced<00:01:34.250> these<00:01:34.490> as<00:01:34.760> we<00:01:34.940> go<00:01:35.120> the<00:01:36.110> customer

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
replaced these as we go the customer

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.260 
replaced these as we go the customer
gets<00:01:36.740> her<00:01:36.890> extra<00:01:37.250> couple<00:01:37.460> of<00:01:37.640> pounds<00:01:38.000> on<00:01:38.090> their

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
gets her extra couple of pounds on their

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.750 
gets her extra couple of pounds on their
bill<00:01:38.420> for<00:01:38.690> a<00:01:38.720> shim<00:01:39.020> but<00:01:39.520> safe<00:01:40.520> in<00:01:40.670> the

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
bill for a shim but safe in the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.070 
bill for a shim but safe in the
knowledge<00:01:40.910> that<00:01:41.150> their<00:01:41.450> engine<00:01:41.780> is<00:01:41.900> going<00:01:42.020> to

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
knowledge that their engine is going to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.650 
knowledge that their engine is going to
be<00:01:42.170> performing<00:01:42.680> well<00:01:42.890> for<00:01:43.450> however<00:01:44.450> many

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
be performing well for however many

service<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.110> what<00:01:48.230> we're<00:01:48.320> gonna<00:01:48.410> do<00:01:48.560> here<00:01:48.740> is

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
service so what we're gonna do here is

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.090 
service so what we're gonna do here is
just<00:01:48.890> take<00:01:49.070> a<00:01:49.220> spring<00:01:49.490> clip<00:01:49.730> off<00:01:50.860> just<00:01:51.860> there

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
just take a spring clip off just there

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.290 
just take a spring clip off just there
sorry<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.460> video<00:01:52.550> is<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.760> bit<00:01:52.970> dark<00:01:53.210> but

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
sorry the video is a bit dark but

hopefully you'll be able to work out

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.580 
hopefully you'll be able to work out
what's<00:01:55.760> going<00:01:56.030> on<00:01:58.660> and<00:01:59.660> then<00:02:00.080> we're<00:02:00.290> gonna<00:02:00.380> go

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
what's going on and then we're gonna go

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.840 
what's going on and then we're gonna go
for<00:02:00.620> this<00:02:00.830> one<00:02:00.890> here<00:02:01.160> so<00:02:01.280> we're<00:02:01.370> taking<00:02:01.490> spring

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
for this one here so we're taking spring

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.980 
for this one here so we're taking spring
clip<00:02:02.030> off<00:02:02.210> we're<00:02:02.390> just<00:02:02.420> gonna<00:02:02.630> move<00:02:02.810> the

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
clip off we're just gonna move the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.760 
clip off we're just gonna move the
rocker<00:02:03.200> finger<00:02:04.630> across<00:02:05.630> to<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.020> right<00:02:06.230> and

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
moving the rocker finger a little drop

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.330 
moving the rocker finger a little drop
down<00:02:11.510> there

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
down there

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:22.740

fall spring and let that rest there then

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.150 
fall spring and let that rest there then
we're<00:02:36.130> gonna<00:02:36.220> get<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.459> BMW<00:02:36.670> special<00:02:37.360> tool<00:02:41.160> which

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
we're gonna get a BMW special tool which

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.990 
we're gonna get a BMW special tool which
is<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.370> certain<00:02:42.880> here<00:02:43.090> magnetic<00:02:43.950> tool<00:02:47.880> pick<00:02:48.880> the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
is a certain here magnetic tool pick the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.800 
is a certain here magnetic tool pick the

let's<00:02:50.200> erosion<00:02:50.830> that's<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.790> old<00:02:51.940> chin<00:02:53.910> then

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
let's erosion that's the old chin then

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.400 
let's erosion that's the old chin then
and<00:02:55.480> then<00:02:55.630> there's<00:02:55.750> nothing<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.019> see<00:02:56.260> at<00:02:56.350> the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
and then there's nothing to see at the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.110 
and then there's nothing to see at the
moment<00:02:56.530> but<00:02:56.830> that's<00:02:57.069> because<00:02:57.220> I'm<00:02:57.549> taking<00:02:57.849> the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
moment but that's because I'm taking the

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.630 
moment but that's because I'm taking the
shin<00:02:58.390> off<00:02:59.260> of<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.590> magnetic<00:03:00.190> tool

shin off of the magnetic tool

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.589 
shin off of the magnetic tool
one<00:03:00.819> second<00:03:04.049> putting<00:03:05.049> it<00:03:05.140> into<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.500> digital

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
one second putting it into a digital

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:14.699 
one second putting it into a digital
bernieoh<00:03:07.599> gauge<00:03:11.220> okay<00:03:12.220> so<00:03:12.519> it's<00:03:12.670> now<00:03:12.849> held<00:03:13.709> you

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
bernieoh gauge okay so it's now held you

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.470 
bernieoh gauge okay so it's now held you

something about a point to three range

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.320 
something about a point to three range
which<00:03:39.519> is<00:03:39.549> a<00:03:39.670> point<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.269> zero

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:51.970 

he's<00:03:44.630> gonna<00:03:44.870> show<00:03:45.050> my<00:03:45.790> knees<00:03:46.790> here

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.500 

we<00:03:52.980> carry<00:03:53.220> some<00:03:53.490> shims<00:03:53.700> in<00:03:53.910> stock

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
we carry some shims in stock

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.630 
we carry some shims in stock
I've<00:03:54.690> got<00:03:54.900> selection<00:03:55.350> of<00:03:55.440> views<00:03:55.620> there<00:03:55.920> these

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
I've got selection of views there these

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.870 
I've got selection of views there these
are<00:03:56.700> some<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.150> new<00:03:57.300> ones<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:59.370> we<00:03:59.730> can

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
are some of the new ones so we can

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.290 
are some of the new ones so we can
normally<00:04:00.270> go<00:04:00.660> as<00:04:00.900> on<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.710> on<00:04:02.460> the<00:04:02.820> fly<00:04:03.000> so<00:04:03.240> to

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
normally go as on the on the fly so to

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.060 
normally go as on the on the fly so to
speak<00:04:03.540> as<00:04:03.750> we're<00:04:03.930> doing<00:04:04.200> these<00:04:04.320> rather<00:04:04.890> than

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
speak as we're doing these rather than

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.980 
speak as we're doing these rather than
have<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:05.250> wait<00:04:05.460> a<00:04:05.490> next<00:04:05.850> day<00:04:05.970> towards<00:04:06.390> them<00:04:06.570> you

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
have to wait a next day towards them you

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.990 
have to wait a next day towards them you
go<00:04:07.200> so<00:04:07.470> we've<00:04:07.920> got<00:04:08.070> a<00:04:08.100> two<00:04:08.280> point<00:04:08.550> two<00:04:08.760> three

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
go so we've got a two point two three

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.770 
go so we've got a two point two three
now<00:04:09.240> I've<00:04:09.600> picked<00:04:09.810> up<00:04:10.970> in<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.270> in<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.570> gauge

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
now I've picked up in the in the gauge

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.270 
now I've picked up in the in the gauge
so<00:04:13.110> that's<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:13.530> point<00:04:13.800> zero<00:04:14.490> five<00:04:14.940> of<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.300> mil

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
so that's a point zero five of a mil

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.259 
so that's a point zero five of a mil
thicker<00:04:17.280> than<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:17.730> one<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:17.910> we've<00:04:18.150> just

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
thicker than the one that we've just

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.770 
thicker than the one that we've just
taken<00:04:18.480> out<00:04:20.090> again<00:04:21.090> you<00:04:21.209> won't<00:04:21.330> be<00:04:21.420> able<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.570> see

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
taken out again you won't be able to see

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.400 
taken out again you won't be able to see
much<00:04:21.959> for<00:04:22.140> a<00:04:22.170> second<00:04:22.560> because<00:04:22.770> I'm<00:04:23.220> just

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
much for a second because I'm just

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.120 
much for a second because I'm just
taking<00:04:25.410> this<00:04:25.530> shim<00:04:26.960> out<00:04:27.960> of<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.230> gauge<00:04:28.440> and

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
taking this shim out of the gauge and

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.260 
taking this shim out of the gauge and
putting<00:04:29.490> onto<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:29.790> magnetic<00:04:30.330> tool<00:04:32.210> okay<00:04:33.210> so

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
putting onto the magnetic tool okay so

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.840 
putting onto the magnetic tool okay so
we've<00:04:33.630> got<00:04:33.980> got<00:04:34.980> the<00:04:35.070> new<00:04:35.220> shim<00:04:35.460> on<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:36.540> magnet

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
we've got got the new shim on the magnet

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:48.730 
we've got got the new shim on the magnet
I'm<00:04:38.850> just<00:04:39.120> gonna<00:04:39.240> pop<00:04:39.510> that<00:04:39.540> back<00:04:39.930> in<00:04:43.850> which<00:04:44.850> is

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.910 

then<00:04:49.740> slide<00:04:50.010> the<00:04:50.040> finger<00:04:50.520> across<00:04:51.920> being

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
then slide the finger across being

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.220 
then slide the finger across being
careful<00:04:53.280> not<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.640> push<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.300> shim<00:04:54.510> out<00:04:56.000> and

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
careful not to push the shim out and

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:09.370 
careful not to push the shim out and
then<00:04:58.230> the<00:04:58.320> spring<00:04:58.620> clip<00:04:58.860> goes<00:04:59.100> in

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:17.140 

now<00:05:10.380> this<00:05:10.530> is<00:05:10.680> a<00:05:11.030> two-handed<00:05:12.030> job

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:27.129 

one<00:05:17.660> second

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.409 

okay<00:05:28.139> spring<00:05:28.470> clips<00:05:28.710> back<00:05:28.860> in<00:05:29.129> I<00:05:29.310> can't<00:05:30.270> move

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
the finger so that's all contained now

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.640 
the finger so that's all contained now
just<00:05:32.970> do<00:05:33.120> a<00:05:33.150> final<00:05:33.419> check<00:05:33.569> again<00:05:34.050> so<00:05:34.289> before

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
just do a final check again so before

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.010 
just do a final check again so before
would<00:05:34.770> you<00:05:34.830> get<00:05:35.009> a<00:05:35.039> point<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.639> five<00:05:36.150> in<00:05:36.719> there

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
would you get a point to five in there

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.409 
would you get a point to five in there
although<00:05:37.409> it<00:05:37.620> was<00:05:37.770> tight<00:05:38.069> so<00:05:38.969> it's<00:05:39.120> at<00:05:39.180> a<00:05:39.270> point

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
although it was tight so it's at a point

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.760 
although it was tight so it's at a point
20<00:05:40.110> now<00:05:40.400> that<00:05:41.400> goes<00:05:41.610> in<00:05:41.840> now<00:05:42.840> trying<00:05:43.439> to<00:05:43.530> point

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
20 now that goes in now trying to point

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.869 
20 now that goes in now trying to point
two<00:05:44.039> five<00:05:45.800> which<00:05:46.800> you<00:05:46.949> can<00:05:47.069> see<00:05:47.250> there<00:05:47.490> and

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
two five which you can see there and

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.209 
two five which you can see there and
obviously<00:05:48.300> this<00:05:48.990> shouldn't<00:05:49.379> go<00:05:49.590> in<00:05:49.770> good<00:05:50.069> now

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:50.219 
obviously this shouldn't go in good now

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:51.399 
obviously this shouldn't go in good now
because<00:05:50.310> we've<00:05:50.550> increased<00:05:51.000> the<00:05:51.120> gap

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.409 
because we've increased the gap

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:54.140 
because we've increased the gap
decreased<00:05:52.409> ago<00:05:52.680> and<00:05:53.310> know<00:05:53.550> that<00:05:53.849> we're<00:05:54.000> not

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
decreased ago and know that we're not

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.159 
decreased ago and know that we're not
going<00:05:54.360> at<00:05:55.139> all<00:05:55.639> but<00:05:56.639> the<00:05:56.729> two<00:05:56.909> did<00:05:57.240> so<00:05:57.569> that's

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
going at all but the two did so that's

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:03.740 
going at all but the two did so that's
how<00:05:58.349> you<00:05:58.789> change<00:05:59.789> the<00:05:59.969> evolved<00:06:00.629> Shimano<00:06:01.050> s54
