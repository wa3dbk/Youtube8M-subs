00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
footage as you can see I have in this

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.530 
footage as you can see I have in this
case<00:00:37.399> basically<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.579> principal<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.300> is

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
case basically the principal of this is

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.470 
case basically the principal of this is
we're<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.110> lay<00:00:40.350> five<00:00:40.829> tracks<00:00:41.480> different

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
we're going to lay five tracks different

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.510 
we're going to lay five tracks different
video<00:00:42.690> tracks<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.370> obviously

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
video tracks just here and obviously

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.180 
video tracks just here and obviously
overlapping<00:00:45.329> each<00:00:45.930> one<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.710> give<00:00:46.860> us<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
overlapping each one to give us the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.760 
overlapping each one to give us the
effect<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.850> you're<00:00:48.030> obviously<00:00:48.120> looking<00:00:48.570> for

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
effect that you're obviously looking for

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.750 
effect that you're obviously looking for
so<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> first<00:00:50.100> thing<00:00:50.250> we're<00:00:50.370> going<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.520> do<00:00:50.640> is

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
so the first thing we're going to do is

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.189 
so the first thing we're going to do is
obviously<00:00:50.879> lay<00:00:51.180> those<00:00:51.390> tracks<00:00:51.750> which<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
obviously lay those tracks which it's a

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.189 
obviously lay those tracks which it's a
simple<00:00:52.530> case<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:53.660> selection<00:00:54.660> your<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.170> out

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
simple case of selection your in and out

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.959 
simple case of selection your in and out
points<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.860> then<00:00:56.280> dropping<00:00:56.520> them<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
points and then dropping them on the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.910 
points and then dropping them on the
timeline<00:01:00.140> okay<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.440> see<00:01:01.590> I've<00:01:01.710> laid

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
timeline okay so you can see I've laid

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.490 
timeline okay so you can see I've laid
the<00:01:02.039> five<00:01:02.219> tracks<00:01:02.840> but<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.229> point

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the five tracks but the in and out point

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.010 
the five tracks but the in and out point
starting<00:01:05.070> where<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.760> need<00:01:06.090> them<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.750> all<00:01:06.840> these

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
starting where I need them to all these

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.410 
starting where I need them to all these
start<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.439> finish<00:01:07.909> if<00:01:08.909> you're<00:01:09.030> not<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.270> sure

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
start and finish if you're not in sure

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.149 
start and finish if you're not in sure
entirely<00:01:09.750> how<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.020> lay<00:01:10.260> track<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.710> top<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.010> each

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
entirely how to lay track on top of each

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.219 
entirely how to lay track on top of each
other<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.760> simply<00:01:12.030> drag<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.600> drop<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
other you just simply drag and drop the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.410 
other you just simply drag and drop the
track<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.500> slightly<00:01:13.920> over<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.610> track

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
track just slightly over the track

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.240 
track just slightly over the track
you've<00:01:15.570> already<00:01:15.659> laid<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.320> you'll<00:01:16.860> attract

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
you've already laid and you'll attract

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.310 
you've already laid and you'll attract
well<00:01:17.460> obviously<00:01:18.180> load<00:01:18.540> up<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.140> just

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
well obviously load up and you can just

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.380 
well obviously load up and you can just
let<00:01:19.409> go<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:20.130> will<00:01:20.250> drop<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.580> there<00:01:20.790> so

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
let go and that will drop in there so

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.550 
let go and that will drop in there so
basically<00:01:21.659> what<00:01:21.810> I've<00:01:21.930> done<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.229> you've<00:01:22.380> moved

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
basically what I've done is you've moved

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.039 
basically what I've done is you've moved
I've<00:01:22.920> moved<00:01:23.189> these<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> point<00:01:24.780> where

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
I've moved these in to the point where

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.190 
I've moved these in to the point where
obviously<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.350> want<00:01:25.560> them<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.740> start<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:28.020> as<00:01:28.080> you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
obviously I want them to start so as you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.840 
obviously I want them to start so as you
can<00:01:28.320> see<00:01:28.380> what<00:01:28.860> we<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.189> select<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> first

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
can see what we can do select the first

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.090 
can see what we can do select the first
bottom<00:01:30.180> track<00:01:30.420> make<00:01:31.259> sure<00:01:31.409> our<00:01:31.439> playhead<00:01:31.950> is

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
bottom track make sure our playhead is

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.490 
bottom track make sure our playhead is
at<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.280> beginning<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.990> obviously<00:01:34.320> as<00:01:34.409> you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
at the beginning and obviously as you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.929 
at the beginning and obviously as you
can<00:01:34.530> see<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.950> example<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.430> actually

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
can see in the example that actually

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.719 
can see in the example that actually
animated<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.570> into<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.900> corner<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.579> do

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
animated up into that corner and to do

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.179 
animated up into that corner and to do
that<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:40.020> said<00:01:40.200> make<00:01:40.409> sure<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.710> sound

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
that as I said make sure that sound

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.340 
that as I said make sure that sound

second<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.340> an<00:01:50.399> insert<00:01:50.729> keyframe<00:01:51.540> basically

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
second it's an insert keyframe basically

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.649 
second it's an insert keyframe basically
it's<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.159> point<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.970> where<00:01:54.180> something<00:01:54.570> is

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
it's a point and where something is

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.149 
it's a point and where something is
going<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.869> change<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.380> timeline<00:01:55.829> because

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
going to change on the timeline because

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.760 
going to change on the timeline because
this<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.549> representing<00:01:57.090> your<00:01:57.270> timeline<00:01:57.770> okay

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
this is representing your timeline okay

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.230 
this is representing your timeline okay
so<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.040> first<00:01:59.159> thing<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.460> did<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.670> on<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.060> on

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
so the first thing I did is on the on

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.899 
so the first thing I did is on the on
the<00:02:00.360> scale<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.020> was<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.380> start<00:02:01.619> point

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
the scale and that was the start point

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.770 
the scale and that was the start point
so<00:02:02.909> we<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.119> click<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.450> once

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
so we just click it once

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.210 
so we just click it once
move<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.229> along<00:02:04.579> just<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:06.119> playhead<00:02:06.540> just<00:02:07.220> to

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
move it along just the playhead just to

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.940 
move it along just the playhead just to
whatever<00:02:09.149> point<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.660> feel<00:02:09.840> that's<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.259> want

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
whatever point you feel that's you want

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.490 
whatever point you feel that's you want
it<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.190> scale<00:02:11.400> down<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.940> obviously<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.390> longer

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
it to scale down to obviously the longer

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.630 
it to scale down to obviously the longer
you're<00:02:13.620> leaving<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.130> longer<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:14.520> gonna

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
you're leaving the longer it's gonna

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.340 
you're leaving the longer it's gonna
take<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:15.120> scale<00:02:15.330> down<00:02:15.390> or<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.870> see<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.050> shorter

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
take to scale down or to see the shorter

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.770 
take to scale down or to see the shorter
the<00:02:16.440> gap<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.800> shorter<00:02:17.190> okay<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.150> we<00:02:18.330> know<00:02:18.480> I

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
the gap the shorter okay so we know I

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.230 
the gap the shorter okay so we know I
New<00:02:19.140> York's<00:02:19.320> 48<00:02:19.680> percent<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.310> crop<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.670> down<00:02:20.850> to

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
New York's 48 percent to crop it down to

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.460 
New York's 48 percent to crop it down to
scale<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.660> down<00:02:21.690> all<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.020> here<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.290> need<00:02:22.410> to

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
scale it down all this here you need to

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.490 
scale it down all this here you need to
play<00:02:22.710> with<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.510> then<00:02:24.510> what<00:02:24.660> we<00:02:24.750> did<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.200> you

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
play with that then what we did is you

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.170 
play with that then what we did is you
just<00:02:26.070> move<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.250> playhead<00:02:26.580> back<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
just move the playhead back to the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.680 
just move the playhead back to the
beginning

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
beginning

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.590 
beginning
on<00:02:27.780> these<00:02:28.470> dots<00:02:28.850> what<00:02:29.850> we've<00:02:30.000> got<00:02:30.150> now<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.480> on

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
on these dots what we've got now is on

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.790 
on these dots what we've got now is on
the<00:02:30.690> center<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.050> we're<00:02:31.290> pretty<00:02:31.440> much<00:02:31.620> doing

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
the center and we're pretty much doing

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.410 
the center and we're pretty much doing
it<00:02:32.010> exactly<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.610> same<00:02:32.820> we<00:02:32.940> can<00:02:32.970> equip<00:02:33.270> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
it exactly the same we can equip the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.290 
it exactly the same we can equip the
start<00:02:33.690> point<00:02:34.400> go<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.670> end<00:02:35.790> point<00:02:36.030> and

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
start point go to the end point and

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.870 
start point go to the end point and
basically<00:02:37.050> on<00:02:37.380> your<00:02:37.680> sequence<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:38.700> your

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
basically on your sequence and your

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.000 
basically on your sequence and your
canvas<00:02:39.270> we<00:02:39.900> buddy<00:02:40.110> pin<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.530> move<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.830> as<00:02:40.950> you

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
canvas we buddy pin and move it as you

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.530 
canvas we buddy pin and move it as you
can<00:02:41.100> see<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.400> lines<00:02:41.640> coming<00:02:41.970> up<00:02:42.180> which<00:02:42.420> is

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
can see the lines coming up which is

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.500 
can see the lines coming up which is
basically<00:02:42.990> our<00:02:43.110> animation<00:02:44.210> so<00:02:45.210> if<00:02:45.270> I<00:02:45.330> just

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
basically our animation so if I just

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.210 
basically our animation so if I just
play<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.870> quickly<00:02:46.410> you'll<00:02:47.070> see<00:02:47.250> what<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.430> mean

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
play that quickly you'll see what I mean

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.910 
play that quickly you'll see what I mean
fine<00:02:50.220> screen<00:02:50.670> number<00:02:51.500> okay<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.740> can<00:02:52.830> see

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
fine screen number okay so you can see

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.560 
fine screen number okay so you can see
I've<00:02:53.010> done<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.280> pretty<00:02:53.459> roughly<00:02:53.940> how<00:02:54.209> I

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
I've done that pretty roughly how I

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.550 
I've done that pretty roughly how I
would<00:02:54.780> have<00:02:54.870> thought<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.140> would<00:02:55.170> probably

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
would have thought you would probably

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.960 
would have thought you would probably
spend<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.800> bit<00:02:55.920> more<00:02:55.950> time<00:02:56.100> making<00:02:56.580> sure<00:02:56.730> that

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
spend a bit more time making sure that

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.240 
spend a bit more time making sure that
was<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.150> little<00:02:57.330> bit<00:02:57.420> smoother<00:02:57.810> ride<00:02:58.190> okay<00:02:59.190> so

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
was a little bit smoother ride okay so

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.070 
was a little bit smoother ride okay so
next<00:02:59.490> ever<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.820> want<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.030> do<00:03:00.150> is<00:03:00.420> go<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.720> the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
next ever you want to do is go to the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.340 
next ever you want to do is go to the
second<00:03:01.830> track<00:03:02.660> double-click<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.870> make<00:03:04.320> sure

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
second track double-click it make sure

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.860 
second track double-click it make sure
again<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.890> hit<00:03:05.070> on<00:03:05.100> stop<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.360> play<00:03:06.540> hit<00:03:06.720> on

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
again the hit on stop the play hit on

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.560 
again the hit on stop the play hit on
the<00:03:06.959> start<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.380> track<00:03:07.709> number<00:03:08.010> two<00:03:08.270> as<00:03:09.270> you<00:03:09.420> can

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
the start of track number two as you can

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.949 
the start of track number two as you can
see<00:03:09.780> it's<00:03:10.790> obviously<00:03:11.790> overlapping<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.720> not

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
see it's obviously overlapping and not

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.260 
see it's obviously overlapping and not
in<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.200> right<00:03:13.350> place<00:03:13.850> again<00:03:14.850> we<00:03:14.970> don't<00:03:15.150> need

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
in the right place again we don't need

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.140 
in the right place again we don't need
any<00:03:15.450> start<00:03:15.750> or<00:03:15.990> stop<00:03:16.140> points<00:03:16.650> on<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:17.150> insert

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
any start or stop points on the insert

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.970 
any start or stop points on the insert
delete<00:03:18.540> keyframe<00:03:19.140> I<00:03:19.260> mean<00:03:19.380> you<00:03:19.470> can<00:03:19.680> do<00:03:19.830> if<00:03:19.890> you

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
delete keyframe I mean you can do if you

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.830 
delete keyframe I mean you can do if you
want<00:03:20.010> use<00:03:20.310> exactly<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.000> same<00:03:21.180> principle<00:03:21.420> but

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
want use exactly the same principle but

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.140 
want use exactly the same principle but
obviously<00:03:22.200> move<00:03:22.380> in<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.620> different<00:03:22.769> direction

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
obviously move in a different direction

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.970 
obviously move in a different direction
will<00:03:24.150> undo<00:03:24.450> it's<00:03:24.959> just<00:03:25.170> gonna<00:03:25.350> pop<00:03:25.590> in<00:03:25.800> so

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
will undo it's just gonna pop in so

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.820 
will undo it's just gonna pop in so
again<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.220> know<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.519> was<00:03:26.610> 48<00:03:26.970> percent<00:03:27.739> and<00:03:28.739> again

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
again I know it was 48 percent and again

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.830 
again I know it was 48 percent and again
all<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:29.130> do<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.550> just<00:03:29.580> move<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.540> can<00:03:30.720> see

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
all I do is just move it and you can see

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.090 
all I do is just move it and you can see
this<00:03:30.989> time<00:03:31.200> around<00:03:31.320> there's<00:03:31.500> no<00:03:31.620> line<00:03:31.860> because

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
this time around there's no line because

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.860 
this time around there's no line because
this<00:03:32.250> does<00:03:32.430> not<00:03:32.459> animate<00:03:33.000> at<00:03:33.360> all<00:03:33.600> that's<00:03:33.780> just

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
this does not animate at all that's just

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.110 
this does not animate at all that's just
basically<00:03:34.380> going<00:03:34.590> up<00:03:34.709> here<00:03:34.890> if<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:35.790> just<00:03:36.000> show

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
basically going up here if I just show

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.110 
basically going up here if I just show
you<00:03:36.150> what<00:03:36.360> I<00:03:36.390> mean<00:03:39.019> I'm<00:03:40.019> screen<00:03:40.500> number<00:03:40.709> one

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
you what I mean I'm screen number one

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.780 
you what I mean I'm screen number one
and<00:03:42.799> okay<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:43.860> basically<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.430> repeat<00:03:44.640> that

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
and okay so basically you repeat that

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.449 
and okay so basically you repeat that
principle<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.200> rest<00:03:46.410> of<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.680> tracks<00:03:46.980> okay

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
principle to the rest of the tracks okay

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.979 
principle to the rest of the tracks okay
so<00:03:47.519> you<00:03:47.640> can<00:03:47.760> see<00:03:47.790> I've<00:03:48.060> laid<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.450> four<00:03:48.630> tracks

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
so you can see I've laid the four tracks

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.140 
so you can see I've laid the four tracks
and<00:03:49.650> put<00:03:49.830> them<00:03:49.950> in<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.100> relevant<00:03:50.340> areas<00:03:51.030> as

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
and put them in the relevant areas as

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.550 
and put them in the relevant areas as
you<00:03:51.269> can<00:03:51.420> see<00:03:51.540> I've<00:03:51.690> not<00:03:51.900> I've<00:03:52.049> really<00:03:52.440> done

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
you can see I've not I've really done

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.110 
you can see I've not I've really done
this<00:03:52.709> quite<00:03:52.860> roughly<00:03:53.340> just<00:03:53.549> for<00:03:53.790> this<00:03:53.880> down

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
this quite roughly just for this down

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.600 
this quite roughly just for this down
example<00:03:55.100> okay<00:03:56.100> we're<00:03:56.190> going<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.370> move<00:03:56.489> on<00:03:56.580> to

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
example okay we're going to move on to

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.160 
example okay we're going to move on to
the<00:03:56.790> fifth<00:03:56.970> track<00:03:57.180> as<00:03:57.450> you<00:03:57.480> if<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:57.720> notice<00:03:58.019> an

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
the fifth track as you if you notice an

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.130 
the fifth track as you if you notice an
example<00:03:58.680> actually<00:03:58.860> slid<00:03:59.549> up<00:03:59.670> from<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.880> bottom

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
example actually slid up from the bottom

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.120 
example actually slid up from the bottom
again<00:04:01.140> if<00:04:01.230> we<00:04:01.320> put<00:04:01.470> our<00:04:01.560> playhead<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.010> the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
again if we put our playhead to the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.039 
again if we put our playhead to the
beginning<00:04:02.280> of<00:04:02.670> that<00:04:02.880> track<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.630> we<00:04:03.750> double

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
beginning of that track and we double

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.830 
beginning of that track and we double
click<00:04:04.080> it<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.640> so<00:04:05.640> you<00:04:05.700> can<00:04:05.940> see<00:04:06.150> obviously<00:04:06.540> in

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
click it and so you can see obviously in

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.650 
click it and so you can see obviously in
your<00:04:07.260> canvas<00:04:08.100> as<00:04:08.820> you<00:04:08.940> can<00:04:09.060> see<00:04:09.209> there<00:04:09.450> it's

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
your canvas as you can see there it's

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.270 
your canvas as you can see there it's
obviously<00:04:09.989> full<00:04:10.290> screen<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.769> that's<00:04:10.920> pretty

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
obviously full screen and that's pretty

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.500 
obviously full screen and that's pretty
nice<00:04:11.519> we<00:04:12.269> don't<00:04:12.570> want<00:04:12.930> that<00:04:14.060> okay<00:04:15.060> what<00:04:15.420> I'm

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
nice we don't want that okay what I'm

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.969 
nice we don't want that okay what I'm
going<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.690> do<00:04:15.840> is<00:04:16.200> just<00:04:16.560> move<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:16.830> down

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
going to do is just move it down

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.120 
going to do is just move it down
slightly<00:04:17.690> until<00:04:18.690> obviously<00:04:19.260> make<00:04:19.799> sure<00:04:19.979> my

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
slightly until obviously make sure my

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.860 
slightly until obviously make sure my
head's<00:04:20.310> not<00:04:20.370> going<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.669> overlap<00:04:21.000> on<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.390> as<00:04:21.780> he

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
head's not going to overlap on it as he

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.210 
head's not going to overlap on it as he
comes<00:04:22.080> up<00:04:22.200> from<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.500> bottom

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
comes up from the bottom

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.540 
comes up from the bottom
and<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.270> same<00:04:25.450> principle<00:04:26.050> but<00:04:26.220> on<00:04:27.220> this<00:04:27.340> time

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
and the same principle but on this time

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.390 
and the same principle but on this time
we<00:04:27.700> can<00:04:27.850> use<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.240> crop<00:04:28.650> that<00:04:29.650> obviously<00:04:30.010> on

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
we can use the crop that obviously on

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.080 
we can use the crop that obviously on
the<00:04:30.550> top<00:04:30.730> only<00:04:31.860> so<00:04:32.860> we're<00:04:33.250> at<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.030> beginning

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
the top only so we're at the beginning

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.560 
the top only so we're at the beginning
of<00:04:34.480> the<00:04:34.630> track<00:04:35.280> we<00:04:36.280> want<00:04:36.550> to<00:04:36.730> crop<00:04:37.120> that<00:04:37.330> all

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
of the track we want to crop that all

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.720 
of the track we want to crop that all
the<00:04:37.690> way<00:04:37.780> down<00:04:38.020> so<00:04:38.500> it's<00:04:38.680> no<00:04:39.250> longer<00:04:39.280> visible

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
the way down so it's no longer visible

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.660 
the way down so it's no longer visible
on<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.150> screen<00:04:40.450> as<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.140> can<00:04:41.290> see<00:04:41.580> we're<00:04:42.580> going

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
on the screen as you can see we're going

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.940 
on the screen as you can see we're going
to<00:04:42.730> use<00:04:42.880> that<00:04:43.000> south<00:04:43.240> start<00:04:43.510> point<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:44.080> again

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
to use that south start point and again

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.570 
to use that south start point and again
we<00:04:45.250> move<00:04:45.430> it<00:04:45.550> along<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:47.080> a<00:04:47.110> point<00:04:47.460> where<00:04:48.460> you

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
we move it along to a point where you

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.290 
we move it along to a point where you
want<00:04:48.760> it<00:04:48.850> to<00:04:48.970> obviously<00:04:49.330> slide<00:04:49.570> up<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:52.000> in

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
want it to obviously slide up and in

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.540 
want it to obviously slide up and in
that<00:04:52.450> case<00:04:52.660> now<00:04:52.990> what<00:04:53.170> we<00:04:53.260> do<00:04:53.440> is<00:04:53.710> we<00:04:54.040> will<00:04:54.190> drag

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
that case now what we do is we will drag

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.010 
that case now what we do is we will drag
the<00:04:54.820> crop<00:04:55.390> top

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
the crop top

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.390 
the crop top
up<00:04:57.990> until<00:04:58.990> this<00:04:59.710> feel<00:04:59.920> happy

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
up until this feel happy

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.980 
up until this feel happy
and<00:05:01.090> as<00:05:01.210> you<00:05:01.360> can<00:05:01.450> see<00:05:01.510> where<00:05:01.720> that's<00:05:01.780> done<00:05:01.960> on

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
and as you can see where that's done on

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.480 
and as you can see where that's done on
your<00:05:02.200> timeline<00:05:02.410> because<00:05:02.890> that's<00:05:03.220> going<00:05:03.400> to

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
your timeline because that's going to

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.110 
your timeline because that's going to
animate<00:05:03.820> your<00:05:03.940> crop<00:05:04.240> to<00:05:04.810> show<00:05:04.990> you<00:05:05.080> an<00:05:05.140> example

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
animate your crop to show you an example

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.840 
animate your crop to show you an example
let's<00:05:07.120> just<00:05:07.330> move<00:05:07.480> it<00:05:11.070> I'm<00:05:12.070> pushing<00:05:12.490> my<00:05:12.550> way<00:05:12.700> up

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
let's just move it I'm pushing my way up

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.280 
let's just move it I'm pushing my way up
right<00:05:13.060> number<00:05:13.780> 5

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
right number 5

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.500 
right number 5
ok<00:05:15.250> that's<00:05:15.460> pretty<00:05:15.610> much<00:05:15.820> it<00:05:16.120> I<00:05:16.150> mean

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
ok that's pretty much it I mean

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.510 
ok that's pretty much it I mean
obviously<00:05:16.900> you<00:05:17.380> can<00:05:17.530> play<00:05:17.710> around<00:05:17.830> with<00:05:18.070> it<00:05:18.310> as

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
obviously you can play around with it as

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.790 
obviously you can play around with it as
you<00:05:18.760> see<00:05:19.150> necessary<00:05:19.780> or<00:05:20.050> do<00:05:20.410> different

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
you see necessary or do different
