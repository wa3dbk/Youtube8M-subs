okay<00:00:00.480> what<00:00:00.690> we're<00:00:00.810> doing<00:00:01.079> now<00:00:01.230> is<00:00:01.410> we're<00:00:01.560> going

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
okay what we're doing now is we're going

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.020 
okay what we're doing now is we're going
to<00:00:01.740> go<00:00:01.860> ahead<00:00:01.920> and<00:00:02.129> do<00:00:02.190> the<00:00:02.310> timing<00:00:02.790> on<00:00:02.879> this

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
to go ahead and do the timing on this

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.230 
to go ahead and do the timing on this
car<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:03.740> the<00:00:04.740> timing<00:00:05.640> bypass<00:00:06.120> is<00:00:06.680> a<00:00:08.240> single

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
car and the timing bypass is a single

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.140 
car and the timing bypass is a single
wire<00:00:09.420> connector<00:00:10.130> under<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.250> glove<00:00:11.460> box<00:00:11.700> in

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
wire connector under the glove box in

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.740 
wire connector under the glove box in
the<00:00:13.139> cabin<00:00:13.500> of<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.650> car<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.540> you<00:00:15.540> have<00:00:15.570> to

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
the cabin of the car and you have to

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.609 
the cabin of the car and you have to
disconnect<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:17.300> before<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.539> put<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
disconnect that before you put the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.790 
disconnect that before you put the
timing<00:00:19.980> light<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:21.199> balancer<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.650> make

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
timing light on the balancer to make

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.630 
timing light on the balancer to make
sure<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.369> degrees<00:00:24.150> are<00:00:24.449> proper<00:00:25.310> so<00:00:26.310> what

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
sure that the degrees are proper so what

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.040 
sure that the degrees are proper so what
we<00:00:26.730> have<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.970> do<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.300> let<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.510> warm<00:00:27.750> up<00:00:27.869> to

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
we have to do is let it warm up to

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.589 
we have to do is let it warm up to
operating<00:00:28.439> temperature<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.220> then<00:00:30.119> once<00:00:30.480> we

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
operating temperature and then once we

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.700 
operating temperature and then once we
get<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.840> warmed<00:00:31.080> up<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.320> operating

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
get it warmed up to operating

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.260 
get it warmed up to operating
temperature<00:00:31.769> then<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:32.489> disconnect<00:00:33.090> that

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
temperature then we disconnect that

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.049 
temperature then we disconnect that
bypass<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.170> then<00:00:35.100> once<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.460> disconnect<00:00:35.969> that

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
bypass and then once we disconnect that

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.729 
bypass and then once we disconnect that
then<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.510> put<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> timing<00:00:37.170> light<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
then we put the timing light on the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.979 
then we put the timing light on the
balancer<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:39.030> make<00:00:39.210> sure<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
balancer to make sure we have the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.400 
balancer to make sure we have the
correct<00:00:40.020> timing<00:00:40.649> degrees<00:00:45.050> feels<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.230> it's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
correct timing degrees feels like it's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.569 
correct timing degrees feels like it's
getting<00:00:46.559> close<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.920> operating<00:00:47.460> temperature

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
getting close to operating temperature

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.840 
getting close to operating temperature
cause<00:00:48.239> getting<00:00:48.629> kind<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.870> warm<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.379> here<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.430> go

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
cause getting kind of warm in here so go

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.639 
cause getting kind of warm in here so go
ahead<00:00:50.940> make<00:00:51.180> sure<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:52.170> make<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.440> set

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
ahead make sure I make it set

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.799 
ahead make sure I make it set
right<00:00:54.219> at<00:00:54.399> zero<00:00:54.730> like<00:00:55.059> it<00:00:55.210> says<00:00:55.480> on<00:00:55.660> the

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
right at zero like it says on the

00:00:55.809 --> 00:02:42.410 
right at zero like it says on the
sticker

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.630 

that's<00:02:43.420> how<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:43.690> time<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.050> 1995<00:02:45.040> Chevrolet

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
that's how you time a 1995 Chevrolet

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.050 
that's how you time a 1995 Chevrolet
Suburban<00:02:46.380> 1500<00:02:47.380> with<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:47.920> 5.7<00:02:48.550> liter
