 because these are dangerous and you tell me 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.299
 which is also another art like eating the 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.000
 age and precisely how they are so 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:41.569

 those flavors come from when you were in 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:49.910
 the press a brake not friend and now I'm going 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:54.349
 I often even leave or be 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:59.030
 came the 89 but to be here 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:02.090
 He did not change a kind of a gordita 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.709
 you hear me and if I did not get up anymore 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.930
 early where the problems that 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.530
 commenting on coming here did not change the 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.810
 class with the teacher can be taken down 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.170
 a little ball doctors masters a chubby 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.300
 of these hears that I was wondering 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.610
 what a delight you saw everything 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.739
 it's good that he has not for the egg 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.220
 be the onion and the salty 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.260
 all fresh 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.530
 everything cool because here also in the 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.310
 plaza you can get all that but 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.140
 It is a pedestrian kitchen that is very topical 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.100
 very very rich 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.530
 these false at the hands of eating that the 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.630
 Grenache is not true that you have to put 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.630
 what we are the very big record for 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.360
 eat and this is a great food 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:55.740
 normally of all is a big 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.320
 and of course a technology of a corn bean 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.120
 and a spicy that moves a selection 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.130
 whole jump with those three things 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.930
 when you what you guess about those Aztecs 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.850
 new the world 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.160

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.780
 to throw us is chubby to get them 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.700
 nothing more to whet appetite we are not going to 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.580
 cooking it seems good to me that this is not 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.700
