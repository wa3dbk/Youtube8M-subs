00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.950 

okay<00:00:15.950> we<00:00:16.130> took<00:00:16.309> the<00:00:16.520> information<00:00:16.910> off<00:00:17.600> of<00:00:17.840> the

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
okay we took the information off of the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.160 
okay we took the information off of the
customers<00:00:18.220> existing<00:00:19.220> ball<00:00:19.640> I<00:00:20.050> transferred<00:00:21.050> it

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
customers existing ball I transferred it

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.900 
customers existing ball I transferred it
over<00:00:21.260> to<00:00:21.560> the<00:00:21.680> dry<00:00:21.920> erase<00:00:21.980> board<00:00:22.550> so<00:00:22.790> it's

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
over to the dry erase board so it's

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.880 
over to the dry erase board so it's
easier<00:00:23.210> for<00:00:23.420> you<00:00:23.480> to<00:00:23.510> see<00:00:23.779> at<00:00:23.869> home<00:00:23.900> and<00:00:24.349> we

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
easier for you to see at home and we

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.429 
easier for you to see at home and we
went<00:00:25.040> with<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:25.550> cuts<00:00:25.820> fans<00:00:26.240> so<00:00:26.810> what<00:00:27.020> we<00:00:27.170> had

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
went with the cuts fans so what we had

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.409 
went with the cuts fans so what we had
what<00:00:27.650> that<00:00:27.800> means<00:00:28.010> is<00:00:28.250> it's<00:00:28.970> going<00:00:29.210> to<00:00:29.270> be

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
what that means is it's going to be

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:30.790 
what that means is it's going to be
where<00:00:29.660> the<00:00:29.779> drilled<00:00:30.079> edge<00:00:30.259> of<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:30.560> thumb

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
where the drilled edge of the thumb

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.729 
where the drilled edge of the thumb
meets<00:00:31.579> the<00:00:31.790> drilled<00:00:32.060> edge<00:00:32.210> of<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:32.480> fingers<00:00:32.960> so

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
meets the drilled edge of the fingers so

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.979 
meets the drilled edge of the fingers so
obviously<00:00:34.190> when<00:00:35.000> we<00:00:35.120> put<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:35.420> finger<00:00:35.720> trips

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
obviously when we put the finger trips

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.380 
obviously when we put the finger trips
inside<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.649> holes<00:00:36.829> the<00:00:37.489> overall<00:00:37.910> span<00:00:38.239> is

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
inside the holes the overall span is

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.270 
inside the holes the overall span is
going<00:00:38.600> to<00:00:38.660> be<00:00:38.750> longer<00:00:39.020> this<00:00:39.829> hopefully<00:00:40.250> is

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
going to be longer this hopefully is

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.430 
going to be longer this hopefully is
easier<00:00:40.670> for<00:00:40.880> you<00:00:40.940> to<00:00:40.970> understand<00:00:41.480> so<00:00:41.750> we<00:00:42.320> have

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
easier for you to understand so we have

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.350 
easier for you to understand so we have
a<00:00:42.500> cut<00:00:42.890> span<00:00:43.190> of<00:00:43.370> four<00:00:43.579> and<00:00:43.700> three<00:00:43.880> eighths<00:00:44.059> on

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
we're going to use nice broad lines so

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.260 
we're going to use nice broad lines so
it<00:01:47.990> shows<00:01:48.200> up<00:01:48.409> better<00:01:48.439> on<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:48.920> video<00:01:49.270> we've

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
it shows up better on the video we've

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.359 
it shows up better on the video we've
decided<00:01:50.780> we<00:01:51.109> are<00:01:51.139> going<00:01:51.259> to<00:01:51.649> drill<00:01:51.920> this<00:01:52.069> ball

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
because then you may risk rolling over

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.629 
because then you may risk rolling over
the<00:02:04.969> the<00:02:05.389> plug<00:02:05.689> you<00:02:06.529> can<00:02:06.560> do<00:02:06.950> it<00:02:07.100> but<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:07.340> want

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:07.639 
the the plug you can do it but you want

the the plug you can do it but you want
to<00:02:07.729> avoid<00:02:07.789> it<00:02:08.209> if<00:02:08.330> at<00:02:08.450> all<00:02:08.569> possible<00:02:09.039> so<00:02:10.039> we

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
to avoid it if at all possible so we

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.640 
to avoid it if at all possible so we
decided<00:02:10.550> we're<00:02:10.819> going<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:10.970> go<00:02:11.060> in<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:12.230> same

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
and I'm going to measure backwards off

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.449 
and I'm going to measure backwards off
the<00:02:50.980> from<00:02:51.879> the<00:02:52.000> center<00:02:52.329> of<00:02:52.389> the<00:02:52.450> span<00:02:53.459> to

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
the from the center of the span to

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.280 
the from the center of the span to
locate<00:02:54.999> where<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.329> thumb<00:02:55.659> hole<00:02:55.840> is<00:02:56.019> going<00:02:56.230> to

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
locate where the thumb hole is going to

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.659 
locate where the thumb hole is going to
be<00:02:56.349> because<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:56.769> want<00:02:56.919> this<00:02:56.980> ball<00:02:57.189> I'm<00:02:57.459> going<00:02:57.609> to

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:57.669 
be because I want this ball I'm going to

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:01.429 
be because I want this ball I'm going to
drill<00:02:57.849> the<00:02:57.969> thumb<00:02:58.180> hole<00:02:58.359> first<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.969> to<00:03:00.969> do<00:03:01.180> the

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
drill the thumb hole first so to do the

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.649 
drill the thumb hole first so to do the
spin<00:03:02.439> of<00:03:02.769> four<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.519> five<00:03:03.760> eighths<00:03:04.060> which<00:03:04.449> was

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
spin of four and five eighths which was

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.770 
spin of four and five eighths which was
is<00:03:04.840> overall<00:03:05.319> span<00:03:06.269> all<00:03:07.269> right<00:03:07.419> I'm<00:03:07.569> going<00:03:07.719> to

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
is overall span all right I'm going to

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.649 
is overall span all right I'm going to
take<00:03:08.409> that<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.889> divide<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.459> by<00:03:09.519> two<00:03:09.760> so

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
take that and divide that by two so

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.280 
take that and divide that by two so
that's<00:03:10.750> going<00:03:11.049> to<00:03:11.139> give<00:03:11.349> me<00:03:11.379> 2<00:03:11.889> and<00:03:12.930> 5/16<00:03:13.930> so

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
that's going to give me 2 and 5/16 so

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.439 
that's going to give me 2 and 5/16 so
four<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.620> five<00:03:14.919> eighths<00:03:15.189> divided<00:03:15.790> by<00:03:15.909> two<00:03:15.969> is

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:16.449 
four and five eighths divided by two is

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:20.059 
four and five eighths divided by two is
going<00:03:17.199> to<00:03:17.319> be<00:03:17.409> two<00:03:17.769> and<00:03:17.799> five<00:03:18.370> sixteenths<00:03:19.239> and

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
going to be two and five sixteenths and

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.770 
going to be two and five sixteenths and
I'm<00:03:21.069> going<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.459> bump<00:03:21.639> it<00:03:21.819> up<00:03:21.939> just<00:03:22.389> a<00:03:22.750> little

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
I'm going to bump it up just a little

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.189 
I'm going to bump it up just a little
bit<00:03:23.159> for<00:03:24.159> the<00:03:24.280> edge<00:03:24.430> of<00:03:24.669> the<00:03:24.790> slug<00:03:25.199> okay
