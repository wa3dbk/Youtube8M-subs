00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.210 

this<00:00:00.240> week's<00:00:00.480> task<00:00:00.810> is<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.560> explain<00:00:02.159> the

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
this week's task is to explain the

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.349 
this week's task is to explain the
workings<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:03.080> my<00:00:04.080> synthesizer<00:00:05.029> they<00:00:06.029> start

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
workings of my synthesizer they start

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.600 
workings of my synthesizer they start
off<00:00:06.450> with<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:07.049> simple<00:00:07.440> wave<00:00:07.740> form<00:00:08.040> created<00:00:08.460> by

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
off with a simple wave form created by

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.390 
off with a simple wave form created by
the<00:00:09.330> voltage<00:00:09.660> controlled<00:00:10.080> oscillator<00:00:10.590> which

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
the voltage controlled oscillator which

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.600 
the voltage controlled oscillator which
can<00:00:11.580> play<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.759> waveform<00:00:12.480> at<00:00:12.719> different<00:00:13.110> pitches

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
can play a waveform at different pitches

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.960 
can play a waveform at different pitches
very<00:00:14.610> key<00:00:15.150> at<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.389> keyboard<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.760> then<00:00:17.760> they

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
very key at the keyboard and then they

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.320 
very key at the keyboard and then they
apply<00:00:18.470> filters<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.070> they<00:00:20.520> modulate

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
apply filters to it and they modulate

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.019 
apply filters to it and they modulate
the<00:00:21.660> amplitude<00:00:22.140> as<00:00:22.350> well<00:00:22.550> I'm<00:00:23.550> starting<00:00:23.880> out

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
the amplitude as well I'm starting out

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.660 
the amplitude as well I'm starting out
with<00:00:24.090> nice<00:00:24.359> simple<00:00:24.750> sound<00:00:25.220> it's<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.310> simple

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
with nice simple sound it's a simple

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.140 
with nice simple sound it's a simple
waveform<00:00:27.320> but<00:00:28.320> what's<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.619> D<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:28.920> DC<00:00:29.730> oh<00:00:29.760> I

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
waveform but what's this D this DC oh I

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.720 
waveform but what's this D this DC oh I
thought<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.689> might<00:00:30.869> be<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.019> VCO<00:00:31.439> yeah<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.610> you

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
thought it might be a VCO yeah that you

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.330 
thought it might be a VCO yeah that you
know<00:00:32.880> one<00:00:33.090> was<00:00:33.630> one<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.079> first<00:00:34.340> analog

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
know one was one of the first analog

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.040 
know one was one of the first analog
synths<00:00:35.730> which<00:00:36.210> actually<00:00:36.540> used<00:00:36.750> digital

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
synths which actually used digital

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.810 
synths which actually used digital
oscillators<00:00:37.950> instead<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.399> voltage

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
oscillators instead of voltage

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.850 
oscillators instead of voltage
controlled<00:00:39.239> oscillators<00:00:39.809> if<00:00:40.230> your<00:00:40.440> voltage

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
controlled oscillators if your voltage

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.700 
controlled oscillators if your voltage
in<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.460> mains<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:42.059> unstable<00:00:42.510> then<00:00:43.350> your<00:00:43.469> pitch

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
in the mains is unstable then your pitch

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.279 
in the mains is unstable then your pitch
is<00:00:43.950> going<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.309> drifting<00:00:44.879> out<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:46.170> these

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
is going to be drifting out so these

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.260 
is going to be drifting out so these
digital<00:00:46.680> oscillators<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.700> get

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
digital oscillators you can just get

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.279 
digital oscillators you can just get
that<00:00:48.420> exactly<00:00:48.809> right

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
that exactly right

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.720 
that exactly right
and<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.829> can<00:00:49.950> be<00:00:50.039> sure<00:00:50.190> that's<00:00:50.430> not<00:00:50.520> going<00:00:50.670> to

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
and you can be sure that's not going to

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.170 
and you can be sure that's not going to
drift<00:00:50.940> out<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:52.350> juno<00:00:52.649> one<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.579> create<00:00:53.820> pulse

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
drift out the juno one can create pulse

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.689 
drift out the juno one can create pulse
waves<00:00:54.480> sawtooth<00:00:55.410> waves<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.520> calls

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699

sound energy on a single frequency but

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.440 
sound energy on a single frequency but
you<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:13.799> do<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.070> backwards<00:01:14.390> playing<00:01:15.390> this

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
you can do this backwards playing this

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.220 
you can do this backwards playing this
is<00:01:15.600> brilliant<00:01:15.900> control

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
is brilliant control

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.560 
is brilliant control
and<00:01:17.430> sweep<00:01:18.430> this<00:01:18.610> filter<00:01:19.030> I'll<00:01:19.300> talk<00:01:19.540> about

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
and sweep this filter I'll talk about

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.570 
and sweep this filter I'll talk about
fills<00:01:19.930> it<00:01:20.050> in<00:01:20.110> a<00:01:20.230> bit<00:01:20.410> dang

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
fills it in a bit dang

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.560 
fills it in a bit dang
so<00:01:22.180> I<00:01:22.210> lose<00:01:22.800> some<00:01:23.800> of<00:01:23.920> these<00:01:24.570> upper

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
so I lose some of these upper

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.590 
so I lose some of these upper
frequencies<00:01:26.140> you<00:01:26.290> can<00:01:26.440> see<00:01:26.590> here<00:01:27.090> then<00:01:28.090> the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
frequencies you can see here then the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.630 
frequencies you can see here then the
wave<00:01:28.810> will<00:01:29.380> turn<00:01:29.620> in<00:01:29.830> something<00:01:30.160> more<00:01:30.340> sine

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
wave will turn in something more sine

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.660 
wave will turn in something more sine
wave<00:01:30.850> flavours<00:01:31.810> what<00:01:32.800> I'm<00:01:32.920> sweeping<00:01:33.160> here<00:01:33.460> is

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
wave flavours what I'm sweeping here is

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.180 
wave flavours what I'm sweeping here is
called<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.210> low-pass<00:01:34.660> filter<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:36.040> only

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
called a low-pass filter it's only

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.730 
called a low-pass filter it's only
letting<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.580> low<00:01:36.700> frequencies<00:01:37.300> through

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
letting the low frequencies through

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.520 
letting the low frequencies through
anything<00:01:38.740> above<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.670> frequency<00:01:40.120> offset<00:01:40.530> is

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
anything above the frequency offset is

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.790 
anything above the frequency offset is
discarded<00:01:42.930> do<00:01:43.930> you<00:01:44.020> know<00:01:44.140> one<00:01:44.290> can<00:01:44.440> mix<00:01:44.680> up

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
discarded do you know one can mix up

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.860 
discarded do you know one can mix up
these<00:01:44.980> waves<00:01:45.220> so<00:01:45.970> you<00:01:46.060> can<00:01:46.180> generate<00:01:46.540> several

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
these waves so you can generate several

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.580 
these waves so you can generate several
waveforms<00:01:47.640> at<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.760> same<00:01:48.940> time<00:01:49.410> to<00:01:50.410> create

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
waveforms at the same time to create

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.810 
waveforms at the same time to create
some<00:01:50.890> quite<00:01:51.040> interesting<00:01:51.070> mixtures<00:01:51.790> of

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
some quite interesting mixtures of

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.380 
some quite interesting mixtures of
squares<00:01:52.660> and<00:01:52.840> saws<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.860> such<00:01:54.070> like<00:01:54.300> what<00:01:55.300> it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
squares and saws and such like what it

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.590 
squares and saws and such like what it
also<00:01:55.540> has<00:01:55.870> is<00:01:56.140> pulse<00:01:56.530> width<00:01:56.950> modulation<00:01:57.600> what

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
also has is pulse width modulation what

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.680 
also has is pulse width modulation what
I'm<00:01:58.720> playing<00:01:58.900> now<00:01:59.170> is<00:01:59.440> a<00:01:59.770> pulse<00:02:00.400> wave<00:02:00.760> so

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
I'm playing now is a pulse wave so

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.779 
I'm playing now is a pulse wave so
called<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.910> as<00:02:03.910> a<00:02:03.940> change<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.420> rates

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.569 

you<00:02:09.390> might<00:02:09.629> go<00:02:09.780> see<00:02:10.019> there<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.379> screen
