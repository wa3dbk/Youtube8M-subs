stops<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.850> go<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.690> seed<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.350> starts<00:00:49.710> bolting<00:00:50.280> up

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
stops it go to seed it starts bolting up

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.029 
stops it go to seed it starts bolting up
vertically<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.210> throws<00:00:52.020> these<00:00:52.320> little<00:00:52.710> balls

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
vertically and throws these little balls

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.950 
vertically and throws these little balls
at<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> top<00:00:53.610> which<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:54.090> see<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.719> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
at the top which you can see here and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.470 
at the top which you can see here and
eventually<00:00:55.949> these<00:00:56.430> little<00:00:56.760> balls<00:00:57.000> will

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
eventually these little balls will

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.340 
eventually these little balls will
become<00:00:58.309> into<00:00:59.309> seed<00:00:59.640> now<00:01:00.050> lettuce<00:01:01.050> most

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
become into seed now lettuce most

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.910 
become into seed now lettuce most
lettuces<00:01:01.800> distribute<00:01:02.430> their<00:01:02.640> seed<00:01:03.680> via<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
lettuces distribute their seed via the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.300 
lettuces distribute their seed via the
wind<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.460> not<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.760> much<00:01:05.909> by<00:01:06.180> bird<00:01:06.510> or<00:01:06.720> insects

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
wind and not so much by bird or insects

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.770 
wind and not so much by bird or insects
so<00:01:08.310> there's<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.610> certain<00:01:08.820> way<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.479> need

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
so there's a certain way that you need

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.620 
so there's a certain way that you need
to<00:01:09.960> collect<00:01:10.229> them<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:11.310> get<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.850> best<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.510> let's

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
to collect them to get the best so let's

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.910 
to collect them to get the best so let's
go<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> look<00:01:13.320> at<00:01:13.439> some<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.799> have

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
go and have a look at some that have

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.070 
go and have a look at some that have
already<00:01:14.100> bolted<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.790> see<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.659> how<00:01:15.869> we're

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
already bolted to see and how we're

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.300 
already bolted to see and how we're
going<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.320> get<00:01:16.470> them<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.890> look<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.189> this

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
going to get them if you look at this

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.789 
going to get them if you look at this
lettuce<00:01:17.580> here<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.509> actually<00:01:18.689> falling<00:01:19.439> over

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
lettuce here it's actually falling over

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.130 
lettuce here it's actually falling over
and<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.610> getting<00:01:20.850> top-heavy<00:01:21.299> from<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> seed

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and it's getting top-heavy from the seed

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.649 
and it's getting top-heavy from the seed
and<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:23.009> see<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.700> got<00:01:23.939> these

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
and you can see that it's got these

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.730 
and you can see that it's got these
little<00:01:24.720> fluffy<00:01:27.140> things<00:01:28.140> here<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.470> these<00:01:28.530> get

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
little fluffy things here and these get

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.490 
little fluffy things here and these get
caught<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.250> wind<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.930> what<00:01:30.930> they<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.140> is

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
caught in the wind and what they do is

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.550 
caught in the wind and what they do is
in<00:01:31.680> its<00:01:31.829> spread<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.340> seed<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.759> way<00:01:32.909> now<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.119> get

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
in its spread to seed that way now I get

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.469 
in its spread to seed that way now I get
let<00:01:34.560> us<00:01:34.710> pop<00:01:35.040> up<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.400> other<00:01:35.490> pots<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.210> things

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
let us pop up in other pots and things

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.569 
let us pop up in other pots and things
on<00:01:36.990> its<00:01:37.350> own<00:01:37.530> because<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:37.950> self<00:01:38.280> size

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
on its own because it's self size

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.840 
on its own because it's self size
because<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.479> system<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.829> what<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.220> do<00:01:41.369> next

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
because of this system so what I do next

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.550 
because of this system so what I do next
is<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.540> actually<00:01:42.770> grab<00:01:43.770> some<00:01:44.040> Al<00:01:44.189> foil<00:01:44.549> and

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
is I actually grab some Al foil and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.700 
is I actually grab some Al foil and
place<00:01:46.560> them<00:01:46.799> into<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.649> really

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
place them into that so it's really

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.490 
place them into that so it's really
simple<00:01:50.250> how<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.729> collect<00:01:51.180> your<00:01:51.329> see<00:01:51.630> what<00:01:52.380> you

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
simple how you collect your see what you

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.219 
simple how you collect your see what you
do<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.040> cut<00:01:53.520> off<00:01:53.549> these<00:01:53.939> little<00:01:54.229> do

with just snip them off with the
scissors

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
scissors

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.120

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.500 
hundreds and then just save them in some
alfoil<00:02:10.959> like<00:02:11.260> that<00:02:11.530> because<00:02:11.950> what<00:02:12.520> you<00:02:12.670> do<00:02:12.940> is

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
alfoil like that because what you do is

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.780 
alfoil like that because what you do is
eventually<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.500> just<00:02:14.530> think<00:02:15.370> they<00:02:15.520> dry<00:02:15.760> out

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
eventually you just think they dry out

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.780 
eventually you just think they dry out
inside<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.510> Alpha<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:17.380> then<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.740> just<00:02:18.010> give

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
inside the Alpha and then you just give

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.070 
inside the Alpha and then you just give
them<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.970> little<00:02:19.090> squeeze<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:22.080> the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
them a little squeeze like that and the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.449 
them a little squeeze like that and the
seeds<00:02:23.380> just<00:02:23.620> fall<00:02:23.980> out<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.950> know<00:02:27.220> like

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
seeds just fall out and you know like

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.850 
seeds just fall out and you know like
you're<00:02:27.580> in<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.790> bit<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.150> rush<00:02:28.390> just<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.440> just

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
you're in a bit of a rush just that just

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.650 
you're in a bit of a rush just that just
throw<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.250> head<00:02:30.430> straight<00:02:30.820> in<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.540> can

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
throw the head straight in so you can

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.880 
throw the head straight in so you can
sometimes<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.290> can<00:02:32.380> just<00:02:32.500> pick<00:02:32.680> them<00:02:32.770> off

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
sometimes you can just pick them off

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.290 
sometimes you can just pick them off
with<00:02:33.070> your<00:02:33.100> fingers<00:02:33.489> that's<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.790> bit<00:02:33.910> cheating

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
with your fingers that's a bit cheating

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.840 
with your fingers that's a bit cheating
so<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.290> just<00:02:35.590> like<00:02:35.770> to<00:02:35.890> cut<00:02:36.100> them<00:02:36.250> off<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:36.670> can

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
so I just like to cut them off you can

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.100 
so I just like to cut them off you can
pick<00:02:37.000> them<00:02:37.120> off<00:02:37.239> with<00:02:37.390> your<00:02:37.420> fingers<00:02:37.900> just

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
pick them off with your fingers just

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.010 
pick them off with your fingers just
throw<00:02:38.890> them<00:02:39.100> in<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.310> alfoil

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
throw them in the alfoil

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.110 
throw them in the alfoil
let<00:02:41.020> them<00:02:41.170> dry<00:02:41.470> out<00:02:41.500> for<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.070> few<00:02:42.489> days<00:02:42.640> in<00:02:42.940> there

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
let them dry out for a few days in there

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.640 
let them dry out for a few days in there
there's<00:02:43.360> come<00:02:43.510> along<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.720> little<00:02:44.110> squeeze<00:02:44.410> and

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
there's come along a little squeeze and

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.320 
there's come along a little squeeze and
put<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.370> in<00:02:45.459> there<00:02:45.610> like<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:45.910> then<00:02:46.000> just<00:02:46.150> pick

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
put it in there like and then just pick

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.780 
put it in there like and then just pick
out<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.600> green<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.260> brown<00:02:47.440> bits<00:02:50.790> so

night and if you've got an ongoing lot
of<00:03:02.290> lettuce<00:03:02.530> growing<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.430> one<00:03:04.239> in<00:03:04.420> first<00:03:04.660> stage

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
of lettuce growing so one in first stage

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.900 
of lettuce growing so one in first stage
second<00:03:05.500> stage<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.980> last<00:03:06.160> stage<00:03:06.370> of<00:03:06.430> your<00:03:06.730> life

second stage and last stage of your life

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.240 
second stage and last stage of your life
stages<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:07.630> see<00:03:07.959> once<00:03:08.799> you've<00:03:08.890> got<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.010> lot<00:03:09.160> of

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
stages you see once you've got a lot of

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.949 
stages you see once you've got a lot of
seed<00:03:09.489> you<00:03:09.580> have<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.880> worry<00:03:10.090> so<00:03:10.330> much<00:03:10.360> about<00:03:10.600> the

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
seed you have to worry so much about the

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.300 
seed you have to worry so much about the
last<00:03:11.170> stage<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:11.680> can<00:03:11.799> pull<00:03:12.010> them<00:03:12.160> out

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
last stage and you can pull them out

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.550 
last stage and you can pull them out
once<00:03:12.580> they<00:03:12.730> start<00:03:13.000> bolting<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:13.750> have<00:03:14.350> some

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
once they start bolting and have some

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.960 
once they start bolting and have some
more<00:03:14.769> running<00:03:14.980> through<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:15.459> you've<00:03:15.640> only<00:03:15.700> got

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
more running through so you've only got

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.660 
more running through so you've only got
the<00:03:16.000> two<00:03:16.299> stage<00:03:16.630> ones<00:03:16.959> but<00:03:17.590> I<00:03:17.620> recommend<00:03:18.459> that

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
the two stage ones but I recommend that

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.789 
the two stage ones but I recommend that
you<00:03:18.880> collect<00:03:19.360> seed<00:03:19.660> at<00:03:19.870> least<00:03:20.049> once<00:03:20.350> a<00:03:20.500> year<00:03:20.530> to

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
you collect seed at least once a year to

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.280 
you collect seed at least once a year to
keep<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.190> nice<00:03:21.370> fresh<00:03:21.670> varieties<00:03:22.299> going<00:03:22.780> and

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
keep a nice fresh varieties going and

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.759 
keep a nice fresh varieties going and
once<00:03:23.500> you've<00:03:23.650> got<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.310> you<00:03:25.170> can<00:03:26.170> see<00:03:26.440> here

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
once you've got it and you can see here

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.580 
once you've got it and you can see here
like<00:03:27.630> see<00:03:28.630> that<00:03:28.780> on<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.049> camera

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
like see that on the camera

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.890 
like see that on the camera
the<00:03:30.040> fluffy<00:03:30.310> seed<00:03:30.730> all<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.090> need<00:03:31.239> to<00:03:31.360> do<00:03:31.540> is

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
the fluffy seed all you need to do is

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.009 
the fluffy seed all you need to do is
have<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.320> separate<00:03:33.130> piece<00:03:33.400> of<00:03:33.730> our<00:03:34.239> foil<00:03:34.690> there

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
have a separate piece of our foil there

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.160 
have a separate piece of our foil there
and<00:03:35.579> for<00:03:36.579> each<00:03:36.730> one<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.239> know<00:03:37.420> how<00:03:37.840> many<00:03:38.019> other

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
and for each one you know how many other

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.930 
and for each one you know how many other
seeds<00:03:38.470> you<00:03:38.590> want<00:03:38.620> to<00:03:38.829> get<00:03:38.980> just<00:03:39.190> give<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:39.850> a

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
seeds you want to get just give it a

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.300 
seeds you want to get just give it a
twist<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.570> you'll<00:03:40.900> find<00:03:41.230> that<00:03:41.380> five<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:42.040> ten

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
twist and you'll find that five to ten

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.090 
twist and you'll find that five to ten
seeds<00:03:42.700> will<00:03:42.940> fall<00:03:43.209> out<00:03:43.239> of<00:03:43.570> each<00:03:43.750> head<00:03:44.230> which

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
seeds will fall out of each head which

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.300 
seeds will fall out of each head which
is<00:03:45.280> really<00:03:45.640> great<00:03:45.940> because<00:03:46.000> I<00:03:46.510> pick<00:03:46.720> probably

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
is really great because I pick probably

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.710 
is really great because I pick probably
twenty<00:03:48.310> thirty<00:03:48.579> heads<00:03:48.910> before<00:03:49.299> they'll<00:03:49.540> give

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
twenty thirty heads before they'll give

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.750 
twenty thirty heads before they'll give
me<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:50.440> know<00:03:50.500> I<00:03:50.560> said<00:03:50.799> thousands<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.489> seeing

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
me you know I said thousands of seeing

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.520 
me you know I said thousands of seeing
something<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.239> video<00:03:52.870> I'm<00:03:53.049> probably<00:03:53.290> over

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
something the video I'm probably over

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.080 
something the video I'm probably over
