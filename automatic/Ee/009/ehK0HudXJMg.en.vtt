 Well see I started competing the year 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.490
 past last season 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.850

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:50.820

 Spain and for the moment resting for the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.650
 next season he has already been a 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.960
 example of how to train as I say 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.229
 with a head and showing that women 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.540
 They can be very feminine and have muscle 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.630
 What do you think about being a girl like you? 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.090
 Well the truth that I think is very 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.090
 important femininity and that you have to 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.820
 keep it although we like the muscle 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.490
 we have to rely on the lines of the 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.810
 Women and being female is evident 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.399
 well let's explain this to the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.990
 colleagues and viewers in a 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.939
 competition time for example 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.729
 missing 15 days for the competition 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:48.820
 how much aerobic exercise do you do 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.070
 one hour one hour a day one hour a day 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.830
 and at what time of day you usually do in 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.840
 fasting and after training fasting 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.680
 total total you do not take anything at all nothing 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.960

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.930

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.760
 and proteins 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.379
 and then when training with weights 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.090
 that you usually train all the groups 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.400
 muscle once a week twice 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.590

 It seems that it is unsightly and that as a 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.099
 little to say that you are taking care of yourself 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.349
 during a season to be well in 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.599
 competition because you do not leave you are not going to 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.670
