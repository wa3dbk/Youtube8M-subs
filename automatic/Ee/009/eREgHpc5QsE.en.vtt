or<00:02:04.920> edge<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.789> can<00:02:05.970> tell<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:07.259> should

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
or edge that you can tell and it should

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.309 
or edge that you can tell and it should
smoothly<00:02:08.130> merge<00:02:08.729> together<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.989> that

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
smoothly merge together just like that

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.150 
smoothly merge together just like that
from<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.099> lightest<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.180> darkest<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:13.160> I'm

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
from the lightest to the darkest and I'm

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.960 
from the lightest to the darkest and I'm
depending<00:02:14.730> on<00:02:14.880> how<00:02:15.239> light<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.989> dark<00:02:16.290> how<00:02:16.590> much

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
depending on how light to dark how much

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.720 
depending on how light to dark how much
you<00:02:17.970> want<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.900> have<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.890> can<00:02:20.069> add<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.430> more

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
you want it to have you can add on more

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
you want it to have you can add on more
layers<00:02:21.030> until<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:23.519> ending<00:02:23.940> bit<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.269> too<00:02:24.480> thin

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
layers until the ending bit is too thin

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.670 
layers until the ending bit is too thin
to<00:02:25.019> add<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.459> anymore<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.780> usually<00:02:27.989> add<00:02:28.410> on

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
to add on anymore and I usually add on

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.780 
to add on anymore and I usually add on
for<00:02:29.690> four<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.780> five<00:02:30.810> layers<00:02:31.350> so<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.190> build<00:02:32.519> it<00:02:32.670> up

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
for four to five layers so I build it up

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.110 
for four to five layers so I build it up
slowly<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.920> now<00:02:34.920> as<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.220> can<00:02:35.400> see<00:02:35.670> there's<00:02:36.030> a

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
slowly and now as you can see there's a

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.120 
slowly and now as you can see there's a
very<00:02:36.360> dark<00:02:36.720> edge<00:02:36.989> right<00:02:37.410> there<00:02:37.470> on<00:02:37.799> the<00:02:37.830> tip<00:02:38.100> of

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
very dark edge right there on the tip of

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.789 
very dark edge right there on the tip of
nail<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:39.510> very<00:02:39.720> light<00:02:39.989> one<00:02:40.200> but<00:02:40.470> it's<00:02:40.590> the

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
nail and a very light one but it's the

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.699 
nail and a very light one but it's the
same<00:02:41.130> color<00:02:41.640> same<00:02:42.420> nail<00:02:42.810> polish<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.530> all<00:02:43.650> I

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
same color same nail polish and all I

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.589 
same color same nail polish and all I
have<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.890> do<00:02:44.100> is<00:02:44.250> just<00:02:44.280> keep<00:02:44.670> keep<00:02:45.120> building<00:02:45.360> it

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
have to do is just keep keep building it

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.539 
have to do is just keep keep building it
up<00:02:45.690> but<00:02:46.230> remember<00:02:46.680> not<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:47.040> buy<00:02:47.160> one<00:02:47.400> with<00:02:47.519> a

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
up but remember not to buy one with a

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.400 
up but remember not to buy one with a
base<00:02:47.790> color<00:02:48.000> or<00:02:48.239> else<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.569> can<00:02:48.720> tell<00:02:48.750> the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
base color or else you can tell the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.009 
base color or else you can tell the
rigid<00:02:49.709> edges<00:02:50.150> where<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.330> have<00:02:51.450> build<00:02:51.750> up<00:02:51.870> the

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
rigid edges where you have build up the

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.160 
rigid edges where you have build up the
new<00:02:52.170> color<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.239> is<00:02:54.359> the<00:02:54.480> finishing<00:02:54.840> nail

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
new color so this is the finishing nail

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.650 
new color so this is the finishing nail
that<00:02:55.500> we<00:02:55.680> have<00:02:55.920> just<00:02:56.220> done<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.790> easily<00:02:57.570> you

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
that we have just done and easily you

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.410 
that we have just done and easily you
can<00:02:57.780> create<00:02:58.079> a<00:02:58.170> merging<00:02:58.739> color<00:02:59.040> onto<00:02:59.760> your<00:03:00.150> set

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
can create a merging color onto your set

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.599 
can create a merging color onto your set
of<00:03:00.540> nails<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:01.410> can't<00:03:01.709> use<00:03:01.950> this<00:03:02.130> as<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.400> base

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
of nails you can't use this as a base

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.240 
of nails you can't use this as a base
and<00:03:02.820> add<00:03:03.269> on<00:03:03.540> other<00:03:03.810> gemstones<00:03:04.470> or<00:03:04.709> patterns

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
and add on other gemstones or patterns

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.800 
and add on other gemstones or patterns
or<00:03:05.459> things<00:03:05.700> like<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.880> or<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.540> can<00:03:06.660> just

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
or things like that or you can just

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.840 
or things like that or you can just
leave<00:03:07.049> it<00:03:07.200> as<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.380> way<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.769> is<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.190> for

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
leave it as the way it is and for

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.840 
leave it as the way it is and for
regular<00:03:09.269> day<00:03:09.480> nails<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.200> another<00:03:11.100> example<00:03:11.489> is

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
regular day nails and another example is

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.910 
regular day nails and another example is
this<00:03:12.269> one<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:12.630> I've<00:03:12.750> made<00:03:12.959> early<00:03:13.350> on<00:03:13.380> and

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
this one that I've made early on and

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.099 
this one that I've made early on and
it's<00:03:14.430> exactly<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:15.090> same<00:03:15.269> technique<00:03:15.750> as<00:03:15.870> the

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
it's exactly the same technique as the

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.289 
it's exactly the same technique as the
one<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.440> we<00:03:16.500> have<00:03:16.769> just<00:03:16.980> made<00:03:17.250> like<00:03:17.489> this<00:03:17.760> but

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
one that we have just made like this but

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.420 
one that we have just made like this but
what<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.569> have<00:03:18.750> done<00:03:18.959> is<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.319> have<00:03:19.590> applied<00:03:20.069> the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
what I have done is I have applied the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.270 
what I have done is I have applied the
white<00:03:20.609> sparkly<00:03:21.209> nail<00:03:21.480> polish<00:03:21.900> on<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.950> bottom

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
white sparkly nail polish on the bottom

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.720 
white sparkly nail polish on the bottom
and<00:03:23.459> then<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.780> two<00:03:25.109> layers<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.680> then<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.400> have

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
and then of two layers and then I have

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.300 
and then of two layers and then I have
added<00:03:26.940> on<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.390> pink<00:03:27.660> one<00:03:27.959> of<00:03:28.140> two<00:03:28.709> layers<00:03:28.980> so

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
added on the pink one of two layers so

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.039 
added on the pink one of two layers so
it's<00:03:29.489> one<00:03:29.730> layer<00:03:29.940> on<00:03:30.150> top<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.630> white<00:03:30.840> and

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
it's one layer on top of the white and

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.080 
it's one layer on top of the white and
then<00:03:31.470> another<00:03:31.799> layer<00:03:32.100> right<00:03:32.579> in<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.850> middle

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
then another layer right in the middle

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.979 
then another layer right in the middle
section<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:33.810> then<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.709> green<00:03:35.010> one<00:03:35.280> as<00:03:35.489> well<00:03:36.120> on

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
section and then a green one as well on

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.710 
section and then a green one as well on
the<00:03:37.290> tip<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:38.160> now<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.579> seems<00:03:38.819> like<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.329> merges

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
the tip so now it seems like it merges

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.160 
the tip so now it seems like it merges
from<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:41.310> white<00:03:41.730> nail<00:03:42.000> polish<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.870> pink

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
from the white nail polish to the pink

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.800 
from the white nail polish to the pink
up<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.889> the<00:03:44.010> green<00:03:44.280> like<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:45.090> but<00:03:45.569> when<00:03:45.720> you

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
up to the green like that but when you

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.840 
up to the green like that but when you
do<00:03:45.989> stuff<00:03:46.200> like<00:03:46.350> this<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.950> can<00:03:47.100> easily<00:03:47.400> tell

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
do stuff like this you can easily tell

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.879 
do stuff like this you can easily tell
that<00:03:47.880> because<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.569> green<00:03:48.840> is<00:03:49.139> not<00:03:49.440> in<00:03:49.739> the

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
that because the green is not in the

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.610 
that because the green is not in the
same<00:03:50.190> color<00:03:50.609> scope<00:03:51.060> as<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.299> pink<00:03:52.139> and<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.440> white

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
same color scope as a pink and the white

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.789 
same color scope as a pink and the white
those<00:03:53.010> two<00:03:53.280> merge<00:03:53.579> more<00:03:54.510> easily<00:03:54.870> whereas<00:03:55.680> a

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
those two merge more easily whereas a

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:56.860 
those two merge more easily whereas a
pink<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.489> green

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
pink and the green

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.229 
pink and the green
emerges<00:03:57.440> a<00:03:57.470> little<00:03:57.830> bit<00:03:57.980> harder<00:03:58.400> but<00:03:58.760> if<00:03:59.030> you

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
emerges a little bit harder but if you

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.449 
emerges a little bit harder but if you
do<00:03:59.420> want<00:03:59.450> stuff<00:04:00.110> that<00:04:00.349> merges<00:04:00.830> more<00:04:01.099> usually

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
do want stuff that merges more usually

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.670 
do want stuff that merges more usually
like<00:04:01.640> this<00:04:01.849> tribe<00:04:02.209> only<00:04:02.629> with<00:04:02.810> one<00:04:03.049> color<00:04:03.319> or

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
like this tribe only with one color or

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.110 
like this tribe only with one color or
the<00:04:04.430> same<00:04:05.000> colors<00:04:05.959> like<00:04:06.769> white<00:04:07.040> and<00:04:07.489> pink<00:04:07.879> and

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
the same colors like white and pink and

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.990 
the same colors like white and pink and
red<00:04:08.390> and<00:04:08.629> slowly<00:04:09.560> build<00:04:09.830> it<00:04:09.950> up<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:10.280> you<00:04:10.670> have

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
red and slowly build it up and you have

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.319 
red and slowly build it up and you have
nails<00:04:11.390> that<00:04:11.659> look<00:04:11.900> like<00:04:12.080> this
