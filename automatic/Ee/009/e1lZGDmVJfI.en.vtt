00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 everyone hopes that you fart the 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.009
 form today I find you for 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.600
 a new and last jiawei of my series 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.760
 so how to create gift boxes 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.380
 recycled this time I propose you to 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.880
 recycle a tin can so 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.590
 aesthetically speaking it's not 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.570
 necessarily the top but on the other hand 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.550
 level of originality of the surprise 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.359
 this box is really the top of the top 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.359
 so I let you look 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.300
 to make this diamond and you will have 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.730
 need a tin can 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.310
 until then everything is logical solvent 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.550
 a box opener and a pistol 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.550
 glue 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.720
 so to start you take your 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.160
 your boxes and you're going to open the box 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.590
 canned in fact by the back 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.340
 you're not going to open it by the way 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.500
 traditional 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.270
 it will be like that for precisely that the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.820
 no one suspects anything do not know 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.949
 not that actually inside there 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.020
 not there basic things but well and good 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.160
 what you have hidden there so once 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.570
 that it's open you put what 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.220
 was inside at the base in a 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.530
 bowl you get it back and especially you do not 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.730
 cost nothing you obviously go on the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.830
 eat later I trust you 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.570
 and then you rinse your box well 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.979
 so really one is good because 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.479
 if it 's something food that 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.369
 you want then replaced at 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.080
 inside is risking to have the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.670
 taste of the thing that was a wind so 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.380
 really nothing is good because good 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.100
 oumma sores and do not necessarily know what 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.869
 which is better 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.979
 you also put hot water 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.990
 like that it allows me to remove 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.610
 the label and for the remains of call 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.410
 because usually there are always 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.180
 glue residues the habib is all 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.950
 simply a cotton or a handkerchief 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.780
 solvent and you will be able to remove 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.369
 the rest of glue even if I you 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.369
 you'll admit it's not necessarily obvious 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.910
 and then you just have to 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.320
 place your surprise inside 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.720
 the box so if you follow me you 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.430
 know that I obviously have some remarks I 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.650
 have them firmly packed at the bottom or when I 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.270
 will close the box with maccoll the 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.980
 so glue does not dribble on candy 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.050
 that was a bit of a mess anyway 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.000
 that's it to lock up with the glue and 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.040
 then you let it dry and everything is 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.300
 completed 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.130
 that's actually you have a pretty box 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.780
 original and really it allows you to 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.100
 to make the surprise that is to say that the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.420
 no one expect to see a 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.920
 time you count of your services request 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.180
 what she does there and he tells himself that 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.040
 it's really bad and then finally he 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.479
 open and ah ah actually I have some 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.010
 candy it's not corn or whatever 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.660
 something like that so if you want 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.010
 decorate your box a little stronger 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.840
 to give him that gift spirit 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.210
 you can also cut a piece 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.710
 to go decorative the height of 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.120
 your tin can that you are pasting 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.590
 then on the box but 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.850
 personally I did not judge his 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.350
 necessary because I really wanted 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.790
 keep the mind in fact from boxes of 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.590
 just keeps thinking it's 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.200
 the cyclical cadore box idea that I have 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.580
 preferred realize and offer so if you
