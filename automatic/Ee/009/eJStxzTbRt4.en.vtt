00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.730
 and 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.920
 good people of youtube today I bring you 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.640
 a tutorial on how to install the word of 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.530
 warcraft version 3 points 3.5 more good 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.780
 how to play it 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:30.380
 either for simple steps or 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.840
 they download it and they already hit the ip or 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.370
 network and whatever you say and 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.820
 play like this directly without going down 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.770
 patches without going down a crack to clear more 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.480
 that nothing that the version that we are going to 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.809
 download is in English but good is low 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.309
 of one and good and the game is not 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.770
 that essentially limit in Spanish 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.410
 but I'm going to teach them how to get off 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.290
 the first and main thing could install 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.760
 this program that is the torrent I know what 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.710
 will leave in the description of the link or in 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.720
 an installation or listing because more 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.910
 administered also not boludeces open it 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.199
 what do I know I'm worth next next 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.260
 next the story to make a 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.140
 icon like this that is not necessary nor 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.230
 even open it but good 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.650
 let's see it so they can see how 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:17.740
 as it is more or less like this 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.570
 how good it is 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.820
 downloading because it takes a little bit of 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.250
 start downloading I burned out working 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.610
 250 or so is quite well 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.789
 drop in one day let's calculate two as 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.370
 much is finished down but good what 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.410
 I will 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.660
 that is to say it does not install directly it is 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.920
 it is installed decompressed the only thing 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.560
 what we have to do is start it and 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.360
 nothing else 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.640
 what I will eliminate if it shows you well 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.950
 all the steps that you have to do 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.630
 I 'm going to leave a link in the 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.979
 description where they directly have 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.229
 to go that good is going to take 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.210
 this page directly what they have 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.630
 what do you do here is get the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.920
 store rent click here 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.080
 them and well they want to hit me the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.570
 file name 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.740
 [Music] 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.120
 ok and to do the same thing that I had at 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.679
 principle was not being downloaded is 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.980
 this good makes it directly 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.050
 download and you're ready to have it 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.110
 game to open open the file 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.070
 which is wow exe not from the launcher because it 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.690
 will start to update the last 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.950
 version of blizzard and that we do not want 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.450
 do we want to open it 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.020
 directly keep it open this 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.610
 file no 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.580
 well that would be part of the 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.319
 installation does not enclose quotes what 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.569
 let's do now 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.909
 paste the real not 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.639
 of the servers in Argentina that 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.260
 guaguas good mainly what 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:42.049
 they have to do in the word folder 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.520
 works is looking for a flame file 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.950
 real 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.540
 write here up real good I eat 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.950
 I have the version also the download in 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.480
 Spanish but good 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.480
 this time to two that says 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:59.060
 what you have to do is right click to 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:01.790
 open or directly open double click 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.469
 in the model opens directly but 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.439
 denotes any word notes editor 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:07.999
 any word for anyone and now 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.639
 they have to paste this erase everything that 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:12.409
 have and paste this is to leave also 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.450
 in the description of the video that's how 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.910
 the ip of the server 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.050
 which we are going to connect to if not 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.480
 It will not leave us 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.980
 we will not stop with hector or 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.880
 let's directly connect the divider 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.070
 then they have to go to this page 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.750
 this table will be left in description for 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.390
 that to expose you create the name of 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.210
 user 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.160
 the user to play on the server does not 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.470
 good believe it and ready to play 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.330
 directly the development is quite 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.490
 well we calculate that there are about 500 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.490
 people more or less online 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.110
 has few books walk all the axes 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.210
 the whole truth is quite complete the 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.780
 server is about to open a tasting kingdom 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.780
 so 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.920
 has vips sport1 bliss like 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.920
 so 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.360
 it is quite difficult to climb almost not 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:15.000
 There's zero tail 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.120
 the server 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.130
 it's pretty good so that's good 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.549
 I do not want to do it too much in the guide 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.549
 long 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.560
 they say more flight from which I already said well 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.080
 I hope it has helped you if you 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.460
 served the video subscribe like favorites 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.520
 when all the bullshit you already know 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.759
 Any questions ask me the same either 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.409
 It gives for many doubts but good I hope 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.499
 that now 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:45.429
 more or less how much should show how many 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:45.429
 connected people 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.090
 a little bit because this is the video 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.910
 in theory 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.219
 I would serve 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:04.300
 connected there are 842 in total there are many 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:04.300
 many people 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:15.289
 and well nothing I hope it serves you 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.289
 the greetings of the technician 36
