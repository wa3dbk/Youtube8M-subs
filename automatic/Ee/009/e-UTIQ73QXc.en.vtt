00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 you 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.370
 Hello everyone 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.129
 today I find you with a 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.379
 video that's going to be basically from 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.959
 advice for young owners 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.029
 of donkeys and when I say young I speak 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.769
 no owner young in age I 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.240
 speaks rather of owners who do not 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.840
 have not been for a long time actually because 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.420
 only recently 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.170
 several people came to ask 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.849
 help 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.279
 because she could not do anything with 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.050
 their roseanne I told myself that this 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.000
 video trotting me in the head 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.379
 for a while it was time for the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.309
 to do so I 'm going to put a lot of 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.570
 things clear once and for all 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.489
 all i will give you advice 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.350
 fundamentals on the donkey 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.989
 I told you about his education 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.550
 general and especially his psychology 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.260
 to start it several times 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.270
 ask the question if your donkey and 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.949
 whole are castrating but really 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.329
 Of course there are exceptions and Me 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.890
 even I knew ancient was very 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.870
 sweet and very kind but in good standing 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.340
 general donkeys whole under very hard 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.390
 even more than the horses we know 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.670
 the lens can have a behavior 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.850
 extremely aggressive you can 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.320
 hustle tap death and if you 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.790
 to overflow otherwise whole 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.100
 you have finished what you are in 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.900
 the more the lens and becomes really 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.880
 nabeul in the presence of years but that's 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.860
 face a phenomenal force where you 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.720
 can not do anything I'll take 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.640
 for example peppers emma lea who is a 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.280
 couple I love that I'm his 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.660
 beautiful both and one 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.030
 complicity from there we get drunk 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.370
 incredible and mahler wanted death 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.710
 pepper whole and recently in fact she 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.150
 made the decision to castrate him because 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.790
 that he was becoming really unmanageable and 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.970
 he respected her more so cqfd it's 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.310
 that really even the most talented and the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.130
 more animal friendly little 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.950
 teenagers really become really 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.960
 complicated second advice a donkey is 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.130
 not a horse and run it 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.500
 absolutely not the same 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.360
 the barge does he will obediently obey 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.829
 in quotation marks because you tell him 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.689
 ask for something here to give you 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.399
 an order he obeys while the donkey 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.350
 not only does he obey you do 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.909
 pleasure but in addition he needs to 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.590
 understand what you are asking him for so 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.090
 again if your hate does not you 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.619
 obey not it's not that he's stubborn 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.490
 is that he surely did not understand this 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.170
 that you are asking him 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.069
 it's that you're doing badly in fact 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.110
 so question yourself 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.360
 put yourself in his place try to think 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.310
 as he thinks it's to put you in 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.330
 his head and appointments understandable 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.760
 for him makes sure that they will 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.650
 basically understand it's almost 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.150
 never the fault of the year if it does not 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.160
 do not walk it surely does not come to him 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.269
 comes over to you third board does not 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.340
 do not burn the steps 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.110
 stop wanting to go up immediately 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.670
 already the later year that the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.430
 horse and ended his growth towards five 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.870
 years so of course from 4 years old you 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.700
 can start to make him wear 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.340
 small charges and not long but 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.230
 to mount it before 5 years forget 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.569
 was waiting for his fifth birthday and then 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.790
 in any case most of the work is 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.739
 on foot we do not climb as long as we have 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.120
 no good bases on foot as I the 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.099
 tell in my video that I'm just putting you 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.079
 here on how to learn how to protect 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.540
 galloping to a donkey set up codes to 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.239
 the apse voice if you teach him to 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.810
 foot right left hulot too this 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.980
 dialogue 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.269
 once it's going to be acquired for him 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.440
 it'll be acquired all this is there 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.720
 will respond in any situation 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.540
 if you forget walking he will obey you at 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.560
 ascend fourth board privilege 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.540
 short sessions 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.650
 remember there is this sentence I do not 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.239
 do not know who she likes so she is 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.190
 magical she says all ask can 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.810
 ask often rewarded a lot 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.000
 that is to say that the donkey assimilate better 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.010
 an exercise if asked for a short time 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.329
 of time but regularly so that if 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.650
 you put on his back and that you do not 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.480
 do not let go for an hour you him 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.650
 ask the same exercise there after 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.510
 a time you go there it is 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.480
 actually there he will put the most 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.680
 big bad will of the world and 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.060
 you are going to have trouble with what you 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.409
 obey because simply the 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.970
 nabe need no mission in the 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.930
 work and they do not see the utility of 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.209
 repeat the exercise 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.159
 again and again if he thinks he has 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.659
 do not be like a horse 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.200
 who will continue to do the same 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.549
 exercise 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.110
 again and again so much wanted to ask 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.310
 without asking any questions so if you 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.920
 want your work sessions to be 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.420
 goes well in the good mood does the 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.860
 short and always finish on a 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.660
 good note and little treats or 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.629
 still to the fifth council hugs 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.190
 congratulated a lot lane it's a real 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.260
 sponge he can smell a year but 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.120
 incalculable of just things with 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.129
 the intonation of your voice so be 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.260
 not stingy with compliments from 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.730
 congratulations and encouragement the 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.049
 bail your voice he knows he has 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.970
 worked out there he did what you 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.579
 wait for him and that will make him 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.750
 morally 6th council and there I 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.810
 speaks more for the shot to young 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.160
 older owners be patient 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.359
 do not take a donkey and tell yourself that 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.590
 going to be great and you will be able to 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.180
 do like more colleagues from 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.130
 competition as a win behind 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.960
 what we do is above all a lot of 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.580
 work we often ask for advice 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.070
 as if there was a button on off on 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.500
 rents as if there was something 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.150
 magic that makes that once we get it 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.740
 know is well there no sai is all of a 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.320
 blow we 'll walk three planes back up 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.000
 jump 90 cm and fold on request 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.800
 but not at all that it takes time 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.510
 and work the year he needs to 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.490
 time he needs to think a lot 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.990
 and much analyzed if you go there 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.780
 take it bad he'll make you pay 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.590
 because she even when he had a 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.210
 bad experience an experience 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.830
 unpleasant a first time 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.190
 it's very difficult to get it back 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.590
 has an elephant memory and that's very 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.030
 very difficult to recover it so we 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.800
 do not plant what do you really take 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.110
 your 7th time I am asked council 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.569
 as often as how to make sure that the 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.369
 court 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.050
 gasoline in the shade for the donkey to do 

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:11.789
 trust makes the device there is no 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.800
 at all from miracle recipe it's just 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.409
 time spent with him upwind 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.580
 to do nothing just to watch it is not 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.229
 not always visit him 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.339
 that to work within range of a 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.369
 treat when you come to see it 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:25.740
 tickle the cuddle the past of time 

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:28.469
 clothes with him take care of you in everything 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.059
 just think about it but trust 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:31.619
 she'll settle down alone like that 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:33.270
 and of course every year different 

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:35.550
 every year at his own pace so there is 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.229
 who will immediately be very attached 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.149
 to you and very demonstrative and others 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.469
 like flies that will put 

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:42.029
 a lot a lot a lot of time to 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:44.309
 you trust them so 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:46.229
 respect this rhythm and adapt to 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:48.149
 your hate in conclusion all 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.610
 simply lane it's not at all a 

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:52.319
 easy animal and that's not in the sense that 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.309
 he is stubborn and where you go nothing or 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:55.020
 succeed in drawing 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:56.699
 but precisely in the sense that it is 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.499
 very very intelligent his psychology 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.839
 it is different from that of the horse 

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:02.490
 it is more complex and needs the 

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:04.080
 communication goes on and you get 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.639
 what you want is for you to do 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.649
 the effort to understand how he 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.869
 works it's up to you to do 

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:11.789
 the effort to speak his language so do not 

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:13.409
 you are not launching into the adventure of having 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:14.789
 a donkey if you are not ready to do 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:17.519
 its concessions to demonstrate 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.990
 a lot of patience tried to think 

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:21.839
 differently and operate 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.300
 differently to adapt to the euro 

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:25.319
 take a horse 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.599
 here I hope with these little ones
