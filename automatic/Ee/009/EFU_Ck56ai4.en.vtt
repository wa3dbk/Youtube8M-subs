problems<00:00:37.530> later<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:37.980> we'll<00:00:38.219> get<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.940> taking

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
problems later so we'll get it taking

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.049 
problems later so we'll get it taking
the<00:00:39.270> headlights<00:00:39.540> out<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.460> donal<00:00:41.730> quick

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the headlights out and it's donal quick

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.209 
the headlights out and it's donal quick
there<00:00:42.719> aren't<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.899> guys<00:00:42.989> both<00:00:43.590> headlights

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
there aren't you guys both headlights

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.479 
there aren't you guys both headlights
are<00:00:44.610> both<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.149> V<00:00:45.300> turn<00:00:45.690> signals<00:00:45.719> are<00:00:46.170> now<00:00:46.260> in

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
are both the V turn signals are now in

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.209 
are both the V turn signals are now in
and<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.059> see<00:00:48.239> I'm<00:00:48.329> blinking<00:00:48.660> over<00:00:48.840> there

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
and you can see I'm blinking over there

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.040 
and you can see I'm blinking over there
again<00:00:50.219> not<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.579> bright<00:00:50.850> during<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> day<00:00:51.480> but

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
again not as bright during the day but

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.450 
again not as bright during the day but
at<00:00:52.110> night<00:00:52.320> these<00:00:52.710> things<00:00:53.010> are<00:00:53.160> nice<00:00:53.250> and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
at night these things are nice and

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.979 
at night these things are nice and
bright<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.610> mean<00:00:53.879> they're<00:00:54.090> still<00:00:54.180> visible<00:00:54.870> of

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
bright I mean they're still visible of

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.340 
bright I mean they're still visible of
course<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.940> they're<00:00:57.090> going<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.570> once<00:00:58.260> you

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
course but so they're going and once you

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.840 
course but so they're going and once you
figure<00:00:58.500> out<00:00:58.620> how<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.800> work<00:00:58.980> these<00:00:59.160> load

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
figure out how to work these load

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.840 
figure out how to work these load
ballast<00:01:00.300> they're<00:01:01.260> really<00:01:01.500> easy<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.800> use<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
ballast they're really easy to use and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.980 
ballast they're really easy to use and
install<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.180> should<00:01:03.510> say<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:06.869> mount

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
install I should say so you just mount

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.090 
install I should say so you just mount
one<00:01:07.260> wire<00:01:07.820> one<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.409> load<00:01:10.409> resistors<00:01:10.860> wires

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
one wire one of the load resistors wires

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.210 
one wire one of the load resistors wires
to<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> ground<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.360> one<00:01:13.320> that's<00:01:13.710> that's<00:01:14.100> my

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
to the ground and one that's that's my

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.010 
to the ground and one that's that's my
turn<00:01:14.400> signal<00:01:14.580> wire<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.240> one's<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.570> and

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
turn signal wire that this one's on and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.020 
turn signal wire that this one's on and
then<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.100> ground<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.000> I

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
then this one is on the ground and so I

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.170 
then this one is on the ground and so I
mean<00:01:18.180> they're<00:01:18.299> really<00:01:18.509> easy<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.869> hook<00:01:18.990> up<00:01:19.200> so

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
mean they're really easy to hook up so

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.429 
mean they're really easy to hook up so
but<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:23.820> mount<00:01:24.330> these<00:01:24.450> backup<00:01:24.840> mount<00:01:25.110> these<00:01:25.229> on

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
but so mount these backup mount these on

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.300 
but so mount these backup mount these on
to<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:26.270> metal<00:01:27.270> surface<00:01:27.770> somewhere<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.890> here<00:01:29.100> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
to a metal surface somewhere in here and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.819 
to a metal surface somewhere in here and
then<00:01:29.520> you're<00:01:30.119> good<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.360> go<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.720> these<00:01:31.619> are<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
then you're good to go so these are the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.230 
then you're good to go so these are the
old<00:01:31.950> bulbs<00:01:32.310> here<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.579> can<00:01:32.700> see<00:01:32.820> how<00:01:32.909> hot<00:01:33.090> they

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
old bulbs here you can see how hot they

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.300 
old bulbs here you can see how hot they
were<00:01:33.299> getting<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:33.900> actually<00:01:34.170> started<00:01:34.409> peeling

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
were getting we actually started peeling

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.760 
were getting we actually started peeling
them<00:01:35.640> paint<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.119> these<00:01:36.409> this<00:01:37.409> one's<00:01:37.619> really

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
them paint on these this one's really

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.539 
them paint on these this one's really
bad<00:01:38.009> here<00:01:38.780> yeah<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:41.250> that's<00:01:41.400> why<00:01:41.490> I'm
