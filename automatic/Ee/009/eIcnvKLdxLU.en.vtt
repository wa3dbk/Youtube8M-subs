00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.850 
chips so these are the four year old
abalone<00:01:55.390> so<00:01:55.479> what<00:01:56.289> they<00:01:56.380> do<00:01:56.439> is<00:01:56.590> they<00:01:56.649> shuck

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
abalone so what they do is they shuck

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.289 
abalone so what they do is they shuck
them<00:01:56.950> out<00:01:57.069> of<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.189> shells<00:01:57.399> clean<00:01:57.850> them<00:01:58.000> and

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
them out of the shells clean them and

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.969 
them out of the shells clean them and
then<00:01:58.479> tenderize<00:01:58.929> them<00:01:59.020> so<00:01:59.469> this<00:01:59.590> is<00:01:59.709> basically

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
then tenderize them so this is basically

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.910 
then tenderize them so this is basically
a<00:02:00.100> tenderize<00:02:00.939> steak<00:02:01.240> this<00:02:01.719> is<00:02:02.020> local<00:02:02.439> halibut

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
a tenderize steak this is local halibut

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.490 
a tenderize steak this is local halibut
and<00:02:03.759> I<00:02:03.819> have<00:02:03.969> it<00:02:04.090> in<00:02:04.179> a<00:02:04.240> brine<00:02:04.509> I<00:02:04.750> make<00:02:05.170> a<00:02:05.200> mousse

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
and I have it in a brine I make a mousse

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.529 
and I have it in a brine I make a mousse
so<00:02:05.679> it's<00:02:05.829> it's<00:02:06.369> basically<00:02:06.579> whipped<00:02:07.299> fish

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
so it's it's basically whipped fish

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.259 
so it's it's basically whipped fish
pureed<00:02:07.869> fish<00:02:08.110> I<00:02:08.349> chop<00:02:09.039> up<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.190> abalone<00:02:09.640> mix<00:02:10.149> it

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
pureed fish I chop up the abalone mix it

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.120 
pureed fish I chop up the abalone mix it
in<00:02:10.420> out<00:02:10.630> a<00:02:10.690> little<00:02:11.019> bit<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.230> cream<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:11.799> you<00:02:11.980> end

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
in out a little bit of cream and you end

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.309 
in out a little bit of cream and you end
up<00:02:12.190> with<00:02:12.340> like<00:02:12.819> a<00:02:12.849> smooth<00:02:13.150> texture<00:02:13.720> uniform

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
up with like a smooth texture uniform

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.229 
up with like a smooth texture uniform
texture<00:02:14.650> I'm<00:02:14.950> using<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.250> piping<00:02:15.610> bag<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.090> can

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
texture I'm using a piping bag so I can

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.250 
texture I'm using a piping bag so I can
get<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.510> into<00:02:16.630> this<00:02:16.900> shape

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
get it into this shape

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.259 
get it into this shape
it's<00:02:17.560> just<00:02:17.739> easiest<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.310> roll<00:02:18.519> we<00:02:19.030> wrap<00:02:19.239> it

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
it's just easiest to roll we wrap it

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.869 
it's just easiest to roll we wrap it
like<00:02:19.599> this<00:02:19.780> fold<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.709> plastic<00:02:20.920> over<00:02:21.250> then<00:02:21.819> we

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
like this fold the plastic over then we

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.050 
like this fold the plastic over then we
tie<00:02:22.030> both<00:02:22.239> ends<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.900> push<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.290> off<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.650> like<00:02:23.980> to

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
tie both ends and push it off I like to

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.729 
tie both ends and push it off I like to
do<00:02:25.060> dishes<00:02:25.299> that<00:02:25.690> give<00:02:26.049> you<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.200> sense<00:02:26.379> of<00:02:26.590> where

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
do dishes that give you a sense of where

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.979 
do dishes that give you a sense of where
you<00:02:26.860> are<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:27.250> decided<00:02:27.849> to<00:02:28.060> incorporate<00:02:28.360> abalone

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
you are I decided to incorporate abalone

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.390 
you are I decided to incorporate abalone
because<00:02:29.230> people<00:02:29.620> come<00:02:29.769> to<00:02:29.860> cake<00:02:30.010> us<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.280> try

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
because people come to cake us to try

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.119 
because people come to cake us to try
the<00:02:30.430> abalone<00:02:30.819> what<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.329> get<00:02:31.450> from<00:02:31.540> there<00:02:31.780> is

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
the abalone what you get from there is

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.470 
the abalone what you get from there is
little<00:02:33.129> sections<00:02:33.489> of<00:02:33.730> abalone<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.299> fish

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
little sections of abalone and fish

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.390 
little sections of abalone and fish
mousse<00:02:34.720> so<00:02:35.049> the<00:02:35.170> next<00:02:35.349> step<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:35.860> frying<00:02:36.190> these

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
mousse so the next step is frying these

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.490 
mousse so the next step is frying these
bad<00:02:36.579> boys<00:02:36.760> right<00:02:36.819> chocolate<00:02:37.569> a<00:02:37.810> little<00:02:38.200> bit<00:02:38.410> of

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
bad boys right chocolate a little bit of

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.559 
bad boys right chocolate a little bit of
squid<00:02:38.680> ink<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:39.190> then<00:02:39.519> we<00:02:39.700> start<00:02:40.000> whisking<00:02:40.209> the

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
squid ink and then we start whisking the

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.449 
squid ink and then we start whisking the
water<00:02:40.930> into<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.260> ink<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.980> add<00:02:42.100> some<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.400> the

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
water into the ink and add some of the

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.250 
water into the ink and add some of the
dry<00:02:42.609> ingredients<00:02:42.639> now<00:02:43.239> was<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:43.989> like

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
dry ingredients now was this like

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.050 
dry ingredients now was this like
another<00:02:44.500> step<00:02:44.920> in<00:02:45.130> conceptualizing<00:02:45.519> this

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
another step in conceptualizing this

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.509 
another step in conceptualizing this
dish<00:02:46.299> yeah<00:02:46.630> you<00:02:46.690> know<00:02:47.079> what<00:02:47.200> happened<00:02:47.620> was<00:02:47.950> at

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
dish yeah you know what happened was at

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:49.890 
dish yeah you know what happened was at
one<00:02:48.639> point<00:02:48.790> we<00:02:48.910> were<00:02:49.000> doing<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.209> dish<00:02:49.359> with<00:02:49.540> with

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
one point we were doing a dish with with

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.280 
one point we were doing a dish with with
beets

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
beets

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.080 
beets
and<00:02:50.709> so<00:02:50.950> we<00:02:51.069> just<00:02:51.220> incorporated<00:02:51.819> the<00:02:51.910> beet

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
and so we just incorporated the beet

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.879 
and so we just incorporated the beet
puree<00:02:52.389> into<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.720> batter<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.650> made<00:02:53.769> it

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
puree into the batter and it made it

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.470 
puree into the batter and it made it
bright<00:02:54.069> red<00:02:54.310> but<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:54.849> was<00:02:54.940> just<00:02:55.090> kind<00:02:55.239> of<00:02:55.269> weird

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
bright red but it was just kind of weird

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.569 
bright red but it was just kind of weird
right<00:02:56.019> you<00:02:56.139> know<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.290> have<00:02:56.470> like<00:02:56.650> red<00:02:56.920> fish<00:02:57.430> and

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
right you know to have like red fish and

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.330 
right you know to have like red fish and
chips<00:02:57.790> but<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.780> idea<00:02:59.170> was<00:02:59.560> was<00:02:59.920> neat<00:03:00.099> you<00:03:00.220> know

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
chips but the idea was was neat you know

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.830 
chips but the idea was was neat you know

error and just happened to work out
we're<00:03:12.790> gonna<00:03:12.849> take<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.180> mousse<00:03:13.359> toss<00:03:14.109> it<00:03:14.380> into

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
we're gonna take the mousse toss it into

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.559 
we're gonna take the mousse toss it into
the<00:03:15.040> batter<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.549> we<00:03:15.639> have<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.880> fish<00:03:16.299> all
