00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.440
 The eight groups of South Africa-2010 deal are ready in the afternoon of 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.490
 Friday, the raffle was held to learn about the components of the eight 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.120
 groups 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.839
 for the South Africa World Cup 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.669
 read the inevitable liar novel by the first hour I was accompanied by 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.089
 and we are going to talk about how the composition of the esteban groups was 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.720
 start what did you think about what has caught your attention the most? 

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:28.230
 this draw made today 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.479
 in cape town 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:34.120
 On the other hand there was much surprise to the group and a fairly level amount 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.300
 as for talent yes 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.000
 aÃ­to group that are obvious as can be outlined as one of the most 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.110
 difficult 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.570
 to the whistle voice of the group that has nothing 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.400
 hala country in south africa 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.100
 Companioned by Mexico, Uruguay and France, and also the group g 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.210
 Then you find Brazil Portugal 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.000
 also the film and North Korea 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.910
 Undoubtedly, Castro indicated that he called before demeaning this segment of me 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.040
 I say that the strongest group of the eight 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.110
 precisely the group b that has brazil pentacampeÃ³n of the world has portugal 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.400
 on an ivory coast that one of the African teams probably 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.200
 better with quality players and troop percent and have tour 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.130
 etc 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.660
 Esteban bet the group to why but the group is going to be more complicated 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.590
 maybe he does not have the level of talent he has 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.100
 the group from brazil and portugal for a rich uruguay proposed by sitting their 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.120
 team to pass 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.810
 we can and what false and france should be for your group 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.890
 part of the medical process just as the monkey is not very difficult 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.530
 to intubate the other but south africa 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.340
 that can save your idol countries always grows team give the chime 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.680
 by the party without a doubt france and france being a nexus and poker face 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.150
 counting on individuals and what is on paper but there are also 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.950
 to remember that a team that comes a European qualifier and that played very very 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.409
 bad with much difficulty 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.990
 his technician Raymond Domenech has been questioned however in the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.280
 runner-up of the world will be held to the final eln in the world past 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.939
 and although he lost to Italy 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.150
 etea age spain that are going to the election parrot bell cope coming 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.709
 probably playing the best football they currently have the world will be in 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.290
 the group h together with switzerland honduras and chile 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.379
 a very accessible group 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.849
 let's talk now will Argentine South American team starting with 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.909
 Argentina and one of the teams that attracts the most attention and 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.820
 hobby brings you rich are located in group b 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.040
 next to nigeria south korea and greece fell very favored by the front 8 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.129
 of head and little assistance 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.970
 the easiest one that corresponded already to South Korea and Greece the team 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.529
 Asian you can lose problems with speed 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:44.940
 as for the court 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.280
 I am not I would not be here in ikea stores as easy as 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.880
 Greece for example a very nice rival very good rutile leader very hard should 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.610
 deal 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.890
 it's a very defensive team and I hope you get a short tournament that can 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.970
 complicate a classification 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.879
 nigeria a good african team and south korea 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.090
 every inning japan korea tuna a good tournament and one a team and constancy 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.539
 this level so 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:10.629
 and with argentina with maradona 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.790
 square was fine if you think it has been quite inconsistent yet 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.740
 we have not seen that nickname argentina 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.179
 that for example in the world past when asked by JosÃ© Pekerman 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:22.599
 with maradona still argentinos found 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:23.880
 I hope for the world 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.280
 as for qaeda and groups are well and that you know from england 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.790
 and we are living the surprise that the Jewish state of the confederations cup 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.440
 is measured to a team from the Murcia region to which it belongs therefore of the 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:36.110
 concacaf 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.550
 be aligned with the bitch Algeria and Slovenia 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.629
 a very interesting group in terms of the other Latin American rivals 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.090
 we have nothing for water and that is the group f next to the world champion i 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.819
 Thalia and New Zealand and Slovakia 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:51.739
 Also in the 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.090
 the group h that we already mentioned is Chile and Honduras that another rivals 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.930
 del aconcagua another of the teams of the concacaf puerto rico its time 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.769
 duran has left the ones that came to draw in the second leg here 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:03.899
