00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
lot of people a lot of hacks that I've

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.730 
lot of people a lot of hacks that I've
seen<00:01:10.020> before<00:01:10.710> required<00:01:11.960> unscrewing<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
seen before required unscrewing the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.730 
seen before required unscrewing the
metal<00:01:14.010> mount<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.729> replacing<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.450> with<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.869> EF

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
metal mount and replacing it with a EF

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.830 
metal mount and replacing it with a EF
mount<00:01:16.979> something<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.390> find<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.750> an

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
mount something that you can find on an

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.130 
mount something that you can find on an
older<00:01:19.520> canon<00:01:20.520> lens<00:01:20.700> here<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.689> an<00:01:21.810> EF

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
older canon lens here this is just an EF

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.219 
older canon lens here this is just an EF
lens<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.970> replacing<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> mount<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.810> problem

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
lens and replacing the mount the problem

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.140 
lens and replacing the mount the problem
is<00:01:25.439> because<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.250> image<00:01:26.549> circles<00:01:26.970> aren't

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
is because the image circles aren't

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.030 
is because the image circles aren't
going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.509> same<00:01:27.720> size<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.470> where<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
going to be the same size and where the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.819 
going to be the same size and where the
contacts<00:01:30.140> touch<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.320> lens<00:01:31.500> you're<00:01:31.740> gonna

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
contacts touch the lens you're gonna

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.560 
contacts touch the lens you're gonna
have<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.220> do<00:01:32.340> some<00:01:32.520> filing<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> mouth<00:01:33.329> and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
have to do some filing on the mouth and

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.510 
have to do some filing on the mouth and
it's<00:01:33.659> really<00:01:33.840> messy<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:35.040> somewhat

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
it's really messy it's somewhat

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.140 
it's really messy it's somewhat
permanent<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:37.500> know<00:01:37.700> there's<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.759> lot<00:01:38.970> more

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
permanent you know there's a lot more

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.539 
permanent you know there's a lot more
opportunity<00:01:39.720> for<00:01:39.780> failure<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.439> for<00:01:41.250> messing

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
opportunity for failure and for messing

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.999 
opportunity for failure and for messing
something<00:01:41.670> up<00:01:41.880> there<00:01:42.290> it<00:01:43.290> doesn't<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.890> be

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
something up there it doesn't have to be

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.440 
something up there it doesn't have to be
that<00:01:44.159> hard<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.549> actually<00:01:44.670> extremely<00:01:45.030> easy

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
that hard it's actually extremely easy

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.749 
that hard it's actually extremely easy
so<00:01:46.790> if<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.939> still<00:01:48.270> own<00:01:48.680> your<00:01:49.680> 1.6<00:01:50.340> crop<00:01:50.549> body

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
so if you still own your 1.6 crop body

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.460 
so if you still own your 1.6 crop body
you<00:01:50.939> can<00:01:51.090> still<00:01:51.390> use<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.810> lens<00:01:52.020> back<00:01:52.259> and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
you can still use this lens back and

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.450 
you can still use this lens back and
forth<00:01:52.710> really<00:01:52.950> easy<00:01:54.290> simple<00:01:55.290> as<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.500> zoom

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460

a little massage we look back and forth
and<00:02:13.079> this<00:02:13.200> piece<00:02:13.379> of<00:02:13.560> plastic<00:02:13.709> pops<00:02:14.189> right<00:02:14.400> off

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
and this piece of plastic pops right off

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.800 
and this piece of plastic pops right off
and<00:02:16.709> that's<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.239> you<00:02:18.239> have<00:02:18.269> an<00:02:18.510> exposed

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
and that's it you have an exposed

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.100 
and that's it you have an exposed
circuit<00:02:19.200> board<00:02:19.409> here<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:19.920> be<00:02:20.069> careful<00:02:20.459> not<00:02:20.610> to

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110

knocking this stuff around but from here
it's<00:02:25.470> as<00:02:25.590> simple<00:02:25.849> it's<00:02:26.849> not<00:02:27.000> like<00:02:27.150> no<00:02:27.239> ants<00:02:28.220> and

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
it's as simple it's not like no ants and

go away

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.300 
go away
pretty<00:03:10.290> drastically<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:10.980> you'll<00:03:11.129> know

to make sure there's absolutely no way
you<00:03:19.049> can<00:03:19.709> snap<00:03:19.919> a<00:03:19.949> picture<00:03:20.280> at<00:03:20.489> ten<00:03:20.639> millimeter

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
you can snap a picture at ten millimeter

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.270 
you can snap a picture at ten millimeter
then<00:03:21.930> all<00:03:22.049> I<00:03:22.079> need<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.319> do<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.620> put<00:03:22.829> on<00:03:22.980> a

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
then all I need to do is put on a

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.640 
then all I need to do is put on a
seventy<00:03:24.030> seven<00:03:24.329> millimeter<00:03:24.690> filter<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.199> UV

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
seventy seven millimeter filter a UV

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.050 
seventy seven millimeter filter a UV
filter<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:28.019> I<00:03:28.109> took<00:03:28.409> a<00:03:28.799> piece<00:03:29.010> of<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.340> coat

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
filter and I took a piece of a coat

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.899 
filter and I took a piece of a coat
hanger<00:03:30.209> wire<00:03:30.389> and<00:03:30.889> just<00:03:31.889> ran<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.459> around<00:03:32.699> on

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
hanger wire and just ran it around on

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.339 
hanger wire and just ran it around on
the<00:03:32.940> inside<00:03:33.180> here<00:03:33.629> make<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:34.019> little<00:03:34.139> larger

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
the inside here make it a little larger

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.960 
the inside here make it a little larger
then<00:03:34.680> just<00:03:34.889> bend<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.459> pop<00:03:35.639> it<00:03:35.669> into<00:03:35.909> place

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
then just bend it and pop it into place

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.199 
then just bend it and pop it into place
and<00:03:36.359> that<00:03:37.199> makes<00:03:37.470> us<00:03:37.620> face<00:03:37.859> er<00:03:38.069> that<00:03:38.699> doesn't

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
and that makes us face er that doesn't

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.479 
and that makes us face er that doesn't
let<00:03:39.419> the<00:03:39.900> lens<00:03:40.139> come<00:03:40.440> up<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.889> ten<00:03:41.069> millimeter

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
let the lens come up to ten millimeter

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.839 
let the lens come up to ten millimeter
so<00:03:42.150> if<00:03:42.269> it's<00:03:42.449> a<00:03:42.510> physical<00:03:42.720> stop<00:03:43.290> there<00:03:43.849> to

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
so if it's a physical stop there to

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.879 
so if it's a physical stop there to
where<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.090> won't<00:03:45.359> ever<00:03:46.109> have<00:03:46.319> a<00:03:46.470> chance<00:03:46.680> of

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
where you won't ever have a chance of

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.770 
where you won't ever have a chance of
hitting<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.250> rear<00:03:47.400> element<00:03:49.340> so<00:03:50.340> let's<00:03:50.519> say

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
hitting the rear element so let's say

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.569 
hitting the rear element so let's say
you<00:03:51.780> no<00:03:51.930> longer<00:03:52.079> have<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.470> 1d<00:03:52.889> or<00:03:52.919> you<00:03:53.310> want<00:03:53.489> to

you no longer have a 1d or you want to

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.129 
you no longer have a 1d or you want to
sell<00:03:53.760> this<00:03:53.909> lens<00:03:54.180> or<00:03:54.419> you<00:03:54.540> want<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.750> get<00:03:54.900> rid<00:03:55.109> of
