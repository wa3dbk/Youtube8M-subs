00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.390
 it also has it good for what 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.270
 have already know they have to download 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.159
 the pack of the description of the video that 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.049
 If this one is going to give you, you know, it's going to 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.729

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.060
 carpetita that wines that are being 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.780
 is inside this one because they already know well 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:35.550
 in the folders with your file and new it 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.020
 that you already know is to copy the folder we 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.710
 we go to the next route that is my 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:46.980
 documents and we go to my documents 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:49.300
 to put root we go to skis 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.240
 well here they stick it I already have it 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.370
 as you will see here it is coming I turn it 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.610
 to copy or that I have it you are crazy 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:03.250
 Penelope won once by doing that he is going 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:05.230
 to a program they refresh everything so that 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.610
 disappear the folder that has been 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:13.690
 this one just ok well the only thing 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:17.110
 what they have to do is open or 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.090
 break down each folder and so 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.390
 successively what they have to do 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.000
 this double-click call on the in the 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.710
 file that for example I'm going to 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.270
 put back that same 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.740
 they also contain what is this 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.930
 bar that is shown that is going 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.930
 sliding slowly on your desk 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:45.930
 with tiers and I'm putting something else 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.810
 that I have to clarify so that what 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.629
 we can regulate well is in the folder of 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.049
 bar at the moment that you put him 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:58.079
 they put this but when they put it they will 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.700
 put in place on bottom so 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.280
 put back the icons 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.989
 I like to accommodate the feet but this 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.159
 folder to see back so you have the 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.159
 appearance of playstation3 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.400
 what else do I show you asylums accesses 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.930
 for example that it can not do 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.830
 that if you do not sing about the video but it's 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.050
 to pay and to suspend here 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.860
 this one they take what is the program 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.860
 I say, I have him 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.860
 here, if they open it, it will take us 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:33.569

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:39.060

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.140
