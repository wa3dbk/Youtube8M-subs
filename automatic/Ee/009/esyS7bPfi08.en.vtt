00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:04.280
 he stood paris 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.280
 the inland business 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.339
 go this way 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.329
 the plains 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.230
 developer volition try too often hardly any solo on average every two 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.470
 there will be a new edition of these fantastic games this year 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.550
 she was once a game i bought when i was in 8 years ago 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.060
 had bought sixty fairy tales 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.730
 she is also a nice though missed it is already a game that means you 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.190
 don't need a win either to play this game 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.320
 stakes are large should always look homicidal along with kim sees 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.330
 forests run from hell 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.329
 how the mail branch ended up 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.399
 Saturday a brilliant plan for his daughter Jezebel to marry 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.189
 those who supply short for substantial supplies for new residents of hell 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.180
 the abduction follows and of course the syrian leader may have it back 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.470
 So time to get a child to look up victims 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.360
 and the mail 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.640
 bring dirk back to earth 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.860
 in terms of controls and children, there is not really anything new in comparison 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.960
 with the predecessors 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.950
 just like the world in the previous seven games, hell is a big open world 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.730
 which gives your play complete freedom 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.210
 I also think it is really cool that she 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.170
 the flies have been adding weeks to iran van putten superpowers 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.110
 the second high jump 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.729
 hand out big hits to value 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.789
 to the enemies 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.819
 but this time the press is that you can fly through the entire folder and I thought so 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.479
 personally it really felt great the controls were nice and yes 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.920
 it was just fair i dont have something new 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.180
 over time if you are of that size 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.920
 magical full 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.650
 you can get all kinds of complaints 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.710
 or improve your own city that silence will hardly use forces 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.170
 made 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.440
 the virus are better to use the two forces that just often go between and 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.400
 le monde at the start of the game to improve it as quickly as possible because that 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:04.890
 I need it the most 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.940
 In addition, there are also those forces who mainly make a proposal for the 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.849
 fights like 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.319
 pecunia, though, which causes your enemies to burn 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.319
 with one and the giant demons 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.280
 who fight for you for three days 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.600
 in short, the ideal way to kill van der gouw last year 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:38.390
 very strong point from this game is expensive nice nice fanatic chiesi 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.989
 as part of an asx file 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.269
 we will run some super cool in musicals and fancy 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.919
 4 really will not soon forget I am not going to tell you too much for sure 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:51.599
 don't even know it is of course a tough competitor Ford year 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.219
 pleasant car turned out does not see game does that calls again and again 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:00.209
 I think that is so fantastic. Syntigo is just really crazy 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.209
 and they need the content 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:08.469
 pica supermarkets a lot 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:16.039
 In addition, the euro is waited for and it is conceivable that it is also present in the living room 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:18.409
 shortly before rest 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:19.669
 keep it here 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:22.619
 he played his son 3 and 4 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:27.650
 7 en nl a bit of the same, it is actually rid of him 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.650
 and instead of there being people who also go for the second round 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.260
 without this development you have to do but make 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.439
 it is actually the demons of the pol 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:38.659
 only there they are not that they 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.539
 the attacker was just like civilians for people who had become unwell 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:44.220
 but still I think so 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.440
 if you play the basement everywhere it is mostly the same but that 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.890
 does not matter what I have expected man on July 19 in this great man 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.609
 which I also find a very big plus 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.289
 that is that you have to collect all sorts of things that you need for property recorders 

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:03.439
 van diem offered together to be able to dress yourself 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.859
 search the newspaper's specific location on small round by a fly 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:08.790
 he earns 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.039
 really many ugly things and 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:16.449
 that also made me very nice to explore the moss the expansion cost 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:17.659
 20 euro 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:21.180
 for the pc the x box can shake exactly your four version 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.999
 she is at 4 and then also together with buying up, but that will be the first 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:29.769
 there were a few issues involved but not like the missions as we are 

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.620
 used to prince crowns 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.219
 it was actually a bit 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:38.549
 the free missions through which you unlock characters and then 

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:40.469
 could do another table issue 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:44.809
 m it were mainly the activities so really fit that could complete those in the 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:48.490
 folder were distributed and a director who had finished 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.740
 how to fit a piece at the flat yes with a piece in the folder so kind 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.990
 authority for yourself 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.590
 the parents is also a sharia though a piece of beach can actually be yours 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.479
 make the world first by winning 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.809
 After my conclusion it is clear I am also against this for more than ten years 

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:06.560
 this game 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.449
 I am ajacied but that did not work out 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.720
 yet incredibly unknown 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.279
 collecting too many texts on the last show 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:15.469
 at the campaign 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:19.619
 explore and therefore the game really makes a very addictive effect 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.719
 in the long term anybody can 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:25.909
 I hope you have a very nice review full know for sure the game 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:26.860
 to buy 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.919
 and her husband to play as soon as possible because this game is like your family 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:31.770
 spoiled 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.169
 then you know for sure they are going to play 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.060
 and two from the triumphant woman 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.050
 it would be just for the humor 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.460
 looking in the blind spot until you follow, she says
