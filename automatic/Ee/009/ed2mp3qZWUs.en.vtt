00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.110
 we want to choose this poet 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.210
 on the cover that we have for the volume 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.210
 of the hearing aids 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.490
 this part the pitcher the speed that 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.580
 we want the song to be the album 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:56.620
 as for example it will be faster if you 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.840
 we give here will be slower will be more 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.420
 close to be able to put it as it was in 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.810
 the morning very well networks will be placed 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.630
 as it was now we give it in fx the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.119
 here we go 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.700
 here will be some effects that we 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.959
 will bring this mixer by default 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.680
 we have to measure the medium the treble 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.459
 under this is like to repeat some 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.459
 part we leave here 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.440
 because this is like 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.440
 If you were in a bus, 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.710
 and so on it brings us like 5 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.920
 effects 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.650
 the rest you have to unlock the threads 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.750
 of what we will do in this way 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.360
 we entered the store 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.860
 and we have to be connected to wifi or 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.860
 have income 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.840
 ok as you see here they will be 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.090
 the 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.890
 the effects and designs that we could 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.440
 to unlock 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.980
 in this part as I see I have 10 coins 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.270
 you do not have to buy anything just 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.500
 we click 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.360
 it's not the currency it was very free 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.150

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.900

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.030
 we do not leave the field 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.560
 ok and now we enter the premium that 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.430

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.650
 the same mixer will not come out the good thing about 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.810
 this is that we have all the effects 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.140
