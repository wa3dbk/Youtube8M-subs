00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.690
 today's edition of pc sos tv has 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.760
 we can easily identify with 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.920
 speakers with one 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.600
 a whole lot of speakers in this 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.820
 video we explain to you all that you are 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.939
 always know about 5.1 surround sound 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.060
 I first wanted to ask why 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.620
 at all 5.1 sound surround sound knows 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.810
 all of you from the cinema and come accordingly 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.640
 from the fund of the filmmaker the 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.710
 Ton jungs wanted before the pictures still 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.270
 sharper and three-dimensional were also 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.489
 on the audio level one more dimension 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.500
 pack it up today has become surround 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.930
 sound in movies computer games and 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.030
 also partly in the music reproduction 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.949
 I will be established in this video 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.440
 specifically on two systems 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.730
 on the one hand to 5.1 sound systems the 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.489
 especially for the computer user 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.620
 were developed and 5.1 systems 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.629
 from the area of ​​home entertainment we 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.970
 buy them in every electronics retailer 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.590
 can get your new tv with his 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.300
 mostly bad sounding speakers 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.160
 something under the arms to grab 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.990
 basically one of the most important 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.940
 criteria for surround sound is the 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.740
 setting up the speakers and me 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.570
 say that so clearly because many 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.220
 do not observe the following specifications 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.869
 then you could get the money for the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.060
 5.1 system save 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.860
 We start with the position of the center 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.560
 Speakers on the zero degree share 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.390
 to the listener films become like that 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.579
 mixed that from the center the whole 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.140
 spoken word comes inclusive 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.180
 the effect sounds just in the 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.549
 visible camera angle happen 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.740
 therefore you should the center on the 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.420
 zero degrees axis either over or under 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.100
 put up the screen by one 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.140
 to get perfect order 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.729
 in our little model room finds 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.829
 your center below the screen 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.219
 where he usually mounted inconspicuous 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.130
 can 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.750
 it continues with the front 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.340
 stereo speakers couple these two 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.409
 Speakers should be at an angle of 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.689
 each 30 degrees from the center of the side 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.430
 be positioned over the screen 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.350
 Front stereo channels comes in the movie 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.770
 actually everything to do with music 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.869
 Has 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.590
 Acoustic atmosphere will be over it 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.300
 narrated and mapped stereo effects 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.430
 the positioning of the 30 degree angle 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.140
 should be kept as good as possible 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.430
 to the sound impressive on appeal space 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.260
 not to distort 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.150
 for the speakers you should 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.860
 side of the tv device a place 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.420
 Find 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.709
 if we already have optimal positions 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.510
 then you can talk about it too 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.129
 look that up 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.780
 even expensive speakers about 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.470
 head height in your ab production 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.239
 are located 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.280
 Now we come to the surround 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.560
 You should speak these if 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.870
 possible at an angle of 110 degrees to 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.250
 Head axis up over the surround 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.769
 channels receive the spatial 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.629
 Depth information moreover, the 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.790
 Rear channels like for effects 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.470
 not visible in the picture are used eg 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.240
 the classic a fly past of 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.280
 helicopter 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.290
 even if the exhibition with 110 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.210
 technically difficult 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.580
 you should try the position like that 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.530
 Good to keep it there because movies exactly 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.210
 mixed for this speaker position 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.370
 become 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.490
 last but not least the subwoofer at 5.1 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.160
 round off the system 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.190
 the subwoofer is 5.1 in truth 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.530
 low frequency effect short led and will 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.090
 also like an effect channel that handles 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.860
 means that from the front speakers 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.380
 basically the entire frequency range 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.720
 In addition, one has the led as 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.160
 effect channel to very low frequencies too 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.060
 support for example 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.550
 explosions 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.710
 It does not really matter where in the space view 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.000
 the lfp is because our hearing deep 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.770
 sounds can not locate 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.390
 in room corners you should still him 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.400
 do not set it up because it's out there 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.910
 acoustic reasons to strong tears 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.910
 can come 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.590
 the next section deals with this 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.890
 connect and cabling from 5.1 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.450
 systems first to the computer systems 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.709
 on the connection page of your mainboard 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.629
 in the pc you will find different 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.379
 possibilities to an audio signal 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.930
 transfer 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.400
 the first variant over toslink needed 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.650
 just a cable one so-called 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.409
 Optical fiber of digital audio 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.680
 translates therefore one transmits that 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.480
 entire 5.1 signal via a cable of 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.670
 second way also transfers 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.489
 digital audio signal over a cable 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.680
 with a digital coaxial cable 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.750
 your computer with the 5.1 system 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.030
 connect and the conventional analog 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.709
 way over the 3.5 millimeter latches 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.310
 cable works, of course, too 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.199
 very well 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.010
 you need three , though 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:28.419
 This cable for the transmission of 5.1 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.860
 let's stay with the analog solution 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.080
 almost every one of you on the mainboard 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.940
 you find the green connects 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.039
 marked front channels with the entrance 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.560
 on the subwoofer side of your system 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.389
 same procedure with the real channels 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.030
 in black and the combination of 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.039
 center and subwoofer in orange from 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.870
 Subwoofer you have now only the 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.030
 cable single speaker 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.490
 in the order in which they are here 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.560
 or listed on your device 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.090
 on the home entertainment page 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.130
 The wiring is usually over 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.139
 an av receiver of the channels 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.210
 divides increasingly and to the individual 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.950
 speaker sends in the case 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.680
 Do you connect your TV with the TV? 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.090
 5.1 receiver also here are the 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.460
 possibility of the optical fiber 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.410
 to insert or use rosling 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.090
 simply hdmi with it can be namely 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.330
 not just an image signal but also 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.800
 multi-channel sound wonderfully transmitted 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.050
 continue on the back of the av 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.970
 Receivers here wired the front 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.340
 channels left and right with those here 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.840
 marked outlets of the center will be in 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.580
 this example to the green socket 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.949
 connected and the surround channels 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.349
 left and right at the blue resp 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:33.940
 gray and speaker boxes the subwoofer 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.130
 usually has its own power supply 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.340
 and therefore gets the unreinforced 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.990
 Violet prix output to a blu ray 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.240
 player in the setup 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.360
 you wired this simply by hdmi 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.740
 with the tv device 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.150
 Finally, a few important words to 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.100
 establishment of a system 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.020
 on your computer, you have the driver 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.000
 call menu euro soundcard 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.580
 There you can have another speaker 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.210
 Select configuration from standard 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.410
 stereo to 5.1 speakers often offer 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.180
 the three but still possibilities 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.250
 room corrections for individual 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.490
 speaker to make the system 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.680
 individually adapt 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.479
 at home cinema, however, you have to with the 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.639
 remote control in the audio menu eures 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:20.409
 tv device navigate around there 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:22.509
 to expand stereophonic to multichannel sound 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.459
 further in the signal chain would have the 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:26.519
 input of your av receivers on the 

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:28.269
 set correct 5.1 signal 

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:31.209
 basically two are distinguished 

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:33.039
 proceed once dolby digital and dts 

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:34.779
 which procedure uses new film 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:37.599
 you can always find on the dvd or 

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:39.909
 blu-ray case allow many av receivers 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:42.879
 In addition, as on the pc room corrections 

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:44.439
 for individual speakers that would be 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:46.449
 now you can do your wish 

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:48.339
 insert film and in the disc mini nor the 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:49.929
 Select surround stream in one 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:52.209
 language of course powerful time 

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:55.539
 of course, and then it starts 

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:57.099
 fun in 5.1 friends of the true surround 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:58.989
 sounds that we would be back on 

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:00.429
 arrived at the end of today's episode 

00:06:58.989 --> 00:07:02.349
 I hope you have something again 

00:07:00.429 --> 00:07:03.969
 I can be happy about it 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:06.039
 criticize your comments and 

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:08.019
 theme suggestions still make happy
