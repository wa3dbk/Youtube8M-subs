the first time that Ford seemed alright
for<00:01:13.740> her<00:01:13.830> didn't<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.070> think<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.520> thought<00:01:14.850> so

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
too

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.330 
too
like<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.140> said<00:01:16.320> he<00:01:16.439> was<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> little<00:01:16.710> sulky<00:01:17.070> out

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
like you said he was a little sulky out

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.700 
like you said he was a little sulky out
of<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> gate<00:01:17.729> first<00:01:18.659> one<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.049> course<00:01:19.350> she's

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
of the gate first one on course she's

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.600 
of the gate first one on course she's
not<00:01:19.830> exactly<00:01:20.280> sure<00:01:20.520> how<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:20.880> gonna<00:01:21.000> ride<00:01:22.610> but

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
not exactly sure how it's gonna ride but

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.399 
not exactly sure how it's gonna ride but
I<00:01:23.640> thought<00:01:23.850> she<00:01:24.119> recovered<00:01:24.750> pretty<00:01:24.869> well<00:01:25.170> and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
I thought she recovered pretty well and

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.520 
I thought she recovered pretty well and
the<00:01:25.560> four<00:01:25.799> showed<00:01:26.369> up<00:01:26.549> nicely<00:01:26.759> yeah<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.720> agree

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the four showed up nicely yeah I agree

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.710 
the four showed up nicely yeah I agree
and<00:01:29.340> actually<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.180> know<00:01:30.240> now<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.509> looks<00:01:30.630> like

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
and actually you know now it looks like

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.940 
and actually you know now it looks like
she's<00:01:30.930> kind<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.439> groove<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
she's kind of in the groove and the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.590 
she's kind of in the groove and the
horse<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.159> paying<00:01:32.520> attention<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.060> think<00:01:33.090> again

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
horse is paying attention I think again

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.480 
horse is paying attention I think again
that<00:01:33.659> first<00:01:34.020> jump<00:01:34.320> right<00:01:34.650> away<00:01:34.829> from<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.280> gate

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that first jump right away from the gate

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.410 
that first jump right away from the gate
and<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.939> being<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.270> good<00:01:36.990> size<00:01:37.200> why<00:01:37.740> doc<00:01:37.979> sir

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
and a being a good size why doc sir

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.640 
and a being a good size why doc sir
knowing<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.570> first<00:01:39.810> line<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.229> forward<00:01:40.590> I

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
knowing that first line is forward I

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.899 
knowing that first line is forward I
think<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.040> sort<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.250> caught<00:01:41.460> both<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.820> them

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
think just sort of caught both of them

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.569 
think just sort of caught both of them
off<00:01:42.060> guard<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.659> little<00:01:43.470> bobble<00:01:43.979> there<00:01:44.100> at<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
off guard a little bobble there at the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.850 
off guard a little bobble there at the
wall<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.570> know<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.810> that's<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.320> very<00:01:46.619> very

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
this may be this right it looks like

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.179 
this may be this right it looks like
she's<00:02:01.570> maybe<00:02:01.750> liking<00:02:02.229> a<00:02:02.320> little<00:02:02.530> experience

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
she's maybe liking a little experience

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.520 
she's maybe liking a little experience
but<00:02:03.430> you<00:02:04.390> know<00:02:04.509> hopefully<00:02:04.720> she'll<00:02:05.140> come<00:02:05.170> back

Jacob hood the Swedish soccer and then

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.150 
Jacob hood the Swedish soccer and then
this<00:02:13.209> roll<00:02:13.540> back<00:02:13.750> here<00:02:13.959> obviously<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:15.040> know

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
this roll back here obviously you know

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.979 
this roll back here obviously you know
last<00:02:15.580> year<00:02:15.760> if<00:02:16.239> you<00:02:16.360> were<00:02:16.480> rotting<00:02:16.810> in<00:02:16.900> this

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
last year if you were rotting in this

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.510 
last year if you were rotting in this
final<00:02:17.319> you<00:02:17.410> would<00:02:17.560> take<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:17.860> inside<00:02:18.280> turn

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
final you would take the inside turn

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.910 
final you would take the inside turn
there<00:02:18.790> right<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.510> think<00:02:19.720> coming<00:02:20.530> out<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.830> that

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
there right I think coming out of that

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.320 
there right I think coming out of that
short<00:02:21.250> turn<00:02:21.459> there<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.880> kind<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.150> presents

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
short turn there it kind of presents

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.350 
short turn there it kind of presents
itself<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.170> do<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.410> inside<00:02:23.800> but<00:02:24.160> maybe<00:02:25.030> going

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
itself to do the inside but maybe going

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.270 
itself to do the inside but maybe going
first<00:02:25.660> she<00:02:25.900> wanted<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.530> take<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.800> safe<00:02:27.010> route

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
first she wanted to take the safe route

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.670 
first she wanted to take the safe route
she<00:02:27.730> had<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:27.849> little<00:02:28.739> tough<00:02:29.739> first<00:02:30.100> jump<00:02:31.680> just

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
she had a little tough first jump just

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.280 
she had a little tough first jump just
wants<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:32.980> get<00:02:33.100> around<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.489> think<00:02:33.900> but<00:02:34.900> ended

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
wants to get around to think but ended

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.039 
wants to get around to think but ended
nicely<00:02:35.910> yeah<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:36.940> mean<00:02:37.209> considering<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.840> way

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
nicely yeah I mean considering the way

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.630 
nicely yeah I mean considering the way
she<00:02:38.440> stopped<00:02:38.739> at<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.980> first<00:02:39.130> jump<00:02:39.459> but<00:02:39.580> you

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
she stopped at the first jump but you

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.340 
she stopped at the first jump but you
know<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:39.850> almost<00:02:39.970> made<00:02:40.269> you<00:02:40.420> think<00:02:40.630> that<00:02:40.750> you

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
know it almost made you think that you

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.990 
know it almost made you think that you
know<00:02:41.500> maybe<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.130> horse<00:02:42.310> wasn't<00:02:42.519> gonna<00:02:42.670> jump

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
know maybe the horse wasn't gonna jump

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.580 
know maybe the horse wasn't gonna jump
that<00:02:43.150> jump<00:02:43.420> but<00:02:43.600> actually<00:02:43.900> once<00:02:44.080> she<00:02:44.260> got<00:02:44.380> in

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
that jump but actually once she got in

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.500 
that jump but actually once she got in
gear<00:02:44.830> it<00:02:45.069> actually<00:02:45.459> was<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.610> solid<00:02:46.209> round<00:02:46.330> but

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
gear it actually was a solid round but

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.590 
gear it actually was a solid round but
just<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.750> little<00:02:46.959> bobble<00:02:47.140> at<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.440> wall
