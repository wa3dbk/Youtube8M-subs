00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
because I don't I don't think they've

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.319 
because I don't I don't think they've
done<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.130> right<00:00:35.280> thing<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.670> don't<00:00:35.730> think<00:00:35.969> they

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
done the right thing I don't think they

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.549

I think they made a poor decision during
the<00:00:39.899> military<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.410> agreeing<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> go<00:00:40.920> overseas

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
know when you agree to kill strangers

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.639
