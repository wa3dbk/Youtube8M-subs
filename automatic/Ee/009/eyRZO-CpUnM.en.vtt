00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.660
 tie to 2 between zaragoza and the 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.990
 valencia in a passionate match the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.610
 that was lived in the romareda a meeting 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.380
 in which the Aragonese painting got 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.140
 an advantage of two goals 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.760
 in fact he put the 2 to 0 in the 30 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.230
 of the first period but after the 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.180
 balance in the second part got 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.830
 equalizing the shock had started very 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.130
 ok things for the set of 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.310
 manolo jiménez 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.290
 with this 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.360
 cardboard maria for víctor ruiz and the 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.079
 relevant clear penalty on 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.079
 helder postiga 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.880
 would get to transform the goal worth 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.030
 maximum 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.890
 support in the 4 minute the zaragoza is 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.010
 presented the party with seven days 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.199
 consecutive without winning and started well 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.440
 his way to triumph though 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.969
 after 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.010
 I managed to restore the tie 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.410
 Ché opening frame with two goals 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.750
 jonas 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.740
 first part competed with a large 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.770
 opportunity 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.510
 by Jonas himself from his own 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.520
 jonas to put the one on one in this 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.390
 action in which I read Frank gets you 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.690
 block the ball by raising the arms 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.540
 more and better the Aragonese painting in the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.390
 first period 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.200
 and opportunities like this one from rochina 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.920
 he was 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.920
 very well 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.079
 rochina 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.070
 which was replaced in the second period 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.229
 but he made a very interesting match 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.690
 as a second point next to helder 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.590
 postiga 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:46.700
 and this would be the play from 2 to 0 was the 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.560
 minute 32 the zaragoza was put by 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.270
 ahead on the scoreboard and had that great 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.580
 opportunity to try to manage this 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.990
 advantage to finally find a 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.370
 triumph after seven days 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.550
 consecutive without winning but 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.700
 the party would be twisted especially in the 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.110
 second period in the first to 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.400
 try to cut distances for 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.680
 approaching the draw would mark 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.060
 the txingurri valverde team with 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.060
 this goal by jonas 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.410
 in minute 35 in fact 3 after 2 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.940
 to 0 cut distances jonas position 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.560
 anti-regulation by Roberto Soldado 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:28.069
 for a little bit but it seems to be 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.069
 advance soldier and that 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.859
 allows jonas to mark because the 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.180
 assistance is soldier although I could 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.889
 it seems that he does not touch the ball 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.319
 supposedly intervenes clearly in the 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:42.430
 action was wrong the referee of the hill 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.019
 big 2 to 1 for zaragoza daría 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.549
 by the end of the first period but 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.730
 still with bad news for the 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.379
 Aragonese painting the support injury that 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.469
 I could not enter the second 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:56.230
 period would enter estefan babovic for 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:58.180
 replace the name he had put 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.200
 1 to 0 had to retire injured 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.870
 of the match entered as we said for today 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.630
 in the second period and in the second 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:12.060
 part although zaragoza started very well 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:15.720
 scoring options with shots on goal 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.650
 in team che the one that would be able to equal 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.780
 the pair 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.130
 before 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.060
 from 2 to 2 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.910
 here the one who tries it is sissokó 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.210
 and this is the action of the second goal of 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.400
 valencia the second of jonas 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.610
 the fastest and at the second post the 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.500
 Brazilian manages to put the 2 to 2 that already 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.370
 it would be definitive on the scoreboard not what 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.370
 I celebrate the footballer of Valencia 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.370
 let's mark 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.050
 how 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.810
 it is evenly placed by the ball of 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.500
 VICTOR RUIZ TO THE SECOND BAD FOR JONAS 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.840
 It was 2 to 2 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.300
 mattia that reappeared four months 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.060
 after his injury 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.610
 had this very clear opportunity sending 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.020
 the ball to the crossbar and this would be a 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.819
 also very important play of 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.350
 hand match 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.920
 de leo franco takes him out of the game 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.920
 direct red 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.449
 with 10 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.449
 the zaragoza 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.280
 here we have clearly 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.729
 how he takes the ball with his hand had 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:39.169
 to get out of the field manolo jiménez 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:41.539
 josemari came on Pablo Alcolea goalie 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.220
 of 23 years of the second team that 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.440
 I would make my debut with the box 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.970
 Aragonese 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.430
 it would end up being important in the game 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.590
 because he took out a couple of hands very 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.990
 transcendent 2 to 2 were 10 minutes 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.990
 and see that hand of alcohol 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.040
 to avoid 2 to 3 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:06.150
 fantastic the goalkeeper 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.640
 from Zaragoza that had options to mark 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.220
 in fact the last of the party would end 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.630
 in goal but the referee would cancel it 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.630
 supposed lack 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.940
 read postiga in this way would end the 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.000
 party with the monumental anger of all 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.670
 the bench of Zaragoza in one action 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.430
 where you are very close to dialing is what 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.930
 you see later is the post and the one 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.450
 it just pushes the ball in the end 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.310
 distribution of points in the romareda 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.310
 zaragoza 2 valencia 2
