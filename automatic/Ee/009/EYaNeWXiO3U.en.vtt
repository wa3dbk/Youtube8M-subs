 goat cattle 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.470
 what will allow us about the limitations we have seen 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.150
 and thus contribute to improving our quality of life 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.150
 and bring a bit of sand last night region 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.320
 mumbrÃº 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.720
 the audiovisual course is divided into four blocks 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.720
 who have a total of fifteen classes on video 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.550
 the class we are looking at is the number one introduction 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.550
 with which each block begins 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.420
 and then we will develop the classes that are in accordance with the process 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.420
 productive that we make 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.480
 In each class we will talk about how to overcome the limitations we have in 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.480
 the management of goats 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.419
 all classes of the course will be seen and heard through the video 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.430
 with a simple and simple language that will allow us to quickly know what 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.430
 that we are taught 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.220
 For this, the participation of the trainers is fundamental 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.780
 who before starting each class 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.309
 will talk with the course participants 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:12.309
 to agree on the subject 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:16.939
 after seeing each class we will talk again with the trainer 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.389
 to discuss and study our primer on the subject 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.760
 all participants will be given a booklet like this one 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.269
 thonn we will find is that if it develops 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:33.909
 at the end of the audiovisual class 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.209
 we study the primer and we will talk with the cava 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.709
 to perform a field practice 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:42.929
 this practice 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:45.929
 We will do it trying to involve the whole family 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.679
 It is important that we know although many topics to be dealt with in this course are 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:57.739
 interesting for us 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.129
 If we take this irresponsibility seriously, we will be 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.299
 making the most of our time 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.299
 and thus be able to improve the family economy 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.450
 in this way we can teach family and neighbors what we have 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:13.919
