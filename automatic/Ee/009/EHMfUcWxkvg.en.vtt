00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.339
 even wealthy people 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.660
 no clue about this already available on 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.519
 technological on you nothing at all 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.080
 Sharila according to Stelevich choose which 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.610
 broken in such a classic after 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:20.960
 you start driving and be confident bitches in 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:24.660
 car connect my mercedes luxury 500 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.840
 turned out to be like a tractor now we are 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.849
 in the most modern car probably 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.439
 which is tesla at the moment 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.640
 model s 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.320
 The owner of this car is Gennady 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.650
 balashov 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.120
 agreed to tell us about the experience 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.800
 use this car 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.960
 about the experience of using in Ukraine 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.960
 the main difference of this car is 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.140
 that there is no standard engine in it 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.269
 petrol and diesel this car 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.940
 fully powered by batteries but also 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.519
 such acceleration right now us sting seat 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.449
 43 to a hundred i.e. it is electric 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.449
 sport car 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.350
 and the most important thing that goes absolutely quiet 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:15.030
 such a completely different driving style from 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:18.690
 after him my mercedes luxury 500 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.690
 turned out to be a tractor 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.119
 I have it all interesting ride here 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.219
 this here acceleration how do you charge i 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.490
 I come to the garage and 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:34.380
 what I have is a small station 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.670
 from ready sockets just charging because 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.790
 220 outlets every morning to execute 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.940
 purchase 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:48.830
 and on profitability how much but I spend on 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:52.000
 full tank 7373 he's full tank it's almost 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.000
 400 kilometers 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.659
 400 kilometers 70 but I think that 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.800
 if I stop somewhere I will ask 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.140
 connect nobody even so to 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.210
 gas stations did not try to charge 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.399
 do ours over if indecent on 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.310
 refueling the hand on the dance and drive on 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.700
 sometimes i want rotated but my hands 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.670
 then I don’t turn that future 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.740
 there are no gas stations if they are petrol 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.850
 refueling will be here near the advertising 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.110
 we can be at the pole 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.290
 Norway went through this way 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.570
 provides everywhere free 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.670
 Carried there for sales number one as well 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.880
 like norway they have the most oil 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.080
 decided to abandon oil at all 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.530
 only decided to sell 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.510
 you do not pollute the atmosphere and 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.220
 now they have the opposite privilege 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.110
 electric cars tesla or friend 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.690
 electric vehicles have special parking 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.200
 on which for becoming 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.590
 gasoline 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.709
 There is no service in Ukraine because here 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:01.090
 nothing will be here if you hit 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:04.019
 we will dress in the usual workshop 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.599
 the woods that feature it all aluminum 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:10.300
 stainless therefore well as complexity with 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:13.180
 aluminum motor judging by sat down 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.180
 impossible that 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.359
 electric motors if comparative 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.680
 engine then gasoline engine 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:27.030
 505 10 something rubbing the parts of their tesla 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.200
 270 was a shame there again come alive at both 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.840
 3-liter money or a lot on 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.280
 customs pay 20 percent windows 8 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.719
 percent duty to protect 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.090
 domestic producer 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:40.810
 20 percent understandable you bring 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.909
 pay because therefore and why in 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.579
 general taxation in Ukraine anus 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:47.379
 scales and plus 35 percent at 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.810
 registration as a three-liter 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.489
 gasoline engine 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.319
 pension fund nobody cares what 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.989
 the engine is not there i am more interested 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.480
 from rich people here to me leader 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.169
 so much tax or retirement tax 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.819
 fund 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.889
 so Islam Ukraine costs a lot 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.919
 expensive if the car costs about a hundred 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.130
 thousand dollars to us plus seven percent 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:10.160
 tax 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.460
 from sales and writing works too 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.960
 This Ukraine after growth can and he already 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.019
 worth 135.000 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.350
 so beggars should pay 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.870
 more than richer cabri Americans need it 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.660
 understand how far the state is robbery on 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.790
 our level is waiting for what is here 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.250
 there will be something done like a test not 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.530
 when you slept and will be made in 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.000
 strangled tax places over the river 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.340
 rest on tweet she brakes 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.810
 when I'm not on the brake press recovery 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.630
 train recharges here goes this 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.460
 operation and driving style leg 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.560
 your changing you practically don't push 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.010
 at the stern on self stops one 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.200
 pedals 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.860
 yeah its all the time on the swing do you want 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:05:00.220
 pedals are driving and when you 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.220
 it is necessary to show the master's sneakers 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.839
 here the computer recount and sat down 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:07.559
 a lot of energy consumption or courtyard 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:09.610
 and a lot of air conditioners work 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:13.389
 recounts how much I have to go 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.979
 until the end there is now 366 . 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.809
 for yourself on very much sparing mode 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:21.419
 can and 500 pulled if 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:24.689
 I want to barely accelerate then save 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:27.520
 here we have such a card 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:29.580
 besides we have here an outlet in 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.580
 the Internet 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.690
 as a normal computer passed height 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.790
 the peasant 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:47.660
 speaking of 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:50.660
 Chinese and I stand like this or not 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.660
 aceh 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:59.780
 I have it from the electric vehicle well beyond 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.460
 the question is like because most of it even 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.390
 wealthy people have no idea about 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.490
 this is technologically available on you 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.640
 although many presentations took place but 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.760
 and 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.350
 pump up goes more with me so 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.870
 even if they released me than abel 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:18.250
 to break 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.250
 in this classic sense 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:25.319
 very pleasant sound that remind 

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:26.999
 that you need to buckle up well 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.069
 I don’t want to introduce myself 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:34.110
 start driving and be confident judge 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:38.269
 the machine is not connected to accelerate properly 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.269
 that moment when you have this beauty
