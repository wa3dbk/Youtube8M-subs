00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.029
 nine boys here we are back with a new one 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.529
 blog as I promised you where 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.270
 I will answer your questions but 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.610
 much more will happen 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.779
 then let's start immediately with the news of the 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.060
 week 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.450
 then how surely you will have Christ 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.079
 now google is trying to aggregate 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.390
 to youtube and google plus more and more 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.760
 so google class is also becoming 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.309
 a fairly useful tool and must 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.760
 to have it for example for example if you want 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.309
 comment on videos so I wanted to 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.379
 advise you to add me on google 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.600

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.260

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.539
 did 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:42.079
 ok let's proceed then it's the latest news 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:44.450
 of the week was also to blogs 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.289
 now I have decided to add one as well 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.390
 ranking of the best fans a 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.560
 true of those who followed me of 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.329
 more this week and then 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.060
 let's see who the winners are 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:01.020
 giving more follow-up by leaving me 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.869
 like comments and robs entered and then the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.880
 first is lorenzo go compliments because 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.450
 you have been the number one 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.480
 then there is black tac compliments to you too 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.590
 and finally there is peter say it compliments 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.510
 to all three 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.340
 so if you want to scale this 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.800
 ranking remember that leave 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.440
 a large number of thumbs up like that already 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.410
 what do you think then we pass to the questions 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.140
 today then the first question to do 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.380
 feeling of 300 and asks us how many 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.430
 question to the puppets you sleep with if yes 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:42.330
 you show us the name ecdc then am 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:45.690
 see stu crazy this is what appears a 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.120
 name we could call it we could 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.860
 call it broglino never too classic and 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.330
 behind the nein 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.370
 I would say more gold and droid could 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.680
 be droid times even though it warns you as well 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.750
 grid droid 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:13.950
 yes my concept already mentioned between us is 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:17.430
 bad what does he founded does it happen 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:22.969
 concerned if an iphone samsung do 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:25.469
 sex what probably comes out of an iphone 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:28.109
 iphone 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:30.840
 antonello carta asks us ok but sorry 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:36.239
 this I have to read it well there is a tic e 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:41.609
 never knows if you have iphone in focus or 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:44.969
 o chicken fa was today sorry does not come well 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:47.489
 clear this question but I read fire and 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:51.209
 iphone so we pass immediately 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.219
 next time we lost it asks us 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.590
 this is not what a real banishment created 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:58.169
 the channel to how many subscribers bet ok 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.120
 finally a serious lavender indeed 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:04.290
 is he asked matteo piece will have us 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.419
 thought before doing ok actually is 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.970
 when they created the channel let's say 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:10.530
 that more than to the writings I pointed to 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.720
 show you arrive after they are 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.099
 noticed that undoubtedly they are a lot 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.720
 better than subscribers 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.639
 views because i 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.739
 visualizations are just one thing there 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.039
 just views you do nothing 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.289
 that is, the members are those 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:28.409
 that fill the heart says no and 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.810
 youtube and not enrolled in no piÃ  

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:33.270
 presence continue making videos then 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.370
 actually I was really wrong because 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.099
 members are much more important and 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.979
 I love each of you give me a 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:42.900
 hug from tender embrace 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:45.479
 ok we finished the questions then 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.669
 we pass in the contest during the 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.349
 last week at least two dresses 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.720
 in this way he wrote on this sheet 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.550
 gold surely the virtus arrived already 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.349
 all since I got one 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.750
 avalanche of comments I wrote with 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:59.970
 just gold although jailed said that 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.639
 It needed only the first convent 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.500
 would have won instead do not want 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:08.639
 we write 300 thousand euros to the parma 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.889
 ok anyway the contest was won 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.469
 by aliberti who wrote it first 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.960
 compliments of course also in this 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:18.570
 video a contest is present then you will have to 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.620
 guess what the object is to mine 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.560
 shoulders 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.110
 disappears almost in one 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.810
 moment in a video question we see 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.479
 whoever succeeds is the first who will write the 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.490
 word will be quoted in the next video 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.409
 But I want to change the rules 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.860
 leave the two comments 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:39.930
 1 co written the object that disappears 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.479
 behind my back and the second 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.760
 comment must be a question one 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.210
 time in question if you do not do these 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.050
 what's this 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.719
 I'll have to mention the name of the person 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.529
 Next he will have performed these two 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.849
 steps 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:57.000
 so we lived a little one 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:59.760
 change then unfortunately also today 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.089
 we have reached the end of this video 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.770
 let me know how more he said if you 

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:06.750
 would like this race to open i 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.870
 packages during blogs and so on 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.150
 begin as early as next 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.339
 coming weeks and me too 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.830
 really would like that 

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:19.770
 leave a nice thumb up if you want 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.180
 that blogs with those less and leave 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.830
 lots of comments 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.230
 ask me other questions that could 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.880
 finish in the classic blog and sign up 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.470
 to the channel if you are not yet registered e 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.070
 as usual we'll see each other 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.070
 video
