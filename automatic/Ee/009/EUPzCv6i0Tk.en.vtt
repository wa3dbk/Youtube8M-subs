00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
which is actually not really that much

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.519 
which is actually not really that much
needed<00:00:23.279> because<00:00:24.240> if<00:00:24.510> you're<00:00:24.660> running<00:00:24.840> low<00:00:25.230> on

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
needed because if you're running low on

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.859 
needed because if you're running low on
money<00:00:27.650> so<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.950> lot<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.670> these<00:00:29.880> irons<00:00:30.270> only<00:00:30.600> work

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
money so a lot of these irons only work

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.619 
money so a lot of these irons only work
is<00:00:31.140> your<00:00:31.350> members<00:00:31.890> but<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.970> can<00:00:33.150> also<00:00:33.330> get

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
is your members but you can also get

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.400 
is your members but you can also get
stuff<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.140> carry<00:00:35.210> so<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.480> has<00:00:36.510> an<00:00:36.900> absolute<00:00:37.320> in

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
stuff to carry so it has an absolute in

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.819 
stuff to carry so it has an absolute in
bed<00:00:37.820> but<00:00:38.820> remember

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.670 

so

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:01:10.969 

the<00:00:48.490> difference<00:00:48.910> like<00:01:07.830> they<00:01:08.830> paint<00:01:09.190> a<00:01:09.340> large

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the difference like they paint a large

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.160 
the difference like they paint a large
this<00:01:11.979> is<00:01:12.190> basically<00:01:12.640> it's<00:01:13.600> basically

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
this is basically it's basically

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.020 
this is basically it's basically
cheating<00:01:14.650> but<00:01:14.800> it's<00:01:14.920> basically<00:01:15.100> not<00:01:15.729> cheap

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
cheating but it's basically not cheap

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.900 
cheating but it's basically not cheap
because<00:01:16.900> even<00:01:17.800> though<00:01:17.979> you're<00:01:18.310> getting<00:01:18.580> free

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
because even though you're getting free

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.210 
because even though you're getting free
item<00:01:20.640> doesn't<00:01:21.640> actually<00:01:22.180> mean<00:01:23.110> you<00:01:23.950> CD

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
item doesn't actually mean you CD

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.120 
item doesn't actually mean you CD
because<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:26.080> still<00:01:26.380> at<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.590> piece<00:01:26.770> of<00:01:26.920> gear

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
because you still at the piece of gear

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.300 
because you still at the piece of gear
I'll<00:01:27.520> bring<00:01:27.729> with<00:01:27.910> money<00:01:28.800> so<00:01:29.800> it<00:01:29.860> was<00:01:29.950> cheating

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
I'll bring with money so it was cheating

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.710 
I'll bring with money so it was cheating
you're<00:01:30.399> not<00:01:30.430> cheating<00:01:30.759> so<00:01:31.060> what<00:01:31.600> do<00:01:31.660> you
