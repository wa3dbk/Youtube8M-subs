00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.050
 hello everyone i'm back 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.890
 today to show you how I 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.590
 dry my hair 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.520
 I also have it happen a little bit their 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.690
 like video but I do like a 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.910
 half method 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.080
 what I use is a lot but 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.849
 must a ping has grown and you will be 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.499
 explained in his choices of course 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.570
 since I also find who is 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.740
 interesting at the level of a drying like 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.769
 that's it can be a super 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.340
 good base for self curling hair 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.680
 were wearing them right or doing a 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.830
 more elaborate hairstyle so if you are 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.660
 interested in canteen seals 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.660
 would have facts 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.210
 so I'm now waiting for the shower 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.840
 so sure but I will make life I put 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.110
 a charge protector then I put 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.240
 also a cutting edge protector 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.800
 but for now it's all because 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.020
 I use a new field dots then 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.600
 I want to see how much the ranks of 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.000
 shiny hair 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.670
 so here I see just buy a little bit of 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.429
 protector of remedies because the other 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.619
 that I was using a film scatter a little 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:20.159
 less well since I have very hair 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:23.270
 precise who is that former engineer and 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.270
 generous ya on it 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:34.920
 and on the point that I joined so 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.720
 always with my little spread 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.950
 quality that hair is everywhere I 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.880
 will explain it to you before leaving 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.090
 because that's my character 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.500
 henry what woman am I going to use a 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.150
 country in great sometimes did I wanted 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.400
 just but must also but with the pen 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.690
 grew up fast whether it's 3.2 me do 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.260
 major for wet hair 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.090
 then I just want stunned by penalties 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.250
 like that to work failed to avoid 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.500
 that my natural curls emerge from 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:05.960
 my hair and then I just want 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.960
 dried like that my hair at the congress 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.160
 so go on what I have to do is that 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.940
 I really focused on the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.760
 hair root 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.040
 a sent to my side on one side as much 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.890
 like water so if I wear my 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.170
 Fringe this side I just want 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.010
 to say put the shoots on the other side 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.570
 to dry in that sense it will give more 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.040
 volume so we want if you miss 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.420
 volume it's a good thing I had 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.810
 still a lot naturally but 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.930
 good it makes more volume 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.310
 our first day at the very least 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.940
 so now take this step there 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.920
 what I 'm going to do is that my 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.500
 roots are almost dry the pot 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.440
 complete contempt is so now I 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.880
 will focus on lengths in 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.350
 doing several floors depending on 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.880
 more or less thick air 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.910
 depending on the thickness of 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.800
 butcher and I'm going to use a brush 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.959
 round for those who would ask 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.660
 this one and ceramic 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.730
 I prefer that to success we fear because 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.590
 that I find it dry and shoote 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.850
 much faster so note the 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.190
 ceramic heats up all that makes a 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.510
 effect of the simple how to do that 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.709
 this is from scoop the range is it what 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.930
 is really put what is a button 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.360
 tip make up the rank hairs since they 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.769
 were really easy to clean so 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.320
 we can remove all the hair that 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.320
 are taken so I have to me but I 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.880
 advise you we did that so made there 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.450
 in thirty-five men failed as 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.030
 it can converse in languages ​​in 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.640
 metal 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.739
 the tip of the dryer the green in the direction 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.750
 cabbage actually podensac weight in 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.100
 the same meaning as the hair that goes from 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.489
 self of hair scales of happy 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.489
 it's going as follows 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.419
 so 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.620
 because I use the Breton how we 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.780
 to dry my hair but that I 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.489
 friezes thereafter with a curling iron 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.350
 I do not necessarily go on 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.360
 using the brush to make a 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.889
 true brushing itself 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.630
 what I'm doing is at this stage 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.330
 the as you saw it's still 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.889
 fast enough to dry my hair 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.449
 especially when the root is already almost 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.729
 a century is that I simply want 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.470
 disgusts me like that back I'm going 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.050
 to pass a geyser of sugar really 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.389
 make sure to remove the rest of the 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.789
 mythical mini if ​​you want between each 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.830
 floor of hair we can put that the 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.660
 temperature of the cold dryer and at this 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.800
 moment places that still have 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.199
 humidity in the choices will bring 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.000
 colder to the touch no you go the 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.009
 feel I'm focused on this place 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.590
 there to properly dry the hair for 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.949
 to avoid doing it a damage then 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.949
 we continue 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.560
 anguished cars final 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.130
 things that I can do with a 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.759
 base like that of this simply 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.560
 come to spend a fair play at the base at 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:47.440
 places where the hair as below 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.310
 are maybe a little more warm gray and 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.800
 otherwise I can come to draw the lengths 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:58.080
 we gave a nice effect their 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.880
 more complex blow-dry but in the background 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.800
 it is preserved at the drying to 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.389
 give volume to the root little 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.789
 appreciated we can really use the 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:09.520
 way we want or even it can be 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:11.289
 a good base for bathers 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.880
 back up so I hope you have 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:14.169
 liked the video if you have any questions 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.660
 or comments do not hesitate to them 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:17.949
 post in death down and on this I 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.970
