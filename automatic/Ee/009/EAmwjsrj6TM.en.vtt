00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
really gets going this season a lot of

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.050 
really gets going this season a lot of
the<00:01:43.259> teams<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.740> mean<00:01:43.770> they<00:01:43.950> saw<00:01:44.189> how<00:01:44.430> close<00:01:44.850> it

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
the teams I mean they saw how close it

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.609 
the teams I mean they saw how close it
was<00:01:45.090> last<00:01:45.509> season<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.049> pro<00:01:46.290> league<00:01:46.439> was<00:01:46.590> a

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
was last season the pro league was a

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.700 
was last season the pro league was a
ridiculously<00:01:47.399> close<00:01:47.610> last<00:01:48.000> season<00:01:48.409> and<00:01:49.409> so

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
ridiculously close last season and so

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.069 
ridiculously close last season and so
this<00:01:50.369> season<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.880> lot<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.149> them<00:01:51.210> are<00:01:51.420> playing

he's gone for a nine pool with some
speed<00:03:03.120> upgrade<00:03:03.930> he's<00:03:04.019> gonna<00:03:04.200> try<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.590> mine

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
speed upgrade he's gonna try and mine

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.620 
speed upgrade he's gonna try and mine
out<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.130> come<00:03:05.670> in<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.940> back<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.360> storage

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
out and come in the back of storage

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.030 
out and come in the back of storage
space<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:07.319> would<00:03:07.560> be<00:03:07.590> absolutely

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
space this would be absolutely

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.550 
space this would be absolutely
devastating<00:03:08.970> if<00:03:09.120> stork<00:03:09.660> had<00:03:09.810> gone<00:03:09.989> for<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.319> fast

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
devastating if stork had gone for a fast

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.110 
devastating if stork had gone for a fast
expansion<00:03:10.950> build<00:03:11.250> but<00:03:11.430> as<00:03:11.519> a<00:03:11.550> complete

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
expansion build but as a complete

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.870 
expansion build but as a complete
coincidence<00:03:12.860> stork<00:03:13.860> maybe<00:03:14.190> he's<00:03:14.370> expecting

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
coincidence stork maybe he's expecting

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.670 
coincidence stork maybe he's expecting
something<00:03:15.060> like<00:03:15.269> this<00:03:15.390> I<00:03:15.540> have<00:03:15.630> no<00:03:15.750> idea<00:03:15.870> he

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
something like this I have no idea he

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.039 
something like this I have no idea he
has<00:03:16.829> gone<00:03:17.040> for<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.400> gateway<00:03:17.970> build<00:03:18.239> instead<00:03:18.959> of

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
has gone for a gateway build instead of

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.590 
has gone for a gateway build instead of
a<00:03:19.260> forged<00:03:19.920> build<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.459> so<00:03:20.760> look<00:03:21.090> at<00:03:21.180> this<00:03:21.209> for

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
a forged build and so look at this for

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.960 
a forged build and so look at this for
drones<00:03:21.930> on<00:03:22.110> minerals<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:23.489> five<00:03:23.730> drones

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
drones on minerals and the five drones

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.670 
drones on minerals and the five drones
are<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.269> few<00:03:24.780> money<00:03:24.959> guys<00:03:25.170> he's<00:03:25.350> probably<00:03:25.410> gonna

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
are a few money guys he's probably gonna

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.910 
are a few money guys he's probably gonna
get<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:26.100> enough<00:03:26.220> minerals<00:03:26.549> for<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:28.380> up<00:03:28.650> and

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
going straight to a cybernetics core

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.539 
going straight to a cybernetics core
though<00:03:31.140> so<00:03:31.350> hopefully<00:03:31.709> he's<00:03:32.070> gonna<00:03:32.160> get<00:03:32.400> some

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
though so hopefully he's gonna get some

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:33.770 
though so hopefully he's gonna get some
zealots<00:03:32.760> out<00:03:32.940> otherwise<00:03:33.209> he's<00:03:33.450> going<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.660> be

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
zealots out otherwise he's going to be

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.370 
zealots out otherwise he's going to be
in<00:03:33.870> trouble<00:03:34.140> here<00:03:35.120> yeah<00:03:36.120> by<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.660> way<00:03:36.840> yet<00:03:37.200> it's

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
in trouble here yeah by the way yet it's

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.870 
in trouble here yeah by the way yet it's
a<00:03:37.470> very<00:03:37.650> thick<00:03:37.920> mineral<00:03:38.250> patch<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.640> takes<00:03:38.790> a

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
a very thick mineral patch it takes a

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.940 
a very thick mineral patch it takes a
long<00:03:39.000> time<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.299> eat<00:03:39.630> through<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.110> I'm<00:03:40.620> not

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
long time to eat through it I'm not

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.229 
long time to eat through it I'm not
exactly<00:03:41.220> sure<00:03:41.400> what<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.730> deal<00:03:41.850> is<00:03:41.910> with<00:03:42.060> that

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
exactly sure what the deal is with that

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.780 
exactly sure what the deal is with that
but<00:03:42.570> uh<00:03:42.650> it's<00:03:43.650> more<00:03:43.890> of<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:44.010> time<00:03:44.280> thing<00:03:44.519> so<00:03:44.700> you

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
but uh it's more of a time thing so you

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.759 
but uh it's more of a time thing so you
can't<00:03:45.030> just<00:03:45.150> sneak<00:03:45.299> up<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.630> really<00:03:46.470> quickly

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
can't just sneak up and really quickly

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.910 
can't just sneak up and really quickly

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
that that was being mined probably he

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.740 
that that was being mined probably he
might<00:03:57.690> notice<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.109> Jesus<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:59.390> hope<00:04:00.390> he's<00:04:00.600> not

to get completely caught off guard by
these<00:04:07.320> zerglings<00:04:07.799> this<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.489> absolutely

these zerglings this is absolutely

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.930 
these zerglings this is absolutely
ridiculous<00:04:08.880> built<00:04:09.570> by<00:04:09.750> both<00:04:09.989> players<00:04:10.290> and

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
ridiculous built by both players and

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.069 
ridiculous built by both players and
it's<00:04:11.940> just<00:04:12.120> a<00:04:12.180> kind<00:04:12.299> of<00:04:12.390> coincidence<00:04:12.870> the

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
it's just a kind of coincidence the

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.300 
it's just a kind of coincidence the
stork<00:04:13.350> might<00:04:13.590> be<00:04:13.739> able<00:04:13.799> to<00:04:13.920> hold<00:04:14.040> this<00:04:14.160> off

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
stork might be able to hold this off

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.770 
stork might be able to hold this off
after<00:04:14.579> all<00:04:14.670> he<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:14.820> going<00:04:15.090> for<00:04:15.299> a<00:04:15.329> tech<00:04:15.540> build

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
after all he is going for a tech build

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.319 
after all he is going for a tech build
he's<00:04:15.900> got<00:04:16.049> that<00:04:16.340> Stargate<00:04:17.340> up<00:04:17.459> already<00:04:17.940> so<00:04:18.030> he

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
he's got that Stargate up already so he

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.640 
he's got that Stargate up already so he
was<00:04:18.450> going<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:18.660> try<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:18.870> do<00:04:19.019> some<00:04:19.169> very<00:04:19.470> very

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
was going to try and do some very very

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.909 
was going to try and do some very very
early<00:04:19.919> harassment<00:04:21.080> it<00:04:22.080> with<00:04:22.289> Corsairs<00:04:22.770> I

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
early harassment it with Corsairs I

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.740 
early harassment it with Corsairs I
imagine

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
imagine

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.270 
imagine
so<00:04:25.080> with<00:04:25.380> luckily<00:04:25.680> he<00:04:25.770> does<00:04:25.980> have<00:04:26.160> that

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
so with luckily he does have that

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.330 
so with luckily he does have that
gateway<00:04:26.520> out<00:04:26.700> earlier<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:28.190> looks<00:04:29.190> like

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
gateway out earlier and looks like

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.520 
gateway out earlier and looks like
luxury<00:04:29.550> he<00:04:30.300> saw<00:04:30.600> with<00:04:30.720> his<00:04:30.780> ol<00:04:30.960> or<00:04:31.170> that<00:04:31.320> stork

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
luxury he saw with his ol or that stork

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.720 
luxury he saw with his ol or that stork
didn't<00:04:31.740> even<00:04:31.890> have<00:04:32.040> that<00:04:32.160> front<00:04:32.430> door<00:04:32.580> and

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
didn't even have that front door and

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.760 
didn't even have that front door and
just<00:04:32.850> run<00:04:33.030> a<00:04:33.060> zergling<00:04:33.840> Xin<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.110> front<00:04:34.350> so

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
just run a zergling Xin the front so

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.050 
just run a zergling Xin the front so
stork<00:04:35.100> is<00:04:35.220> probably<00:04:35.580> going<00:04:35.700> to<00:04:35.790> be<00:04:35.850> able<00:04:35.910> to

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
stork is probably going to be able to

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.430 
stork is probably going to be able to
hold<00:04:36.150> this<00:04:36.300> off<00:04:36.480> pretty<00:04:36.720> decently<00:04:37.080> he's<00:04:37.230> got<00:04:37.410> a

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
hold this off pretty decently he's got a

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.380 
hold this off pretty decently he's got a
few<00:04:37.680> probes<00:04:38.040> running<00:04:38.400> around<00:04:38.580> now<00:04:38.730> and<00:04:39.060> whoa

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
few probes running around now and whoa

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.510 
few probes running around now and whoa
that<00:04:39.420> your<00:04:39.780> gun<00:04:39.930> came<00:04:40.710> very<00:04:40.860> close<00:04:41.070> to<00:04:41.160> getting

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
that your gun came very close to getting

dragoon<00:04:46.020> they're<00:04:46.530> very<00:04:46.920> very<00:04:47.190> dangerous<00:04:47.730> they

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
dragoon they're very very dangerous they

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.210 
dragoon they're very very dangerous they
can<00:04:48.300> kill<00:04:49.020> off<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.170> Jupiter<00:04:49.890> going<00:04:50.040> very

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
can kill off the Jupiter going very

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.660 
can kill off the Jupiter going very
quickly<00:04:50.570> so<00:04:51.570> a<00:04:52.170> very<00:04:52.560> nice<00:04:52.860> move<00:04:53.070> making<00:04:53.400> that

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
quickly so a very nice move making that

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.400 
quickly so a very nice move making that
wall<00:04:53.970> of<00:04:54.240> zealots<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.350> will<00:04:56.220> aid<00:04:56.430> zealot<00:04:56.820> and
