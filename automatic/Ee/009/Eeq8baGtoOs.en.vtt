00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
different Galapagos Islands so we're

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.380

can come up with some concrete data that

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.979 
can come up with some concrete data that
give<00:02:52.920> us<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.220> an<00:02:53.580> understanding<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.480> how<00:02:54.660> well
