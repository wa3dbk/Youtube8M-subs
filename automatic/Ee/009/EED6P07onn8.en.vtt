you're going to want to purchase a
separate<00:01:49.710> jar<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.130> looks<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:50.549> like<00:01:50.759> this

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
separate jar it looks just like this

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.630 
separate jar it looks just like this
it's<00:01:51.899> around<00:01:52.170> 100<00:01:52.380> dollars<00:01:52.890> extra<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.610> you

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
it's around 100 dollars extra so you

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.249 
it's around 100 dollars extra so you
will<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:54.000> paying<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.360> little<00:01:54.509> more<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.110> this

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
will be paying a little more to do this

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.050 
will be paying a little more to do this
particular<00:01:55.439> function<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> machine<00:01:56.820> but

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
particular function in the machine but

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.569 
particular function in the machine but
it's<00:01:57.869> got<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> different<00:01:58.500> different<00:01:59.040> jar

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
it's got a different different jar

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.399 
it's got a different different jar
design<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.299> different<00:02:00.630> blade<00:02:00.840> design<00:02:01.229> and

design and a different blade design and
it<00:02:01.500> works<00:02:01.710> really<00:02:02.009> well<00:02:02.280> for<00:02:02.340> these<00:02:02.759> grains<00:02:03.090> so

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
it works really well for these grains so

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.999 
it works really well for these grains so
that's<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.750> one<00:02:03.930> we're<00:02:04.110> going<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.409> be<00:02:04.590> using

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
I'm going to use the high speed to do

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.350 
I'm going to use the high speed to do
the<00:02:45.989> grinding<00:02:46.410> now<00:02:47.129> how<00:02:47.400> long<00:02:47.459> we<00:02:48.000> run<00:02:48.209> this

the grinding now how long we run this
test<00:02:48.599> is<00:02:48.840> completely<00:02:49.379> up<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.560> us<00:02:49.709> depending<00:02:50.310> on

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
test is completely up to us depending on

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.250 
test is completely up to us depending on
how<00:02:50.550> fine<00:02:50.790> or<00:02:51.030> coarse<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.390> want<00:02:51.780> your<00:02:51.959> flour

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
how fine or coarse you want your flour

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.949 
how fine or coarse you want your flour
that<00:02:52.980> will<00:02:53.280> depend<00:02:53.700> on<00:02:54.060> how<00:02:54.209> long<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.660> let<00:02:54.840> it

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
that will depend on how long you let it

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.900 
that will depend on how long you let it
run<00:02:55.140> obviously<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.739> longer<00:02:56.069> runs<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.640> finer

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
run obviously the longer runs the finer

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.420 
run obviously the longer runs the finer
the<00:02:57.000> flour<00:02:57.360> will<00:02:57.629> get<00:02:57.840> this<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.890> completely

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
the flour will get this is a completely

the flour will get this is a completely
arbitrary<00:02:59.670> test<00:03:00.300> we<00:03:00.480> could<00:03:00.629> run<00:03:00.840> 15<00:03:01.319> seconds

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
arbitrary test we could run 15 seconds

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.559 
arbitrary test we could run 15 seconds
or<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> three-minute<00:03:02.550> test<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:02.940> doesn't<00:03:03.150> matter

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
or a three-minute test it doesn't matter

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.930 
or a three-minute test it doesn't matter
the<00:03:04.230> Blendtec<00:03:04.650> however<00:03:05.220> when<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.459> use<00:03:05.489> the

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
the Blendtec however when you use the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.180 
the Blendtec however when you use the
manual<00:03:06.390> speeds<00:03:06.720> will<00:03:07.140> shut<00:03:07.470> itself<00:03:07.769> off<00:03:07.980> after

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
manual speeds will shut itself off after

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.210 
manual speeds will shut itself off after
50<00:03:08.790> seconds<00:03:09.239> so<00:03:09.390> we'll<00:03:09.569> just<00:03:09.780> use<00:03:10.050> that<00:03:10.319> as<00:03:10.560> our

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
50 seconds so we'll just use that as our

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.729 
50 seconds so we'll just use that as our
arbitrary<00:03:11.819> time<00:03:12.510> for<00:03:12.840> this<00:03:12.959> particular<00:03:13.260> test

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
it stops and shuts itself off we'll run

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.729 
it stops and shuts itself off we'll run
the<00:03:20.909> Vitamix<00:03:21.360> for<00:03:21.540> 50<00:03:21.810> seconds<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.409> then<00:03:22.560> we

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
the Vitamix for 50 seconds and then we

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.399 
the Vitamix for 50 seconds and then we
will<00:03:22.890> compare<00:03:23.129> the<00:03:23.430> two<00:03:23.610> flours<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:25.140> see

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
will compare the two flours to see

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.280 
will compare the two flours to see
exactly<00:03:25.860> how<00:03:26.069> both<00:03:26.400> machines<00:03:26.819> worked<00:03:27.290> here's

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
exactly how both machines worked here's

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.750 
exactly how both machines worked here's
the<00:03:28.530> back<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.040> Blendtec<00:03:29.459> we'll<00:03:29.610> go<00:03:29.700> to

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
the back of the Blendtec we'll go to

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.550 
the back of the Blendtec we'll go to
speed<00:03:30.000> 10

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:04:19.440 

you

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.050 

and<00:04:20.450> now<00:04:21.170> the<00:04:21.230> Vitamix<00:04:21.829> will<00:04:22.010> put<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.790> same

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
and now the Vitamix will put the same

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.909 
and now the Vitamix will put the same
amount<00:04:23.210> one<00:04:23.630> cup<00:04:24.550> of<00:04:25.550> brown<00:04:25.850> rice<00:04:26.180> into<00:04:26.900> it

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.480 

we'll<00:04:30.919> go<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.130> speed<00:04:31.430> 10<00:04:31.700> for<00:04:31.970> 50<00:04:32.330> seconds<00:04:33.490> bear

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
we'll go to speed 10 for 50 seconds bear

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.700 
we'll go to speed 10 for 50 seconds bear
with<00:04:34.639> me<00:04:34.760> one<00:04:34.940> second<00:04:35.510> while<00:04:35.660> I<00:04:35.690> start<00:04:36.590> my

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
with me one second while I start my

00:04:36.710 --> 00:05:32.050 
with me one second while I start my
timer

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.460 

okay<00:05:33.060> now<00:05:33.240> one<00:05:33.480> thing<00:05:33.690> I<00:05:33.780> want<00:05:34.020> to<00:05:34.080> show<00:05:34.410> you

okay now one thing I want to show you

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.430 
okay now one thing I want to show you
before<00:05:35.130> we<00:05:35.460> compare<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.270> flowers<00:05:36.750> I've<00:05:36.960> been

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
before we compare the flowers I've been

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.350 
before we compare the flowers I've been
meaning<00:05:37.800> to<00:05:37.830> do<00:05:38.160> this<00:05:38.460> on<00:05:39.560> several<00:05:40.560> videos<00:05:40.980> a

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
meaning to do this on several videos a

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.670 
meaning to do this on several videos a
lot<00:05:42.360> of<00:05:42.480> people<00:05:42.720> may<00:05:42.870> be<00:05:42.900> wondering<00:05:43.169> what<00:05:43.530> does

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
lot of people may be wondering what does

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.500 
lot of people may be wondering what does
doing<00:05:43.950> this<00:05:44.190> kind<00:05:44.490> of<00:05:44.610> work<00:05:44.669> do<00:05:45.120> to<00:05:45.389> the

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
doing this kind of work do to the

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.210 
doing this kind of work do to the
blenders<00:05:45.900> let<00:05:46.139> me<00:05:46.230> show<00:05:46.440> you<00:05:46.500> something

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
blenders let me show you something

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.220 
blenders let me show you something
now<00:05:47.730> you<00:05:47.880> won't<00:05:48.030> get<00:05:48.270> this<00:05:48.480> advantage<00:05:48.990> with

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
now you won't get this advantage with

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.040 
now you won't get this advantage with
the<00:05:49.380> Vitamix<00:05:49.889> but<00:05:50.130> on<00:05:50.250> the<00:05:50.370> Blendtec<00:05:50.880> it<00:05:51.780> has<00:05:52.020> a

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
the Vitamix but on the Blendtec it has a

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.050 
the Vitamix but on the Blendtec it has a
counter<00:05:52.830> that<00:05:53.300> number<00:05:54.300> right<00:05:54.540> there

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
counter that number right there

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.430 
counter that number right there
represents<00:05:57.060> the<00:05:57.240> number<00:05:57.419> of<00:05:57.600> times<00:05:57.720> that<00:05:58.200> I've

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
represents the number of times that I've

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.310 
represents the number of times that I've
used<00:05:58.770> this<00:05:58.980> machine<00:05:59.600> I've<00:06:00.600> used<00:06:00.990> this<00:06:01.110> machine

used this machine I've used this machine

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:09.140 
used this machine I've used this machine
almost<00:06:02.479> 19,000<00:06:03.479> 200<00:06:04.380> times<00:06:07.010> now<00:06:08.010> I<00:06:08.370> haven't

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
almost 19,000 200 times now I haven't

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.120 
almost 19,000 200 times now I haven't
done<00:06:09.300> the<00:06:09.570> math<00:06:09.780> on<00:06:10.050> that<00:06:10.080> but<00:06:10.530> if<00:06:10.650> you<00:06:10.800> divide

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
done the math on that but if you divide

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:16.750 
done the math on that but if you divide
19<00:06:11.729> thousand<00:06:12.560> 172<00:06:13.560> by<00:06:14.600> 365<00:06:15.600> days<00:06:16.470> a<00:06:16.500> year

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
19 thousand 172 by 365 days a year

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.030 
19 thousand 172 by 365 days a year
you're<00:06:17.760> going<00:06:17.970> to<00:06:18.090> come<00:06:18.450> up<00:06:18.630> with<00:06:18.900> a<00:06:19.229> number

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
you're going to come up with a number

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.770 
you're going to come up with a number
that's<00:06:20.190> over<00:06:20.550> 50<00:06:20.760> which<00:06:21.150> means<00:06:21.419> if<00:06:21.600> you<00:06:21.750> use

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
that's over 50 which means if you use

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.610 
that's over 50 which means if you use
these<00:06:22.260> machines<00:06:22.710> every<00:06:23.190> single<00:06:23.580> day<00:06:24.500> for<00:06:25.500> the

these machines every single day for the
next<00:06:25.860> 50<00:06:26.250> years<00:06:26.580> you<00:06:26.790> still<00:06:27.030> won't<00:06:27.210> have<00:06:27.330> as

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
next 50 years you still won't have as

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.620 
next 50 years you still won't have as
many<00:06:28.590> uses<00:06:29.190> on<00:06:29.340> your<00:06:29.370> machine<00:06:29.910> as<00:06:30.150> I<00:06:30.389> do<00:06:30.450> on

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
many uses on your machine as I do on

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.170 
many uses on your machine as I do on
this<00:06:30.960> one<00:06:31.139> my<00:06:31.290> point<00:06:31.620> being<00:06:31.860> these<00:06:32.639> machines

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
this one my point being these machines

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.990 
this one my point being these machines
are<00:06:33.419> designed<00:06:33.690> to<00:06:34.139> last<00:06:35.660> now<00:06:37.550> let's<00:06:38.550> compare

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
are designed to last now let's compare

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.060 
are designed to last now let's compare
the<00:06:39.180> two<00:06:39.260> flowers<00:06:40.260> that<00:06:40.500> was<00:06:40.650> the<00:06:40.770> point<00:06:40.979> of

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
the two flowers that was the point of

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:46.460 
the two flowers that was the point of
this<00:06:41.190> demonstration<00:06:43.820> put<00:06:45.140> flour<00:06:46.140> on<00:06:46.289> the

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.470 
this demonstration put flour on the

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.469 
this demonstration put flour on the
Blendtec<00:06:46.890> on<00:06:47.070> one<00:06:47.280> side<00:06:47.520> of<00:06:47.669> this<00:06:47.760> plate<00:06:50.479> and

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 
Blendtec on one side of this plate and

00:06:51.479 --> 00:07:10.239 
Blendtec on one side of this plate and
with<00:06:51.750> the<00:06:51.840> Vitamix<00:06:52.729> on<00:06:53.729> the<00:06:53.880> other

00:07:10.239 --> 00:07:10.249 

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:14.079 

as<00:07:10.819> you<00:07:10.969> can<00:07:11.119> see<00:07:11.499> that<00:07:12.499> flower<00:07:13.429> is<00:07:13.729> fine

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:14.089 
as you can see that flower is fine

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:18.339 
as you can see that flower is fine
enough<00:07:14.419> to<00:07:14.569> bake<00:07:14.779> with<00:07:16.629> now<00:07:17.629> just<00:07:17.869> feeling<00:07:18.259> the

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:18.349 
enough to bake with now just feeling the

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:23.339 
enough to bake with now just feeling the
textures<00:07:18.919> of<00:07:19.009> these<00:07:21.459> they<00:07:22.459> are<00:07:22.489> almost

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:23.349 
textures of these they are almost

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:26.379 
textures of these they are almost
identical<00:07:24.349> the<00:07:24.559> Vitamix<00:07:25.459> texture<00:07:26.029> may<00:07:26.329> be

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:26.389 
identical the Vitamix texture may be

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:29.979 
identical the Vitamix texture may be
ever<00:07:26.839> so<00:07:27.259> slightly<00:07:27.859> finer<00:07:28.569> which<00:07:29.569> would<00:07:29.779> make

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:29.989 
ever so slightly finer which would make

00:07:29.989 --> 00:07:32.379 
ever so slightly finer which would make
some<00:07:30.259> sense<00:07:30.559> because<00:07:30.799> that<00:07:31.249> blade<00:07:31.759> in<00:07:32.089> that

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:32.389 
some sense because that blade in that

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:35.669 
some sense because that blade in that
jar<00:07:32.689> is<00:07:32.869> designed<00:07:33.579> just<00:07:34.579> for<00:07:34.729> this<00:07:35.149> function
