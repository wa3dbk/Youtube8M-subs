00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.040
 we make farmhouse days at 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.890
 raw milk 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.779
 about 14 tons of parents who 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.540
 are marketed throughout the 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.640
 France it's been eleven years that we have 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.890
 there hop and we have a flock of 60 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.410
 brown dairy cows of the Alps 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.269
 and montbeliarde the milk in rennet and goes 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.190
 stay 16 hours minimum 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:38.860
 we go mussels and cheeses to the ladle 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.020
 to return them twice we call it 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:46.239
 the drip agents mussels and let them 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.670
 24 hours at temperature around 21 to 23 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.260
 degrees the finesse of the notebook any 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.620
 the attention we can bring 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.390
 goes mold and cheese are very very 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.670
 very important to have a draining 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.649
 the most optimums possible and what will 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.370
 to be crucial to have one and bad 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.079
 can stand 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.850
 avoid all the flaws we can 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.910
 have on a notebook the tick of the kind 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.979
 bitterness the cheese returned to the cellar 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.670
 of refining are rubbed together 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.979
 days to the brine water and then the 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.290
 second week they went back and 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.510
 rub three times and then both 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.119
 last weeks we incorporate marc 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.920
 of Burgundy which is the specificity of 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.470
 after four weeks 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.479
 the cheeses are packed everything we 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.040
 can find on the natural flora of 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.930
 milk and especially on raw milk 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.540
 since we work in raw milk will get 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.119
 find in cheese found 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.000
 a panel of nuances at the level of 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.590
 aromas and smells that can 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.840
 that can be described when doing a 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.299
 tasting that is still very very 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.799
 wide and then a great finesse of 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.799
 cheese and a great balance of cheese
