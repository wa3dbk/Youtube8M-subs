00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 good afternoon days or nights I am sirasa 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:10.679
 572 and this time I bring a criticism to the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.480
 2010 universe series if you can read the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.389
 description since you have put 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.930
 information to save time xd without 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.480
 more let's start see 10 at first it was 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.640
 a series but exceptional entertaining and 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.740
 with good moments of action but with 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.660
 the course of the series this one went 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.760
 doing more self-centered and arrogant 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.219
 because it attracted the majority of the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.770
 child audience from one moment to another 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.750
 cartoon network put ben 10 at the mere 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.850
 tip of your programming reaching 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.430
 make specials if I remember correctly 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.430
 all day sell secrets of ben10 or 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.079
 something like that x more than all the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.570
 merchandise with the name of vendiesen 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.600
 she like t-shirts shoes toys 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.300
 etcetera and as the series did not come down from 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.940
 popularity they released their alien sequels 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.070
 force 'and ultimate to good were not bad 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.899
 sequels but you could see that only the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.940
 they took out to be more silver in the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.369
 pockets of cn producers 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.150
 since I had quite a few inconsistencies 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.890
 for more has 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.560
 exaggerations regarding the series 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.780
 original as the commas saga of 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.240
 kevin who decided to review what has already been done 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.030
 or what happened to the doctor, what do you think 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.520
 they got sucked hahaha xd and those are 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.350
 just a few examples but do not 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.260
 It was enough and kept the bastards 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.660
 overexploiting avn 10 after the end 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.490
 mamón the ultimate alien that where the 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.500
 pen according to has the maximum power of 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.080
 universe and uses it according to to cure the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.150
 world of evil and blah blah blah it seemed that 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.550
 they were not going to idolize so much to ben 10 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.770
 but not gold followed with another series that 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.140
 no doubt it would be the sample of how far 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.910
 Greed and egocentricity can come 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.180
 of a corporation in order to take out 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.979
 silver ben10 omni see the first thing 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.619
 that we can see in this series is its 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.540
 animation quality I think that a 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.340
 caricature is like a video game not 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.950
 you need the best graphic quality 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.440
 so that it is good but neither exaggerate 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.360
 if they already had a decent half animation 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.090
 so that they change it to one that looks 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.160
 mediocre leagues is that it seriously seems 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.320
 that the scenarios and especially the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.870
 characters were drawn to the idiot 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.510
 and as hurriedly as possible 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.799
 the characters look very bad 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.170
 simply the face of see is seen more 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.150
 and not only that, but also 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.610
 he looks much skinnier than in the series 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.129
 based is that perhaps they did 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.170
 anorexic or hahaha and that according to 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.720
 it took a year since the final mamón of 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.879
 ultimate alien and not to mention that he came 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.709
 of aliens should simply those of 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.349
 formed in a way that I can only 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.450
 to say to kevin kevin they did it a 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.670
 asymmetric metal leg and the 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.069
 most aliens drew them from a 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.530
 somewhat loving way I do not say that to 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.900
 all but if you compare it if you can 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.090
 notice the good change one would think that 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.120
 at least they tried to make a program 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.280
 decent but not take out wen ya kevin and 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.530
 put a new half-naive partner 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.650
 not to say asshole does not look good 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.500
 signal or if they even took the girlfriend out of 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.750
 they see hahaha what was missing now they go 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.030
 to change sides xd and what is worse 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.609
 good keeps coming but in few 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.859
 episodes and when his personality comes out 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.170
 becomes more healthy and apathetic and does not 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.030
 they leave neither the role of segundón but of 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.760
 mere xd props and he 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.940
 kevin does not even come out I just saw it in the 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.680
 first chapter finally played like 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.350
 call is not even half of what it was 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.870
 that I saw up to that and kevin if he had his 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.790
 funny moments or they were not seen 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.980
 forced and his jokes came out 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.380
 natural but they had to take it for 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.450
 someone who seriously gives her forgiveness for 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.120
 the expression but I can not find another 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.190
 way to describe it the jokes of rub 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.620
 they do not rely on more than understanding the 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.290
 things of the earth if you have seen the new 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.570
 young titans youth series 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.790
 titans in action will be able to see that rug is 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.830
 like star fire may be good for the 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.600
 combat but it comes to annoy that 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.150
 always have no idea of the 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.640
 customs of the earth once in each 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.739
 two or three chapters good he is forgiven 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.140
 but seriously they get dirty with this 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.720
 well we have a new and naive like 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.790
 protagonist at least one would think that 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.470
 the series is going to get cool and will try 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.780
 to retain some coherence and 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.049
 sense with respect to the previous series 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.419
 but as I said 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.400
 they see in all the episodes it does not stop 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.310
 remind us that he saved the universe a 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.440
 endless times it is seriously arrives to tie 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.449
 that all the fucking episodes say that 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.909
 has saved the universe endless 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.460
 sometimes believing the most fregon of all 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:37.099
 see what I mean when I say that 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.620
 this series became arrogant at least 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.479
 in the past series ben was bothered 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.419
 in keeping some humility but 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.250
 they sent that little bit to the newspaper anyway 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.500
 the adventures must be taken to 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.659
 out in a place called town under which 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.789
 it's a kind of black market that very 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:55.009
 conveniently it was always below 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.020
 from the village of Beni that houses almost 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.379
 all the alien species of the 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.569
 galaxy soccer today and that xd and talking 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:04.969
 of logic that was that of including the pen 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.280
 child to the series I think that that's 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:09.889
 mere stuffing or a stupid excuse to 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.229
 put in villains who want revenge 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.569
 ok it's cool that they put villains but 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.639
 that way they fucked up completely the logic of 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.800
 the first series of ben10 put to that 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.840
 they also got aliens that never 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.449
 they came out and making it worth ping to the 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.120
 most of the plot of the child pen 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:28.069
 or cartoon network following with the 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.710
 history they got a main villain 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.509
 disque well powerful and hunter malote 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.789
 with a dog that can be 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:37.189
 transform but the truth the parts of 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:39.680
 that dog look very forced and that only 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:41.509
 seeks to make you stay more fat pj avn and 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.029
 this is even more noticeable since the 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:46.490
 villain in a chapter manages to capture 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:48.800
 ben and that but as always ben achieves 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.240
 save yourself and flip all the cards in 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.610
 its against in a way the most 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.710
 irrational and shit going back between 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.689
 quotes save the universe still 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.810
 less credible than when he did it with 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:01.849
 vilgax and that is saying a lot but this 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.400
 series can feel like the power 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:07.610
 rangers appears a bad confronta 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.830
 they fight something happens and everything is solved or 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.509
 it is clearly a coarse story and 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.449
 that only distracts little kids 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:16.189
 who see the series of important things and 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:17.960
 that only encourage them to buy their 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:20.659
 products and fill your mind with 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.639
 stupidities still in the previous series 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:24.529
 they had a little bit of effort for 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.809
 put logic and meaning to the story 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:28.790
 so that it does not seem delayed but 

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:31.190
 here that went to hell 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.050
 and not to mention the new ones we came out with 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.510
 tell them that there is one that is a toy 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.640
 of blocks seriously is an alien that his 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.100
 power is to be made of blocks 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.260
 I think I've told you everything and to top 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.140
 they took out the supreme forms of 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.390
 aliens that's how they got it in all the 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.970
 episodes that I saw I never saw that ben was 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:52.130
 transforms into a supreme form is a 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.200
 pity since the supreme forms if 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.630
 they put good action on the series to 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.700
 conclude we can say that while this 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.530
 series can prompt the imagination of 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.690
 children the truth is that with 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.060
 characters and gross and stupid story 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.280
 I would recommend that you see another type 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.440
 of programs like a more or group show 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.260
 that at least those entertain and are not 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.270
 as proud as you are if you liked the 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.340
 dale thumb up video I accept 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.620
 suggestions and opinions but try not to 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.810
 use a lot of rudeness you are free to 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.830
 express your opinion but without offending 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.210
 others 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.210
 thanks for watching the video
