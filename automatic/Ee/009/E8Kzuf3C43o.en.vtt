00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.750
 which but coffee discounter currently better to explain require that attention 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.109
 coffee expert 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.970
 so i said buy 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.970
 talea de giro 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.470
 philips has his short life in europe press 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.840
 Philip did she buy 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.760
 taken over a year ago and we already notice that in support and the 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.040
 quality 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.490
 the actual difference with the or ds series 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.519
 The basic series a clean they buy is that that is only as one 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.719
 very important effect and that is 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.160
 this sbs group 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.440
 falls with davy prÃ¶pper 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.810
 fine and let the keeper niamh cup 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.760
 because it is never going to get that far out of the machine 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.340
 what the actual can be found on the coffee machine market 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.700
 It is a fantastic element that does not have a nice result 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.300
 is the difference with o'dea series the driver a bit bigger lisse has it 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.460
 income woke 7 liters of water instead of one and a half 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.970
 and I know it comes in the built descaling program 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.840
 we are just going to make spss 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.740
 previous may 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.980
 the sharp contraction the amount of grams of apps sync states to maximum 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.600
 then you have to run the water through more coffee and know it for sure 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.780
 more flavors 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.810
 I have now adjusted fashion to the finest position 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.070
 then something beautiful comes out very easily, too, that you have a bigger one here 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.920
 a small one can continue in waterloo but I don't need much 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.170
 just a little party 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.730
 watch the water board 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.100
 what kind of beautiful express would he make? 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.410
 it is convinced that at that time there was more water to process 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.350
 also nice prices remain low 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.350
 to see 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.020
 that is what i want to see slowly not rising on time it is very much from it 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.499
 was just not anymore 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:11.729
 I'm going with the tests 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:14.839
 that's it and I was ready 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:21.009
 the numbers come then you that rochus maker very nice weather coffee that I can 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.009
 to ensure 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.700
 who wants to make a new cappuccino is very simple 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.119
 then you go through hot steam 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:35.069
 a small layer of milk in a loft to froth a cup with this pipe 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.609
 both agricole milking let's just blow that is very simple the crowds 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.790
 just whether this button and now threatens to make 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.039
 stoner 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:48.130
 and who will stick out milk foam that you with a spoon or they will not point 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.999
 when he can get the coffee 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:51.979
 do you want the hot water 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:55.449
 and that kind of reading it is not just a cup of tea 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.159
 then you just have to turn me around 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.819
 the other side 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.059
 and also pressing the drop 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:06.209
 then you did not just say the water for this one 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.529
 but also to prune the cups well 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:10.709
 for heating 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.249
 what to make that half in zero land and that wheelbarrow even more beautiful 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.509
 and to thicken the coffee in a bargain 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:19.389
 we know a cup must go and win 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.019
 including in the bottom 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.019
 then you will get the best result 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:26.989
 because 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.569
 This means one of Monday's sources is 250 grams 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:35.569
 leaving behind the soil 7 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.399
 with an officer and do it with a key press and run it 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:40.499
 preferably when you turn 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:44.370
 You also have a box here that is easy for those who absolutely 

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:45.719
 want decaf 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:47.719
 can add you here 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:51.869
 the machine is also accessible because there are wheels underneath and that is handy 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:56.310
 then it's all about showing where the waste you make them 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.039
 and it doesn't matter how beautiful 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:02.889
 start the first one 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.539
 and this sets group 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:06.999
 So you have to go once a week 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.099
 he thoroughly scored with fun all the water 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.499
 no he in the water 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:14.179
 today i'm wearing it and pieter 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:17.689
 he wants the king to lubricate the supposed lukewarm water once a week 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:21.349
 minimal rinsing from debts and relocation is very easy 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:30.099
 make a very large couple of large latte macchiato or leave a cafe 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:30.960
 is that possible 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.050
 don't look now 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.379
 now so 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.539
 that can be a complete and including 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.289
 easy to operate 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.219
 supported by philips Nederland 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:44.870
 I am sure you will use this numerical language energy or bus 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.639
 have a lot of fun with it 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:52.030
 simply by this secret foundation delicious cup of rotating sbs buttons 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.930
 very important is the maintenance of the province 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.439
 in addition to just rinsing z group 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:02.909
 you must descale 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.309
 we assume that here in six a year, so every two months 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:11.669
 It is important that he additionally has it for cooking 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.349
 the machine must also have succeeded a number of times a year 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.740
 that just doesn't happen pills 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.639
 a little much 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.039
 depending on the machine 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.520
 is also added more often to the water or is in a separate compartment 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.219
 of course this number can be set 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:32.219
 for a whole year's care that loser 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:39.830
 they will despres then also suspect but also proposes cappuccino 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.840
 or just plain coffee ready it's obvious that one
