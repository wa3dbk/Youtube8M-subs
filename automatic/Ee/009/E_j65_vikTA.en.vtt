00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
written that are more electronic in

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.100 
written that are more electronic in
creating<00:01:57.450> what<00:01:57.660> is<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:58.110> very<00:01:58.530> unique<00:01:58.890> sound<00:02:00.110> no

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110

something<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:23.959> didn't<00:02:24.319> expect<00:02:24.409> to<00:02:24.709> happen<00:02:24.890> but

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
something I didn't expect to happen but

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.410 
something I didn't expect to happen but
it's<00:02:25.310> actually<00:02:25.430> better<00:02:25.819> than<00:02:25.969> I<00:02:26.150> thought<00:02:26.359> it

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
it's actually better than I thought it

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.599 
it's actually better than I thought it
would<00:02:26.569> be<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.409> that's<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.769> value<00:02:28.040> of

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
would be and that's the value of

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.420 
would be and that's the value of
bringing<00:02:29.150> all<00:02:29.359> these<00:02:29.510> different<00:02:29.780> parties<00:02:30.430> to

the 80s backs or than a cold war so we

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.370 
the 80s backs or than a cold war so we
want<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.450> have<00:02:47.540> two<00:02:47.780> different<00:02:47.960> musical

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
want to have two different musical

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.790 
want to have two different musical
directions<00:02:48.920> for<00:02:49.190> each<00:02:49.550> time<00:02:50.480> period<00:02:50.960> and<00:02:51.620> one

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
directions for each time period and one

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.770 
directions for each time period and one
of<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:52.040> future<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.730> feel<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.000> little<00:02:53.360> bit<00:02:53.570> more

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
of the future to feel a little bit more

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.150 
of the future to feel a little bit more
slicker<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:55.690> have<00:02:56.690> maybe<00:02:56.960> more<00:02:57.470> electronics

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
slicker and have maybe more electronics

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.490 
slicker and have maybe more electronics
whereas<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.820> 80s<00:02:59.240> felt<00:02:59.540> feels<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.230> little<00:03:00.350> bit

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
whereas the 80s felt feels a little bit

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.120 
whereas the 80s felt feels a little bit
more<00:03:00.620> Kestrel

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.080 

I<00:03:08.650> think<00:03:09.650> my<00:03:09.740> favorite<00:03:09.950> part<00:03:10.130> of<00:03:10.610> writing

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
I think my favorite part of writing
