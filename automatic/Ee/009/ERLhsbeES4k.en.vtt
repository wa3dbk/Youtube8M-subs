00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.790
 The main advantages were the cultivation of medicinal plants and the center with my 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.610
 body 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.090
 is directly related to the 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.710
 another measure of the water ie under the hands with pure water and the control of 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.020
 pests and diseases is carried out through the management of the logical perenco of diseases 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.100
 and pests using 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.990
 acib instances that do not 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.990
 compromises the quality of medicinal plant assets 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.460
 The other advantage is related to the year-round production of some 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.800
 species of medicinal plants 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.300
 there is some asepsis control is better and we have healthier plants to be 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.480
 marketed 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.490
 in the specific case of the cultivation of medicinal plants, the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.620
 hydroponic 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.090
 I have observed if separating the cultivation of mint 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.210
 metaceno pepper piperita menus resex the significant increase in order 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.270
 of 50% in the trailer of assets of these plants 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.950
 since the course shows how to grow medicinal plants 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.289
 condiments and aromatic 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.410
 has a game system 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.960
 in the first part shows fundamental aspects of the installations 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.539
 necessary for the 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:44.990
 a child with him 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.619
 how to control the environment to favor growth and that the production of steel 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.090
 the formulation 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.090
 the preparation of dilma must have a solution 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.020
 in the second part shows the medicinal species 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.060
 can be grown in rondonÃ³polis 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.060
 how to produce the seedlings and transplanted 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.129
 pest and disease control 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.479
 plant harvest 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.679
 the package 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.359
 dehydration 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.589
 storage and appearance 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:17.589
 the marketing 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:30.409
 The first step is to be used for anyone thinking of assembling any kind of 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:31.129
 business 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.599
 is to do a market research 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.709
 at this moment 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.040
 you need to check for demand for the product you want to produce 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:41.759
 Where is this demand? 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:46.009
 which medicinal or spice species are claimed 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.810
 and an estimate of the amount that the market can absorb 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:56.429
 it is very important that before you produce you have already defined how e 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:59.429
 who will sell their production 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.340
 there are some types of hydraulic systems 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.369
 which can be used for commercial cultivation 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:20.959
 all are made without soil and the plants are fed by a 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.329
 nutritious solution 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.409
 as examples we have a system that uses sand or expanded clay as 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.119
 plant supports 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:32.799
 and are bathed by nutrient solution 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.979
 and the nfp or laminar flow technique of nutrients 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:43.389
 in which the end in the nutrient solution film circulates through the large r channels 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.239
 to the roots of plants
