of<00:02:10.530> their<00:02:11.010> blood<00:02:11.250> vessels<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:12.180> can<00:02:12.330> decrease

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
of their blood vessels so can decrease

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
what hey you have to put them on ACE

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.310 
what hey you have to put them on ACE
inhibitors<00:02:18.000> because<00:02:18.360> it's<00:02:18.570> in<00:02:18.750> B<00:02:18.870> but<00:02:19.110> also

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
inhibitors because it's in B but also

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.840 
inhibitors because it's in B but also
gonna<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:19.920> gonna<00:02:20.010> decrease<00:02:20.400> their<00:02:20.610> blood

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
gonna it's gonna decrease their blood

gonna it's gonna decrease their blood
pressure<00:02:21.240> is<00:02:21.450> going<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.810> decrease<00:02:21.960> their<00:02:22.320> one

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.080 

and<00:02:31.650> also<00:02:31.920> prevents<00:02:32.280> heart<00:02:32.460> remodeling

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
and also prevents heart remodeling

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.600

compared<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.020> all<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.890> good<00:02:35.070> one<00:02:35.250> oh<00:02:35.340> that's

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
compared it all to good one oh that's

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.920 
compared it all to good one oh that's
like<00:02:35.700> you're<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.910> blocker<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:36.660> we<00:02:36.750> take<00:02:36.900> that

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
like you're a blocker so we take that

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.160 
like you're a blocker so we take that
back<00:02:37.200> right<00:02:37.470> it's<00:02:37.740> inhibitor<00:02:38.340> lisinopril

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
back right it's inhibitor lisinopril

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.040 
back right it's inhibitor lisinopril
right<00:02:40.200> give<00:02:41.100> them<00:02:41.310> statins<00:02:41.760> ah<00:02:42.090> statins<00:02:42.930> that

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
right give them statins ah statins that

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.750 
right give them statins ah statins that
inside<00:02:43.470> really<00:02:43.740> good<00:02:44.010> stuff<00:02:44.280> right<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.610> want

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
inside really good stuff right you want

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.570 
inside really good stuff right you want
to<00:02:44.790> decrease<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.510> one<00:02:45.740> LDL<00:02:46.740> you<00:02:47.280> came<00:02:47.460> from

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
to decrease that one LDL you came from

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.460 
to decrease that one LDL you came from
there<00:02:47.760> was<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.240> cheeseburger<00:02:49.020> from

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
there was the cheeseburger from

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.630 
there was the cheeseburger from
McDonald's<00:02:50.190> ha<00:02:50.400> stop<00:02:50.940> eating<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.420> stuff

eventually you're gonna eat enough of
them<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:55.080> give<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.260> form<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.620> nice<00:02:55.740> beautiful

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
them to give to form a nice beautiful

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.590 
them to give to form a nice beautiful
plaque<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.490> their<00:02:56.580> arteries<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.270> you<00:02:57.360> want<00:02:57.540> to

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
plaque in their arteries so you want to

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.970 
plaque in their arteries so you want to
decrease<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:57.900> what<00:02:58.200> ality<00:02:58.530> else<00:02:58.710> cuz<00:02:58.890> you

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
decrease that what ality else cuz you

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.740 
decrease that what ality else cuz you
remember<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.310> macrophage<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.090> eating<00:03:00.450> up<00:03:00.570> all

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
remember the macrophage is eating up all

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.860 
remember the macrophage is eating up all
this<00:03:00.900> what<00:03:01.130> LDLs<00:03:02.130> forming<00:03:02.520> foam<00:03:02.730> cells<00:03:03.060> Smuts

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
this what LDLs forming foam cells Smuts

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.330 
this what LDLs forming foam cells Smuts
uh<00:03:03.990> perforation<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.680> forms<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.130> plaque

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
uh perforation that forms a plaque

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.130 
uh perforation that forms a plaque
eventually<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.510> want<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:06.720> start<00:03:06.930> on<00:03:07.020> a

sublingual nitrate they pop it into
their<00:03:23.640> mouth<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:24.239> dissolves<00:03:24.989> it<00:03:25.410> causes<00:03:25.860> what

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
their mouth it dissolves it causes what

what<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:30.270> venous<00:03:30.750> system<00:03:30.989> so<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.040> decreased

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
what the venous system so it decreased

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.729 
what the venous system so it decreased
