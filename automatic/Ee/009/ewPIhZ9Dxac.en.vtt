are a bit unruly so I just take a little

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.590 
are a bit unruly so I just take a little
bit<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> brush<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.670> then<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.390> always

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
bit on the brush and then I just always

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.050 
bit on the brush and then I just always
brush<00:01:09.990> up<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:11.030> then<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.150> shape<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.810> top

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
brush up and then I just shape the top

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.490 
brush up and then I just shape the top
and<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.240> really<00:01:15.450> easy<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.869> quick<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.409> in

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
and it's really easy and quick to do in

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.749 
and it's really easy and quick to do in
the<00:01:16.560> morning<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.130> keeps<00:01:17.340> them<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.580> place

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759

in the middle and then just if I use it
on<00:03:59.739> the<00:03:59.829> side<00:04:00.069> it's<00:04:00.819> actually<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.299> perfect

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
on the side it's actually the perfect

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.069 
on the side it's actually the perfect
length

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
length

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.660 
length
for<00:04:02.230> my<00:04:02.319> brows<00:04:02.590> I<00:04:02.769> kind<00:04:02.980> of<00:04:03.010> use<00:04:03.190> on<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.400> side

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
for my brows I kind of use on the side

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.059 
for my brows I kind of use on the side
and<00:04:04.299> just<00:04:04.510> like<00:04:04.750> adding<00:04:05.170> a<00:04:05.260> few<00:04:05.440> extra<00:04:05.500> hairs

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
and just like adding a few extra hairs

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.339 
and just like adding a few extra hairs
kind<00:04:06.819> of<00:04:06.880> define<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.329> ends<00:04:07.599> of<00:04:07.690> it<00:04:07.750> more<00:04:08.019> and

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
kind of define the ends of it more and

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.910 
kind of define the ends of it more and
then<00:04:08.799> on<00:04:09.069> this<00:04:09.639> brow<00:04:09.940> I<00:04:10.239> actually<00:04:10.480> have<00:04:11.049> a<00:04:11.410> gap

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
then on this brow I actually have a gap

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.129 
then on this brow I actually have a gap
so<00:04:12.549> I<00:04:12.579> kind<00:04:12.819> of<00:04:12.880> go<00:04:13.030> through<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.780> just<00:04:13.810> like

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
so I kind of go through and just like

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.020 
so I kind of go through and just like
fill<00:04:14.470> in<00:04:14.620> that<00:04:14.739> gap<00:04:14.799> so<00:04:15.280> that<00:04:15.430> everything<00:04:15.819> all

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
fill in that gap so that everything all

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.990 
fill in that gap so that everything all
matches<00:04:16.419> up<00:04:16.570> but<00:04:16.870> it<00:04:17.289> is<00:04:17.440> so<00:04:17.709> quick<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:18.970> easy

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
matches up but it is so quick so easy

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.930 
matches up but it is so quick so easy
and<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:19.989> think<00:04:20.200> it<00:04:20.349> looks<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.919> most<00:04:21.099> natural<00:04:21.729> or

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.350 
and I think it looks the most natural or

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
medium brown because I like it was a

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.170 
medium brown because I like it was a
tiny<00:05:51.470> bit<00:05:51.800> of<00:05:51.830> a<00:05:51.980> tint<00:05:52.190> in<00:05:52.400> it<00:05:52.580> so<00:05:52.820> these<00:05:52.970> two

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
tiny bit of a tint in it so these two

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.880 
tiny bit of a tint in it so these two
products<00:05:53.630> combined<00:05:54.050> together<00:05:54.260> make<00:05:54.680> my
