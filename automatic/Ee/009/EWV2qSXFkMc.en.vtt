00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.329
 jalid and if you're looking for a drink that 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.550
 I'll hydrate you to give you energy instead of 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.529
 that you go to the store and the purchase is that 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.649
 type of drinks that even shakes you in the 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:38.210
 heart this drink you can prepare it 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:40.489
 made at home with very good flavor and 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.579
 also without artificial colors without 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.489
 artificial flavors besides this drink 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.739
 I will give you the much resistance 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.230
 you can take before you go running or 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.910
 before going to the gym or before 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.129
 do any other activity that 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.420
 have planned during the day since 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:02.570
 we all need energy and endurance 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.420
 We're going to need a cup of water 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.580
 coconut already in my other videos has been 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.030
 talked about how beneficial it is to take 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.399
 this liquid and the only thing to open this 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.830
 coconut which is the coconut of thailand a coconut 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:19.210
 young and tender you will give him four 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.360
 strong blows making a picture 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.110
 I have not just opened this list too 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.050
 We are going to need 2 tablespoons of chia 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.790
 this seed apart from that has 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.740
 protein 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.250
 I like to consume it because it has 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.820
 omega 3 and omega 3 reaches a lot 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.460
 things as well as for the brain and 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.880
 also something very interesting about this 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.310
 seed is that it helps you regulate your 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.979
 appetite that is very important for 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.340
 keep a healthy weight 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.289
 in that we have to work then 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.680
 let's prepare what is most 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:02.610
 simple 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.280
 is a cup of coconut water that has already been 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.479
 tucked in and I like to strain it so it does not 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.849
 come the coconut shell 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.019
 and then we're going to use both 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.019
 spoonfuls of chia 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.530
 and it is already 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.819
 that's all it tastes great 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.560
 you can leave soaking a little bit like that 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.940
 you can take it immediately or if 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.739
 you want to leave it soaking a 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.019
 little by little I'm going to stir it up 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.360
 everything but this is all you have to 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.700
 do before you start exercising 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.959
 see you if you liked this video 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.959
 please give it a like 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.079

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.640
 Y
