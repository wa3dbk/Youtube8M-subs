00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 would it be the best project God has 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.290
 for those who want to see this mission because in fact if the family is to be 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.019
 missionary is to be evangelized 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.480
 a family is born when young you know you need 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.299
 make sales happen 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.630
 through this choice of him as father and mother as exposed as wife 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.470
 because the family 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.220
 family the constant yes every day 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.240
 yes it's for jesus christ 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.779
 and we have difficulties 2 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.130
 to be family 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.110
 because the family to renounce oneself is not to want to do their will but to 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.370
 the other's will 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.940
 is to think of a larger project 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.700
 It's bigger because it's from God because God's actions and never ending with 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.600
 love and love is god because i ceased family in the countryside 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.389
 the skoda of today really are many lack of prayer 

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:50.539
 of commitment 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.610
 of delivery knowledge 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.810
 lack of renunciation especially lack of forgiveness 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.810
 there is no forgiveness when we use two of God's word 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.360
 but the difficulties are nothing 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.030
 before the love that God has for our families 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.860
 for your protection 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.290
 and of course there is a perfect family 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.220
 not in the sense of the more wrong to the contrary perfect family that 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.550
 err and ask forgiveness to seek reconciliation 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.020
 what look at jesus 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.170
 avoid that it is possible yes this person using my side is the best present that 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.140
 God gave me 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.710
 I'm responsible for your happiness I can surrender I can give myself and 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.970
 I can also receive is an exchange is a communion of life and hope of 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:31.600
 fight 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600
 from there they smile 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.850
 all is good 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.810
 it is the gift of the Lord and perfection is to want to do the will of God I never 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.689
 I thought about leaving my family 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:42.759
 on the contrary 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:43.730
 the suitcase 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.760
 give myself if I need to 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.260
 so that it can grow 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.170
 I'm getting better 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.340
 on the way the same jesus christ 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.850
 knowing how to take care not just with the word 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.730
 but with concrete gestures 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.730
 do not heal from a family asking you to love what is important 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.780
 it is the greatest difficulty of joys 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.220
 how the priest 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.570
 it's worse action 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.619
 I can not speak what I can not grow materially and 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.429
 offers through prayer 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.379
 after all, everything affection affection family action 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.739
 it's safe harbor 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.559
 the husband must take care of his wife in that way 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:21.879
 protected love of his wife 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.099
 reminding his wife we ​​in the ways the scientists treated his life 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.859
 woman who has wisdom 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:29.279
 husband's thing 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:30.719
 sport and citizenship 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.159
 take care of the wife 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.449
 parents take care of their children I take care of each other this is 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:38.849
 taking care of children is this 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.159
 the husband and wife when one of the other 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.539
 and so together 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:46.770
 their children firmly saying yes when 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.709
 not when it is not but always arming and we never stop putting together 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.060
 but the most important thing is that father and mother are very united is taking great care 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.449
 well of your children 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:03:00.989
 when he has exposed and does not participate the wife can not do it alone and vice versa 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.839
 the children need both 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:04.109
 father and mother together 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.210
 in the same boat 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.740
 in the same direction 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.329
 and certainly happy saucers 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:10.820
 blessed sons 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.039
 saucer or not 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:16.569
 but who do not remain the same because they are children who have faith in safety 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:17.779
 in your parents 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.109
 do not forget the sound of god can not end 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.430

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.909
 and continuous through me and you 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.149

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:32.039
 be true or your family a family of faith and hope a family that 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:35.319
 walk with jesus christ who has intercession of our lady 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.369
 Our father's account is that the church starts at home and so 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:42.909
 community worldwide 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:44.380
 if we seek 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.769
 the righteousness before God if we recorded his word in the heart 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.049
 we will always have family on the rock 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.959

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.160
 start this victor again and in the failures do not slaughter 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.340
 do not use delivery instead 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.869
 get up reg 

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:05.650
