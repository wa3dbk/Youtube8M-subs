by<00:00:14.610> some<00:00:15.000> interesting<00:00:15.450> software<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:15.900> we're

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
by some interesting software so we're

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.410 
by some interesting software so we're
there<00:00:16.230> we<00:00:17.070> come<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.490> devices<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.119> minute<00:00:18.330> yes

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
there we come to devices in a minute yes

there we come to devices in a minute yes
first<00:00:18.779> before<00:00:19.560> we<00:00:19.650> come<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.859> some<00:00:19.980> key<00:00:20.279> thing

first before we come to some key thing

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.800 
first before we come to some key thing
we<00:00:20.490> start<00:00:20.760> getting<00:00:21.000> all<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.300> other<00:00:21.420> experts

we start getting all the other experts
in<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.230> think<00:00:22.980> we've<00:00:23.310> always<00:00:23.609> maintained<00:00:24.420> that

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
in I think we've always maintained that

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.560 
in I think we've always maintained that
the<00:00:25.019> first<00:00:25.350> 30<00:00:25.769> seconds<00:00:26.369> Oh<00:00:26.580> first<00:00:27.119> three<00:00:27.449> or

the first 30 seconds Oh first three or
four<00:00:27.750> minutes<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.199> crucial<00:00:28.830> if<00:00:29.310> something

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
four minutes is crucial if something

be a big success exactly and I have to

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.220 
be a big success exactly and I have to
say<00:00:34.680> one<00:00:35.040> thing<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.550> all<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.230> Microsoft

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
say one thing that of all the Microsoft

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.750 
say one thing that of all the Microsoft
products<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.800> i<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:37.980> used<00:00:38.219> i<00:00:38.399> think<00:00:38.579> since

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
products that i have used i think since

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.060 
products that i have used i think since
word<00:00:39.149> when<00:00:39.480> i<00:00:39.570> first<00:00:39.780> used<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.230> connect<00:00:40.920> now

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
word when i first used to connect now

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.350 
word when i first used to connect now
because<00:00:41.309> i<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> feeling<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.149> you're

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
because i have a feeling that you're

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.330 
because i have a feeling that you're
going<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> say<00:00:42.660> something<00:00:42.719> positive<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.710> i

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
going to say something positive and i

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.520 
going to say something positive and i
want<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.550> take<00:00:44.670> any<00:00:44.820> positive<00:00:45.239> i<00:00:45.320> want<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.379> set

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
want to take any positive i want to set

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.310 
want to take any positive i want to set
the<00:00:46.710> stage<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.090> word<00:00:48.420> positive

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
the stage for this so the word positive

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.990 
the stage for this so the word positive
and<00:00:49.530> microsoft<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> same<00:00:50.460> sentence

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and microsoft in the same sentence

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.240 
and microsoft in the same sentence
coming<00:00:51.300> from<00:00:51.420> Vikram<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.899> also<00:00:52.649> an<00:00:52.770> iconic
