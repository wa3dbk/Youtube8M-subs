00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.150 
for the red eye carbons to review for
the<00:00:18.990> new<00:00:19.109> iPad<00:00:19.500> because<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.859> thought<00:00:20.039> they

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
thing i do want to mention the video is

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.870 
thing i do want to mention the video is
that<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> apple<00:00:28.529> smart<00:00:28.800> covers<00:00:29.130> do<00:00:29.429> indeed

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
that the apple smart covers do indeed

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.209 
that the apple smart covers do indeed
work<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.510> carbons<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.320> I'm<00:00:31.830> not<00:00:32.040> sure

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
work with the I carbons so I'm not sure

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.010 
work with the I carbons so I'm not sure
about<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.550> leather<00:00:32.790> ones<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.420> know<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
about the leather ones but I do know the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.630 
about the leather ones but I do know the
polyurethane<00:00:34.710> ones<00:00:34.829> do<00:00:35.040> work<00:00:35.250> I'm<00:00:35.399> not<00:00:35.520> sure

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
polyurethane ones do work I'm not sure

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.580 
polyurethane ones do work I'm not sure
there's<00:00:35.820> much<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.120> difference<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.899> in

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
there's much of a difference but the in

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.340 
there's much of a difference but the in
fact<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.129> polios<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.700> ones<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.940> do<00:00:39.120> work

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
fact the polios and ones that do work

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.139 
fact the polios and ones that do work
outstanding<00:00:40.350> no<00:00:40.530> flaws<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:41.640> really<00:00:41.969> any

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
outstanding no flaws not really any

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.720 
outstanding no flaws not really any
problems<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.860> as<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.129> see<00:00:44.280> my<00:00:44.430> color

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
problems so as you can see my color

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.850 
problems so as you can see my color
combination<00:00:45.390> looks<00:00:45.600> pretty<00:00:46.110> outrageous<00:00:46.320> I've

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
combination looks pretty outrageous I've

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.619 
combination looks pretty outrageous I've
got<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> blue<00:00:47.219> smart<00:00:47.520> cover<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.270> red<00:00:48.600> eye

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
got a blue smart cover with the red eye

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.660 
got a blue smart cover with the red eye
carbons<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.800> I'm<00:00:49.950> planning<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.309> getting<00:00:50.430> in

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
carbons but I'm planning on getting in

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.340 
carbons but I'm planning on getting in
black<00:00:50.940> smart<00:00:51.360> cover<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.020> can<00:00:52.170> get<00:00:52.320> I

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
black smart cover and then you can get I

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.350 
black smart cover and then you can get I
carbons<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.280> carbons<00:00:53.699> website<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.239> go

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
carbons on the I carbons website to go

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.569 
carbons on the I carbons website to go
on<00:00:54.600> top<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> smart<00:00:55.620> cover<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.340> that'll

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
on top of the smart cover so that'll

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.819 
on top of the smart cover so that'll
make<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.730> look<00:00:57.030> sexy<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.289> I'm<00:00:58.440> planning<00:00:58.620> on

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
make it look sexy so I'm planning on

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.319 
make it look sexy so I'm planning on
doing<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.460> as<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.820> see<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.239> do

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329

doing that and as you can see you can do
anything<00:01:00.570> with<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> Smart<00:01:01.170> Cover<00:01:01.379> fold<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> up

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
anything with the Smart Cover fold it up

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.109 
anything with the Smart Cover fold it up
roll<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.460> etc<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.510> works<00:01:03.690> perfect<00:01:05.119> so

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
roll it up etc and it works perfect so

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.160 
roll it up etc and it works perfect so
now<00:01:06.240> let's<00:01:06.420> go<00:01:06.540> ahead<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.720> take<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.930> look<00:01:07.049> at
