00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.819
 good for you to see if your original phone 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.179
 before you lose money buying 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.400
 a fake a fake 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.950
 here are some tips 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.560
 I'm going to start with a 2013 model that 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:22.020
 studio that has been repaginated now you see 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.350
 right away you have to take a look 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.260
 in the plastic that surrounds the packaging 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:35.130
 it has to be a plastic that leaves a 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:38.219
 step cooking without air single city and 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.210
 every bit what's original it has this 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.210
 opening here for the tab that will be 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.020
 placed on the ball then it is the opening 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:53.300
 that no fake phone comes around usually comes 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.039
 covered that this is two things does 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.789
 to look to see if it's 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.600
 true 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:04.379
 this 2013 model comes with one with a 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:12.119
 extra they have this afternoon here this 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:16.320
 magnetic seal to help further 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.140
 plus you identify a missing phone one 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.000
 fake or true phone 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.750
 the older models they do not have 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.750
 this afternoon 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:35.579
 but the rule is worth also the packaging 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:38.060
 it has to be smooth five speeds in 1 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.420
 to 1 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:46.700
 the packaging must have this opening 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.700
 in these older packages 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.670
 You can see this water. 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:02:00.439
 the resistance she has if she has 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:05.280
 this resistance here I am is original 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:09.420
 the false ones tend to be this way 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.250
 it stands straight and original in a 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.930
 stay 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:18.620
 well these are some tips i hope 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.620
