another<00:00:59.270> way<00:00:59.450> of<00:00:59.600> doing<00:00:59.720> the<00:00:59.960> same<00:00:59.990> exact

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
another way of doing the same exact

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.070 
another way of doing the same exact
thing<00:01:00.590> is<00:01:00.920> if<00:01:01.130> we<00:01:01.250> go<00:01:01.430> through<00:01:01.640> my<00:01:02.480> computer

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
thing is if we go through my computer

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.430 
thing is if we go through my computer
and<00:01:04.070> now<00:01:04.640> we<00:01:04.699> see<00:01:05.059> the<00:01:05.360> SD<00:01:05.690> card<00:01:05.930> right<00:01:06.140> here

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
and now we see the SD card right here

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.640 
and now we see the SD card right here
and<00:01:07.300> we<00:01:08.300> can<00:01:08.480> either<00:01:08.600> right-click<00:01:09.110> it<00:01:09.500> and

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
and we can either right-click it and

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.100 
and we can either right-click it and
push<00:01:10.130> open<00:01:10.730> and<00:01:10.940> now<00:01:11.360> we<00:01:11.420> can<00:01:11.660> see<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.930> same

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
name for this and we don't have that we

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.020 
name for this and we don't have that we
can<00:01:29.450> just<00:01:29.600> hit<00:01:29.690> the<00:01:29.810> import<00:01:29.960> button<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:31.030> after
