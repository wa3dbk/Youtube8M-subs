00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.270
 Then I put two cups of water in the 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.220
 pan 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:35.140
 I'll put a spoonful of butter one 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:37.510
 spoon of sugar a pinch of salt and 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.609
 I'll stir until the butter melts. 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.050
 now that the butter has melted and 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.749
 it started to boil 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.949
 I'll add two cups of 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:47.859
 couple 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.979
 then you will play this way little by little and 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:49.979
 moving 

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:59.729
 you will stir until the cooking dough 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:02.739
 flour to be homogeneous 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:06.610
 this process is approximately three 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:09.340
 to five minutes after the mass 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.270
 it's cooked like that or you'll put 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.670
 a little plate to cool down after you go 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.909
 To be able to have lunch with love is the mass 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.899
 so she 's ready she's ready now 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.899
 I'm just going to have an ax 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.530
 Go to the mini churros format. 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.119
 and I'm going to need a bottle of those 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.420
 of the same water raffle 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.940
 I cut her off, in fact I put 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.159
 the pasta in here and I'll tighten the 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:50.860
 size that I leave here whenever I want 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.580
 launch new niches were so I 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.799
 you are 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.360
 The oil is already hot so we'll go 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.539
 start believing I'll put here 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.539
 O 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.709
 beyond 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.280
 After the agent is done to justify 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.900
 idea that I made a mix of 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.140
 sugar and cinnamon 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.140
 daiane takes the churros here 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.630
 this was the result of our trash 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:44.120
 Now just pass some milk and it's 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.700
 super easy to do you saw if to 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.380
