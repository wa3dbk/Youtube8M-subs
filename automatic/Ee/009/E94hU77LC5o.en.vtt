board now grab your soldering iron and

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.540 
board now grab your soldering iron and
desolder<00:02:13.910> all<00:02:14.180> four<00:02:14.480> wires<00:02:15.400> don't<00:02:16.400> worry

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
desolder all four wires don't worry

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.250 
desolder all four wires don't worry
about<00:02:16.700> which<00:02:16.970> ones<00:02:17.240> went<00:02:17.510> where<00:02:17.720> because<00:02:18.140> the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
about which ones went where because the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.780 
about which ones went where because the
board<00:02:18.470> has<00:02:18.650> labels<00:02:19.010> on<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.310> tell<00:02:19.490> you<00:02:19.610> what

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
board has labels on it to tell you what

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.060 
board has labels on it to tell you what
each<00:02:19.970> signal<00:02:20.360> is<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:21.530> can<00:02:21.680> see<00:02:21.830> here<00:02:22.040> that

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
each signal is you can see here that

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.930 
each signal is you can see here that
says<00:02:22.660> GND<00:02:23.660> for<00:02:23.990> ground<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.530> mic<00:02:25.310> for<00:02:25.700> your<00:02:25.790> mic

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
says GND for ground and mic for your mic

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.930 
says GND for ground and mic for your mic
obviously<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:28.190> other<00:02:28.340> two<00:02:28.550> are<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.760> bit

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.170 
strip back each of the wires make sure
you<00:03:27.650> only<00:03:27.770> strip<00:03:28.130> back<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.340> very<00:03:28.760> small<00:03:29.060> amount

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
you only strip back a very small amount

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.120 
you only strip back a very small amount
of<00:03:29.420> wire<00:03:29.690> so<00:03:30.050> you<00:03:30.140> don't<00:03:30.350> have<00:03:30.470> a<00:03:30.530> long<00:03:30.800> section

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
of wire so you don't have a long section

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.500 
of wire so you don't have a long section
of<00:03:31.340> exposed<00:03:31.700> wire<00:03:31.970> that<00:03:32.209> can<00:03:32.330> make<00:03:32.480> a

short<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.550> cut<00:03:37.700> your<00:03:37.850> wires<00:03:38.620> now<00:03:39.620> it's<00:03:39.860> time<00:03:40.100> to

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
short to cut your wires now it's time to

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.630 
solder start with your ground wire
because<00:03:42.530> you'll<00:03:42.680> need<00:03:42.800> to<00:03:42.950> either<00:03:43.070> put<00:03:43.340> shrink

fit perfectly into the cutouts so it

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.010 
fit perfectly into the cutouts so it

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:03.949 

it<00:06:02.819> should<00:06:02.999> look<00:06:03.119> like<00:06:03.149> this<00:06:03.449> before<00:06:03.749> you

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:03.959 
it should look like this before you

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:08.510 
it should look like this before you
start<00:06:04.199> putting<00:06:04.379> screws<00:06:04.649> back<00:06:04.889> in

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.490 

now<00:06:09.520> put<00:06:09.790> the<00:06:09.850> screws<00:06:10.090> back<00:06:10.120> in<00:06:10.510> it<00:06:11.170> doesn't

now put the screws back in it doesn't

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.170 
now put the screws back in it doesn't
matter<00:06:11.620> which<00:06:11.830> ones<00:06:12.040> you<00:06:12.160> put<00:06:12.340> in<00:06:12.430> first<00:06:12.700> but<00:06:13.150> I

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
matter which ones you put in first but I

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.580 
matter which ones you put in first but I
prefer<00:06:13.540> putting<00:06:13.840> the<00:06:13.930> silver<00:06:14.200> screws<00:06:14.440> in

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
prefer putting the silver screws in

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.230 
prefer putting the silver screws in
first<00:06:14.830> since<00:06:15.250> they<00:06:15.400> hold<00:06:15.640> the<00:06:15.760> center<00:06:16.000> of<00:06:16.150> the

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
first since they hold the center of the

first since they hold the center of the
connector<00:06:16.570> together

at<00:06:19.380> this<00:06:19.620> point<00:06:19.950> you<00:06:20.250> can<00:06:20.430> now<00:06:20.550> test<00:06:20.850> your

at this point you can now test your

at this point you can now test your
connection<00:06:21.240> to<00:06:21.510> see<00:06:21.660> if<00:06:21.750> you<00:06:21.930> started<00:06:22.230> it

connection to see if you started it
correctly<00:06:22.680> if<00:06:22.890> everything<00:06:23.850> works<00:06:24.090> and<00:06:24.330> you

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
correctly if everything works and you

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.360 
correctly if everything works and you

want your wires to be a bit more secure
you<00:06:26.790> can<00:06:26.940> put<00:06:27.120> hog<00:06:27.330> glue<00:06:27.600> into<00:06:27.810> the<00:06:27.960> connector

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
you can put hog glue into the connector

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.860 
you can put hog glue into the connector
here<00:06:28.740> to<00:06:29.220> hold<00:06:29.430> the<00:06:29.550> cable<00:06:29.700> in<00:06:29.880> place<00:06:30.150> but<00:06:30.810> a

way<00:06:53.770> you<00:06:53.830> can<00:06:54.040> plug<00:06:54.250> any<00:06:54.460> 2.5<00:06:55.150> millimeter<00:06:55.630> head

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780 
way you can plug any 2.5 millimeter head

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.350 
way you can plug any 2.5 millimeter head
set<00:06:55.990> cable<00:06:56.290> into<00:06:56.560> the<00:06:56.590> adapter<00:06:56.680> if<00:06:57.240> you<00:06:58.240> can

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
set cable into the adapter if you can

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.580 
set cable into the adapter if you can
find<00:06:58.540> a<00:06:58.660> small<00:06:58.900> enough<00:06:59.110> jack

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
find a small enough jack

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.990 
find a small enough jack
you<00:06:59.770> can<00:06:59.950> even<00:07:00.160> glue<00:07:00.310> it<00:07:00.460> inside<00:07:00.670> the

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
you can even glue it inside the

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.550 
you can even glue it inside the
connector<00:07:01.390> so<00:07:01.900> it<00:07:01.960> would<00:07:02.050> be<00:07:02.170> a<00:07:02.200> seamless

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 
connector so it would be a seamless

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.430 
connector so it would be a seamless
design<00:07:03.090> again<00:07:04.090> I'm<00:07:04.570> not<00:07:04.720> the<00:07:04.780> first<00:07:04.990> person<00:07:05.410> to

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 
design again I'm not the first person to

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.110 
design again I'm not the first person to
think<00:07:05.620> of<00:07:05.770> this<00:07:05.920> but<00:07:06.520> I<00:07:06.580> thought<00:07:06.730> it<00:07:06.880> should<00:07:06.910> be

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 
think of this but I thought it should be

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.780 
think of this but I thought it should be
mentioned<00:07:07.270> I<00:07:08.220> hope<00:07:09.220> you<00:07:09.370> all<00:07:09.490> found<00:07:09.640> that
