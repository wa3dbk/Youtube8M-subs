00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.230
 It has a certain mutuality 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.640
 between the sound of a picture power ups 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.450
 and the melody at the end of a level 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.450
 have noticed 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.120

 Just under this bridge and 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.890
 throw two games directly into the water 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.209

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.250
 to activate easter egg 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.989

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.330
