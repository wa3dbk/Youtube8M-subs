00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
an Xbox accessory but it sits within one

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
now we want to focus on a standalone

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.920 
now we want to focus on a standalone
untethered<00:01:02.489> device<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.329> make<00:01:03.480> sure<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.690> it

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
untethered device and make sure that it

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.380 
untethered device and make sure that it
can<00:01:04.080> prove<00:01:04.290> out<00:01:04.500> that's<00:01:04.799> scenario<00:01:05.610> that's

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
can prove out that's scenario that's

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.120 
can prove out that's scenario that's
where<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:06.750> started<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.560> that's<00:01:07.770> where<00:01:08.010> we

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
where we started and that's where we

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.120 
where we started and that's where we
announced<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.640> January<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.780> fully<00:01:10.130> first

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
announced in January the fully first

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.310 
announced in January the fully first
fully<00:01:11.400> contained<00:01:11.850> headset<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.659> feathered

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
fully contained headset the feathered

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.840 
fully contained headset the feathered
scenarios<00:01:13.860> around<00:01:14.159> VR<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.490> think<00:01:14.760> are

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
scenarios around VR I think are

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.060 
scenarios around VR I think are
interesting<00:01:15.229> but<00:01:16.229> we're<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
interesting but we're going for the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.590 
interesting but we're going for the
something<00:01:17.460> different<00:01:18.000> not<00:01:18.119> being<00:01:18.360> tethered

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
something different not being tethered

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.840 
something different not being tethered
to<00:01:18.750> over<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> pc<00:01:19.320> xbox<00:01:19.590> or<00:01:20.040> phone<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.549> part<00:01:20.759> of

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
to over the pc xbox or phone as part of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.249 
to over the pc xbox or phone as part of
that<00:01:20.909> solution<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.840> our<00:01:21.960> design

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
that solution is one of our design

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.830 
that solution is one of our design
challenges<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.430> we<00:01:23.640> did<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.090> now<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:24.630> have

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
challenges and we did that now we have

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.560 
challenges and we did that now we have
to<00:01:24.869> say<00:01:25.080> well<00:01:25.350> ok<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:26.520> an<00:01:26.610> xbox<00:01:26.850> one<00:01:27.330> or

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
to say well ok if we have an xbox one or

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.319 
to say well ok if we have an xbox one or
a<00:01:27.630> pc<00:01:28.170> what<00:01:29.070> about<00:01:29.189> those<00:01:29.430> scenarios<00:01:29.820> we

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
a pc what about those scenarios we

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.690 
a pc what about those scenarios we
aren't<00:01:30.869> publicly<00:01:31.470> talked<00:01:31.860> about<00:01:32.159> what<00:01:32.490> those

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
aren't publicly talked about what those

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.969 
aren't publicly talked about what those
are<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.299> can<00:01:33.450> imagine<00:01:33.540> as<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.560> continue

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
are but you can imagine as we continue

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.679 
are but you can imagine as we continue
to<00:01:35.040> drive<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.610> get<00:01:35.729> success<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.390> hololens

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
to drive and get success with hololens

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.870 
to drive and get success with hololens
scenarios<00:01:37.500> become<00:01:37.860> obvious<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.400> developers

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
scenarios become obvious and developers

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.960 
scenarios become obvious and developers
will<00:01:39.030> take<00:01:39.210> advantage<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.020> them<00:01:40.259> now<00:01:41.040> before<00:01:41.790> I

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
will take advantage of them now before I

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.789 
will take advantage of them now before I
give<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:42.329> opinions<00:01:42.810> on<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.229> want<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.500> jump

as<00:03:28.530> well<00:03:28.770> get<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.190> over<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.580> done<00:03:29.730> with<00:03:30.140> in

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
as well get that over and done with in

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.210 
as well get that over and done with in
terms<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.590> kinect<00:03:31.980> I'm<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:33.150> two<00:03:33.410> minds<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.830> has

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
terms of kinect I'm of two minds it has

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.520 
terms of kinect I'm of two minds it has
the<00:03:35.250> potential<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:36.120> be<00:03:36.330> kind<00:03:36.630> of<00:03:36.720> cool<00:03:36.930> for

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
the potential to be kind of cool for

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.699 
the potential to be kind of cool for
certain<00:03:37.890> games<00:03:38.220> my<00:03:38.550> friends<00:03:39.140> for<00:03:40.140> example<00:03:40.530> is

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
certain games my friends for example is

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.030 
certain games my friends for example is
really<00:03:41.100> interested<00:03:41.700> in<00:03:41.820> sports<00:03:42.660> games<00:03:43.050> but

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
really interested in sports games but

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.340 
really interested in sports games but
there's<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.370> bit<00:03:44.550> of<00:03:44.580> a<00:03:44.820> bit<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.600> an<00:03:45.660> oddity<00:03:45.900> he

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
there's a bit of a bit of an oddity he

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.800 
there's a bit of a bit of an oddity he
was<00:03:46.500> showing<00:03:46.709> me<00:03:46.860> for<00:03:47.280> example<00:03:47.490> FIFA<00:03:48.209> works

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
was showing me for example FIFA works

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.750 
was showing me for example FIFA works
really<00:03:49.080> well<00:03:49.170> with<00:03:49.440> Kinect<00:03:49.830> bird<00:03:50.400> on<00:03:50.640> the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
really well with Kinect bird on the

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.120 
really well with Kinect bird on the
other<00:03:50.910> hand<00:03:51.180> Madden<00:03:52.170> dozen<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.800> we're

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
other hand Madden dozen and we're

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.660 
other hand Madden dozen and we're
talking<00:03:53.459> about<00:03:53.580> Madden<00:03:54.120> tube<00:03:54.300> air<00:03:54.560> 2015

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
talking about Madden tube air 2015

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.040 
talking about Madden tube air 2015
basically<00:03:56.670> it<00:03:56.790> tells<00:03:56.820> you<00:03:57.209> hey<00:03:57.390> or<00:03:57.780> not<00:03:57.900> in

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
basically it tells you hey or not in

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.280 
basically it tells you hey or not in
American<00:03:58.560> region<00:03:58.980> so<00:03:59.250> you're<00:03:59.400> pretty<00:03:59.580> screwed

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
American region so you're pretty screwed

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.230 
American region so you're pretty screwed
with<00:04:01.290> voice<00:04:01.709> commands<00:04:02.100> which<00:04:02.550> obviously

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
with voice commands which obviously

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.510 
with voice commands which obviously
isn't<00:04:03.480> particularly<00:04:03.870> great<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:05.010> I<00:04:05.040> think<00:04:05.340> it

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
isn't particularly great so I think it

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.970 
isn't particularly great so I think it
is<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:06.060> onus<00:04:06.450> is<00:04:06.630> somewhat<00:04:07.140> on<00:04:07.260> developers

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
is the onus is somewhat on developers

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.010 
is the onus is somewhat on developers
but<00:04:08.730> I<00:04:08.970> do<00:04:09.330> feel<00:04:10.020> that<00:04:10.140> Microsoft<00:04:10.980> really

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
but I do feel that Microsoft really

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.360 
but I do feel that Microsoft really
hampered<00:04:13.020> itself<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.530> little<00:04:13.709> bit<00:04:13.980> but<00:04:14.220> the

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
hampered itself a little bit but the

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.130 
hampered itself a little bit but the
launch<00:04:14.610> of<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.880> xbox<00:04:15.150> one<00:04:15.510> bundling<00:04:16.020> and

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
launch of the xbox one bundling and

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.890 
launch of the xbox one bundling and
connect<00:04:16.560> I<00:04:16.739> do<00:04:16.859> feel<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.340> it<00:04:17.910> did<00:04:18.330> cost<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.810> a

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
connect I do feel that it did cost of a

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.500 
connect I do feel that it did cost of a
little<00:04:19.350> bit<00:04:19.470> of<00:04:19.560> goodwill<00:04:20.090> particularly<00:04:21.090> when

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
little bit of goodwill particularly when

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.700 
little bit of goodwill particularly when
they<00:04:22.200> said<00:04:22.500> hey<00:04:22.740> it<00:04:23.070> wasn't<00:04:23.669> really<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.710> know

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
they said hey it wasn't really you know

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.330 
they said hey it wasn't really you know
easy<00:04:26.220> to<00:04:26.610> remove<00:04:26.910> connect

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
easy to remove connect

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.800 
easy to remove connect
it's<00:04:27.490> actually<00:04:27.580> part<00:04:27.970> of<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.210> experience<00:04:28.570> we

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
it's actually part of the experience we

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.689 
it's actually part of the experience we
can't<00:04:29.050> just<00:04:29.230> decouple<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:30.040> bloody<00:04:30.280> thing<00:04:30.580> you

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
can't just decouple the bloody thing you

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.340 
can't just decouple the bloody thing you
know<00:04:30.790> it's<00:04:30.910> it's<00:04:31.240> actually<00:04:31.660> part<00:04:32.110> of<00:04:32.290> the

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
know it's it's actually part of the

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.020 
know it's it's actually part of the
system<00:04:32.650> you<00:04:32.980> can't<00:04:33.190> just<00:04:33.370> flick<00:04:33.610> a<00:04:33.639> switch<00:04:33.760> and

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
system you can't just flick a switch and

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.080 
system you can't just flick a switch and
then<00:04:34.780> you<00:04:35.110> know<00:04:35.230> connect<00:04:35.560> suddenly<00:04:36.550> no<00:04:37.060> longer

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
then you know connect suddenly no longer

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.219 
then you know connect suddenly no longer
is<00:04:37.540> required<00:04:37.990> but<00:04:38.889> then<00:04:39.010> of<00:04:39.040> course<00:04:39.340> when<00:04:39.520> xbox

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
is required but then of course when xbox

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.379 
is required but then of course when xbox
finally<00:04:41.229> was<00:04:41.800> announced<00:04:42.340> with<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.639> decoupled

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
finally was announced with a decoupled

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:44.760 
finally was announced with a decoupled
connect<00:04:43.780> it<00:04:43.960> pissed<00:04:44.229> off<00:04:44.410> a<00:04:44.560> lot<00:04:44.590> of

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
connect it pissed off a lot of

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.070 
connect it pissed off a lot of
developers<00:04:45.430> and<00:04:45.639> so<00:04:46.150> developers<00:04:46.660> have<00:04:46.870> this

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
developers and so developers have this

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.770 
developers and so developers have this
situation<00:04:47.350> where<00:04:47.949> if<00:04:48.729> they're<00:04:49.060> developing<00:04:49.570> a

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
situation where if they're developing a

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.750 
situation where if they're developing a
cross<00:04:50.050> genres<00:04:50.080> game<00:04:50.979> that's<00:04:51.340> a<00:04:51.520> for<00:04:51.699> the

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
cross genres game that's a for the

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.420 
cross genres game that's a for the
PlayStation<00:04:52.210> 4<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:53.290> Xbox<00:04:53.320> one<00:04:53.889> and<00:04:53.919> PC

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
PlayStation 4 and the Xbox one and PC

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.719 
PlayStation 4 and the Xbox one and PC
they<00:04:55.389> have<00:04:55.570> to<00:04:55.720> say<00:04:55.900> hey<00:04:56.169> it's<00:04:56.740> not<00:04:57.070> just<00:04:57.490> that

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
they have to say hey it's not just that

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.180 
they have to say hey it's not just that
we're<00:04:58.240> developing<00:04:58.449> it<00:04:58.960> let's<00:04:59.169> just<00:04:59.290> for<00:05:00.100> the

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
we're developing it let's just for the

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.310 
we're developing it let's just for the
sake<00:05:00.400> of<00:05:00.430> argument<00:05:01.090> obviously<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:01.900> sales<00:05:02.139> on

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
sake of argument obviously the sales on

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.659 
sake of argument obviously the sales on
like<00:05:02.530> that<00:05:02.740> but<00:05:02.919> let's<00:05:03.040> just<00:05:03.250> say<00:05:03.400> for<00:05:03.430> the

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
like that but let's just say for the

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.330 
like that but let's just say for the
sake<00:05:03.850> of<00:05:03.910> my<00:05:04.270> sanity<00:05:04.330> and<00:05:05.020> ease<00:05:05.350> that<00:05:05.919> each<00:05:06.070> of

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
sake of my sanity and ease that each of

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.980 
sake of my sanity and ease that each of
the<00:05:06.460> consoles<00:05:06.910> got<00:05:07.060> exactly<00:05:07.510> the<00:05:07.630> same<00:05:07.870> amount

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
the consoles got exactly the same amount

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.350 
the consoles got exactly the same amount
of<00:05:08.260> sales<00:05:08.500> let's<00:05:09.130> say<00:05:09.310> each<00:05:09.490> copy<00:05:09.820> of<00:05:10.120> a<00:05:10.210> game

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
of sales let's say each copy of a game

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.810 
of sales let's say each copy of a game
sells<00:05:10.720> 1<00:05:10.900> million<00:05:11.290> copies<00:05:11.470> so<00:05:12.160> you<00:05:12.700> know

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
sells 1 million copies so you know

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.420 
sells 1 million copies so you know
one-third<00:05:13.540> of<00:05:13.690> the<00:05:13.840> total<00:05:13.990> copies<00:05:14.530> for<00:05:15.340> each

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
one-third of the total copies for each

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.270 
one-third of the total copies for each
of<00:05:15.669> the<00:05:15.850> three<00:05:16.300> systems<00:05:16.780> well<00:05:17.440> they're<00:05:18.070> not

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
of the three systems well they're not

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.770 
of the three systems well they're not
just<00:05:18.490> thinking<00:05:18.850> hey<00:05:19.060> we<00:05:19.240> need<00:05:19.419> to<00:05:19.539> develop

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
just thinking hey we need to develop

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.440 
just thinking hey we need to develop
this<00:05:20.470> functionality<00:05:21.070> for<00:05:21.729> you<00:05:22.330> know

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450

whatever<00:05:47.800> the<00:05:47.919> hell<00:05:48.070> they<00:05:48.220> want<00:05:48.340> to<00:05:48.490> do<00:05:48.639> so<00:05:48.880> I

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
whatever the hell they want to do so I

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.969 
whatever the hell they want to do so I
guess<00:05:49.270> it's<00:05:49.479> just<00:05:49.570> it's<00:05:50.320> just<00:05:50.470> one<00:05:50.800> of<00:05:50.830> those

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
guess it's just it's just one of those

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:54.900 
guess it's just it's just one of those
situations<00:05:51.370> but<00:05:52.770> personally<00:05:53.770> I<00:05:53.979> do<00:05:54.310> feel<00:05:54.849> that

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
situations but personally I do feel that

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.839 
situations but personally I do feel that
phil<00:05:55.419> has<00:05:55.690> kind<00:05:56.020> of<00:05:56.169> admitted<00:05:56.710> that<00:05:57.520> it

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
phil has kind of admitted that it

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.300 
phil has kind of admitted that it
doesn't<00:05:58.479> actually<00:05:58.740> bring<00:05:59.740> as<00:05:59.919> much<00:06:00.070> to<00:06:00.280> the

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
doesn't actually bring as much to the

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.150 
doesn't actually bring as much to the
table<00:06:00.580> as<00:06:00.880> maybe<00:06:01.120> Microsoft<00:06:01.450> had<00:06:01.930> hoped<00:06:02.289> and<00:06:02.620> I

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
table as maybe Microsoft had hoped and I

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.070 
table as maybe Microsoft had hoped and I
don't<00:06:03.430> think<00:06:03.639> that<00:06:03.760> necessarily<00:06:03.880> connect<00:06:04.840> is

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
don't think that necessarily connect is

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.610 
don't think that necessarily connect is
completely<00:06:05.830> devoid<00:06:06.340> of<00:06:06.820> use<00:06:07.120> but<00:06:08.050> you<00:06:08.470> know<00:06:08.590> a

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
completely devoid of use but you know a

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.070 
completely devoid of use but you know a
lot<00:06:08.919> of<00:06:08.979> games<00:06:09.280> it<00:06:09.520> just<00:06:09.729> doesn't<00:06:10.150> quite<00:06:10.450> fit

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
lot of games it just doesn't quite fit

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.740 
lot of games it just doesn't quite fit
with<00:06:11.560> the<00:06:11.830> genre<00:06:12.280> of<00:06:12.400> type<00:06:12.639> of<00:06:13.060> the<00:06:13.300> titles

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
things over to the hololens I find that

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.810 
things over to the hololens I find that
scenario<00:06:22.630> pretty<00:06:23.410> much<00:06:23.650> a<00:06:23.860> given<00:06:24.160> that

scenario pretty much a given that

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.719 
scenario pretty much a given that

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
eventually hollow lens type hololens

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.200 
eventually hollow lens type hololens
will<00:06:28.030> be<00:06:28.150> compatible<00:06:28.720> the<00:06:28.840> xbox<00:06:29.260> one<00:06:29.560> or

Carmack<00:07:10.790> at<00:07:10.970> this<00:07:11.120> point<00:07:11.420> but<00:07:12.230> I<00:07:12.440> think<00:07:12.800> it<00:07:12.920> has

Carmack at this point but I think it has

Carmack at this point but I think it has
a<00:07:13.340> lot<00:07:13.370> of<00:07:13.850> potential<00:07:14.450> and<00:07:14.810> I<00:07:15.020> think<00:07:15.350> hololens

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:24.920 
would be silly not to utilize it to its

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.360 
would be silly not to utilize it to its
