two<00:03:01.939> so<00:03:02.599> if<00:03:03.319> you<00:03:03.500> look<00:03:03.739> very<00:03:04.480> closely<00:03:05.480> just

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
two so if you look very closely just

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.809 
two so if you look very closely just
here<00:03:06.700> as<00:03:07.700> soon<00:03:07.939> as<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.209> hole<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:10.400> goes<00:03:10.639> through

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
here as soon as a hole that goes through

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.429 
here as soon as a hole that goes through
the<00:03:10.939> two<00:03:10.970> this<00:03:11.269> is<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.540> right<00:03:11.720> hand<00:03:11.989> side<00:03:12.200> one

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 
the two this is the right hand side one

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:17.619 
the two this is the right hand side one
so<00:03:15.250> get<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.280> cutting<00:03:16.519> mat<00:03:16.669> ready<00:03:16.910> because

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
so get a cutting mat ready because

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.659 
so get a cutting mat ready because
you'll<00:03:17.750> notice<00:03:17.900> that<00:03:18.230> this<00:03:18.410> has<00:03:18.590> got<00:03:18.769> a<00:03:19.069> raised

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
you'll notice that this has got a raised

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.699 
you'll notice that this has got a raised
edge<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.840> what<00:03:20.959> we<00:03:21.049> want<00:03:21.199> to<00:03:21.290> do<00:03:21.410> is<00:03:21.500> we<00:03:21.590> want

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
edge and what we want to do is we want

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.309 
edge and what we want to do is we want
to<00:03:21.769> place<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.160> upside<00:03:22.549> down<00:03:22.870> up<00:03:23.870> against<00:03:24.139> the

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
to place that upside down up against the

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.890 
to place that upside down up against the
edge<00:03:24.500> like<00:03:24.949> so<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:26.209> we're<00:03:26.449> going<00:03:26.599> to<00:03:26.629> be<00:03:26.720> then

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
edge like so and we're going to be then

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:34.899 
edge like so and we're going to be then
fixing<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:28.129> wing<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:32.109> end<00:03:33.109> plate<00:03:33.379> so<00:03:33.909> just

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
fixing the wing to the end plate so just

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:36.789 
fixing the wing to the end plate so just
test<00:03:35.180> fit<00:03:35.419> just<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:36.019> make<00:03:36.199> sure<00:03:36.440> that<00:03:36.650> that

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
test fit just to make sure that that

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.830 
test fit just to make sure that that
will<00:03:36.949> go<00:03:37.730> into<00:03:37.879> position<00:03:38.299> so<00:03:38.449> you<00:03:38.540> can<00:03:38.599> see

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
will go into position so you can see

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.809 
will go into position so you can see
what<00:03:38.989> we're<00:03:39.079> going<00:03:39.169> to<00:03:39.230> be<00:03:39.319> doing<00:03:39.579> okay<00:03:40.579> and

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
what we're going to be doing okay and

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.849 
what we're going to be doing okay and
then<00:03:41.000> get<00:03:41.209> your<00:03:41.389> plastic<00:03:41.930> adhesive<00:03:42.109> ready<00:03:42.560> and

then get your plastic adhesive ready and

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.920 
then get your plastic adhesive ready and
then<00:03:43.849> well<00:03:44.239> glue<00:03:44.810> that<00:03:44.959> into<00:03:45.169> position<00:03:46.930> once

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
then well glue that into position once

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.289 
then well glue that into position once
you've<00:03:48.079> done<00:03:48.199> that<00:03:48.260> get<00:03:49.040> right<00:03:49.280> angle<00:03:49.609> and

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
you've done that get right angle and

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.680 
you've done that get right angle and
just<00:03:50.359> place<00:03:50.750> it<00:03:50.780> on<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.859> base<00:03:52.010> of<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.280> plate

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
just place it on the base of the plate

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.960

something on top just to hold that just
to<00:05:09.450> make<00:05:09.630> sure<00:05:09.900> that<00:05:10.110> that<00:05:10.320> sits<00:05:10.890> nicely<00:05:11.360> once

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
to make sure that that sits nicely once

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.570 
to make sure that that sits nicely once
again<00:05:12.720> get<00:05:13.440> your<00:05:13.590> right<00:05:13.740> angle<00:05:13.950> and<00:05:14.280> put<00:05:14.460> it<00:05:14.520> up

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
again get your right angle and put it up

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.940 
again get your right angle and put it up
against<00:05:14.940> there<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:15.270> then<00:05:15.960> then<00:05:16.470> all<00:05:16.590> that<00:05:16.740> to

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
against there and then then all that to

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.130 
against there and then then all that to
dry<00:05:20.180> take<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.270> front<00:05:21.419> wing<00:05:21.600> assembly<00:05:21.870> that

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
dry take the front wing assembly that
