similar to the training I poster but
it's<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.920> little<00:00:17.210> tweaked<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.449> Zeon<00:00:18.779> because

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
in my opinion all you have to do is go

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.940 
in my opinion all you have to do is go
to<00:02:24.480> this<00:02:24.750> map<00:02:24.900> here<00:02:25.050> are<00:02:25.200> two<00:02:25.320> platforms<00:02:25.560> and

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
to this map here are two platforms and

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.890 
to this map here are two platforms and
do<00:02:26.310> one<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.910> your<00:02:26.970> openings<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.660> can<00:02:27.750> take

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
do one of your openings that can take

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.810 
do one of your openings that can take
down<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.260> lot<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.710> map<00:02:28.860> either<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.550> on

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820

down a lot of the map either that I on
thrust<00:02:30.150> or<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.870> move<00:02:31.280> yeah<00:02:32.280> it's<00:02:32.459> pretty

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.760 
thrust or this move yeah it's pretty
good<00:02:32.880> map<00:02:33.510> because<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.959> mainly<00:02:34.290> one<00:02:34.440> gets<00:02:34.650> to

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
good map because the mainly one gets to

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.590 
good map because the mainly one gets to
100<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.340> this<00:02:35.520> is<00:02:35.700> where<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.209> starts<00:02:36.570> getting
