fairy<00:03:35.340> tale<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.790> stay<00:03:36.150> maybe<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.959> celestial

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
fairy tale a stay maybe the celestial

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.410 
fairy tale a stay maybe the celestial
spirit<00:03:37.680> King<00:03:37.860> might<00:03:38.160> be<00:03:38.310> evil<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.700> stated<00:03:39.300> that

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
spirit King might be evil I stated that

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.150 
spirit King might be evil I stated that
well<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.900> bunch<00:03:40.170> of<00:03:40.260> Sheba's<00:03:40.590> said<00:03:40.770> that<00:03:40.950> maybe

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
well a bunch of Sheba's said that maybe

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.970 
well a bunch of Sheba's said that maybe
it<00:03:41.430> possibly<00:03:41.850> could<00:03:42.030> be<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.450> 13th<00:03:42.959> golden<00:03:43.440> key

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
it possibly could be the 13th golden key

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.190 
it possibly could be the 13th golden key
zodiac<00:03:44.520> it's<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.090> possibility<00:03:45.600> because<00:03:45.900> the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
zodiac it's a possibility because the

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.050 
zodiac it's a possibility because the
zodiac<00:03:46.650> is<00:03:46.830> shown<00:03:47.220> in<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.520> opening<00:03:47.850> ending

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
zodiac is shown in the opening ending

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.090 
zodiac is shown in the opening ending
song<00:03:48.270> briefly<00:03:49.020> and<00:03:49.350> we<00:03:49.590> don't<00:03:49.770> know<00:03:49.890> much

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
song briefly and we don't know much

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.010 
song briefly and we don't know much
about<00:03:50.310> this<00:03:50.850> zodiac<00:03:51.450> so<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:51.840> could<00:03:51.990> be

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
about this zodiac so it could be

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.010 
about this zodiac so it could be
possible<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.890> zodiac<00:03:53.100> is<00:03:53.520> evil<00:03:54.240> and<00:03:54.390> so

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
possible that the zodiac is evil and so

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.920 
possible that the zodiac is evil and so
that<00:03:55.709> could<00:03:56.010> be<00:03:56.190> possibly<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:57.030> final<00:03:57.510> villain

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
that could be possibly the final villain

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.770 
that could be possibly the final villain
of<00:03:58.110> this<00:03:58.830> arc<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.910> could<00:04:00.150> not<00:04:00.270> be<00:04:00.330> probably

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
of this arc and it could not be probably

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.150 
of this arc and it could not be probably
the<00:04:00.840> celestial<00:04:01.320> spirit<00:04:01.590> king<00:04:01.740> but<00:04:01.860> we'll<00:04:02.010> have

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
the celestial spirit king but we'll have

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.610 
the celestial spirit king but we'll have
to<00:04:02.340> see<00:04:02.490> exactly<00:04:02.640> where<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.270> goes<00:04:03.300> now<00:04:04.140> for<00:04:04.530> the
