golden<00:00:46.789> lotus<00:00:46.940> reps<00:00:47.329> as<00:00:47.739> you<00:00:48.739> can<00:00:48.949> see<00:00:49.070> I

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
golden lotus reps as you can see I

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.430 
golden lotus reps as you can see I
killed<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.609> pile<00:00:49.850> of<00:00:50.089> various<00:00:50.870> critters<00:00:51.230> and

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
killed a pile of various critters and

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.180 
killed a pile of various critters and
even<00:00:52.370> some<00:00:52.519> mogu<00:00:52.820> over<00:00:53.059> there<00:00:54.129> over<00:00:55.129> there

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
even some mogu over there over there

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.169 
even some mogu over there over there
somewhere<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.980> everything<00:00:57.980> gave<00:00:58.489> me<00:00:58.670> 10<00:00:58.910> rep

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
somewhere and everything gave me 10 rep

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:02.579 
somewhere and everything gave me 10 rep
so<00:00:59.660> I<00:00:59.960> guess<00:01:00.589> that's<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:00.920> make<00:01:01.160> up<00:01:01.339> for<00:01:01.609> it<00:01:01.699> and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
so I guess that's the make up for it and

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:04.660 
so I guess that's the make up for it and
you<00:01:03.589> know<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.859> loss<00:01:04.070> of<00:01:04.280> all<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.550> other

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
you know the loss of all the other

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.140 
you know the loss of all the other
quests<00:01:05.120> so<00:01:05.900> let's<00:01:06.890> go<00:01:07.040> ahead<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:07.400> turn<00:01:07.940> these

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150

what's this other one gave me we must

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.370 
what's this other one gave me we must
not<00:01:40.619> ok<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:41.679> they<00:01:41.920> all<00:01:42.039> give<00:01:42.220> you<00:01:42.250> 300<00:01:42.789> rep<00:01:43.380> I'm

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
not ok so they all give you 300 rep I'm

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.149 
not ok so they all give you 300 rep I'm
assuming<00:01:45.159> that's<00:01:45.280> before<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:45.880> double<00:01:46.570> rep

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
assuming that's before the double rep

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.359 
assuming that's before the double rep
from<00:01:48.159> having<00:01:48.460> another<00:01:48.700> one<00:01:48.880> at<00:01:49.000> revered

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
from having another one at revered

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.800 
from having another one at revered
because<00:01:51.369> it's<00:01:51.610> not<00:01:51.789> showing<00:01:52.060> up<00:01:52.270> here<00:01:52.479> so<00:01:52.780> I

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
because it's not showing up here so I

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.139 
because it's not showing up here so I
would<00:01:53.200> assume<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.860> at<00:01:54.070> that<00:01:54.100> point<00:01:54.429> if

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
would assume that at that point if

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.389 
would assume that at that point if
you're<00:01:55.329> running<00:01:55.509> it<00:01:55.750> on<00:01:55.810> alt<00:01:56.289> you<00:01:57.159> would<00:01:57.280> get

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
you're running it on alt you would get

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.559 
you're running it on alt you would get
600<00:01:58.030> per<00:01:59.340> yeah<00:02:00.340> that<00:02:00.729> pretty<00:02:00.819> much<00:02:00.940> makes<00:02:01.330> up

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
600 per yeah that pretty much makes up

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.029 
600 per yeah that pretty much makes up
for<00:02:01.780> it<00:02:01.869> I'm<00:02:01.959> assuming<00:02:02.350> that's<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.770> whole

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
for it I'm assuming that's the whole

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.120 
for it I'm assuming that's the whole
point<00:02:03.280> it's<00:02:04.240> not<00:02:04.420> impossible<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.500> get<00:02:05.679> golden

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
point it's not impossible to get golden

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.789 
point it's not impossible to get golden
lotus<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.520> exult<00:02:06.729> it<00:02:06.939> anymore<00:02:07.530> or<00:02:08.530> I<00:02:08.560> guess<00:02:08.709> I

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
lotus to exult it anymore or I guess I

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:14.130 
lotus to exult it anymore or I guess I
