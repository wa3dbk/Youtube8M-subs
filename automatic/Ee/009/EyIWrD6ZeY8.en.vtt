00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 and people who are still going to 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.700
 video I'll be talking about the camera 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.700
 iphone 5 s 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.630
 good one of the great news of the iphone 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.570
 5 s was your camera it stays with 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.280
 the 8 megapixels of the iphone 5 however now 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.470
 As you can see, it is equipped with 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.110
 dual flash this improves on lighting 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.030
 when a photo taken with flash 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.100
 but not only that the camera also had 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.260
 an improvement when a picture taken in the 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.480
 dark without flash beyond the apple 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.850
 also implemented the template bust that is the 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.190
 so it takes ten photos per second and 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.650
 also in addition the iphone 5 s also 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.640
 record videos or motion sa 120 frames 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.140
 per second 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.940
 a first function that I'm going to show 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.430
 for you bust function so that 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.780
 take ten photos a second and under you 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.540
 enter here in the photo app 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.540
 and hold the take photo button. 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.830
 You can see that he's taking 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.830
 several and many photos many same photos 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.390
 these can see that I will have 79 photos and 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.250
 she's all here the coolest 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.840
 because it groups you can see that in 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.160
 that the photos in the photos are 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.320
 grouped 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.810
 so you can select your photo 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.420
 let's say more sharp favorite then this 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.310
 is really cool is the quality is also super 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.440
 good another resource as well 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.570
 I find it very interesting from iphone 5 is if 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.400
 is that it can record videos in slow 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.670
 motion you have this small option here 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.280
 in the camera application that records the 120 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.930
 frames per second and that's pretty cool 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.370
 I'm going to record a very fast video, come on. 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.110
 put with flash to have a better 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.450
 quality always likes to have a 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.010
 Top quality bonus I'm motion I 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:04.670
 I'll do it here with my finger on 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:07.640
 Go ahead, come on, let's stop. 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.330
 the recording we will now see as 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.200
 was the video here I can hit the 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.409
 place 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.269
 I mean the right frame, right? 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.620
 sure I want your motion 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.870
 so let's assume that it 's just that I do not want to 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.530
 This is what I put in this part, yes and 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.040
 part here the slow motion for certain 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.280
 A little before and now let's play 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.280
 on here 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:39.300
 You can see I'm moving. 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.310
 so that's pretty cool what does not 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.300
 very good for making a cool video with 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.250
 slow motion 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.560
 but I already did several and it was good 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.350
 interesting soon you are posting there 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.000
 some examples of slow motion viruses in the 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.250
 my channel and something else that 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.920
 I was surprised it was in the double flash that 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.080
 Apple implemented the iphone 5 is if it 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.390
 is much better than the iphone 5's 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.460
 colors are much more real let's say so 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.920
 of photos with a flash shot and 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.780
 so what I found really cool and if I 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.270
 I'm not mistaken, too, the flash is a bit 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.670
 stronger and so little with a little color 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.280
 different now has two colors have the color 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.860
 abnormal white and one with a little more 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.430
 that it is just to have 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.050
 keep the actual colors of the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.700
 flash does not turn white when 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.370
 You, for example, take a photo with the 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.440
 iphone 5 so that's cool 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.420
