found<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.539> there<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.350> think<00:00:52.739> about<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.010> book

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
found it there I think about this book

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.529 
found it there I think about this book
is<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.460> was<00:00:54.410> it<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:55.559> pressed<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.160> 1998<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
is it was it was pressed in 1998 so the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.049 
is it was it was pressed in 1998 so the
pricing<00:00:58.219> and<00:00:59.219> probably<00:00:59.640> some<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
pricing and probably some of the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.610 
pricing and probably some of the
listings<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> little<00:01:00.899> bit<00:01:01.020> dated<00:01:01.260> but

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
listings are a little bit dated but

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.130 
listings are a little bit dated but
there's<00:01:02.219> great<00:01:02.969> information<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.809> here<00:01:03.989> it's

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
there's great information in here it's

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.010 
there's great information in here it's

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
written by Bill little Coulter it's

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.609 
written by Bill little Coulter it's
apparently<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.760> as<00:01:08.760> obsession<00:01:09.600> from<00:01:09.840> clearly

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
apparently a as obsession from clearly

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.310 
apparently a as obsession from clearly
more<00:01:10.770> obsessed<00:01:11.159> than<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.430> am<00:01:11.640> about<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.479> NASCAR

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
more obsessed than I am about a NASCAR

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.609 
more obsessed than I am about a NASCAR
model<00:01:13.890> building<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:15.140> NASCAR<00:01:16.140> probably<00:01:16.530> in

general<00:01:17.270> but<00:01:18.270> anyway<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:19.259> think<00:01:19.860> because<00:01:20.100> it's

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
general but anyway I think because it's

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.310
