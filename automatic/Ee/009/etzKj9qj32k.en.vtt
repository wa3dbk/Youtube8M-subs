there and then once it's screwed all the
way<00:02:09.700> in<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:11.560> end<00:02:12.180> will<00:02:13.180> actually<00:02:13.660> attach

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
way in this end will actually attach

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.710 
way in this end will actually attach
right<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:15.100> your<00:02:15.250> oxygen<00:02:15.579> machine<00:02:16.150> right<00:02:16.420> above

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
right to your oxygen machine right above

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.150 
right to your oxygen machine right above
the<00:02:17.650> dial<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.370> then<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.090> can<00:02:19.299> take<00:02:19.570> this<00:02:19.780> jar

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
the dial and then you can take this jar

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.920 
the dial and then you can take this jar
and<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.370> can<00:02:21.550> set<00:02:21.790> it<00:02:21.940> right<00:02:22.150> in<00:02:22.210> there<00:02:22.660> and

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
and you can set it right in there and

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.250 
and you can set it right in there and
that's<00:02:23.320> a<00:02:23.470> nice<00:02:23.620> little<00:02:23.920> holder<00:02:24.430> for<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:25.260> then

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
that's a nice little holder for it then

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.740 
that's a nice little holder for it then
on<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.590> end<00:02:26.710> of<00:02:26.890> your<00:02:26.950> jar<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:28.300> want<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.570> take

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
rinse it out and let it dry and then you

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.830 
rinse it out and let it dry and then you
can<00:03:23.320> replace<00:03:23.770> it<00:03:24.070> on<00:03:24.190> your<00:03:24.430> machine<00:03:24.580> you<00:03:25.060> just

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
can replace it on your machine you just

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.560 
can replace it on your machine you just
screw<00:03:26.170> it<00:03:26.320> on<00:03:26.500> one<00:03:27.250> problem<00:03:27.550> that<00:03:27.910> commonly

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
screw it on one problem that commonly

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.430 
screw it on one problem that commonly
happens<00:03:29.370> as<00:03:30.370> you<00:03:30.640> screw<00:03:31.000> this<00:03:31.180> on<00:03:31.420> and<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:32.230> can

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
happens as you screw this on and you can

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
happens as you screw this on and you can
see<00:03:32.680> here<00:03:32.980> how<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:33.190> lids<00:03:33.520> not<00:03:33.790> on<00:03:34.000> all<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.330> way

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
see here how the lids not on all the way

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.770 
see here how the lids not on all the way
so<00:03:36.460> just<00:03:36.990> unscrew<00:03:37.990> it<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.980> then<00:03:39.190> re<00:03:39.510> screw<00:03:40.510> the

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
so just unscrew it and then re screw the

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.780 
so just unscrew it and then re screw the
jar<00:03:41.020> on<00:03:41.050> to<00:03:41.440> make<00:03:41.620> sure<00:03:41.830> it's<00:03:42.040> connected<00:03:42.400> all

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
jar on to make sure it's connected all

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.900 
jar on to make sure it's connected all
the<00:03:42.820> way<00:03:43.920> sometimes<00:03:44.920> when<00:03:45.280> you're<00:03:45.430> using<00:03:45.460> the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
the way sometimes when you're using the

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.240 
the way sometimes when you're using the
humidifier<00:03:46.510> jar<00:03:46.930> you<00:03:47.380> will<00:03:47.530> not<00:03:47.680> feel<00:03:48.040> any

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
humidifier jar you will not feel any

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.330 
humidifier jar you will not feel any
oxygen<00:03:48.910> coming<00:03:49.240> out<00:03:49.510> one<00:03:50.290> way<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.590> check<00:03:51.040> that

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
oxygen coming out one way to check that

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.780 
oxygen coming out one way to check that
is<00:03:51.910> to<00:03:52.030> actually<00:03:52.360> disconnect<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:54.130> humidifier

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
is to actually disconnect the humidifier

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.650 
is to actually disconnect the humidifier
jar<00:03:55.180> from<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:56.170> concentrator<00:03:57.420> remove<00:03:58.420> your

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
jar from the concentrator remove your

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.230 
jar from the concentrator remove your
oxygen<00:03:59.230> tubing<00:03:59.650> from<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.010> humidifier<00:04:00.790> jar

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
oxygen tubing from the humidifier jar

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.680 
oxygen tubing from the humidifier jar
and<00:04:01.740> then<00:04:02.740> you<00:04:02.920> can<00:04:03.130> connect<00:04:03.640> your<00:04:04.420> oxygen

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
and then you can connect your oxygen

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.949 
and then you can connect your oxygen
tubing<00:04:05.320> directly<00:04:05.890> to<00:04:06.100> your<00:04:06.250> machine<00:04:06.700> now<00:04:06.970> if

tubing directly to your machine now if

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.110 
tubing directly to your machine now if
you're<00:04:08.140> getting<00:04:08.290> oxygen<00:04:09.100> you<00:04:09.670> know<00:04:09.820> there's<00:04:10.060> a

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
you're getting oxygen you know there's a

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.040 
you're getting oxygen you know there's a
problem<00:04:10.480> with<00:04:10.750> your<00:04:10.930> humidifier<00:04:11.440> jar<00:04:13.050> another

problem with your humidifier jar another

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.050 
problem with your humidifier jar another
way<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.350> check<00:04:14.740> if<00:04:14.920> you're<00:04:15.070> getting<00:04:15.400> oxygen<00:04:15.910> is

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
way to check if you're getting oxygen is

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.810 
way to check if you're getting oxygen is
to<00:04:16.239> take<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.690> end<00:04:16.900> of<00:04:17.140> your<00:04:17.200> cannula<00:04:17.950> that
