in Santa Barbara in California and it's

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.680 
in Santa Barbara in California and it's
literally<00:02:56.890> probably<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.820> best<00:02:58.060> purchase<00:02:58.540> of

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
literally probably the best purchase of

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.420 
literally probably the best purchase of
my<00:02:58.840> life<00:02:58.989> this<00:02:59.320> is<00:02:59.440> perfect<00:02:59.650> for<00:03:00.010> me<00:03:00.130> not<00:03:00.310> only

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
my life this is perfect for me not only

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.130 
my life this is perfect for me not only
for<00:03:00.700> school<00:03:00.970> but<00:03:01.150> for<00:03:01.299> you<00:03:01.450> ship<00:03:01.630> as<00:03:01.750> well<00:03:01.780> and

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
for school but for you ship as well and

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.620 
for school but for you ship as well and
this<00:03:02.320> is<00:03:02.500> because<00:03:02.890> as<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:03.670> can<00:03:03.700> see<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.390> month

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
this is because as you can see the month

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.140 
this is because as you can see the month
is<00:03:04.840> laid<00:03:05.080> out<00:03:05.110> on<00:03:05.290> just<00:03:05.680> two<00:03:05.950> pages<00:03:06.459> so<00:03:07.030> you

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
is laid out on just two pages so you

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.759 
is laid out on just two pages so you
probably<00:03:07.390> can't<00:03:07.750> see<00:03:07.870> your<00:03:08.079> writing<00:03:08.410> but<00:03:08.560> here
