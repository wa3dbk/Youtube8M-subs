about what the perimeter is the four

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:30.070 
about what the perimeter is the four
corners<00:01:17.790> won't<00:01:18.330> do<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.570> very<00:01:18.780> quickly

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.230

they're<00:02:00.210> basically<00:02:01.210> ideas<00:02:01.630> just<00:02:01.840> think<00:02:02.020> up

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
they're basically ideas just think up

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.510 
they're basically ideas just think up
the<00:02:02.230> four<00:02:02.410> corners<00:02:02.830> kept<00:02:03.040> it<00:02:03.130> kind<00:02:03.280> of<00:02:03.340> loose

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
and everything because there's plenty of

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.200 
and everything because there's plenty of
justments<00:02:05.050> to<00:02:05.110> be<00:02:05.200> done<00:02:08.820> I'm<00:02:09.820> gonna<00:02:09.940> take<00:02:10.060> my

and what I like to do I like the POE to

00:02:18.760 --> 00:03:24.170 
and what I like to do I like the POE to
be<00:02:18.940> slightly<00:02:19.240> tilted<00:02:19.900> outward

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.660
