hopefully<00:01:48.240> without<00:01:48.570> too<00:01:48.869> many<00:01:49.020> entries<00:01:49.680> and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
hopefully without too many entries and

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.889 
hopefully without too many entries and
too<00:01:50.040> much<00:01:50.189> fatigue<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.149> yes<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.570> think<00:01:51.600> you're

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
too much fatigue so yes I think you're

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.069 
too much fatigue so yes I think you're
going<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.079> see<00:01:52.140> them<00:01:52.380> go<00:01:52.860> out<00:01:53.070> try<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.000> play<00:01:54.840> an

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
going to see them go out try and play an

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.690 
going to see them go out try and play an
acceptable<00:01:55.590> fashion<00:01:56.009> not<00:01:56.219> expend<00:01:56.549> too<00:01:56.670> much

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
acceptable fashion not expend too much

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.149 
acceptable fashion not expend too much
energy<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.600> win<00:01:57.840> against<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.320> team<00:01:58.530> who<00:01:58.950> have

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
energy but win against a team who have

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.069 
energy but win against a team who have
actually<00:01:59.369> lost<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.090> lot<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.600> players<00:02:00.810> but

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
actually lost a lot of the players but

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.660 
actually lost a lot of the players but
took<00:02:01.259> them<00:02:01.469> into<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.799> qualification<00:02:02.490> for

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
took them into the qualification for

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.430 
took them into the qualification for
this<00:02:02.759> competition<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.509> first<00:02:03.719> place

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
this competition in the first place

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.570 
this competition in the first place
do<00:02:05.530> you<00:02:05.620> think<00:02:05.890> we<00:02:06.010> are<00:02:06.100> going<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.400> see

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
do you think we are going to see

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.010 
do you think we are going to see
Tottenham<00:02:06.910> slightly<00:02:07.270> fatigued<00:02:07.630> with<00:02:07.870> the

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
Tottenham slightly fatigued with the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.630 
Tottenham slightly fatigued with the
travel<00:02:08.260> here<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.860> obviously<00:02:09.130> with<00:02:09.430> the<00:02:09.460> two

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
travel here and obviously with the two

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.600 
travel here and obviously with the two
matches<00:02:09.970> on<00:02:10.090> either<00:02:10.210> side<00:02:10.479> of<00:02:10.510> the<00:02:10.630> weekend<00:02:10.990> I

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
matches on either side of the weekend I

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.980 
matches on either side of the weekend I
think<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:12.970> big<00:02:13.180> ask<00:02:13.330> full<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.840> in

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
think it is a big ask full of it in

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.200 
think it is a big ask full of it in
there<00:02:14.290> there<00:02:15.130> bourbonnais<00:02:15.520> I<00:02:15.640> suppose<00:02:15.940> is

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
there there bourbonnais I suppose is

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.210 
there there bourbonnais I suppose is
that<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:17.080> two<00:02:17.260> games<00:02:17.530> either<00:02:17.710> site<00:02:18.040> or

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
that the two games either site or

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.860 
that the two games either site or
against<00:02:18.430> London<00:02:18.670> team<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:19.240> it's<00:02:19.390> not<00:02:19.630> like

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
against London team so it's not like

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.470 
against London team so it's not like
they've<00:02:20.290> got<00:02:20.470> fly<00:02:21.190> back<00:02:21.460> from<00:02:21.700> Dagestan<00:02:22.240> and

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
they've got fly back from Dagestan and

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.910 
they've got fly back from Dagestan and
immediately<00:02:22.960> jump<00:02:23.200> on<00:02:23.320> another<00:02:23.530> plane<00:02:23.740> and

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
immediately jump on another plane and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.500 
immediately jump on another plane and
fly<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.160> new<00:02:24.460> castle<00:02:24.640> or<00:02:24.970> something<00:02:25.120> like<00:02:25.450> that

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
fly to new castle or something like that

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.150 
fly to new castle or something like that
so<00:02:26.200> they'll<00:02:26.320> be<00:02:26.410> quite<00:02:26.500> happy<00:02:26.710> about<00:02:26.860> that

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
so they'll be quite happy about that

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.600 
so they'll be quite happy about that
that's<00:02:27.370> for<00:02:27.430> sure<00:02:27.640> but<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.630> think<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:29.610> they're

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
that's for sure but I think that they're

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.430 
that's for sure but I think that they're
going<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.850> obviously<00:02:31.210> be<00:02:31.750> looking<00:02:32.290> to

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
going to obviously be looking to

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.200 
going to obviously be looking to
conserve<00:02:32.830> some<00:02:33.160> energy<00:02:33.220> whilst<00:02:33.820> they're<00:02:34.060> out

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
conserve some energy whilst they're out

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.970 
conserve some energy whilst they're out
there<00:02:34.480> they<00:02:34.720> feel<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:35.440> they<00:02:35.590> should<00:02:35.620> come

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
there they feel that they should come

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.380 
there they feel that they should come
through<00:02:36.160> this<00:02:36.310> group<00:02:36.520> stage<00:02:36.760> fairly<00:02:37.210> easily

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
through this group stage fairly easily

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.290 
through this group stage fairly easily
and<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:38.920> think<00:02:39.310> yes<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:39.760> can<00:02:39.820> look<00:02:40.030> for<00:02:40.180> that

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
and so I think yes you can look for that

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.060 
and so I think yes you can look for that
to<00:02:40.390> be<00:02:40.480> an<00:02:40.570> impact<00:02:40.810> rolling<00:02:41.290> on<00:02:41.380> thank<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:41.950> to

where they're not expected to but also
to<00:03:12.370> do<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.910> hard<00:03:13.209> work<00:03:13.239> as<00:03:13.660> well<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.230> go<00:03:14.590> out

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
to do the hard work as well so to go out

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.310 
to do the hard work as well so to go out
to<00:03:15.100> places<00:03:15.370> like<00:03:15.580> antsy<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.360> pick<00:03:16.900> up<00:03:17.050> three

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
to places like antsy and pick up three

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.750 
to places like antsy and pick up three
points<00:03:17.739> and<00:03:17.830> I<00:03:17.890> think<00:03:18.160> that's<00:03:18.310> what<00:03:18.489> we<00:03:18.610> can

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
points and I think that's what we can

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.160 
points and I think that's what we can
expect<00:03:18.880> them<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.300> do<00:03:19.480> we<00:03:19.900> can<00:03:20.020> certainly

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
expect them to do we can certainly

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.240 
expect them to do we can certainly
expect<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.680> make<00:03:20.770> it<00:03:20.830> through<00:03:21.070> to<00:03:21.160> the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
expect to make it through to the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.860 
expect to make it through to the
knockout<00:03:21.400> stages<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.150> I<00:03:22.180> wouldn't<00:03:22.480> be<00:03:22.570> at<00:03:22.660> all

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
knockout stages and I wouldn't be at all

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.380 
knockout stages and I wouldn't be at all
surprised<00:03:23.320> to<00:03:23.350> see<00:03:23.620> them<00:03:23.709> go<00:03:23.830> on<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.040> win<00:03:24.160> this
