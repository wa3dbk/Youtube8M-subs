people<00:01:47.040> usually<00:01:47.310> make<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.759> are<00:01:48.119> only<00:01:48.329> on

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
people usually make that are only on

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.100 
people usually make that are only on
console<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.380> then<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.590> get<00:01:49.710> called<00:01:49.979> dude<00:01:50.189> so

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
console and then you get called dude so

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.410 
console and then you get called dude so
there's<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.680> few<00:01:53.579> years<00:01:53.610> ago<00:01:53.880> if<00:01:54.240> you

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
there's that a few years ago if you

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.020 
there's that a few years ago if you
owned<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.720> pc<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.320> probably<00:01:55.950> wasn't<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.610> gaming

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
owned a pc it probably wasn't for gaming

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.270 
owned a pc it probably wasn't for gaming
it<00:01:57.210> was<00:01:57.329> probably<00:01:57.750> for<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.979> know<00:01:59.100> like

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
it was probably for you know like

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.580 
it was probably for you know like
surfing<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> web<00:02:00.119> or<00:02:00.390> maybe<00:02:00.630> editing<00:02:01.200> videos

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
surfing the web or maybe editing videos

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
if you're into the YouTube scene then I

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.899 
if you're into the YouTube scene then I

past year so PC gaming is kind of snuck

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.820 
past year so PC gaming is kind of snuck
up<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:09.000> me

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
up on me

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.620 
up on me
of<00:02:10.220> course<00:02:10.490> from<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.700> new<00:02:10.850> era<00:02:11.090> of<00:02:11.180> gaming<00:02:11.570> we

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
of course from the new era of gaming we

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.350 
of course from the new era of gaming we
have<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.780> lot<00:02:12.080> more<00:02:12.260> than<00:02:12.470> just<00:02:12.500> pc<00:02:13.220> gaming<00:02:13.520> we

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
have a lot more than just pc gaming we

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.020 
have a lot more than just pc gaming we
have<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.570> new<00:02:14.690> xbox<00:02:15.200> one<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:15.470> ps4<00:02:16.000> although<00:02:17.000> i

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
have the new xbox one and ps4 although i

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.480 
have the new xbox one and ps4 although i
don't<00:02:17.180> think<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:17.930> those<00:02:18.740> are<00:02:18.770> really<00:02:19.370> going

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
don't think that those are really going

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.020 
don't think that those are really going
to<00:02:19.580> be<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.700> big<00:02:20.060> of<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.210> deal<00:02:21.460> because<00:02:22.460> you

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
to be that big of a deal because you

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.850 
to be that big of a deal because you
know<00:02:23.120> people<00:02:23.300> i<00:02:23.840> just<00:02:24.230> don't<00:02:24.410> think<00:02:24.560> people

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
know people i just don't think people

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.650 
know people i just don't think people
are<00:02:24.980> that<00:02:25.130> excited<00:02:25.520> about<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:26.060> if<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.210> think

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
are that excited about it if you think

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.980 
are that excited about it if you think
back<00:02:26.810> 20<00:02:27.020> 360<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.070> ps3<00:02:28.250> came<00:02:28.670> out<00:02:28.900> people<00:02:29.900> are

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
back 20 360 and ps3 came out people are

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.780 
back 20 360 and ps3 came out people are
a<00:02:30.020> lot<00:02:30.170> more<00:02:30.200> excited<00:02:30.800> then<00:02:30.980> mainly<00:02:31.640> because

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
a lot more excited then mainly because

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.850 
a lot more excited then mainly because
back<00:02:32.120> then<00:02:32.150> gaining<00:02:32.660> was<00:02:33.020> dominated<00:02:33.860> by

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
back then gaining was dominated by

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.820 
back then gaining was dominated by
consoles<00:02:34.990> also<00:02:35.990> we<00:02:36.140> have<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.380> new<00:02:36.500> steam

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
consoles also we have the new steam

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.830 
consoles also we have the new steam
machines<00:02:37.190> which<00:02:37.400> i<00:02:37.550> guess<00:02:37.760> arguably<00:02:38.390> could<00:02:38.480> be

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
machines which i guess arguably could be

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.530 
machines which i guess arguably could be
placed<00:02:39.140> into<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.530> pc<00:02:39.890> category<00:02:40.370> but<00:02:40.670> i<00:02:40.940> think

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
placed into the pc category but i think

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.790 
placed into the pc category but i think
they're<00:02:41.690> worth<00:02:41.840> mentioning<00:02:42.410> because<00:02:42.530> it

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
they're worth mentioning because it

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.070 
they're worth mentioning because it
makes<00:02:42.950> pc<00:02:43.430> gaming<00:02:43.760> sound<00:02:44.270> a<00:02:44.450> lot<00:02:44.660> better<00:02:44.720> to

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
makes pc gaming sound a lot better to

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.660 
makes pc gaming sound a lot better to
someone<00:02:45.350> who's<00:02:45.470> been<00:02:45.590> playing<00:02:45.770> console<00:02:46.520> for

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
someone who's been playing console for

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.880 
someone who's been playing console for
the<00:02:46.760> past<00:02:46.940> seven<00:02:47.330> years<00:02:47.740> because<00:02:48.740> they're

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
the past seven years because they're

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.420 
the past seven years because they're
basically<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.870> console<00:02:50.870> that<00:02:51.110> blaze<00:02:51.709> pc<00:02:52.190> games

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
basically a console that blaze pc games

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.260 
basically a console that blaze pc games
they<00:02:52.700> even<00:02:52.910> have<00:02:53.030> their<00:02:53.120> own<00:02:53.209> little

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
they even have their own little

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.140 
they even have their own little
controller<00:02:53.810> for<00:02:54.080> for<00:02:54.740> though<00:02:54.890> see<00:02:55.580> machines

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.699 

next<00:02:59.150> we<00:02:59.330> have<00:02:59.420> virtual<00:02:59.900> reality<00:03:00.380> gaming

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
next we have virtual reality gaming

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.830 
next we have virtual reality gaming
which<00:03:01.010> includes<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.640> oculus<00:03:02.300> rift<00:03:02.630> and

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
which includes the oculus rift and

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.260 
which includes the oculus rift and
Sony's<00:03:03.410> version<00:03:03.860> of<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.280> oculus<00:03:04.730> rift<00:03:05.030> that

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
Sony's version of the oculus rift that

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.010 
Sony's version of the oculus rift that
they<00:03:05.810> call<00:03:06.050> project<00:03:07.030> Morpheus<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.330> think<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:08.810> saw

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
they call project Morpheus I think I saw

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.500 
they call project Morpheus I think I saw
that<00:03:09.170> right<00:03:09.410> but<00:03:10.190> I'm<00:03:10.280> not<00:03:10.340> really<00:03:10.490> sure<00:03:10.670> but

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
that right but I'm not really sure but

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.480 
that right but I'm not really sure but
these<00:03:11.870> two<00:03:12.020> vices<00:03:12.260> allow<00:03:12.650> certain<00:03:12.950> games<00:03:13.280> like

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
these two vices allow certain games like

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.910 
these two vices allow certain games like
Minecraft<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.330> slender<00:03:14.750> man<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.230> watch

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
Minecraft and slender man and watch

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.060 
Minecraft and slender man and watch
other<00:03:16.160> games<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.850> become<00:03:17.600> almost<00:03:18.070> virtual

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
other games to become almost virtual

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.610 
other games to become almost virtual
reality<00:03:19.550> I<00:03:20.060> say<00:03:20.600> almost<00:03:20.870> because<00:03:21.110> there's

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
reality I say almost because there's

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.229 
reality I say almost because there's
definitely<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.100> few<00:03:22.310> things<00:03:22.459> that<00:03:22.700> can<00:03:22.820> work<00:03:22.970> on

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
definitely a few things that can work on

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.259 
definitely a few things that can work on
to<00:03:23.630> improve<00:03:24.019> both<00:03:24.260> devices<00:03:24.650> like<00:03:25.640> sometimes

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
to improve both devices like sometimes

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.640 
to improve both devices like sometimes
when<00:03:26.450> you<00:03:26.540> turn<00:03:26.720> your<00:03:26.900> head<00:03:27.050> you<00:03:27.290> have<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:27.500> turn

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
when you turn your head you have to turn

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.740 
when you turn your head you have to turn
it<00:03:27.800> really<00:03:28.459> far<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:28.940> see<00:03:29.120> something<00:03:29.540> in<00:03:29.660> the

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
it really far to see something in the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.280 
it really far to see something in the
game<00:03:30.400> so<00:03:31.400> I<00:03:31.790> guess<00:03:32.030> that<00:03:32.060> it<00:03:32.870> just<00:03:33.080> seems<00:03:33.230> like

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
game so I guess that it just seems like

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.590 
game so I guess that it just seems like
they've<00:03:33.470> become<00:03:33.890> annoying<00:03:34.640> so<00:03:35.120> maybe<00:03:35.450> they

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
they've become annoying so maybe they

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.229 
they've become annoying so maybe they
could<00:03:35.780> add<00:03:35.959> some<00:03:35.989> type<00:03:36.470> of<00:03:36.500> like<00:03:37.430> calibration

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
could add some type of like calibration

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.790 
could add some type of like calibration
system<00:03:38.420> that<00:03:38.870> works<00:03:39.019> with<00:03:39.230> different<00:03:39.560> games

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
system that works with different games

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.890 
system that works with different games
so<00:03:40.580> that<00:03:40.790> you<00:03:40.880> can<00:03:41.030> adjust<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.570> sensitivity

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
so that you can adjust the sensitivity

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.440 
so that you can adjust the sensitivity
and<00:03:42.500> calibrate<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.220> device<00:03:43.610> perfectly<00:03:44.239> for

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
and calibrate the device perfectly for

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.840 
and calibrate the device perfectly for
each<00:03:44.540> game<00:03:45.220> also<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.340> fact<00:03:46.489> that<00:03:46.610> when<00:03:46.790> you

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
each game also the fact that when you

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.420 
each game also the fact that when you
try<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.150> record<00:03:47.480> a<00:03:47.630> game<00:03:47.840> while<00:03:48.140> using<00:03:48.440> it<00:03:48.739> the

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
try and record a game while using it the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.640 
try and record a game while using it the
oculus<00:03:49.820> rift<00:03:50.060> anyways<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:50.930> have<00:03:51.200> really<00:03:51.470> seen

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
oculus rift anyways I have really seen

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.160 
oculus rift anyways I have really seen
this<00:03:51.800> with<00:03:51.950> project<00:03:52.670> Morpheus<00:03:53.239> but<00:03:53.959> when<00:03:54.140> you

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
this with project Morpheus but when you

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.370 
this with project Morpheus but when you
try<00:03:54.350> and<00:03:54.410> record<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.739> game<00:03:54.950> using<00:03:55.160> it<00:03:55.370> like

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
try and record a game using it like

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.410 
try and record a game using it like
splits<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:57.650> game<00:03:57.860> into<00:03:58.670> two<00:03:58.910> because<00:03:59.300> you're

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
splits the game into two because you're

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.060 
splits the game into two because you're
supposed<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.810> be<00:03:59.959> like<00:04:00.200> looking<00:04:00.560> at<00:04:00.709> it<00:04:00.890> with

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
supposed to be like looking at it with

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.009 
supposed to be like looking at it with
both<00:04:01.250> eyes<00:04:01.459> so<00:04:01.790> it<00:04:01.910> makes<00:04:02.269> it<00:04:02.390> weird<00:04:02.810> whenever

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
both eyes so it makes it weird whenever

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.410 
both eyes so it makes it weird whenever
you<00:04:03.260> record<00:04:03.680> it<00:04:03.769> and<00:04:03.890> see<00:04:04.070> it<00:04:04.190> and<00:04:05.180> it<00:04:05.300> also

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
you record it and see it and it also

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.690 
you record it and see it and it also
gives<00:04:05.540> it<00:04:05.870> like<00:04:05.989> a<00:04:06.019> fisheye<00:04:06.470> effect<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:07.190> it

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
gives it like a fisheye effect and it

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.979 
gives it like a fisheye effect and it
just<00:04:07.880> doesn't<00:04:08.299> really<00:04:08.420> look<00:04:08.570> that<00:04:08.630> good<00:04:08.930> when

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
just doesn't really look that good when

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.050 
just doesn't really look that good when
you<00:04:09.170> record<00:04:09.470> it<00:04:09.530> so<00:04:09.769> maybe<00:04:10.459> they<00:04:10.670> could<00:04:10.850> use

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
you record it so maybe they could use

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.320 
you record it so maybe they could use
some<00:04:11.660> type<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:11.900> feature<00:04:12.320> to

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
some type of feature to

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.360 
some type of feature to
allow<00:04:13.900> you<00:04:13.960> to<00:04:14.110> record<00:04:14.350> it<00:04:14.800> and<00:04:14.950> it<00:04:15.100> still

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
allow you to record it and it still

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.360 
allow you to record it and it still
looked<00:04:15.640> normal<00:04:16.860> lastly<00:04:17.860> I<00:04:17.890> thought<00:04:18.220> I'd

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
looked normal lastly I thought I'd

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.699 
looked normal lastly I thought I'd
include<00:04:18.700> mobile<00:04:19.090> gaming<00:04:19.450> because<00:04:20.290> it's

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
include mobile gaming because it's

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.680 
include mobile gaming because it's
become<00:04:21.070> a<00:04:21.100> lot<00:04:21.220> more<00:04:21.519> popular<00:04:22.120> than<00:04:22.360> it<00:04:22.510> was
