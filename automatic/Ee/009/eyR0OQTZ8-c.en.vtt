00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:08.100
 I this after closing the faucet in the kitchen This recently this 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.330
 Do you chose this itself is I do not read it were not corner about the week before last 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.000
 I'm looking at it 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.150
 After closing the faucet in the kitchen, I see a drop of water falling and making a loud noise 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.150
 When 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.919
 I wonder if the ball is down 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.919
 It Oitepi Chong 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.289
 I would like to see a stainless steel bowl I like but it feels good but it's a big deal 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.420
 a 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:38.380
 That 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:45.880
 I start to feel that the timing of the water drop and the sound is out of focus I notice the water drop falling from the faucet 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:51.410
 It is the moment when the drop of water is dropped, but the moment I think that the main drop is dropped 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:55.970
 It is said that the timing of the sound is out of sync 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:01:03.739
 When I try in the Nakane family, I understand that it is amazing 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:04.850
 I recognize that the moment I left the faucet that I needed has fallen, and almost immediately after that 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.880
 What 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.430
 A little like a predecessor expectations When you first come accustomed to something gradually rhythm I'm not in recent years 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.740
 Is 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.090
 It's going to become for the Toka such as video in something head been preceded 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.700
 Good 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:26.700
 Recently I asked Fan sedge I fan Tara Wa' soooo So without another after all the other talk 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.780
 It often becomes a fan made 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.900
 I'm getting rid of my fanta and mowing but it's amazing to be told by Mr. Kami 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.640
 There are many 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:40.479
 Hm 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:43.790
 Immediately after closing the faucet, water droplets fall one after another at short intervals, so even if you look at the faucet 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:48.830
 There is no discomfort at all 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:54.530
 I'm going to be in because that would up the processing speed of the softening brain be either I I'm the same rhythm so 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:02:00.450
 But it does not MAY certainly become more extra likely you were the 8 irregular 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:04.890
 Take a shot without going out with a stainless steel bowl and a big drama 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.370
 A little after Toka watch firmly Toka little has been reflected in the ball of the stainless 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.130
 It was reflected there 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:16.100
 Thin light 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.730
 Fairly and that feeling Zu' in which you are also moved or dissolved at the sink of stainless 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.560
 Somewhere will say 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:25.010
 I'm asking you so much hot bread I 'm asking for a fan of God Big Saan again 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.010
