00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
in the design as well you know it's very

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.720 
in the design as well you know it's very
subtle<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:24.630> it's<00:00:25.050> done<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.410> very<00:00:25.560> cool<00:00:25.949> very

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
personal taste and also also my brand I

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.069 
personal taste and also also my brand I
think<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.700> has<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> feminine<00:00:39.510> feel<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.020> it

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.740 
think that it has a feminine feel to it
but<00:00:40.200> not<00:00:40.410> overly<00:00:40.800> feminine<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.640> think<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.570> it

but not overly feminine I think that it

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.080 
but not overly feminine I think that it
also<00:00:43.170> feels<00:00:43.530> quite<00:00:43.800> masculine<00:00:44.489> as<00:00:44.640> well<00:00:44.850> I

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.649 
little bit of a classic feel about it as
well<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.380> think<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.829> tan<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.579> is<00:02:00.090> very<00:02:00.509> very

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
well and I think the tan is is very very

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.640 
well and I think the tan is is very very
chic<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.320> think<00:02:01.500> it's<00:02:01.619> very<00:02:01.829> unexpected

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
chic I think it's very unexpected

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.280 
chic I think it's very unexpected
I<00:02:03.680> think<00:02:04.100> it<00:02:04.280> was<00:02:04.460> quite<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:04.970> challenging<00:02:05.840> color

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
I think it was quite a challenging color

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.890 
I think it was quite a challenging color
to<00:02:06.770> work<00:02:07.010> with<00:02:07.370> because<00:02:07.970> it<00:02:08.510> is<00:02:08.660> quite

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:08.900 
to work with because it is quite

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.590 
to work with because it is quite
different<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:09.890> love<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.310> I<00:02:10.460> think<00:02:10.490> that<00:02:11.420> it

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
different and I love it I think that it

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.290 
different and I love it I think that it
really<00:02:11.750> complements<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.340> exterior<00:02:16.300> beam

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
really complements the the exterior beam

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.280 
really complements the the exterior beam
