00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:14.779
 so yes I think I think take 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.779
 I think that first he fell into a group the hardest of this rate 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.339
 and and 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.429
 and that the match the first game against Romania and 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.759
 it's up to bigger markets than French football to play it's 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:27.409
 sure 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:28.979
 you have to win the first match 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.979
 on the first two matches is off to a good start if you allow it 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.810
 govou is a little bit in which case to say things as they 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.810
 are 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.700
 I think the list is good I think very sincerely that the list is 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.090
 good and I think raymond domenec she shows a lot of courage 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.090
 in europe have eliminated the lambro is here it's including 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.390
 too mexes there I confess that I'm worth and I do not know me I would never 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.300
 nepal what against what 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.060
 ah that's for sure if here to say to snow 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.500
 european championship trends this summer 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.570
 it's a blow because if you 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.700
 that will bring 2006 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.700
 at the same time if you want the head of zidane who played 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.710
 the zidane's whim that gave 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.090
 a dirty blow really to the team of France 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.130
 the wound of vieira in this final 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.110
 we have a little forgotten 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.640
 bt very detrimental also to the team's performance and I'm 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.420
 persuaded that 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.420
 if she turned was not injured and 6th grade primary 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.080
 France beat the Italian 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.080
 he is a super soldier 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.000
 so that romania can go very far can go very far because 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.960
 than 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.460
 but I tell you what it is 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.130
 there are boys who are born 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.170
 in rank engines in this particular ribery team so little 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.380
 the detonator of this team 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.729
 gomis what confirm his two extraordinary goal pmi against cons 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.259
 the equator 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.290
 because he is in the middle of now powerless floundering 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.359
 he is a young man 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:17.359
 that's why we're rediscovering sponsors 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.339
 so it's true that but there 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.329
 I am thinking in particular of homework or two Russian attackers 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:30.489
 zenith just chavigned plan ac 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.859
 who are youth players of my talent 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.459
 fernando torrÃ¨s does not matter 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.849
 an exceptional scorer we Catholics 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.849
 karim a great season with them with the bayern 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:43.159
 you all 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.159
 the attacker mac after old kinin brandon 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.239
 we know since more than any first youth but finally and it marks a beautiful 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.429
 purpose been suspended lately 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:55.509
 when I am a little temperamental the young man is dead 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:03:00.319
 % to 8% exhausted and the French benzema anyway 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.509
 there eve 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.539
 it's a whiskey that in my opinion is going to get back to the level of 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:06.419
 this hen 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:07.849
 his final phase 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.169
 I think we can then we can have 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:11.269
 the chapel has in the political past
