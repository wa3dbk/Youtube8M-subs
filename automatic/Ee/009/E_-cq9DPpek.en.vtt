turning itself down we were listening to
music<00:00:48.429> to<00:00:48.640> eventually<00:00:49.059> where<00:00:49.329> it<00:00:49.510> muted

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
music to eventually where it muted

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.959 
music to eventually where it muted
itself<00:00:50.230> and<00:00:50.469> no<00:00:51.219> matter<00:00:51.339> what<00:00:51.429> you<00:00:51.550> did<00:00:51.760> it

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
itself and no matter what you did it

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.880 
itself and no matter what you did it
would<00:00:52.120> i<00:00:52.539> would<00:00:52.870> keep<00:00:53.170> turning<00:00:53.530> itself<00:00:53.710> down

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
would i would keep turning itself down

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.399 
would i would keep turning itself down
until<00:00:54.219> it<00:00:54.460> you<00:00:54.909> know<00:00:55.059> it<00:00:55.480> there<00:00:55.960> was<00:00:56.050> no<00:00:56.140> sound

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
until it you know it there was no sound

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.259 
until it you know it there was no sound
coming<00:00:56.710> through<00:00:56.800> it<00:00:56.949> at<00:00:57.039> all<00:00:57.219> and<00:00:57.489> so<00:00:58.239> that

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
coming through it at all and so that

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.180 
coming through it at all and so that
makes<00:00:58.749> it<00:00:58.839> the<00:00:59.050> headphones<00:00:59.409> really<00:00:59.679> unusable

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
makes it the headphones really unusable

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.860 
makes it the headphones really unusable
because<00:01:00.280> to<00:01:00.729> use<00:01:00.969> headphones<00:01:01.390> you<00:01:01.569> need<00:01:01.719> to

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
because to use headphones you need to

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.140 
because to use headphones you need to
have<00:01:02.170> some<00:01:03.039> kind<00:01:03.249> of<00:01:03.339> audio<00:01:03.609> coming<00:01:03.940> throne

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150

have some kind of audio coming throne
and<00:01:04.360> that<00:01:05.350> problem<00:01:06.310> that<00:01:06.520> it<00:01:06.610> had<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:08.350> enable

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
and that problem that it had then enable

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.880 
and that problem that it had then enable
it<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:08.920> do<00:01:09.130> that<00:01:09.340> so<00:01:09.910> i<00:01:09.940> took<00:01:10.060> them<00:01:10.270> back<00:01:10.390> and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
it to do that so i took them back and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.380 
it to do that so i took them back and
exchange<00:01:11.890> them<00:01:12.160> for<00:01:12.190> these<00:01:12.430> same<00:01:13.150> price<00:01:13.360> for

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
exchange them for these same price for

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.540

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
similar to this but the other ones with

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.170 
similar to this but the other ones with
it<00:03:08.590> was<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:08.830> pouch<00:03:09.070> this<00:03:09.880> is<00:03:10.000> more<00:03:10.180> of<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.299> case

it was a pouch this is more of a case
they<00:03:13.180> do<00:03:13.239> make<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.540> different<00:03:13.930> version<00:03:14.110> of

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
they do make a different version of

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.539 
they do make a different version of
these<00:03:14.440> headphones<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.220> other<00:03:15.340> version

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
these headphones and the other version

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.840 
these headphones and the other version
has<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.450> in<00:03:16.750> mind<00:03:16.959> controller<00:03:17.440> that<00:03:18.250> comes<00:03:18.670> with

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
has a in mind controller that comes with

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.530 
has a in mind controller that comes with
a<00:03:18.880> mic<00:03:19.299> input<00:03:19.750> and<00:03:20.049> also<00:03:20.829> has<00:03:21.130> volume<00:03:21.549> up<00:03:22.299> and

a mic input and also has volume up and
down<00:03:22.600> controls<00:03:23.170> on<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:24.040> headphones

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
down controls on the headphones

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.890 
down controls on the headphones
themselves<00:03:24.549> these<00:03:25.060> ones<00:03:25.239> do<00:03:25.360> not<00:03:25.390> that's<00:03:25.780> why

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
themselves these ones do not that's why

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.930 
themselves these ones do not that's why
they<00:03:26.019> are<00:03:26.140> cheaper<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.709> think<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.670> other<00:03:27.790> ones

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
they are cheaper I think the other ones

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.120 
they are cheaper I think the other ones
run<00:03:28.150> for<00:03:28.360> 120<00:03:29.049> 130<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.739> these<00:03:29.829> ones<00:03:30.040> are

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
run for 120 130 and these ones are

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.009 
run for 120 130 and these ones are
straight<00:03:30.400> hundred<00:03:30.730> dollars<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.239> I<00:03:31.870> don't

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
straight hundred dollars and I don't

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.270 
straight hundred dollars and I don't
really<00:03:32.110> care<00:03:32.380> for<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.590> inline<00:03:32.799> controller<00:03:33.160> I

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
really care for the inline controller I

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.280 
really care for the inline controller I
mean<00:03:33.519> it<00:03:33.730> would<00:03:33.820> be<00:03:33.850> nice<00:03:34.090> but<00:03:34.120> I<00:03:34.720> don't<00:03:35.230> know

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
mean it would be nice but I don't know

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.350 
mean it would be nice but I don't know
if<00:03:35.380> I<00:03:35.440> pay<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.769> money<00:03:36.070> for<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.610> dr<00:03:37.180> dre's

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
if I pay the money for it the dr dre's

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.900 
if I pay the money for it the dr dre's
can<00:03:37.660> with<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:37.959> prior<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.620> dollars<00:03:38.980> these<00:03:39.670> ones

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
can with it prior to dollars these ones

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.000 
can with it prior to dollars these ones
don't<00:03:39.940> so<00:03:40.329> it's<00:03:40.450> really<00:03:40.570> not<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.780> problem<00:03:41.010> but

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
don't so it's really not a problem but

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.740 
don't so it's really not a problem but
that<00:03:42.370> is<00:03:42.489> one<00:03:42.640> thing<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:42.850> note<00:03:43.150> if<00:03:43.329> you<00:03:43.420> do<00:03:43.570> need

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
that is one thing to note if you do need

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.440 
that is one thing to note if you do need
the<00:03:43.810> inline<00:03:44.170> controller<00:03:45.030> maybe<00:03:46.030> you<00:03:46.209> want<00:03:46.360> to

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
the inline controller maybe you want to

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.970 
the inline controller maybe you want to
go<00:03:46.540> for<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.780> dr<00:03:47.079> dre's<00:03:47.290> because<00:03:47.560> they<00:03:47.709> are<00:03:47.799> the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
go for the dr dre's because they are the

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.860 
go for the dr dre's because they are the
same<00:03:48.190> price<00:03:48.519> and<00:03:48.820> do<00:03:49.120> come<00:03:49.360> with<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.600> inline

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
same price and do come with the inline
