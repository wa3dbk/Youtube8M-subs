and they're priced depending which one
you<00:04:41.230> get<00:04:41.410> because<00:04:41.740> they<00:04:41.860> all<00:04:42.010> have<00:04:42.130> different

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
you get because they all have different

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.740 
you get because they all have different
ingredients<00:04:42.550> I<00:04:42.940> think<00:04:42.970> some<00:04:43.390> of<00:04:43.420> the<00:04:43.630> more

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
ingredients I think some of the more

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.320 
ingredients I think some of the more
anti-aging<00:04:44.110> ones<00:04:44.530> more<00:04:44.710> expensive<00:04:45.220> but<00:04:46.180> they

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
anti-aging ones more expensive but they

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.420 
anti-aging ones more expensive but they
start<00:04:46.600> at<00:04:46.810> like<00:04:46.960> 250<00:04:47.410> and<00:04:47.740> go<00:04:47.860> up<00:04:48.040> to<00:04:48.220> four

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
start at like 250 and go up to four

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.250 
start at like 250 and go up to four
pounds<00:04:48.790> for<00:04:48.850> two<00:04:49.150> so<00:04:49.480> and<00:04:49.870> they're<00:04:50.050> amazing

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
pounds for two so and they're amazing

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.540 
pounds for two so and they're amazing
for<00:04:50.380> traveling<00:04:50.800> as<00:04:50.890> well<00:04:50.920> because<00:04:51.280> if<00:04:51.430> you're
