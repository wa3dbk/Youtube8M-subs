00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.940
 heyer 2 and welcome a new video to 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.010
 my channel I am from mega cross teri and 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.170
 as always you have a new video and 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.210
 well this is a new analysis and 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.010
 before you start remember that you have 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.150
 I uploaded more incidental course videos in 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.850
 today so if you have not 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.369
 seen see my previous videos and look at it 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.970
 ok and good this is a new analysis of 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.759
 a video of the campaign and let's go 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.730
 seeing remarkable things and good in this 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.410
 part there's nothing like that to stand out 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.060
 it's not a little bit of the same 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.830
 little stars that we saw that had been 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.130
 of the good campaign here you can see the 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.650
 weapon of the mass according to the previous video 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.870
 and well let's see the characters that are 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.700
 protagonisms of this campaign 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.710
 well here we are going to start doing the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.720
 analysis in this part and we can see 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.520
 here in slow motion as he pulls the 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.730
 remembered and effectively the cropped 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.590
 has two charges or two shots per 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.670
 charger 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.430
 impressive not only that it can 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.760
 take many more bullets and right now 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.409
 let's see elsewhere see here 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.930
 comes the see is believed that we have already seen 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.930
 in the bike video and good up to 12 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.270
 bullets gentlemen and if that is the top 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.130
 because maybe you have more 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.810
 we know it but up to 12 bullets could 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.570
 get to have and good in this part 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.979
 we see the disque weapon that we 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.990
 we had said or rather I had said 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.210
 that it was a fire grenade launcher that 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.950
 could do was speculated is not a 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.800
 sort of normal grenade launcher that 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.009
 has four bullets per charger and good 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.130
 it's a bit absurd to extend the 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.300
 boomer but well ni pex good here happened 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.220
 something very loaded that we're going to see in 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.580
 slow motion as he throws the grenade and he 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.500
 it hits you ok you get to hear the 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.680
 you want that in spears you can stick to 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.020
 the enemies this is a 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.850
 it's an improvement, not me, I really like it 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.230
 you can do that good let's continue 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.750
 watching this video that really is very 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.520
 short and well we see that they go to the 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.130
 seen the grenade explodes the above and 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.020
 Now let's see something that is nothing 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.660
 spectacular is the execution of this 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.370
 new weapon let's see it in slow motion 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.870
 and well here we see how he grabs 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.600
 wall is like grabbing him from corpse and 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.880
 he breaks his neck really is not not 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.010
 so impressive this execution to 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.810
 less from the angle where we saw it and 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.480
