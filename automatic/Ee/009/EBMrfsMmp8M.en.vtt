00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:05.000
 Hello dear people i have you guys listening to short video or in short 

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:08.549
 Overview of the Sony PRS 650 brought 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:09.960
 that is the current one 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.259
 it is surrounded by Fridolin 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.859
 Cost point currently at Sony itself 229 euros, so a bit difficult 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.279
 We get an impression of what it looks like 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.380
 Today it has arrived with me 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.259
 Gallen 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.259
 Euro 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.890
 the pressure on charcoal burner 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.930
 in a protective service of federal and local government leadership 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.839
 an own goal 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.080
 not much 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.560
 Heidelberg 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.560
 I work 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.430
 we'll never feel better again 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.520
 Handball for the device you do not need to see 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.250
 and whether it is right now 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.250
 Meet again in October 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.810
 the device is compatible with Adobe Yahoo because that is indeed man 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.080
 can also be drm-protected books 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.080
 For example, from various online stores Corp. play 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.530
 as it otherwise remained very well so Â»in functionality at much 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.880
 be worth 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.880
 by Thomas Spinnler just once 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.800
 I had the feeling of putting myself on the one hand 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.260
 you do not have to make any arrangements 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.370
 You can see right down here we are currently playing 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.950
 so that there soon pdf file actually log on the whole page 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.390
 overview as well as that 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.400
 usually off 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.190
 with the magnifying glass function, however, the font size can be overwhelming 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.190
 taught that adapt for example on hands 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.010
 this naturally shifts the paragraphs a bit 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.320
 alternatively you can on the sides - adjust so 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.320
 the border is cut off and you really only text 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.399
 or you have the opportunity to miss the whole team Creaform 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:13.349
 which is later in turmoil child size it is as in previous years 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:15.599
 and 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.329
 is actually quite well readable above all resolution of 800 times 600 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:20.420
 pixels 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.420
 and because 6 inches is of course help 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.309
 definitely better than Annika something on the g-20 summit 2 13 back 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.489
 Functionalities such as Television Manhattan this works for example 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.489
 that means for me now 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.859
 would like to present on the internet 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:43.549
 in the team not in the right piece 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.029
 I can, for example 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:46.979
 to mark 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.929
 "Our visitors wish and that is already marked 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:52.929
 can of course make handwritten notes about it 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.629
 Hundreds of people injured have not been a problem ever 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.799
 only the huge one's function is a bit offset but time 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.359
 before that, there must be a humpbacked and no tiebreaker 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.499
 other options are of course these characters you can add 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:19.539
 or just on the corner but Philipp tilt 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:24.169
 Indirectly it should mark it later on the options menu 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:28.179
 play next to such 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.200
 for Hannover back 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.929
 the main menu 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:37.489
 here turned Wednesday 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.379
 Internships can 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.569
 I have dozens of books then all the books I prepared for a book 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.549
 Reconstruction but listed 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.379
 so succeeded in this case and you can still enjoy such a good reputation 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.629
 you can only guess 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:56.349
 if then really 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.459
 Last books in the floor and the books I have 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.449
 next to not wanted to read 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:09.150
 very nice is the possibility that many show only two statistics 

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:10.369
 can that 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:13.349
 percentage of a matching document of performance 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.629
 I'll just say that now 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:19.559
 from Monaco and how, for example 

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:23.019
 For example, if I disable function the pages housing 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.590
 put two columns 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.590
 now set the font size to provider unoccupied 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.720
 that gave the sounds and now the district passes the left column 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.110
 read 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.610
 after that he goes on the right column is of course perfect in this case 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.290
 stupid advertising 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.290
 Mom is to be expected 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.009
 otherwise threaten to get 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:54.520
 So they are natural again compared to the small ones 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.490
 SD Card and Memory Stick 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.639
 For the expandable to have been and comfortable and fast laid the 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.029
 connected to the PC 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:09.860
 and applying for me 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.180
 you have the opportunity to see pictures 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.270
 Handwritten said that Brown always plays it so you actually 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.270
 also explained as a notebook, so to speak 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.229
 Of course he also has the possibility to be able to 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.120
 Som to play parties 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.529
 not urgent 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:30.909
 which I'm not very nice though 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:34.099
 not required 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.099
 Of course I also had it 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.709
 In this case I have now German English and let me show you 

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:43.599
 can which 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.309
 for him lies in the starting eleven 

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:46.879
 Booking back occurs 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:49.879
 Munich with a sporty touch 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.990
 Cult of Fire to end with a profit selling Bitburg 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:05.599
 Represented trade fairs 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.770
 Of course I can choose any words from which, for example 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.809
 reforms 

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:15.939
 various cell phones or cars fall 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:19.990
 now fall English Dictionary lie German DJIA for this money 

00:06:19.989 --> 00:06:23.469
 I have not found yet but will certainly often soon 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:30.520
 Of course, I can say nothing about the battery life as the salary as today 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.779
 but wanted to get that way so build quality is it 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:34.710
 important 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.389
 very solid the only thing you want 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:42.300
 The back of aluminum is finished to hold the two 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.460
 become Mr. 600 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.660
 which is now also made of plastic makes the device easier too 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.369
 about 220 grams 

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:53.219
 the readability of the display is of course really very good me 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:56.309
 Today I also had a final day outside in the sun 

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:59.300
 can not work without problems 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.300
 and here of course the advantage over lcd- or edited 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.650
 so far more if you have questions then just in the comments cost and 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.630
 the bank wanted to ask questions on the profiles
