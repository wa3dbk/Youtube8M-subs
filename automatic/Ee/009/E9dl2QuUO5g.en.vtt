to competitive I think that was a really

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.770 
to competitive I think that was a really
important<00:01:08.219> gun<00:01:08.369> ban<00:01:08.579> that<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:09.000> didn't<00:01:09.689> take

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
in the second half just in the sense of

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.260 
in the second half just in the sense of
you<00:02:37.130> see<00:02:37.280> no<00:02:37.430> other<00:02:37.580> than<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.850> ball<00:02:38.030> movement
