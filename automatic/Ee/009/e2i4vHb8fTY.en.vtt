 and very good to all boys and girls today 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.430
 I bring you a splendid news though 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.630
 and everyone knows good as more 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:21.119
 waste time I extract the second tlc 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.860
 of dragon ball I do not see being that it is not 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.800
 the great news of truth not all 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.750
 they were waiting for good because I took the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.660
 annoyances of making this video for 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.930
 bring them back then let's not lose anymore the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.180
 time we are going to download it 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.100
 well this is the description of the video 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.060
 I'll leave the link for download 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.160
 by torrent of clear 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.530
 and the files that you will find 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.829
 at the time of the download will be with these 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.059
 3 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:56.539
 ok but they practically do not tell the 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.519
 judges that we copy the update in 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.699
 the game directory and then you 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.699
 create 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.860
 we go to the directory where the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.890
 route where the game is 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:14.000
 we quietly come 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.729
 where we copied it quietly from 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.700
 control right to copy a control c 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.150
 point we know we're going here 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.730
 straight 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.550
 get here we replace the files 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.940
 of no problem ok up there we go 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.430
 well now the ones that crack 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.960
 what advantage does this have that good we have 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.980
 the two versions have the version of the 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.240
 codex 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.920
 I'm going to do the 100's 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.640
 either of them will work 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.000
 but I have in the codex version 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.370
 and quietly I came to judge it good 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.260
 as well as copy and paste 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.870
 quietly 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.360
 no problem that yes the game is going to 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.870
 stay in English so that's what 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.610
 we do for that 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.550
 we go to the codex a point 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.920
 and we look 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.920
 the language the language 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.650
 we'll see 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:19.720
 [Music] 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.440
 and here it is I come to spanish here 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.450
 to go out in guys or english 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.070
 quietly we have just modified 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.480
 and we passed it to Spanish without any 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.010
 problem 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.299
 and some can give them that they can not 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.360
 replace the tubes directly what is 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.760
 what we do here the mind do the 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.860
 modification 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.980
 we are going to file save as 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.350
 and we take it to the directory to be 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.450
 more, much easier 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.430
 here with the same name codex dot in 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.239
 we keep it quietly 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.239
 we close 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.120
 we touch the file we promote because to 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.120
 replace optimal 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.130
 quiet without any problem now with 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.620
 the same pont start the game 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.650
 I always recommend facing it like 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.270
 administrator but it will not get worse 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.900
 I'm going to do it outside 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.939
 I have not done it many 6 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.420
 and if in case your computer has a 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:23.799
 operating system windows 8 8.1 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.709
 you probably get eta then 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.020
 let's go to information and run vÃ­ctor 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.010
 shapes 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.010
 we accept 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.440
 and here we have the game 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.440
 quickly let's see 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.750
 There is how you can see this in Spanish 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.110
 without any problem the volume is for 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.350
 you many nations 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.650
 we passed 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.460
 we use the game here the mind no 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.560
 problem 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.610
 the data is not going to be erased so 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.610
 you do not run the problem well 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.530
 perhaps 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.030
 it can be a small I'm going to make a 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.730
 small cut because this took me on 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.470
 notice in my case truth can be done 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.680
 a small cut and I'm going to go 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:22.869
 directly agree 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.869
 [Music] 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.550
 Well, here we are after the 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:29.569
 cut 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.569
 we will go 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.970
 to secondary missions so that 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.970
 can see it 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:45.699
 and we already have them 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:48.090
 and I think that as you know they are going to appear 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.090
 this 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.800
 look 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.940
 and these two new missions is not done 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.180
 but I do not remember six pots and some 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.260
 new missions and functions were missing from 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.260
 the saga of wikis 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:17.710
 a problem 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:21.790
 [Music] 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.520
 we are choosing characters we go and 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.030
 bingo 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.130
 [Music] 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.130
 but you calmly look 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:37.129
 [Music] 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:40.870
 our staff from the first dlc them and 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:40.870
 here we have the dragons 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.550
 when the others are going to unlock 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.500
 according 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.750
 complete the side missions if you do not 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.640
 I misunderstand and the others 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.410
 characters that are released with the wishes 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.410
 of waiting for the dragon spheres 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.759
 I hope the video 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.460
 a subscription and a like it does not carry anything 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.689
 any inconvenience because I do not know if 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.960
 can help them because they too 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:11.800
 I'm just installing them and I hope that 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.800
 they work
