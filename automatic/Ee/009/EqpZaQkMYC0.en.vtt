00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.480
 new pinta tonic raggasonic 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.880
 in a range certainly often at the 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.400
 guitar I advise you to learn it 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.719
 even if you use it to 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.309
 do the second advice to learn it 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.710
 even this is not the impression of doing 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.240
 this lot since we will use it I 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.220
 showed other possible applications 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.109
 of this range can really 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.480
 very interesting things with without 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.039
 necessarily from soul to the same 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.960
 Here if you want to solo 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.869
 this video so for you since I 'm going 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.910
 show you how well to work 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.649
 ok so I showed several things 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.480
 at first bahdja how the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.059
 take it if you do not know it and 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 Then I will show you three 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.090
 ways to work it to speed up 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.629
 your game better control your hand 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.070
 left back and forth right hand 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.399
 and rust a little fingers 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.500
 So here we begin play the watch 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.239
 do not hesitate to watch always seems 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.190
 to the score that had the short that 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.840
 can help you 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.949
 so if he's going to have to do that then 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.030
 that we will do first on the rope me 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.940
 5.8 below dollar body 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.080
 five sets yet 500 is an order and 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.740
 5.7 had the hand alone 05/08 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.070
 body too 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.960
 cooked like 2010 around and with june 8 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:29.259
 September 2008 that of everyone if this 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:34.030
 dining alone as May 7 re cords 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.479
 7 5 during the 8 5 strings and so that 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.939
 gave it 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.950
 there I will do if you leave you a 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.820
 little jerky it must be 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.820
 regular a rocker 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.540
 there are two things she will have to 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.619
 pay attention to the level of the hands so 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.180
 it's the position of the left hand 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.399
 how the exercise situation is going 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.470
 try as usual to a good position 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.020
 it's here to go get the bodies 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.330
 serious enough to put the thumb up rather 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.239
 in the middle of the neck is not the freight 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.330
 I 'm going about agde to 600 mhz 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.489
 to blackcurrant and the fingers here they go 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.610
 not be the freight and every finger even 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.450
 must have his box so the index will be at 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.150
 the case 5 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.580
 the blackcurrant mage although we use it 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.890
 no good symbol major the ring finger to 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.230
 which the one in box 8 and 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.030
 it's always it's douala who will play 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.739
 these gases so I go back never look 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.130
 the fingers is always every finger 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.130
 it breaks 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.110
 you always see when it breaks 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.380
 five days but with this camp it's the 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.819
 gauze to say always avoids my little 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.040
 finger and when is the box it's 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.239
 always the ring finger so that's the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.459
 first thing that will have to 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.380
 pay attention 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.780
 then we will pick up what we 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.650
 call the round trip me the same 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.480
 it's something that is not 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.190
 necessarily suede at first but you 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.200
 see it really help you 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.610
 to be more horrible more settled when 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.470
 you do is later a game more 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.060
 quick 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.410

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.420
