massive<00:02:13.129> crush<00:02:13.400> also<00:02:13.700> in<00:02:13.790> Monza<00:02:14.830> England<00:02:15.830> I

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
massive crush also in Monza England I

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.869 
massive crush also in Monza England I
was<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.980> bit<00:02:16.069> unlucky<00:02:16.310> really<00:02:16.670> with<00:02:16.790> the

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
was a bit unlucky really with the

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.880 
was a bit unlucky really with the
injuries<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.180> hunt<00:02:17.390> last<00:02:17.720> year<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.620> speed

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
injuries a hunt last year so the speed

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.649 
injuries a hunt last year so the speed
wasn't<00:02:19.220> too<00:02:19.340> far<00:02:19.550> away<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:19.790> was<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.090> was<00:02:20.480> always

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
wasn't too far away I was I was always

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.210 
wasn't too far away I was I was always
at<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.959> from<00:02:21.140> how<00:02:21.980> closely<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.430> front

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
at the from how closely the front

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.589 
at the from how closely the front
but<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:24.459> just<00:02:24.670> didn't<00:02:24.880> happen<00:02:24.970> for<00:02:25.300> one<00:02:25.420> reason

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
but it just didn't happen for one reason

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.740 
but it just didn't happen for one reason
another<00:02:25.959> last<00:02:26.170> year<00:02:26.459> so<00:02:27.459> this<00:02:27.610> year<00:02:27.670> it's<00:02:28.420> time

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
another last year so this year it's time

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.500 
another last year so this year it's time
you<00:02:28.989> know<00:02:29.140> I've<00:02:29.230> got<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.470> really<00:02:29.680> kind<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.099> like

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
you know I've got a really kind of like

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.330 
you know I've got a really kind of like
develop<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.599> bike<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.560> get<00:02:32.709> up<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:33.190> get

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
develop the bike and to get up to get

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.520 
develop the bike and to get up to get
the<00:02:33.430> BMW<00:02:33.610> of<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.420> speed<00:02:34.690> but<00:02:34.930> also<00:02:35.110> keep

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
the BMW of the speed but also keep

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.110 
the BMW of the speed but also keep
consistent<00:02:36.130> as<00:02:36.220> well<00:02:36.370> without<00:02:36.550> trying<00:02:36.970> too

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
consistent as well without trying too

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.710 
consistent as well without trying too
hard<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.450> crashing<00:02:37.810> we've<00:02:38.200> got<00:02:38.349> to<00:02:38.380> just<00:02:39.069> be

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
hard and crashing we've got to just be

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.020 
hard and crashing we've got to just be
have<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.750> lot<00:02:40.930> of<00:02:40.959> feel<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.830> if<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.550> feel<00:02:42.790> like

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
have a lot of feel and if you feel like

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.430 
have a lot of feel and if you feel like
you're<00:02:43.420> on<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.690> edge<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:43.989> your<00:02:44.050> particular

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
you're on the edge of your particular

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.100 
you're on the edge of your particular
package<00:02:44.980> at<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:45.220> point<00:02:45.520> stay<00:02:46.390> there<00:02:47.970> because

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
package at that point stay there because

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.320 
package at that point stay there because
there's<00:02:50.110> no<00:02:50.230> point<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:50.560> testing<00:02:50.980> actually<00:02:51.330> go

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
there's no point in testing actually go

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.000 
there's no point in testing actually go
and<00:02:52.420> above<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:52.720> point<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.590> risking

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
and above that point and risking

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.880 
and above that point and risking
crushing<00:02:54.370> because<00:02:54.580> you<00:02:54.700> will<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.930> trick<00:02:56.860> is

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
crushing because you will the trick is

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.240 
crushing because you will the trick is
is<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.370> go<00:02:57.489> faster<00:02:57.940> when<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.120> bike<00:02:58.360> improves

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
is to go faster when the bike improves

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.470 
is to go faster when the bike improves
intestine<00:03:00.250> in<00:03:00.790> race<00:03:01.060> you<00:03:01.180> don't<00:03:01.330> have<00:03:01.420> a

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
intestine in race you don't have a

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.000 
intestine in race you don't have a
choice<00:03:01.660> you've<00:03:02.170> got<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.470> push<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.680> little<00:03:02.799> bit

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
choice you've got to push a little bit

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.220 
choice you've got to push a little bit
more<00:03:03.250> than<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.519> bike<00:03:03.700> for<00:03:04.569> yourself<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.080> get<00:03:05.200> a

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
more than the bike for yourself to get a

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.930 
more than the bike for yourself to get a
better<00:03:05.380> result<00:03:05.590> but<00:03:06.160> in<00:03:06.250> testing<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.670> trick

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
better result but in testing the trick

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.640 
better result but in testing the trick
is<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.120> go<00:03:07.360> keep<00:03:07.870> getting<00:03:08.170> faster<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.590> faster

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
is to go keep getting faster and faster

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.890 
is to go keep getting faster and faster
without<00:03:09.340> pushing<00:03:09.760> anymore<00:03:10.209> because<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.720> bike

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
without pushing anymore because the bike

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.070 
without pushing anymore because the bike
gets<00:03:11.140> wetter<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:12.819> sometimes<00:03:13.239> you<00:03:13.390> misjudge<00:03:13.959> a

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
gets wetter and sometimes you misjudge a

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.500 
gets wetter and sometimes you misjudge a
bit<00:03:14.290> because<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.700> know<00:03:15.819> that<00:03:16.090> that's<00:03:16.390> how

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
bit because you know that that's how

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.809 
bit because you know that that's how
fine<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.810> point<00:03:16.900> we<00:03:17.230> are<00:03:17.380> on<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:18.220> bike<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.700> know

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
fine a point we are on the bike you know

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.440 
fine a point we are on the bike you know
