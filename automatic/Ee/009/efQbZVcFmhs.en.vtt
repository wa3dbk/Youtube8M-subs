 hannover / celle we hardly have any grip on DVD but we also have "I wish 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.909
 you need a wonderful one and then this may be on TV's penchant for 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:22.079
 this Sunday, but first very briefly 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.829
 whoever is not a country from the Saarland - only start collecting the collection 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.189
 The Saale has well looked exceptions and apparently since yesterday 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.589
 Play where he involved various channels suburbs and also on 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:34.620
 Driver too 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.350
 have already been attacked by a minuteness of three tigers 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.050
 become

 The hack risks satisfied Delphi farming in terms of a lot of special stuff 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:47.170
 often many classics in domestic 3 from the 1 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.180
 I can happily drop in the weather, thanks for that 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.970
 always find it great when other songs support him and Carlo completely 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.860
 to say honestly 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.289
 more that is very respectful for all of us 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.399
 because it's just a cool thing somehow, "he says 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.560
 the one or the other negative comment on this channel has accumulated here Well 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.380
 Stade is that 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.290
 but was canceled an example 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.200
 but I am glad that we are always there and how hard Mark Held 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.409
 help comments 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.429
 he is also going to do that as an appetite suppressant what it was sure she was up to 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:22.409
 At the beginning of next week I do not know exactly when and how 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.430
 Podcast on 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.010
 and the company wants to keep informed 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.820
 and that will change but be curious what the two Metelener 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.350
 had sent in at the launch 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.880
 and of course what I've sent is the episode she tells 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.130
 also 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.020
 While they have failed their players and fans is the result of one 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.539
 study 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.209
 20 15 on ProSieben in the first 15 minutes before this Sunday 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.119
 he was in 5 or not funny that exists because the Berlinale 2009 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.200
 has received and therefore accused Arnstadt Museum both for the 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.160
 Berlinale we open to bring big 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.770
 We are familiar with such mild smiles looking at the construction work 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.590
 An ophthalmologist is unclear about the main roles. Documents "We are experiencing today 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.729
 another, like Armin müller-stole federal by and large 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.090
 polit-thriller "The Ghost" that's what the Festprogramm interpol-agent is all about 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.989
 Related to the prosecutor 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.319
 is here played by August of an internationally operating bank and their 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.659
 The machinations come when this bank has many monies from Melanie 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.790
 7 crime gangs 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.579
 widespread and therefore also the conflicts in the Middle East 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.269
 and money in this way demanded that this money 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.349
 Hot topic is he is that since the financial crisis clearly since the 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.389
 Bankruptcy of all students grass and I continued to pull this 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.510
 The Hypo Real Estate or even some banks then say what in 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.389
 Germany the bankrupt for what then again the individual citizen 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.769
 so tax has to come up with a hot topic political thriller 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.909
 always look a little bit more complicated i also know that i am here now » 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.020
 are so dry 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.430
 Uncertainty The goal must be that we notice this for as little as two hours 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.770
 unfortunately the film had its crew was very curious one was 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.990
 This time the band is what actually likes when the brain called for healthy because 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.970
 the hearts are coming and watching very carefully which characters are given 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.339
 how interwoven 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:11.129
 in the city so a very interesting land 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.650
 a topic achievements 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.080
 makes and unacceptable as much as what makes the job of occasion to spectators 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.150
 having personally always been in car washes one of the two big ones 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.150
 German actors are simply not successful 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.430
 Now let's talk to the investor so he really has some lengths 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.990
 then only when partly very into the final he also always tried 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.590
 to look very authentic and then of course there is a really great one here 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.849
 Year it came to me after given a little too long 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.469
 It was a little hard to watch here 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:44.939
 and it has been a bit of a pity passenger for me 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.269
 I would not have expected a small one more he had for television 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.899
 the pages very interesting 

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:53.189
 but it really has its lingerman be her dizzy for the third time 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.729
 Actually, all that makes them look in Gescher or because they are authentic 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:59.580
 I have the feeling that you are actually doing things 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.060
 and the way the lack of this world is drawn 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.590
 The whole thing would not seem so dry because they look nice 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.570
 is that arises in many regions 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.840
 alone the opening scene in the heavy sea over that is for me that 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.810
 I mean 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.799
 just read off as were turned directly on the doorstep 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.620
 that makes him a bit proud to be here in the big and big 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.169
 All Michelin Michelin he did not hewn too stupid it is 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.600
 a well-made film especially artisanal 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.389
 but also a conductor like the lack of crazy clothes just too much 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.849
 I can only say that he could be captain at the weekend 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:35.780
 for example, animation company Klöckner 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.700
 is unfortunately also one of the not so strong animations or and therefore 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.760
 it is a little bit always on a different ship this Sunday 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.050
 and first manufacturer and otherwise I recommend you anyway in the 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.310
 Shops a spectator 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.680
 but brain cells are so exhausting but they become so 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.270
 determines one or the other divisions job relatively severely cut this 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.430
 Film sets her on overall composition 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.590
 He really has 300 or more in between Mousepads and the toilet 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.960
 go with her application is 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.419
 then that can already damage the impression sustainable 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.240
 Hello we can do it we have promised a bunch not seriously yourself 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.830
 meant he does not necessarily want to be absolutely worth seeing 4 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:15.509
 percent 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:17.059
 I want you okay 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:20.079
 Percent and therefore goes from 5 out of every 10 possible points 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.440
 no less than captain 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.129
 even if this recommendation is a 2 no search is more great recommendation 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.830
 it's easier to pick up so much more and Chair 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.659
 and because of all those interested the last few weeks maybe my old one 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:35.670
 Sands variety 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.950
 al Kosi 20 15 frequent callers to the Child Protection Agency 

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:43.460
 I am an exit visa then we all have a superhero again
