00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:38.440 

maybe<00:02:32.299> not<00:02:35.799> the<00:02:36.799> main<00:02:37.010> problem<00:02:37.639> is<00:02:37.909> that<00:02:38.090> not

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
maybe not the main problem is that not

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.119 
maybe not the main problem is that not
only<00:02:38.599> does<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.959> engine<00:02:39.200> have<00:02:39.409> less<00:02:39.590> power<00:02:39.980> and

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
only does the engine have less power and

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.910 
only does the engine have less power and
torque<00:02:40.519> than<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.180> Commodore<00:02:41.689> but<00:02:42.499> the<00:02:42.620> Captiva

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
torque than a Commodore but the Captiva

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.920 
torque than a Commodore but the Captiva
also<00:02:43.280> weighs<00:02:43.489> more<00:02:43.879> than<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.209> Commodore<00:02:44.659> and

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
also weighs more than a Commodore and

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.400 
also weighs more than a Commodore and
that's<00:02:45.769> a<00:02:45.889> bad<00:02:46.159> combination

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.540

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.710 
is this very useful wet/dry storage area
but<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.860> best<00:03:46.099> part<00:03:46.370> about<00:03:46.430> a<00:03:46.580> Captiva<00:03:47.180> is

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
but the best part about a Captiva is

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.270 
but the best part about a Captiva is
that<00:03:47.870> it's<00:03:48.019> crossing<00:03:48.200> just<00:03:48.410> thirty<00:03:48.739> five<00:03:48.980> nine

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
that it's crossing just thirty five nine

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.460 
that it's crossing just thirty five nine
ninety<00:03:49.790> or<00:03:50.030> thirty<00:03:50.690> eight<00:03:50.870> nine<00:03:51.049> nine<00:03:51.080> so<00:03:51.410> if

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
ninety or thirty eight nine nine so if

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.530 
ninety or thirty eight nine nine so if

you want extra row seats in the back so

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.600
