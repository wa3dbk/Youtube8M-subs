the functioning of the joints below in
this<00:00:27.150> case<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.720> also<00:00:28.080> above<00:00:28.560> when<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:28.980> comes

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
this case and also above when it comes

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.980 
this case and also above when it comes
to<00:00:29.369> trying<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.789> make<00:00:30.000> sure<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.210> we<00:00:30.510> have<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
to trying to make sure that we have the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.900 
to trying to make sure that we have the
optimal<00:00:31.470> performance<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.550> area<00:00:32.850> in

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
optimal performance of the area in

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.639 
optimal performance of the area in
question<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.660> middle<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.350> if<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.530> think

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
question in the middle so if we think

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.770 
question in the middle so if we think
about<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.950> hip<00:00:35.190> hinge<00:00:35.370> why<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.270> hip<00:00:36.390> hinge<00:00:36.600> so

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
about a hip hinge why is it hip hinge so

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.660 
about a hip hinge why is it hip hinge so
important<00:00:37.290> because<00:00:37.680> we<00:00:37.950> want<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.280> be<00:00:38.399> able<00:00:38.489> to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
important because we want to be able to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.610 
important because we want to be able to
maintain<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.480> stability<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:40.110> our<00:00:40.170> low<00:00:40.379> back

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
maintain the stability of our low back

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.610 
maintain the stability of our low back
without<00:00:41.719> compromising<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.110> stability<00:00:43.290> of

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
without compromising the stability of

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.680 
without compromising the stability of
our<00:00:43.739> low<00:00:43.920> back<00:00:44.129> okay<00:00:44.850> because<00:00:45.120> if<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.450> lack

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
our low back okay because if we lack

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.750 
our low back okay because if we lack
mobility<00:00:45.960> through<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> joint<00:00:46.980> below<00:00:47.399> as<00:00:47.579> we

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
mobility through a joint below as we

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.580 
mobility through a joint below as we
might<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> hip<00:00:48.390> hinge<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:49.079> don't<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
might with a hip hinge we don't have the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.170 
might with a hip hinge we don't have the
mobility<00:00:50.039> there<00:00:50.219> then<00:00:50.730> we're<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.000> start

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
mobility there then we're going to start

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.910 
mobility there then we're going to start
compromising<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> stability<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.800> low

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
compromising the stability of the low

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.889 
compromising the stability of the low
back<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.309> do<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.730> that's<00:00:54.270> when<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.539> start<00:00:54.780> to

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
back to do that that's when we start to

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.860 
back to do that that's when we start to
get<00:00:55.020> low<00:00:55.649> low<00:00:55.920> back<00:00:56.280> issues<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.879> pain<00:00:57.090> same

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
get low low back issues in pain same

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.240 
get low low back issues in pain same
thing<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.109> could<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.379> said<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.620> above<00:00:59.070> and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
thing I could be said for above and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.860 
thing I could be said for above and
we'll<00:00:59.340> cover<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.760> different<00:00:59.789> video<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:00.690> you

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
we'll cover in a different video if you

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.200 
we'll cover in a different video if you
lack<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.350> mobility<00:01:01.949> through<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:02.910> thoracic

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
lack the mobility through your thoracic

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.050 
lack the mobility through your thoracic
spine<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.899> rotate<00:01:04.379> again<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.580> need<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.880> get

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
spine to rotate again we need to get

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.880 
spine to rotate again we need to get
that<00:01:06.240> mobility<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.810> somewhere<00:01:07.110> else<00:01:07.170> down

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
that mobility of somewhere else down

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.280 
that mobility of somewhere else down
here<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> core<00:01:08.640> again<00:01:09.290> compromising

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
here in the core again compromising

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.020 
here in the core again compromising
stability<00:01:10.860> for<00:01:11.040> mobility<00:01:11.310> somewhere<00:01:11.850> else

stability for mobility somewhere else

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.780 
stability for mobility somewhere else
that's<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.720> problem<00:01:13.140> too<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:14.010> hip<00:01:14.280> hinge<00:01:14.549> joke

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
that's a problem too the hip hinge joke

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.520 
that's a problem too the hip hinge joke
comes<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.330> critically<00:01:15.840> important<00:01:16.320> when<00:01:16.409> it

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
comes in so critically important when it

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.679 
comes in so critically important when it
comes<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.860> all<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.189> our<00:01:17.310> big<00:01:17.549> lifts<00:01:17.939> if<00:01:18.090> you're

throughout all of your other lifts

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.270 
throughout all of your other lifts
that's<00:01:57.420> your<00:01:57.570> main<00:01:57.810> one<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.560> only<00:01:58.799> goal<00:01:59.040> for

that's your main one and only goal for
your<00:01:59.670> low<00:01:59.850> back<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.570> for<00:02:00.780> me<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> similar

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
your low back so for me I have a similar

your low back so for me I have a similar
curve<00:02:02.250> here<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:03.149> Raymond<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.200> not<00:02:04.710> excessive

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
curve here to Raymond it's not excessive

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.760 
curve here to Raymond it's not excessive
it's<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:05.909> basically<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.570> lumbar<00:02:06.930> curve<00:02:07.229> that

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
it's just basically a lumbar curve that

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.669 
it's just basically a lumbar curve that
follows<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.399> inward<00:02:08.700> pattern<00:02:09.569> now<00:02:10.080> when<00:02:10.649> I

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
follows this inward pattern now when I

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.050 
follows this inward pattern now when I
bend<00:02:10.979> over<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.340> do

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
bend over to do

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.020 
bend over to do
an<00:02:12.330> exercise<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.320> bent<00:02:13.590> row<00:02:13.800> if<00:02:14.100> I'm<00:02:14.700> going

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
an exercise like a bent row if I'm going

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.240 
an exercise like a bent row if I'm going
to<00:02:15.120> lift<00:02:15.300> here<00:02:15.630> my<00:02:15.930> whole<00:02:16.260> one<00:02:16.740> or<00:02:16.860> only<00:02:16.920> goal

to lift here my whole one or only goal

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.160 
to lift here my whole one or only goal
is<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.430> maintain<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.210> position<00:02:18.360> here<00:02:18.990> as<00:02:19.110> I

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
is to maintain the position here as I

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.620 
is to maintain the position here as I
lift<00:02:20.040> if<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.310> load<00:02:20.820> starts<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.180> get<00:02:21.300> too<00:02:21.450> heavy

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
lift if the load starts to get too heavy

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.900 
lift if the load starts to get too heavy
and<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.260> start<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.590> do<00:02:22.710> that<00:02:23.040> now<00:02:23.670> I'm<00:02:23.820> in

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
and I start to do that now I'm in

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.090 
and I start to do that now I'm in
trouble<00:02:24.150> I'm<00:02:24.390> compromising<00:02:25.140> my<00:02:25.650> lower<00:02:25.860> back

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
trouble I'm compromising my lower back

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.860 
trouble I'm compromising my lower back
at<00:02:26.340> some<00:02:26.580> point<00:02:26.850> same<00:02:27.480> thing<00:02:27.660> with<00:02:27.780> the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
at some point same thing with the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.060 
at some point same thing with the
deadlift<00:02:28.170> if<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.470> can<00:02:28.620> get<00:02:28.740> in<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:28.830> position

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
deadlift if I can get in that position

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.190 
deadlift if I can get in that position
and<00:02:29.640> hold<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.150> maintain<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.510> then<00:02:30.990> that's

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
and hold it and maintain it then that's

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.620 
and hold it and maintain it then that's
good<00:02:31.470> well<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.220> way<00:02:32.340> we<00:02:32.370> do<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:32.940> I'll<00:02:33.390> get

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
good well the way we do this I'll get

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.880 
good well the way we do this I'll get
Raymond<00:02:34.620> here<00:02:34.800> out<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.130> way<00:02:35.280> is<00:02:36.710> you<00:02:37.710> want

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
Raymond here out of the way is you want

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.800 
Raymond here out of the way is you want
to<00:02:37.980> make<00:02:38.130> sure<00:02:38.160> that<00:02:38.670> when<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.390> get<00:02:39.510> into<00:02:39.720> this

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
to make sure that when you get into this

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.500 
to make sure that when you get into this
position<00:02:39.950> that<00:02:40.950> all<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.640> movement<00:02:42.150> comes

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
position that all the movement comes

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.290 
position that all the movement comes
from<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:43.050> hips<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.340> have<00:02:44.610> this<00:02:44.910> the

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
from the hips so that you have this the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.750 
from the hips so that you have this the
mobility<00:02:45.990> through<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.350> hips<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:47.220> get

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
mobility through the hips to get

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.910 
mobility through the hips to get
yourself<00:02:48.240> into<00:02:48.540> this<00:02:48.660> position<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.320> still

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
yourself into this position and still

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.740 
yourself into this position and still
maintain<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.610> stability<00:02:50.760> without<00:02:51.240> having<00:02:51.660> to

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
maintain the stability without having to

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.960 
maintain the stability without having to
give<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.440> up<00:02:52.590> here<00:02:52.920> through<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.580> core<00:02:53.790> in<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
give it up here through the core in the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.300 
give it up here through the core in the
low<00:02:54.090> back<00:02:54.300> so<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.170> hip<00:02:55.350> hinge<00:02:55.620> needs<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:56.100> take

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
low back so the hip hinge needs to take

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.850 
low back so the hip hinge needs to take
place<00:02:56.610> all<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.750> way<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.110> we<00:02:58.290> can<00:02:58.410> get<00:02:58.530> our<00:02:58.650> butt

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
place all the way so we can get our butt

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.610 
place all the way so we can get our butt
all<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.040> way<00:02:59.160> back<00:02:59.510> there's<00:03:00.510> no<00:03:00.750> Niemann<00:03:01.380> here

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
all the way back there's no Niemann here

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.460 
all the way back there's no Niemann here
I'm<00:03:01.920> not<00:03:02.220> bending<00:03:02.940> my<00:03:03.240> knees<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:04.140> get<00:03:04.260> myself

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
I'm not bending my knees to get myself

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.400 
I'm not bending my knees to get myself
back<00:03:05.370> all<00:03:05.760> I'm<00:03:06.000> doing<00:03:06.300> is<00:03:06.390> moving<00:03:07.110> my<00:03:07.230> hips

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
back all I'm doing is moving my hips

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.950 
back all I'm doing is moving my hips
backwards<00:03:08.190> they<00:03:08.790> see<00:03:09.060> pushing<00:03:09.450> from<00:03:09.660> here

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
backwards they see pushing from here

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.980 
backwards they see pushing from here
straight<00:03:10.650> back<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.370> going<00:03:12.030> as<00:03:12.150> far<00:03:12.390> back<00:03:12.690> as<00:03:12.900> I

straight back and going as far back as I
possibly<00:03:13.500> can<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:14.250> then<00:03:15.090> get<00:03:15.270> myself<00:03:15.450> in

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
possibly can to then get myself in

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.470 
possibly can to then get myself in
position<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.440> be<00:03:16.560> stable<00:03:17.040> now<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.760> lift<00:03:18.060> do<00:03:18.450> a

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.730 
deadlift whatever else it may be but
people<00:03:21.690> don't<00:03:21.870> know<00:03:21.959> how<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.140> do<00:03:22.350> this<00:03:22.500> and

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
people don't know how to do this and

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.410 
people don't know how to do this and
there's<00:03:23.100> one<00:03:23.310> big<00:03:23.340> complicating<00:03:24.000> factor<00:03:24.300> that

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
there's one big complicating factor that

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.550 
there's one big complicating factor that
comes<00:03:24.630> up<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:24.930> prevents<00:03:25.320> it

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
comes up that prevents it

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.770 
comes up that prevents it
it's<00:03:25.950> hamstring<00:03:26.400> flexibility<00:03:27.000> again<00:03:27.600> if<00:03:27.690> we

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
it's hamstring flexibility again if we

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.810 
it's hamstring flexibility again if we
look<00:03:27.810> back<00:03:28.110> at<00:03:28.170> Raymond<00:03:28.709> we<00:03:28.980> see<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.400> the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
look back at Raymond we see that the

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.820 
look back at Raymond we see that the
hamstrings<00:03:30.300> will<00:03:30.450> attach<00:03:30.720> right<00:03:30.990> here<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.709> the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
hamstrings will attach right here to the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.040 
hamstrings will attach right here to the
bottom<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.250> pelvis<00:03:32.459> so<00:03:33.180> if<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.450> pelvis<00:03:33.870> is

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
bottom of the pelvis so if the pelvis is

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.040 
bottom of the pelvis so if the pelvis is
back<00:03:34.470> this<00:03:35.190> way<00:03:35.490> into<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.970> hip<00:03:36.209> hinge<00:03:36.420> we've

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
back this way into a hip hinge we've

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.900 
back this way into a hip hinge we've
basically<00:03:37.320> lengthen<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.160> hamstrings<00:03:38.610> if<00:03:38.850> I

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
basically lengthen the hamstrings if I

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.880 
basically lengthen the hamstrings if I
do<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.900> hamstrings<00:03:40.260> not<00:03:40.470> have<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.739> get

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
do this the hamstrings not have to get

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.449 
do this the hamstrings not have to get
longer

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
longer

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.300 
longer
okay<00:03:42.000> now<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.239> further<00:03:42.600> back<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.140> go<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:44.070> more

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
okay now the further back I go the more

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.640 
okay now the further back I go the more
I'm<00:03:44.489> pulling<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.120> hamstring<00:03:45.630> further<00:03:46.320> away

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
I'm pulling that hamstring further away

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.920 
I'm pulling that hamstring further away
from<00:03:46.680> its<00:03:47.340> insertion<00:03:47.940> so<00:03:48.420> there's<00:03:48.600> more<00:03:48.840> and

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
from its insertion so there's more and

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.170 
from its insertion so there's more and
more<00:03:48.989> of<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.260> pull<00:03:49.500> at<00:03:49.770> some<00:03:50.220> point<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.670> can't<00:03:50.970> get

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
more of a pull at some point I can't get

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.850 
more of a pull at some point I can't get
my<00:03:51.300> hips<00:03:51.510> back<00:03:51.720> anymore<00:03:51.989> so<00:03:52.320> they<00:03:52.440> kind<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.680> try

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
my hips back anymore so they kind of try

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.960 
my hips back anymore so they kind of try
to<00:03:52.920> curl<00:03:53.250> under<00:03:53.400> because<00:03:53.700> they<00:03:53.790> want<00:03:53.940> to

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
to curl under because they want to

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.670 
to curl under because they want to
relieve<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.390> tension<00:03:54.420> so<00:03:55.260> if<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:55.470> have<00:03:55.650> a

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
relieve the tension so if you have a

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.260 
relieve the tension so if you have a
difficult<00:03:56.250> time<00:03:56.400> getting<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.060> hip

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
difficult time getting it to the hip

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.790 
difficult time getting it to the hip
hinge<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.840> might<00:03:58.050> want<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.350> first<00:03:58.560> of<00:03:58.680> all

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
hinge you might want to first of all

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.770 
hinge you might want to first of all
check<00:03:59.070> your<00:03:59.280> own<00:03:59.370> hamstring<00:03:59.820> flexibility<00:04:00.420> if

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
check your own hamstring flexibility if

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.900 
check your own hamstring flexibility if
that's<00:04:01.380> not<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.650> problem<00:04:01.920> for<00:04:02.220> you<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:02.730> just

that's not a problem for you you just
don't<00:04:03.000> know<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.180> mechanics<00:04:03.780> of<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.110> all<00:04:04.560> you

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
don't know the mechanics of it all you

don't know the mechanics of it all you
got<00:04:04.830> to<00:04:04.950> do<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.160> this<00:04:05.450> okay<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.600> I'm<00:04:06.660> not

here at the top of the hip flexor area
okay

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
okay

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
you feel those creases soon as you

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.689 
you feel those creases soon as you
create<00:04:27.870> them<00:04:28.080> put<00:04:28.560> your<00:04:28.710> hands<00:04:29.010> right<00:04:29.130> in<00:04:29.490> them

now stand upright now push through the
creases<00:04:33.120> as<00:04:33.300> you<00:04:33.510> allow<00:04:33.720> your<00:04:33.930> butt<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:34.229> travel

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
creases as you allow your butt to travel

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.090 
creases as you allow your butt to travel
back

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
back

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.700 
back
you<00:04:35.460> should<00:04:35.669> feel<00:04:35.940> immediately<00:04:36.570> that<00:04:37.080> all<00:04:37.380> the

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
you should feel immediately that all the

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.020 
you should feel immediately that all the
motions<00:04:38.130> happening<00:04:38.550> right<00:04:38.669> here<00:04:38.880> at<00:04:38.940> the

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
motions happening right here at the

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.850 
motions happening right here at the
pelvis<00:04:39.449> or<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:39.900> pelvis<00:04:40.290> is<00:04:40.410> traveling

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
pelvis or the pelvis is traveling

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.740 
pelvis or the pelvis is traveling
backwards<00:04:41.100> again<00:04:41.970> you<00:04:42.120> might<00:04:42.300> feel<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:42.540> little

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
backwards again you might feel a little

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.090 
backwards again you might feel a little
bit<00:04:42.840> of<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:42.960> stretch<00:04:43.199> in<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.410> hamstrings<00:04:43.889> and

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
bit of a stretch in the hamstrings and

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.650 
bit of a stretch in the hamstrings and
that's<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.699> case<00:04:44.910> you<00:04:45.120> want<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.389> stretch<00:04:45.630> your

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
that's the case you want to stretch your

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.900 
that's the case you want to stretch your
hamstrings<00:04:46.199> out<00:04:46.440> of<00:04:46.830> this<00:04:47.040> anterior<00:04:47.580> tilt

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
hamstrings out of this anterior tilt

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.240 
hamstrings out of this anterior tilt
position<00:04:48.090> so<00:04:49.020> that<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.169> can<00:04:49.320> actually<00:04:49.680> have<00:04:50.220> a

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
position so that you can actually have a

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.850

functional carryover we're right here I

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.189 
functional carryover we're right here I
go<00:04:53.370> all<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.639> way<00:04:53.729> down<00:04:53.970> as<00:04:54.389> far<00:04:54.720> back<00:04:54.870> as<00:04:54.930> I<00:04:55.169> can

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
and you'll notice that no stability was

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.640 
and you'll notice that no stability was
