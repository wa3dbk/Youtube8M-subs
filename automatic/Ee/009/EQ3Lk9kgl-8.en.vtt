some of the strongest proponents of of

some of the strongest proponents of of
you<00:02:01.890> know<00:02:02.009> labeling<00:02:02.850> games<00:02:03.149> as<00:02:03.540> mature

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
you know labeling games as mature

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
you know labeling games as mature
content<00:02:04.680> and

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
content and

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.590 
content and
not<00:02:05.220> because<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:05.700> know<00:02:05.790> our<00:02:05.970> intention<00:02:06.480> is

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
not because you know our intention is

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.740 
not because you know our intention is
never<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.230> make<00:02:07.440> a<00:02:07.470> game<00:02:07.800> for<00:02:08.630> you<00:02:09.630> know

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
never to make a game for you know

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.900 
never to make a game for you know
younger<00:02:10.410> audiences<00:02:11.130> it's<00:02:11.340> always<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.820> know

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
younger audiences it's always you know

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.550 
younger audiences it's always you know
the<00:02:12.030> average<00:02:12.180> for<00:02:12.450> video<00:02:12.630> game<00:02:12.810> players<00:02:13.050> 29

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the average for video game players 29

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.860 
the average for video game players 29
years<00:02:13.770> old<00:02:13.920> 30<00:02:14.250> years<00:02:14.460> old<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:15.390> that's<00:02:15.660> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
years old 30 years old and so that's the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.270 
years old 30 years old and so that's the
target<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.380> we're<00:02:16.560> really<00:02:16.800> shooting<00:02:17.100> for

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
target that we're really shooting for

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.800 
target that we're really shooting for
and<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.980> we're<00:02:20.490> in<00:02:20.700> full<00:02:20.940> agreement<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.660> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
and so we're in full agreement to it the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.730 
and so we're in full agreement to it the
screen<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:23.370> know<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.120> ESRB<00:02:24.630> was<00:02:25.320> the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
screen you know the the ESRB was the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.610 
screen you know the the ESRB was the
result<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.370> maturing<00:02:27.350> industry<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.500> know

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
result of a maturing industry you know

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.710 
result of a maturing industry you know
the<00:02:30.020> before<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:32.700> know<00:02:32.820> when<00:02:33.150> games<00:02:33.360> were<00:02:33.450> much

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
the before you know when games were much

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.390 
the before you know when games were much
less<00:02:33.900> sophisticated<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.710> was<00:02:34.860> just<00:02:35.070> little

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
less sophisticated it was just little

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.640 
less sophisticated it was just little
you<00:02:35.610> know<00:02:35.730> little<00:02:36.450> characters<00:02:36.960> jumping<00:02:37.410> over

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
you know little characters jumping over

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.490 
you know little characters jumping over
mushrooms<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.520> whatnot<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.570> as<00:02:39.810> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
mushrooms and whatnot and and as the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.320 
mushrooms and whatnot and and as the
graphics<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.310> technology<00:02:41.850> got<00:02:42.030> more<00:02:42.240> and

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
graphics and the technology got more and

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.910 
graphics and the technology got more and
more<00:02:42.480> sophisticated<00:02:42.630> all<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.380> sudden<00:02:43.650> the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
more sophisticated all of a sudden the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.560 
more sophisticated all of a sudden the
visuals<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.460> would<00:02:44.640> see<00:02:44.820> in<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:45.000> game<00:02:45.180> are

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
visuals that you would see in a game are

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.040 
visuals that you would see in a game are
closer<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.680> closer<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.310> film<00:02:48.270> or<00:02:48.570> movies<00:02:48.930> or

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
closer and closer to film or movies or

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.420 
closer and closer to film or movies or
something<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.680> would<00:02:49.800> see<00:02:49.980> there<00:02:50.250> and

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
something that you would see there and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.270 
something that you would see there and
with<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.630> comes<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.380> ability<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.100> create

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
with that comes the ability to create

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.510 
with that comes the ability to create
content<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:55.200> know<00:02:55.520> over-the-top

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
content that is you know over-the-top

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.900 
content that is you know over-the-top
and<00:02:56.910> violent<00:02:57.570> stuff<00:02:57.810> like<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.530> that

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
and violent stuff like that and so that

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.570 
and violent stuff like that and so that
evolved<00:02:59.910> into<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.390> need<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:01.200> we<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:02.460> know

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
evolved into a need that we you know

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.760 
evolved into a need that we you know
tend<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:02.910> agree<00:03:03.150> with<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.840> some<00:03:04.440> kind<00:03:04.680> of

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
tend to agree with the some kind of

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.920 
tend to agree with the some kind of
labeling<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.400> saying<00:03:05.670> hey<00:03:05.850> this<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.750> kind

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
labeling of saying hey this is the kind
