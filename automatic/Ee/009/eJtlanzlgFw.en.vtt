00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.050
 The murmur of the palms 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.883
 by Deepa Gangwani 

00:00:14.883 --> 00:00:18.800
 and Tina Suchanek 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.550
 Mori was a little girl 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.633
 with big brown eyes. 

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:26.550
 She lived with her parents 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.383
 in a beautiful coconut grove, 

00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:36.550
 near a lake with blue waters. 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.133
 Each morning, 

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.550
 she was posing a big 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.967
 empty basket balancing on his head, 

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:46.467
 and went down to the lake. 

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:47.550
 His mother followed her 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.133
 carrying a laundry basket 

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.300
 and his father, 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.383
 a large fishing net. 

00:00:55.383 --> 00:00:57.133
 His mother was washing clothes 

00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:01.217
 on a stone by the lake 

00:01:01.217 --> 00:01:02.050
 as his father 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.383
 went fishing. 

00:01:05.383 --> 00:01:06.883
 Then he pulled the net on the shore 

00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:08.383
 and together they were gathering the fish 

00:01:08.383 --> 00:01:14.050
 in the big basket. 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.300
 Sometimes, 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.883
 a turtle was stuck 

00:01:17.883 --> 00:01:19.717
 in the net but Mori 

00:01:19.717 --> 00:01:25.300
 always came to his aid. 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.217
 A nice morning, 

00:01:28.217 --> 00:01:31.050
 while Mori was fishing with his father, 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.050
 she exclaimed: 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.383
 "If we continue to catch as many fish, 

00:01:37.383 --> 00:01:41.467
 one day, there will be no more! " 

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:42.383
 His mother laughed 

00:01:42.383 --> 00:01:49.217
 and sent him to school. 

00:01:49.217 --> 00:01:51.883
 But, in the shade of coconut palms, 

00:01:51.883 --> 00:01:54.133
 Mori's mother lay down 

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:57.050
 and in a troubled sleep, 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.133
 she dreamed of a small lake 

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:03.383
 without fish. 

00:02:03.383 --> 00:02:04.133
 That's when the wind 

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:05.300
 in the flippers 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.383
 murmured in secret: 

00:02:10.383 --> 00:02:11.217
 " Water 

00:02:11.217 --> 00:02:11.883
 and the earth 

00:02:11.883 --> 00:02:13.467
 have always taken 

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:20.383
 care of you and your family. 

00:02:20.383 --> 00:02:23.633
 You too, your turn 

00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:25.467
 you must take 

00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:32.217
 take care of her. " 

00:02:32.217 --> 00:02:33.550
 She woke up 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.133
 eyes misted with tears 

00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:37.217
 because she did not see 

00:02:37.217 --> 00:02:38.467
 how to raise Mori 

00:02:38.467 --> 00:02:42.550
 without continuing to sell all these fish. 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.717
 She spent the whole afternoon 

00:02:45.717 --> 00:02:48.717
 seat to weave carpets in coconut fiber 

00:02:48.717 --> 00:02:49.383
 while reflecting 

00:02:49.383 --> 00:02:53.133
 to his dream. 

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:55.300
 That night, 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.550
 Mori heard his parents 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.133
 whisper long 

00:02:57.133 --> 00:03:01.717
 and the oil lamp 

00:03:01.717 --> 00:03:06.050
 burned until late at night. 

00:03:09.383 --> 00:03:10.717
 The next morning, 

00:03:10.717 --> 00:03:11.800
 his father entrusted him 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.217
 a smaller basket. 

00:03:14.217 --> 00:03:15.800
 "How to bring back all 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.050
 fishing in this little basket? " 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.133
 She asked. 

00:03:23.133 --> 00:03:24.050
 "We will bring back 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.883
 so many fish 

00:03:26.883 --> 00:03:30.050
 that this basket can contain ", 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.467
 he replied. 

00:03:32.467 --> 00:03:36.800
 Mori was perplexed. 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.717
 On his return from school, 

00:03:39.717 --> 00:03:41.300
 she was delighted to find her mother 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.550
 busy making soap 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.467
 and coconut oil. 

00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:49.467
 Mori was going to climb up a 

00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:56.300
 coconut tree for 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.300
 to harvest again when her mother warned her: 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.967
 "Do not pick anything, 

00:03:59.967 --> 00:04:01.467
 we do not have to take 

00:04:01.467 --> 00:04:07.217
 than what the tree gives us. " 

00:04:07.217 --> 00:04:09.883
 And his father added: 

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:10.717
 "We only used 

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:12.383
 those who had fallen to the ground 

00:04:12.383 --> 00:04:13.467
 to make all these things. 

00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:14.300
 look, 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.217
 we made this soap 

00:04:16.217 --> 00:04:22.050
 and there is even a jasmine flower inside. " 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.883
 Since then, 

00:04:24.883 --> 00:04:26.633
 the whole family made brooms 

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:27.967
 of palm leaves 

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:29.133
 and weaved carpets 

00:04:29.133 --> 00:04:33.133
 in coconut fiber. 

00:04:33.133 --> 00:04:34.717
 They sold to the soap market, 

00:04:34.717 --> 00:04:36.217
 oil 

00:04:36.217 --> 00:04:38.383
 and only 

00:04:38.383 --> 00:04:42.883
 a little fish. 

00:04:42.883 --> 00:04:45.717
 When Mori became big, 

00:04:45.717 --> 00:04:48.383
 she loved to carve tiny turtles 

00:04:48.383 --> 00:04:51.133
 in the coconut shell. 

00:04:51.133 --> 00:04:53.383
 Moreover, she always wore one 

00:04:53.383 --> 00:04:55.383
 around his neck.
