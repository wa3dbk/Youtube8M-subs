follows in this third category this blue
section<00:00:42.829> basically<00:00:43.829> saying<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.309> runs<00:00:44.489> at<00:00:44.640> 300

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
section basically saying it runs at 300

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.110 
section basically saying it runs at 300
nips<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:46.289> above<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:47.100> run<00:00:47.250> at<00:00:47.370> 450

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
nips the one above that can run at 450

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.779 
nips the one above that can run at 450
and<00:00:48.149> 300<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.800> one<00:00:49.950> above<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.610> run

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
and 300 and the one above that can run

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.860 
and 300 and the one above that can run
it<00:00:51.289> 450<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.410> 450<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.820> reason<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.329> has<00:00:54.510> two

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
it 450 and 450 the reason it has two

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.590 
it 450 and 450 the reason it has two
settings<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.620> because<00:00:56.070> those<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.390> dual

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
settings is because those are a dual

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.400 
settings is because those are a dual
band<00:00:57.870> router

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
band router

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.529 
band router
meaning<00:00:59.219> they<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.640> run<00:00:59.820> at<00:00:59.940> five<00:01:00.180> gigahertz

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
meaning they can run at five gigahertz

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.500 
meaning they can run at five gigahertz
as<00:01:00.870> well<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:01.230> 2.4<00:01:01.620> gigahertz<00:01:02.210> this<00:01:03.210> router

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
as well as 2.4 gigahertz this router

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.050 
as well as 2.4 gigahertz this router
only<00:01:03.719> runs<00:01:04.019> at<00:01:04.170> 2.4<00:01:04.920> gigahertz<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
only runs at 2.4 gigahertz and the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.240 
only runs at 2.4 gigahertz and the
reason<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.510> would<00:01:06.570> choose<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.170> one<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.770> if<00:01:08.070> you

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
reason I would choose this one is if you

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.090 
reason I would choose this one is if you
have<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> DSL<00:01:09.060> connection<00:01:09.659> or<00:01:10.080> slow<00:01:10.590> cable

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
have a DSL connection or slow cable

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.969 
have a DSL connection or slow cable
connection<00:01:12.140> it's<00:01:13.140> not<00:01:13.350> going<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> make<00:01:13.740> much

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
connection it's not going to make much

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.890 
connection it's not going to make much
of<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.189> difference<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.700> mean<00:01:14.820> 2<00:01:15.030> bands<00:01:15.450> however

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
of a difference I mean 2 bands however

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.190 
of a difference I mean 2 bands however
if<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:17.040> larger<00:01:17.490> family<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.960> have

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
if you have a larger family and you have

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.890 
if you have a larger family and you have
a<00:01:19.229> high-speed<00:01:19.860> connection<00:01:20.479> where<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.509> might

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
a high-speed connection where you might

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.530 
a high-speed connection where you might
stream<00:01:22.320> movies<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.250> lot<00:01:23.580> or<00:01:23.880> do<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> lot<00:01:24.390> of

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
stream movies a lot or do a lot of

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.390 
stream movies a lot or do a lot of
downloading<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.590> might<00:01:25.740> want<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.159> those

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
downloading you might want to have those

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.490 
downloading you might want to have those
two<00:01:26.670> bands<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.360> will<00:01:27.600> have<00:01:27.750> lag<00:01:28.140> free

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
two bands so you will have lag free

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.640 
two bands so you will have lag free
streaming<00:01:29.400> if<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.240> watch<00:01:30.450> movies<00:01:30.990> or<00:01:31.140> playing

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
streaming if you watch movies or playing

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.480 
streaming if you watch movies or playing
games<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.900> so<00:01:33.900> I'll<00:01:33.990> go<00:01:34.170> ahead<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.500> get

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
games on one so I'll go ahead and get

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.170 
games on one so I'll go ahead and get
into<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.790> box<00:01:36.000> here

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.990 

so<00:01:40.990> this<00:01:41.200> is<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.530> box<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:41.890> comes<00:01:42.490> inside<00:01:42.790> the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
so this is the box that comes inside the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.290 
so this is the box that comes inside the
bigger<00:01:43.210> box<00:01:43.510> and<00:01:44.700> go<00:01:45.700> ahead<00:01:45.910> and<00:01:46.030> take<00:01:46.150> the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
bigger box and go ahead and take the

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.420 
bigger box and go ahead and take the
router<00:01:46.480> I'll<00:01:46.710> show<00:01:47.710> you<00:01:47.770> what<00:01:47.980> it<00:01:48.070> looks<00:01:48.250> like

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
kind of a plain router I like the white

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.690 
kind of a plain router I like the white
finish<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.300> it<00:01:52.860> kind<00:01:53.860> of<00:01:54.040> give<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.400> a<00:01:54.430> whole

back you can see these three gold

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.420 
back you can see these three gold
connections<00:02:04.150> for<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.960> antenna<00:02:05.410> it<00:02:05.710> has<00:02:06.040> three

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
connections for the antenna it has three

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.639

I<00:03:53.390> kind<00:03:54.390> of<00:03:54.420> like<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.780> antennas<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.470> it

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
I kind of like the antennas that it

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.820 
I kind of like the antennas that it
comes<00:03:55.800> with<00:03:55.920> kind<00:03:56.580> of<00:03:56.670> big<00:03:56.819> antennas<00:03:57.300> I<00:03:58.230> would

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
comes with kind of big antennas I would

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.210 
comes with kind of big antennas I would
thought<00:03:59.069> there<00:03:59.280> would<00:03:59.400> be<00:03:59.430> a<00:04:00.650> different<00:04:01.650> dpi

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
thought there would be a different dpi

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.660 
thought there would be a different dpi
setting<00:04:02.670> than<00:04:02.790> they<00:04:02.910> are<00:04:02.940> these<00:04:03.330> are<00:04:03.569> to<00:04:04.020> gain

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
setting than they are these are to gain

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.059 
setting than they are these are to gain
per<00:04:05.670> antenna<00:04:06.030> I<00:04:06.300> should<00:04:06.750> say<00:04:06.990> I<00:04:07.230> thought<00:04:07.890> they

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
per antenna I should say I thought they

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.460 
per antenna I should say I thought they
would<00:04:08.220> have<00:04:08.340> been<00:04:08.490> least<00:04:08.790> five<00:04:09.120> I've<00:04:09.870> read

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
would have been least five I've read

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.170 
would have been least five I've read
online<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:11.070> some<00:04:11.310> people<00:04:11.640> switch<00:04:11.880> them<00:04:12.060> out

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
online that some people switch them out

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.290 
online that some people switch them out
to<00:04:12.480> a<00:04:12.510> nineteen<00:04:13.200> bi<00:04:13.410> gain<00:04:13.740> antenna<00:04:14.300> little

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
to a nineteen bi gain antenna little

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.890 
to a nineteen bi gain antenna little
ethernet<00:04:15.720> cord<00:04:15.930> that's<00:04:16.500> nice<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:18.510> last

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
ethernet cord that's nice and the last

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.530 
ethernet cord that's nice and the last
thing<00:04:19.109> in<00:04:19.200> a<00:04:19.290> box<00:04:20.150> guessing<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.239> is<00:04:21.390> your

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
thing in a box guessing this is your

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:28.840 
thing in a box guessing this is your
power<00:04:21.690> supply<00:04:22.109> here<00:04:25.550> got<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.669> power<00:04:26.910> supply

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
power supply here got the power supply

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.080 
power supply here got the power supply
so<00:04:29.850> that's<00:04:30.060> basically<00:04:30.510> all<00:04:30.720> it's<00:04:30.870> in<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.080> Box

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
so that's basically all it's in the Box

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.370 
so that's basically all it's in the Box
pretty<00:04:33.090> straightforward<00:04:33.780> I<00:04:33.900> actually<00:04:34.110> think

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
pretty straightforward I actually think

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.100 
pretty straightforward I actually think
it<00:04:34.590> was<00:04:34.710> kind<00:04:34.919> of<00:04:34.950> nicer<00:04:35.840> putting<00:04:36.840> so<00:04:36.990> much

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
it was kind of nicer putting so much

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.840 
it was kind of nicer putting so much
documents<00:04:37.890> in<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.100> ethernet<00:04:38.580> cable<00:04:38.760> on<00:04:39.000> there

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
documents in the ethernet cable on there

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.120 
documents in the ethernet cable on there
I'll<00:04:41.850> kind<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.210> go<00:04:42.390> ahead<00:04:42.480> and<00:04:42.900> say<00:04:43.860> a<00:04:43.890> couple

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
I'll kind of go ahead and say a couple

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.930 
I'll kind of go ahead and say a couple
more<00:04:44.220> things<00:04:44.310> about<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:46.350> router<00:04:46.620> will<00:04:47.520> fly<00:04:47.730> in

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
more things about the router will fly in

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.450 
more things about the router will fly in
this<00:04:48.090> video<00:04:48.590> and<00:04:49.590> I'll<00:04:49.740> leave<00:04:49.919> it<00:04:49.950> looking<00:04:50.370> on

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
this video and I'll leave it looking on

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.250 
this video and I'll leave it looking on
the<00:04:50.580> back<00:04:50.820> and<00:04:51.270> I'll<00:04:51.450> that's<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.810> part<00:04:52.050> most

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
the back and I'll that's the part most

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.620 
the back and I'll that's the part most
people<00:04:52.530> have<00:04:52.680> questions<00:04:53.190> about<00:04:54.620> so<00:04:56.419> I'll<00:04:57.419> just

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
people have questions about so I'll just

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.270 
people have questions about so I'll just
talk<00:04:57.780> a<00:04:57.810> little<00:04:58.050> bit<00:04:58.290> about<00:04:58.320> this<00:04:58.800> specific

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
talk a little bit about this specific

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.969 
talk a little bit about this specific
router<00:04:59.490> and<00:04:59.700> why<00:04:59.790> you<00:04:59.850> might<00:05:00.180> want<00:05:00.419> to<00:05:00.510> get<00:05:00.660> it

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
router and why you might want to get it

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.580 
router and why you might want to get it
what's<00:05:01.979> nice<00:05:02.190> about<00:05:02.220> this<00:05:02.700> router<00:05:03.000> is<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:04.350> it

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
what's nice about this router is that it

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.800 
what's nice about this router is that it
does<00:05:04.770> support<00:05:05.100> Wireless<00:05:05.610> and<00:05:05.850> as<00:05:06.210> well<00:05:06.419> as<00:05:06.570> B

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
does support Wireless and as well as B

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.580 
does support Wireless and as well as B
and<00:05:06.960> G<00:05:07.200> and<00:05:08.120> it<00:05:09.120> has<00:05:09.300> an<00:05:09.510> external<00:05:09.840> antenna<00:05:10.290> for

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
and G and it has an external antenna for

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.930 
and G and it has an external antenna for
each<00:05:10.830> it's<00:05:11.220> kind<00:05:11.940> of<00:05:12.000> nice<00:05:12.150> on<00:05:13.340> they<00:05:14.340> also<00:05:14.520> made

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
each it's kind of nice on they also made

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.840 
each it's kind of nice on they also made
this<00:05:15.210> to<00:05:15.990> run<00:05:16.620> off<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:16.860> third-party<00:05:17.490> firmware

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
this to run off a third-party firmware

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.480 
this to run off a third-party firmware
like<00:05:18.720> tomato<00:05:19.140> on<00:05:19.350> dd-wrt

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
like tomato on dd-wrt

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.830 
like tomato on dd-wrt
and<00:05:21.200> because<00:05:22.200> of<00:05:22.380> it<00:05:22.500> it<00:05:22.740> actually<00:05:23.160> has<00:05:23.840> 128

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
and because of it it actually has 128

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.120 
and because of it it actually has 128
megabytes<00:05:25.110> of<00:05:25.530> RAM<00:05:25.830> and<00:05:26.360> a<00:05:27.360> lot<00:05:28.020> of<00:05:28.050> ROM<00:05:28.470> to<00:05:28.860> be

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
megabytes of RAM and a lot of ROM to be

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.340 
megabytes of RAM and a lot of ROM to be
able<00:05:29.220> to<00:05:29.400> store<00:05:29.760> any<00:05:30.450> firmware<00:05:30.780> you<00:05:31.050> need

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
able to store any firmware you need

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.490 
able to store any firmware you need
actually<00:05:32.280> has<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.460> largest<00:05:32.760> amount<00:05:33.210> of<00:05:33.500> any

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
actually has the largest amount of any

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.650 
actually has the largest amount of any
router<00:05:35.039> right<00:05:35.340> now

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
router right now

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.420 
router right now
Asus<00:05:37.169> only<00:05:37.410> makes<00:05:37.590> a<00:05:37.710> few<00:05:37.919> more<00:05:38.130> with<00:05:38.310> that

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
Asus only makes a few more with that

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.980 
Asus only makes a few more with that
same<00:05:38.789> size<00:05:39.120> so<00:05:40.050> it's<00:05:40.530> really<00:05:40.860> nice<00:05:41.510> this<00:05:42.510> isn't

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
same size so it's really nice this isn't

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.150 
same size so it's really nice this isn't
a<00:05:43.700> dual<00:05:44.700> band<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:45.270> it's<00:05:45.390> not<00:05:45.630> AC<00:05:45.979> which<00:05:46.979> is

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
a dual band and it's not AC which is

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.010 
a dual band and it's not AC which is
kind<00:05:47.400> of<00:05:47.430> next-generation<00:05:47.940> so<00:05:48.539> if<00:05:48.630> you<00:05:48.750> really

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
kind of next-generation so if you really

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.159 
kind of next-generation so if you really
want<00:05:49.350> to<00:05:49.440> spend<00:05:49.530> some<00:05:49.800> money<00:05:49.890> and<00:05:50.510> buy<00:05:51.510> the

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
want to spend some money and buy the

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.469 
want to spend some money and buy the
highest<00:05:52.890> tech<00:05:53.250> router<00:05:53.490> this<00:05:53.850> isn't<00:05:54.180> for<00:05:54.360> you

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
highest tech router this isn't for you

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.690 
highest tech router this isn't for you
but<00:05:54.660> if<00:05:55.530> you<00:05:55.680> want<00:05:55.830> to<00:05:55.979> buy<00:05:56.100> something<00:05:56.669> that

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
but if you want to buy something that

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.050 
but if you want to buy something that
has<00:05:57.120> a<00:05:57.570> pretty<00:05:57.960> fast<00:05:58.289> speed<00:05:58.650> to<00:05:58.919> it<00:05:59.100> at<00:05:59.910> least

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
has a pretty fast speed to it at least

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.480 
has a pretty fast speed to it at least
in<00:06:00.210> theory<00:06:00.539> I<00:06:01.440> think<00:06:01.919> this<00:06:02.070> is<00:06:02.220> a<00:06:02.250> pretty

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
in theory I think this is a pretty

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.540 
in theory I think this is a pretty
decent<00:06:02.729> router<00:06:03.150> and<00:06:03.510> like<00:06:03.780> I<00:06:03.960> said<00:06:04.020> you<00:06:04.320> can

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
decent router and like I said you can

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.200 
decent router and like I said you can
swap<00:06:05.550> out<00:06:05.729> these

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
swap out these

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.870 
swap out these
tennis<00:06:06.660> with<00:06:06.990> your<00:06:07.169> own<00:06:07.289> antennas<00:06:07.789> some<00:06:08.789> of

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
tennis with your own antennas some of

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.029 
tennis with your own antennas some of
the<00:06:08.970> new<00:06:09.090> Asus<00:06:09.539> once<00:06:09.810> I'll<00:06:10.080> have<00:06:10.350> an<00:06:10.470> internal

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
the new Asus once I'll have an internal

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.710 
the new Asus once I'll have an internal
antenna<00:06:11.190> so<00:06:11.639> you<00:06:11.819> won't<00:06:12.060> be<00:06:12.180> able<00:06:12.270> to<00:06:12.419> have

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
antenna so you won't be able to have

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.860 
antenna so you won't be able to have
that<00:06:13.520> so<00:06:14.520> that's<00:06:14.789> pretty<00:06:15.000> much<00:06:15.090> there<00:06:15.449> is<00:06:15.599> to

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
that so that's pretty much there is to

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:16.520 
that so that's pretty much there is to
it

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
it

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.860 
it
