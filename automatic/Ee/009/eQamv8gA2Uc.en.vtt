00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.699 

so<00:00:00.179> I<00:00:00.240> finished<00:00:00.630> cleaning<00:00:00.840> the<00:00:01.020> glass<00:00:01.199> with

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
so I finished cleaning the glass with

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.590 
so I finished cleaning the glass with
the<00:00:01.829> magnet<00:00:02.280> and<00:00:02.520> i'll<00:00:03.240> just<00:00:03.389> show<00:00:03.570> you

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
the magnet and i'll just show you

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.160 
the magnet and i'll just show you
quickly<00:00:03.990> how<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.290> use<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.680> pro<00:00:04.890> scraper<00:00:06.170> just

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
quickly how to use the pro scraper just

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.259 
quickly how to use the pro scraper just
apply<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.799> bit<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.099> pressure<00:00:08.370> on<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:08.880> so<00:00:09.120> it

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
apply a bit of pressure on it so it

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.900 
apply a bit of pressure on it so it
flattens<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.110> just<00:00:10.950> clean<00:00:11.190> where<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.460> go<00:00:11.610> to

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
flattens and just clean where you go to

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.570 
flattens and just clean where you go to
and<00:00:12.240> it'll<00:00:12.450> clean<00:00:12.660> off<00:00:12.950> some<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.130> coraline

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
and it'll clean off some of the coraline

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.170 
and it'll clean off some of the coraline
yeah<00:00:15.240> actually<00:00:15.360> have<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.809> be<00:00:15.900> careful<00:00:16.970> this<00:00:17.970> is

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
yeah actually have to be careful this is

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.269 
yeah actually have to be careful this is
a<00:00:18.210> little<00:00:18.720> bit<00:00:18.810> older<00:00:19.170> blade<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.800> it's<00:00:19.949> not<00:00:20.100> as

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
a little bit older blade so it's not as

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.029 
a little bit older blade so it's not as
flat<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:21.020> newer<00:00:22.020> blade<00:00:22.380> will<00:00:22.590> catch<00:00:22.769> more

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
flat a newer blade will catch more

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.179 
flat a newer blade will catch more
surface<00:00:23.519> area<00:00:24.230> you<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.380> see<00:00:25.560> they<00:00:25.740> do<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.980> good

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
surface area you can see they do a good

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.759 
surface area you can see they do a good
job<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:27.080> could<00:00:28.080> be<00:00:28.170> careful<00:00:28.560> where<00:00:28.680> you're

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
job I could be careful where you're

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:41.640 
job I could be careful where you're
working<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.369> don't<00:00:31.189> hit<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.369> corals

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:50.220 

and<00:00:42.550> there's<00:00:43.510> a<00:00:43.570> smaller<00:00:43.900> one<00:00:44.200> as<00:00:44.350> well<00:00:49.230> you

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
and there's a smaller one as well you

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.970 
and there's a smaller one as well you
can<00:00:50.410> use<00:00:50.620> just<00:00:50.920> a<00:00:51.040> clean<00:00:51.810> sides<00:00:55.860> careful<00:00:56.860> how

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
can use just a clean sides careful how

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.880 
can use just a clean sides careful how
coach<00:00:57.220> you<00:00:57.370> go<00:00:57.490> to<00:00:57.550> the<00:00:57.730> edge<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:59.500> don't<00:00:59.680> want

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
coach you go to the edge you don't want

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:07.200 
coach you go to the edge you don't want
to<00:01:00.070> damage<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.970> caulking<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.850> like<00:01:07.030> that

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
to damage the caulking just like that

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.370 
to damage the caulking just like that
you<00:01:08.110> know<00:01:08.490> i<00:01:09.490> also<00:01:10.150> have<00:01:10.480> a<00:01:10.510> little<00:01:10.780> tool<00:01:11.050> here

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
you know i also have a little tool here

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.190 
you know i also have a little tool here
which<00:01:11.590> I<00:01:11.740> find<00:01:11.950> hard<00:01:12.100> to<00:01:12.310> get<00:01:12.580> in<00:01:13.390> Canada<00:01:13.960> but<00:01:14.020> I

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
which I find hard to get in Canada but I

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.609 
which I find hard to get in Canada but I
was<00:01:14.320> able<00:01:14.440> to<00:01:14.619> get<00:01:14.740> it<00:01:14.920> into<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.490> states<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
was able to get it into the states is a

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.240 
was able to get it into the states is a
mag<00:01:18.190> flip<00:01:18.580> it's<00:01:19.060> small<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.560> it<00:01:20.680> allows<00:01:20.890> me<00:01:21.130> to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
mag flip it's small so it allows me to

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.090 
mag flip it's small so it allows me to
get<00:01:21.369> into<00:01:22.140> tighter<00:01:23.140> areas<00:01:23.530> it's<00:01:23.740> not<00:01:23.890> as

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
get into tighter areas it's not as

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.050 
get into tighter areas it's not as
strong<00:01:24.369> a<00:01:24.400> magnet<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:26.830> good<00:01:27.100> for

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
strong a magnet but it is good for

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.820 
strong a magnet but it is good for
getting<00:01:28.360> into<00:01:28.630> areas<00:01:29.050> where<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.380> coral<00:01:29.710> is

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
getting into areas where the coral is

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.980 
getting into areas where the coral is
close<00:01:30.070> to<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.369> glass<00:01:30.690> or<00:01:31.690> you<00:01:31.869> have

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
close to the glass or you have

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.719 
close to the glass or you have
tight-fitting<00:01:32.590> areas<00:01:32.920> where<00:01:33.100> your<00:01:33.190> rock<00:01:33.430> is

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
tight-fitting areas where your rock is

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.810 
tight-fitting areas where your rock is
so<00:01:34.510> you<00:01:34.600> can<00:01:34.720> get<00:01:34.869> into<00:01:35.080> those<00:01:35.350> areas<00:01:35.410> and<00:01:36.010> it

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
so you can get into those areas and it

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.780 
so you can get into those areas and it
can<00:01:37.060> there's<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:37.690> trick<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:37.990> it<00:01:38.340> my<00:01:39.340> hands<00:01:39.550> wet

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
can there's a trick to it my hands wet

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.249 
can there's a trick to it my hands wet
so<00:01:39.970> it's<00:01:40.119> easier<00:01:40.390> for<00:01:40.450> me<00:01:40.570> just<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:40.900> do<00:01:41.050> it<00:01:41.080> this

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
so it's easier for me just to do it this

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.370 
so it's easier for me just to do it this
way<00:01:41.580> but<00:01:42.580> he<00:01:42.670> just<00:01:42.820> flipped<00:01:43.119> it<00:01:43.210> around<00:01:43.380> there

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
way but he just flipped it around there

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.380 
way but he just flipped it around there
is<00:01:44.500> a<00:01:44.530> trick<00:01:44.800> you<00:01:44.979> can<00:01:45.040> do<00:01:45.250> it<00:01:45.369> has<00:01:45.880> a<00:01:45.910> bit<00:01:46.240> of<00:01:46.270> a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
is a trick you can do it has a bit of a

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.140 
is a trick you can do it has a bit of a
blade<00:01:46.600> on<00:01:46.630> it<00:01:46.870> it's<00:01:47.440> not<00:01:47.650> bad<00:01:47.860> we'll<00:01:48.670> take<00:01:48.940> some

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
blade on it it's not bad we'll take some

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.780 
blade on it it's not bad we'll take some
coraline<00:01:49.720> with<00:01:49.930> a<00:01:49.960> bit<00:01:50.140> of<00:01:50.170> work<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.610> as<00:01:51.610> it

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
coraline with a bit of work and as it

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.380 
coraline with a bit of work and as it
ages<00:01:51.970> it<00:01:52.210> gets<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.540> little<00:01:52.690> worse<00:01:52.960> but<00:01:52.990> it<00:01:53.920> can

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
ages it gets a little worse but it can

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.670 
ages it gets a little worse but it can
takes<00:01:55.390> a<00:01:55.480> lot<00:01:55.630> of<00:01:55.660> work<00:01:55.840> but<00:01:56.050> you<00:01:56.200> can<00:01:56.230> actually

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
takes a lot of work but you can actually

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.460 
takes a lot of work but you can actually
get<00:01:57.040> small<00:01:57.820> patches<00:01:58.300> of<00:01:58.570> coraline<00:01:59.050> off<00:01:59.230> not

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
get small patches of coraline off not

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.720 
get small patches of coraline off not
large<00:01:59.710> ones<00:01:59.980> though<00:02:00.570> thank<00:02:01.570> you
