00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
feeling dimension it's almost like we're

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.799 
feeling dimension it's almost like we're
going<00:00:32.279> from<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> head<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.090> heart<00:00:33.420> if<00:00:33.690> you

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
going from the head to the heart if you

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.630 
going from the head to the heart if you
will<00:00:33.989> that's<00:00:34.530> right<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.070> we<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.309> two

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
will that's right and we have two

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.299 
will that's right and we have two
reasons<00:00:35.969> for<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.660> one<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.559> lunar<00:00:37.980> shift

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
reasons for that one is the lunar shift

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.340

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
mean there's a sense of imagination with

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.350 
mean there's a sense of imagination with
Neptune<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.290> spirituality<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.119> moon's

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
moving into in into Pisces also it's

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.410 
moving into in into Pisces also it's
going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.140> catch<00:01:16.350> up<00:01:16.650> with<00:01:16.729> with<00:01:17.729> Neptune<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
going to catch up with with Neptune and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.570 
going to catch up with with Neptune and
so<00:01:18.810> there's<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.200> idea<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.890> Dreams<00:01:20.340> being

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
so there's this idea of Dreams being

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.179 
so there's this idea of Dreams being
very<00:01:21.090> important<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.990> our<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.530> sense<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.920> wish

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
very important and our the sense of wish

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.880 
very important and our the sense of wish
fulfillment<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.939> fantasy<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.720> being<00:01:24.900> very

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
fulfillment of fantasy of being very

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.630 
fulfillment of fantasy of being very
significant<00:01:26.640> here<00:01:26.850> also<00:01:27.090> yeah<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.130> think<00:01:29.130> that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
significant here also yeah I think that

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.999 
significant here also yeah I think that
while<00:01:29.970> imagination<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.200> fantasy<00:01:31.500> are

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
