anyways he actually had his work on his
team<00:00:29.859> I<00:00:30.039> predicted<00:00:30.849> predicted<00:00:31.630> this<00:00:31.749> to<00:00:31.929> be

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
team I predicted predicted this to be

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.680 
team I predicted predicted this to be
dessert<00:00:32.470> and<00:00:32.770> actually<00:00:33.610> do<00:00:34.210> predicted<00:00:34.600> to<00:00:34.660> be

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
dessert and actually do predicted to be

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.240 
dessert and actually do predicted to be
this<00:00:34.840> org<00:00:35.050> so<00:00:35.320> that's<00:00:35.650> why<00:00:35.770> I<00:00:35.800> go<00:00:35.980> into<00:00:36.100> my

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
this org so that's why I go into my

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.160 
this org so that's why I go into my
Zapdos<00:00:36.700> and<00:00:36.730> I<00:00:37.180> take<00:00:37.360> it<00:00:37.510> nicely<00:00:37.690> because<00:00:37.930> I'm

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
Zapdos and I take it nicely because I'm

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.760 
Zapdos and I take it nicely because I'm
a<00:00:38.200> special<00:00:38.620> defensive<00:00:38.980> Zapdos<00:00:39.370> and<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.960> was

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
a special defensive Zapdos and I was

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.439 
a special defensive Zapdos and I was
hoping<00:00:41.949> this<00:00:42.070> thing<00:00:42.250> to<00:00:42.370> be<00:00:42.460> either<00:00:42.670> sash<00:00:43.149> to<00:00:43.390> a

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
hoping this thing to be either sash to a

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.389 
hoping this thing to be either sash to a
scarf<00:00:43.780> mostly<00:00:44.379> scarf<00:00:44.680> so<00:00:44.800> you<00:00:44.890> can<00:00:45.010> switch<00:00:45.280> out

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
scarf mostly scarf so you can switch out

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.459 
scarf mostly scarf so you can switch out
of<00:00:45.519> something<00:00:45.670> and<00:00:45.940> I<00:00:46.030> can<00:00:46.180> get<00:00:46.269> toxic<00:00:46.660> off<00:00:46.840> but

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
of something and I can get toxic off but

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.110 
of something and I can get toxic off but
i<00:00:47.500> actually<00:00:47.680> just<00:00:47.859> went<00:00:48.129> for<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.309> toxics<00:00:48.730> just

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
i actually just went for the toxics just

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.900 
i actually just went for the toxics just
so<00:00:49.269> just<00:00:49.930> in<00:00:50.050> case<00:00:50.230> of<00:00:50.440> it<00:00:50.530> was<00:00:50.710> sash<00:00:51.039> we

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
so just in case of it was sash we

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.430 
so just in case of it was sash we
actually<00:00:52.059> turned<00:00:52.329> out<00:00:52.359> to<00:00:52.420> be<00:00:52.600> a<00:00:52.629> leftover<00:00:53.230> so

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
actually turned out to be a leftover so

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.229 
actually turned out to be a leftover so
i<00:00:53.500> really<00:00:53.620> haven't<00:00:53.829> seen<00:00:54.039> on<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.340> drugs

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
i really haven't seen on the drugs

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.439 
i really haven't seen on the drugs
usually<00:00:55.949> but<00:00:56.949> he<00:00:57.309> gets<00:00:57.460> a<00:00:57.519> nasty<00:00:57.670> pot<00:00:58.030> off<00:00:58.210> and

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
for the night burst and said because I

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.760 
for the night burst and said because I
get<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:32.530> burden<00:01:32.920> here<00:01:33.220> which<00:01:34.030> is<00:01:34.180> pretty<00:01:34.360> much

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
get the burden here which is pretty much

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.709 
get the burden here which is pretty much
K<00:01:35.770> because<00:01:35.799> now<00:01:36.520> Tara<00:01:36.850> tar<00:01:37.119> is<00:01:37.180> almost<00:01:37.479> useless

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
K because now Tara tar is almost useless

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.240 
K because now Tara tar is almost useless
because<00:01:38.200> it's<00:01:39.130> mostly<00:01:39.250> physical<00:01:39.640> but<00:01:41.250> it's

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
because it's mostly physical but it's

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.280 
because it's mostly physical but it's
going<00:01:42.399> to<00:01:42.460> become<00:01:42.579> useful<00:01:43.149> i<00:01:43.750> guess<00:01:43.960> but

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
going to become useful i guess but

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.959 
going to become useful i guess but
anyways<00:01:44.890> this<00:01:45.070> work<00:01:45.280> is<00:01:45.399> going<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.579> die<00:01:45.729> due<00:01:45.790> to

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
anyways this work is going to die due to

rocks<00:01:56.049> up<00:01:56.289> and<00:01:56.469> i<00:01:56.500> know<00:01:56.560> you<00:01:56.710> pretty<00:01:57.009> much

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
rocks up and i know you pretty much

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.670 
rocks up and i know you pretty much
can't<00:01:57.369> do<00:01:57.490> anything<00:01:57.789> to<00:01:58.000> me<00:01:58.060> but<00:01:58.590> he's<00:01:59.590> gonna

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
can't do anything to me but he's gonna

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.200 
can't do anything to me but he's gonna
go<00:01:59.829> for<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.070> gear<00:02:00.340> shift<00:02:00.610> which<00:02:01.149> raises<00:02:01.479> his

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
go for the gear shift which raises his

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.740 
go for the gear shift which raises his
speed<00:02:02.870> and<00:02:03.110> attack<00:02:04.330> but<00:02:05.330> i'm<00:02:05.420> not<00:02:05.479> really<00:02:05.540> that

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
speed and attack but i'm not really that

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.469 
speed and attack but i'm not really that
worried<00:02:06.640> so<00:02:07.640> he's<00:02:08.000> gonna<00:02:08.149> go<00:02:08.270> for<00:02:08.300> the

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
worried so he's gonna go for the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.020 
worried so he's gonna go for the
solution<00:02:08.990> which<00:02:09.259> is<00:02:09.289> a<00:02:09.470> move<00:02:09.800> that<00:02:10.039> I<00:02:10.220> think<00:02:10.819> is

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
solution which is a move that I think is

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.170 
solution which is a move that I think is
based<00:02:11.270> on<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.600> hate<00:02:11.959> between<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:13.180> trainer

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
based on the hate between the trainer

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.100 
based on the hate between the trainer
and<00:02:14.830> Pokemon<00:02:15.830> which<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:16.640> really<00:02:16.910> seen<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.690> lot

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
and Pokemon which I really seen a lot

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.809 
and Pokemon which I really seen a lot
lately<00:02:18.380> at<00:02:18.620> all<00:02:18.830> in<00:02:18.980> Wi-Fi<00:02:19.310> battles<00:02:19.670> but

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
lately at all in Wi-Fi battles but

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.479 
lately at all in Wi-Fi battles but
whatever<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.840> works<00:02:21.020> works<00:02:21.380> but<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:22.280> looks

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
whatever it works works but it looks

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.340 
whatever it works works but it looks
like<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.670> 3<00:02:22.970> AKO<00:02:23.239> so<00:02:23.510> i<00:02:23.750> am<00:02:23.810> able<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.140> get<00:02:24.260> my

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
like a 3 AKO so i am able to get my

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.580 
like a 3 AKO so i am able to get my
rocks<00:02:24.500> up<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:24.940> then<00:02:25.940> use<00:02:26.410> earthquake<00:02:27.410> in

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
rocks up and then use earthquake in

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.280 
rocks up and then use earthquake in
earthquakes<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.880> AKO<00:02:29.209> so<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.569> is<00:02:29.690> good<00:02:30.230> for

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
earthquakes to AKO so that is good for

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.640 
earthquakes to AKO so that is good for
me<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:32.440> yeah<00:02:33.440> it's<00:02:33.739> basically<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.489> so<00:02:34.640> far<00:02:35.650> use

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
me and yeah it's basically it so far use

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.400 
me and yeah it's basically it so far use
his<00:02:36.800> frustration<00:02:37.340> again<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:37.989> live<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.230> then

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
his frustration again I live and then

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.380 
his frustration again I live and then
I'm<00:02:39.560> able<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:40.010> take<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.280> down<00:02:40.760> with<00:02:41.120> the

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
I'm able to take it down with the

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.290 
I'm able to take it down with the
earthquake<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.830> now<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.550> think<00:02:46.850> he's<00:02:46.970> gonna<00:02:47.090> go

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
earthquake and now I think he's gonna go

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.850 
earthquake and now I think he's gonna go
down<00:02:47.420> this<00:02:47.540> coach<00:02:47.750> John<00:02:47.989> Doe<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.350> then<00:02:48.560> I'll

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
down this coach John Doe and then I'll

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.290 
down this coach John Doe and then I'll
basically<00:02:49.370> distracting<00:02:49.850> me<00:02:50.000> out<00:02:50.060> with<00:02:50.209> the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
basically distracting me out with the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.120 
basically distracting me out with the
u-turn<00:02:50.660> or<00:02:50.900> high<00:02:51.080> jump<00:02:51.350> kick<00:02:51.410> or<00:02:51.680> whatever<00:02:51.920> he

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
u-turn or high jump kick or whatever he

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.160 
u-turn or high jump kick or whatever he
has<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.250> take<00:02:52.459> me<00:02:52.640> off<00:02:52.760> with<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.780> figured<00:02:54.080> of

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
has to take me off with so I figured of

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.890 
has to take me off with so I figured of
mind<00:02:54.320> of<00:02:54.470> just<00:02:55.370> use<00:02:55.670> my<00:02:55.850> swampert<00:02:56.239> water<00:02:56.540> later

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
mind of just use my swampert water later

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.630 
mind of just use my swampert water later
and<00:02:57.560> i'm<00:02:57.680> going<00:02:57.800> to<00:02:57.920> switch<00:02:58.010> out<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.430> go<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.610> my

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
and i'm going to switch out and go to my

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.040 
and i'm going to switch out and go to my
scar<00:02:59.000> me<00:02:59.150> because<00:02:59.300> they<00:02:59.420> can't<00:02:59.600> take<00:02:59.720> anything

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
scar me because they can't take anything

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.320 
scar me because they can't take anything
from<00:03:00.350> that<00:03:00.530> co<00:03:00.680> John<00:03:00.890> Doe<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.220> then<00:03:02.060> go<00:03:02.180> for

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
from that co John Doe and then go for

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.540 
from that co John Doe and then go for
the<00:03:02.390> u-turn<00:03:02.750> which<00:03:03.140> does<00:03:03.410> like<00:03:03.620> nothing<00:03:04.250> to

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
the u-turn which does like nothing to

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.080 
the u-turn which does like nothing to
skarmer<00:03:05.030> because<00:03:05.300> it<00:03:05.420> is<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:06.010> beast<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.430> I'm

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
skarmer because it is a beast and I'm

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.910 
skarmer because it is a beast and I'm
just<00:03:08.420> going<00:03:08.570> to<00:03:08.600> be<00:03:08.720> able<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:09.079> recover<00:03:09.590> that

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
just going to be able to recover that

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.009 
just going to be able to recover that
with<00:03:10.130> my<00:03:10.280> leftovers<00:03:10.820> but<00:03:11.150> he's<00:03:11.750> going<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:11.959> be

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
with my leftovers but he's going to be

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.750 
with my leftovers but he's going to be
able<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.440> get<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.650> switch<00:03:12.950> advantage<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.549> going

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
able to get a switch advantage and going

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.060 
able to get a switch advantage and going
as<00:03:13.880> Victini<00:03:14.450> which<00:03:15.290> isn't<00:03:15.590> too<00:03:15.680> good<00:03:15.799> for<00:03:15.980> me

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
as Victini which isn't too good for me

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.319 
as Victini which isn't too good for me
because<00:03:16.160> I<00:03:16.430> have<00:03:16.549> no<00:03:16.790> idea<00:03:16.880> what's<00:03:17.120> going<00:03:17.269> to

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
because I have no idea what's going to

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.360 
because I have no idea what's going to
do<00:03:17.420> well<00:03:17.660> as<00:03:18.470> either<00:03:18.769> going<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.040> go<00:03:19.160> for<00:03:19.340> the

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
do well as either going to go for the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.430 
do well as either going to go for the
fire<00:03:19.610> move<00:03:19.850> or<00:03:20.090> focus<00:03:20.450> blast<00:03:20.630> but<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:21.049> figured

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
fire move or focus blast but I figured

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.840 
fire move or focus blast but I figured
he<00:03:21.530> probably<00:03:21.769> might<00:03:22.010> go<00:03:22.190> for<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.459> firewood

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
he probably might go for the firewood

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.759 
he probably might go for the firewood
because<00:03:23.090> smoke<00:03:23.299> is<00:03:23.420> possible<00:03:23.810> probably<00:03:24.620> not

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
because smoke is possible probably not

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.670 
because smoke is possible probably not
kill<00:03:25.220> my<00:03:27.430> skarmory<00:03:28.810> so<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:30.110> should<00:03:30.290> publish<00:03:30.530> it

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
kill my skarmory so I should publish it

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.680 
kill my skarmory so I should publish it
and<00:03:30.769> maybe<00:03:30.920> gone<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.310> my<00:03:31.400> heatran<00:03:31.820> to<00:03:32.480> get<00:03:32.570> the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
and maybe gone to my heatran to get the

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.830 
and maybe gone to my heatran to get the

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
tails and garbage do now she'll break in

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.950 
tails and garbage do now she'll break in
and<00:04:12.460> based<00:04:12.610> on<00:04:12.730> past<00:04:12.940> but<00:04:13.150> I'm<00:04:13.390> not<00:04:13.690> gonna<00:04:13.840> let

Tom<00:04:34.090> passes<00:04:34.360> into<00:04:34.660> something<00:04:35.050> he<00:04:35.620> thought

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
Tom passes into something he thought

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.980 
Tom passes into something he thought
that<00:04:36.160> was<00:04:36.240> he<00:04:37.240> thought<00:04:37.390> i<00:04:37.450> would<00:04:37.630> use<00:04:37.750> hidden

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
that was he thought i would use hidden

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.390 
that was he thought i would use hidden
power<00:04:38.110> grass<00:04:38.470> so<00:04:38.650> he<00:04:38.740> goes<00:04:38.890> into<00:04:39.100> something

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
power grass so he goes into something

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.700 
power grass so he goes into something
that<00:04:39.520> could<00:04:39.640> resist<00:04:39.910> it<00:04:40.150> but<00:04:41.020> actually<00:04:41.200> go<00:04:41.500> for

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
that could resist it but actually go for

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.900 
that could resist it but actually go for
the<00:04:41.770> earth<00:04:41.950> part<00:04:42.220> which<00:04:42.370> is<00:04:42.400> bad<00:04:42.700> for<00:04:42.880> him

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
the earth part which is bad for him

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.720 
the earth part which is bad for him
because<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:44.170> jirachi<00:04:44.470> is<00:04:44.650> going<00:04:44.890> to<00:04:45.070> die<00:04:45.400> now

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
because the jirachi is going to die now

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.610 
because the jirachi is going to die now
so<00:04:46.600> it's<00:04:46.720> pretty<00:04:46.840> much<00:04:47.020> useless<00:04:47.230> to<00:04:47.530> you

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
so it's pretty much useless to you

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.520 
so it's pretty much useless to you
she'll<00:04:47.920> breaking<00:04:48.250> all<00:04:48.370> that<00:04:48.550> other<00:04:49.180> crap<00:04:49.530> and

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
she'll breaking all that other crap and

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.720 
she'll breaking all that other crap and
he<00:04:50.620> actually<00:04:50.710> has<00:04:50.920> the<00:04:50.950> white<00:04:51.190> herb<00:04:51.370> which<00:04:51.550> is

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
he actually has the white herb which is

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.060 
he actually has the white herb which is
pretty<00:04:52.330> cool<00:04:52.570> because<00:04:52.720> now<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.380> defense<00:04:53.890> and

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
pretty cool because now the defense and

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.030 
pretty cool because now the defense and
special<00:04:54.250> defense<00:04:54.640> drop<00:04:54.940> is<00:04:55.360> not<00:04:55.570> affected<00:04:56.040> so

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
special defense drop is not affected so

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.530 
special defense drop is not affected so
yeah<00:04:57.160> it's<00:04:57.340> pretty<00:04:57.520> good<00:04:57.730> combination<00:04:58.030> but

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
yeah it's pretty good combination but

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.930 
yeah it's pretty good combination but
the<00:04:59.050> I<00:04:59.680> take<00:05:00.100> it<00:05:00.220> down<00:05:00.310> with<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.550> earth<00:05:00.760> power

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
the I take it down with the earth power

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.940 
the I take it down with the earth power
so<00:05:01.240> now<00:05:01.900> he's<00:05:02.020> going<00:05:02.140> to<00:05:02.230> go<00:05:02.320> out<00:05:02.350> his<00:05:02.560> co<00:05:02.710> John

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
so now he's going to go out his co John

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.410 
so now he's going to go out his co John
Doe<00:05:03.100> and<00:05:03.250> basically<00:05:03.730> just<00:05:03.970> try<00:05:04.090> to<00:05:04.150> take<00:05:04.330> out

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
Doe and basically just try to take out

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.560 
Doe and basically just try to take out

Victini<00:05:31.030> I've<00:05:31.420> really<00:05:31.900> no<00:05:32.080> idea<00:05:32.350> what's<00:05:32.500> going

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
Victini I've really no idea what's going

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.710 
Victini I've really no idea what's going
to<00:05:32.740> do<00:05:32.830> i<00:05:33.010> was<00:05:33.190> actually<00:05:33.420> predicting<00:05:34.420> the

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
to do i was actually predicting the

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.350 
to do i was actually predicting the
focus<00:05:35.020> bus<00:05:35.200> but<00:05:35.470> I<00:05:35.650> was<00:05:35.770> like<00:05:36.030> wait<00:05:37.030> doesn't

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
focus bus but I was like wait doesn't

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.750 
focus bus but I was like wait doesn't
regenerate<00:05:37.780> of<00:05:38.170> physical<00:05:38.500> moves<00:05:38.680> so<00:05:38.890> might<00:05:39.610> be

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
regenerate of physical moves so might be

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.420 
regenerate of physical moves so might be
physical<00:05:40.270> Victini<00:05:41.230> so<00:05:41.560> he<00:05:41.980> actually<00:05:42.100> goes<00:05:42.280> for

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
physical Victini so he actually goes for

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.250 
physical Victini so he actually goes for
the<00:05:42.490> u-turn<00:05:42.790> I'll<00:05:43.270> my<00:05:43.480> tyranitar<00:05:44.050> which

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
the u-turn I'll my tyranitar which

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.190 
the u-turn I'll my tyranitar which
doesn't<00:05:45.130> kill<00:05:45.280> me<00:05:45.460> but<00:05:45.720> he<00:05:46.720> gets<00:05:46.930> to<00:05:47.020> switch

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
doesn't kill me but he gets to switch

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.010 
doesn't kill me but he gets to switch
onto<00:05:47.380> espanto<00:05:47.920> and<00:05:48.130> I<00:05:48.340> think<00:05:49.180> I<00:05:49.330> I'm<00:05:49.750> pretty

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
onto espanto and I think I I'm pretty

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.260 
onto espanto and I think I I'm pretty
strong<00:05:50.200> faster<00:05:50.770> because<00:05:51.000> hotels<00:05:52.000> don't<00:05:52.090> have

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
strong faster because hotels don't have

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.780 
strong faster because hotels don't have
that<00:05:52.600> much<00:05:53.350> speed<00:05:54.040> I<00:05:54.070> don't<00:05:54.370> really<00:05:54.490> know<00:05:54.670> the

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
that much speed I don't really know the

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.700 
that much speed I don't really know the
base<00:05:54.970> speed<00:05:55.510> of<00:05:55.660> this<00:05:55.750> thing<00:05:55.990> but<00:05:56.170> I'm<00:05:56.350> going

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
base speed of this thing but I'm going

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.810 
base speed of this thing but I'm going
to<00:05:56.800> be<00:05:56.920> able<00:05:57.010> to<00:05:57.160> take<00:05:57.280> you<00:05:57.400> down<00:05:57.550> with<00:05:57.580> the

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
to be able to take you down with the

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.350 
to be able to take you down with the
crunch<00:05:58.560> but<00:05:59.560> now<00:06:00.040> this<00:06:00.280> tyranitar<00:06:01.060> is<00:06:01.210> like

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
crunch but now this tyranitar is like

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.930 
crunch but now this tyranitar is like
basically<00:06:01.630> useless<00:06:02.500> to<00:06:02.800> me<00:06:02.830> because<00:06:03.100> of<00:06:03.490> the

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
basically useless to me because of the

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.730 
basically useless to me because of the
burn<00:06:05.040> so<00:06:06.040> I'm<00:06:06.190> just<00:06:06.580> going<00:06:06.730> to<00:06:06.820> let<00:06:06.970> it<00:06:07.680> die<00:06:08.680> the

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
burn so I'm just going to let it die the

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.490 
burn so I'm just going to let it die the
next<00:06:09.010> turn<00:06:09.370> wherever<00:06:09.580> it<00:06:09.730> goes<00:06:09.760> into

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
next turn wherever it goes into

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.750 
next turn wherever it goes into
yeah<00:06:11.500> he's<00:06:11.680> gonna<00:06:11.800> go<00:06:11.950> out<00:06:12.070> to<00:06:12.220> his<00:06:12.280> bikini

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
yeah he's gonna go out to his bikini

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.080 
yeah he's gonna go out to his bikini
which<00:06:12.970> is<00:06:13.120> I<00:06:13.270> think<00:06:13.300> he's<00:06:13.570> lost<00:06:13.690> pokemon<00:06:14.290> and

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
which is I think he's lost pokemon and

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.130 
which is I think he's lost pokemon and
he's<00:06:16.090> in<00:06:16.270> hope<00:06:16.420> for<00:06:16.570> the<00:06:16.660> u-turn<00:06:16.870> which<00:06:17.050> is

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
he's in hope for the u-turn which is

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.480 
he's in hope for the u-turn which is
going<00:06:17.230> to<00:06:17.290> take<00:06:17.350> me<00:06:17.560> out<00:06:17.620> but<00:06:17.860> I<00:06:18.040> have<00:06:18.280> my
