the<00:01:04.650> first<00:01:04.890> half<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.280> what<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.729> need<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.119> as

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the first half and what we need to do as

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.240 
the first half and what we need to do as
we<00:01:06.479> move<00:01:06.630> forward<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.140> look<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.350> combine<00:01:08.040> those

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
when we do that we've got a chance to be

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.130 
when we do that we've got a chance to be
a<00:01:11.610> very<00:01:12.119> very<00:01:12.270> good<00:01:12.479> football<00:01:12.840> team<00:01:13.020> and
