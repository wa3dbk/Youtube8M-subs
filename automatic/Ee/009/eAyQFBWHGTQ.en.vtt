447<00:05:12.530> 44<00:05:13.010> you<00:05:13.580> entered<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:14.000> telephone<00:05:14.419> man<00:05:14.660> hit

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
447 44 you entered the telephone man hit

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.650 
447 44 you entered the telephone man hit
down<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:16.340> you<00:05:16.490> have<00:05:16.640> to<00:05:16.760> do<00:05:16.880> it<00:05:16.970> extremely

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
down and you have to do it extremely

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.390 
down and you have to do it extremely
fast<00:05:17.990> and<00:05:18.140> what<00:05:18.260> happens<00:05:18.590> in<00:05:18.740> on<00:05:18.890> block<00:05:19.130> only

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
fast and what happens in on block only

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.629 
fast and what happens in on block only
the<00:05:19.700> overhand<00:05:20.030> will<00:05:20.150> come<00:05:20.300> out

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
the overhand will come out

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.969 
the overhand will come out
if<00:05:20.819> you<00:05:21.060> do<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.569> overhead<00:05:22.020> into<00:05:22.349> the<00:05:22.469> teleport

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
if you do the overhead into the teleport

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.550 
if you do the overhead into the teleport
and<00:05:23.129> hit<00:05:23.280> down<00:05:23.430> and<00:05:23.729> he<00:05:24.360> blocks<00:05:24.629> it<00:05:24.900> maybe<00:05:25.379> hits

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
and hit down and he blocks it maybe hits

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.050 
and hit down and he blocks it maybe hits
it<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:25.860> the<00:05:25.949> teleport<00:05:26.340> will<00:05:26.430> come<00:05:26.550> out<00:05:26.669> the

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
it and the teleport will come out the

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.149 
it and the teleport will come out the

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.899 
be about forty percent yeah so I mean he
has<00:06:00.479> safe<00:06:00.719> options<00:06:01.229> and<00:06:01.409> he's<00:06:01.529> I<00:06:01.830> do<00:06:02.550> agree

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909
