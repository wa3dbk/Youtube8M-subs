convex<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.489> model<00:00:59.789> which<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> big

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
convex on this model which is the big

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.459 
convex on this model which is the big
difference<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.809> there's<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.989> little<00:01:01.140> bit<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.410> a

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.330 
like there's like little holes and
that's<00:02:04.840> about<00:02:05.079> it<00:02:05.229> but<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:05.439> doesn't<00:02:05.560> doesn't

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
that's about it but it doesn't doesn't

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.160 
that's about it but it doesn't doesn't
actually<00:02:06.520> have<00:02:06.759> any<00:02:06.909> functionality<00:02:07.360> so<00:02:08.140> uh

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
actually have any functionality so uh

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.859

jump into the game it's a pre-alpha code

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.290 
jump into the game it's a pre-alpha code
showing<00:02:11.530> up<00:02:11.650> here<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.760> this<00:02:12.970> shouldn't<00:02:13.180> be

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
showing up here so this shouldn't be

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.110

mind-blowing<00:03:19.690> but<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:21.010> definitely<00:03:21.459> looks

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
mind-blowing but it definitely looks

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.400 
mind-blowing but it definitely looks
nicer<00:03:22.030> than<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.299> stuff<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.690> we've<00:03:22.810> seen<00:03:23.079> on

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
nicer than the stuff that we've seen on

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.470 
nicer than the stuff that we've seen on
the<00:03:23.590> current<00:03:23.889> gen<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.639> controller<00:03:25.000> again<00:03:25.180> is

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
the current gen the controller again is

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.569 
the current gen the controller again is
responsive<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.410> feels<00:03:26.950> like<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.190> should<00:03:27.400> feel

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
responsive it feels like it should feel

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.190 
responsive it feels like it should feel
right<00:03:27.850> on<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:28.000> console<00:03:28.600> doesn't<00:03:28.810> feel<00:03:29.049> like

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
right on a console doesn't feel like

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.229 
right on a console doesn't feel like
there's<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.470> lag<00:03:30.250> or<00:03:30.609> any<00:03:30.730> sort<00:03:30.940> of<00:03:30.970> an<00:03:31.090> issue

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
there's a lag or any sort of an issue

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.629 
there's a lag or any sort of an issue
between<00:03:31.630> when<00:03:32.380> you<00:03:32.470> push<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.680> button<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.340> and

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
between when you push a button and and

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:34.770 
between when you push a button and and
what<00:03:33.819> actually<00:03:34.120> happens<00:03:34.420> on<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.630> screen

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
what actually happens on the screen

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.470 
what actually happens on the screen
there's<00:03:35.109> a<00:03:35.170> imperceptible<00:03:36.160> lag<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:37.450> I

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
there's a imperceptible lag and I

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.789 
there's a imperceptible lag and I
believe<00:03:37.720> that<00:03:37.900> would<00:03:38.019> be<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.260> case<00:03:38.410> as<00:03:38.620> well

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
believe that would be the case as well

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.160 
believe that would be the case as well
when<00:03:39.040> you<00:03:39.160> have<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.459> when<00:03:40.359> you<00:03:40.389> have<00:03:40.569> it<00:03:40.690> not

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
when you have it when you have it not

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.509 
when you have it when you have it not
plugged<00:03:41.500> in<00:03:41.680> right<00:03:41.889> that's<00:03:42.100> not<00:03:42.250> making<00:03:42.489> a

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
plugged in right that's not making a

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:43.349 
plugged in right that's not making a
huge<00:03:42.670> difference<00:03:42.760> other<00:03:43.120> than<00:03:43.209> actually

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
huge difference other than actually

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.629 
huge difference other than actually
giving<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.989> charge<00:03:44.380> there's<00:03:45.340> actually<00:03:45.609> a

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
giving it a charge there's actually a

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.280 
giving it a charge there's actually a
racing<00:03:46.150> line<00:03:46.329> you<00:03:46.480> can<00:03:46.630> see<00:03:46.750> showing<00:03:46.959> up<00:03:47.170> in

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
racing line you can see showing up in

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.930 
racing line you can see showing up in
the<00:03:47.350> game<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.709> try<00:03:47.829> to<00:03:47.920> make<00:03:48.250> us<00:03:48.370> better<00:03:48.519> as<00:03:48.790> we

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
the game to try to make us better as we

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.240 
the game to try to make us better as we
repeatedly<00:03:49.480> crash<00:03:49.780> into<00:03:50.200> walls<00:03:50.319> and<00:03:50.829> there's

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
repeatedly crash into walls and there's

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.099 
repeatedly crash into walls and there's
my<00:03:51.370> silly<00:03:51.639> face<00:03:51.910> popping<00:03:52.299> up<00:03:52.420> that<00:03:52.569> the<00:03:52.660> ps4<00:03:53.079> I

my silly face popping up that the ps4 I

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.539 
my silly face popping up that the ps4 I
actually<00:03:53.530> took<00:03:53.769> a<00:03:53.859> picture<00:03:54.040> of<00:03:54.160> us<00:03:54.280> when<00:03:54.459> we

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
actually took a picture of us when we

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.940 
actually took a picture of us when we
started<00:03:54.760> playing<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.090> game<00:03:55.239> so<00:03:56.170> again<00:03:56.590> you'll

for now know that the controller does

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.500 
for now know that the controller does
feel<00:04:08.079> good<00:04:08.349> it<00:04:08.500> feels<00:04:08.980> like<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.340> an<00:04:09.940> evolution

that kind of good stuff

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.210 
that kind of good stuff
but<00:06:33.810> I<00:06:33.840> don't<00:06:34.560> think<00:06:34.650> we're<00:06:34.830> gonna<00:06:34.890> see<00:06:35.100> the

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
but I don't think we're gonna see the

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.500 
but I don't think we're gonna see the
kind<00:06:35.370> of<00:06:35.430> ubiquity<00:06:35.850> that<00:06:36.030> we're<00:06:36.120> gonna<00:06:36.210> see<00:06:36.390> on

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
kind of ubiquity that we're gonna see on

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.970 
kind of ubiquity that we're gonna see on
the<00:06:36.600> Xbox<00:06:36.900> one<00:06:37.110> just<00:06:37.380> because<00:06:37.500> it<00:06:37.740> isn't

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980 
the Xbox one just because it isn't

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.830 
the Xbox one just because it isn't
included<00:06:38.310> with<00:06:38.820> the<00:06:38.880> console<00:06:39.180> but<00:06:39.570> that's<00:06:39.750> a

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
included with the console but that's a

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.360 
included with the console but that's a
maybe<00:06:40.200> a<00:06:40.320> good<00:06:40.530> thing<00:06:40.710> because<00:06:40.890> the<00:06:41.070> console

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
maybe a good thing because the console

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.670 
maybe a good thing because the console
cost<00:06:41.580> $400<00:06:42.270> $100<00:06:42.840> less<00:06:43.020> than<00:06:43.140> the<00:06:43.200> Xbox<00:06:43.500> one

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
cost $400 $100 less than the Xbox one

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.010 
cost $400 $100 less than the Xbox one
and<00:06:43.860> it's<00:06:44.370> a<00:06:44.460> it's<00:06:44.700> a<00:06:44.790> very<00:06:44.970> pretty<00:06:45.270> thing<00:06:45.600> so
