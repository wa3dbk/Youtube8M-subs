over<00:00:02.170> the<00:00:02.260> next<00:00:02.440> few<00:00:02.650> minutes<00:00:02.860> I'm<00:00:03.190> going<00:00:03.310> to

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:03.370 
over the next few minutes I'm going to

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.370 
over the next few minutes I'm going to
take<00:00:03.580> you<00:00:03.699> on<00:00:03.850> a<00:00:03.879> step-by-step<00:00:04.420> process<00:00:04.960> of

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:05.380 
take you on a step-by-step process of

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.079 
take you on a step-by-step process of
how<00:00:05.529> to<00:00:05.560> set<00:00:05.890> the<00:00:06.009> eclipses<00:00:06.250> measuring<00:00:06.670> system

00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:07.089 
how to set the eclipses measuring system

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:08.940 
how to set the eclipses measuring system
up<00:00:07.240> and<00:00:07.480> how<00:00:07.960> it<00:00:07.990> can<00:00:08.290> be<00:00:08.379> used<00:00:08.620> to<00:00:08.740> your

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:08.950 
up and how it can be used to your

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:09.600 
up and how it can be used to your
advantage

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
advantage

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.000 
advantage
the<00:00:10.600> very<00:00:10.809> first<00:00:11.080> step<00:00:11.199> is<00:00:11.530> to<00:00:11.650> create<00:00:11.830> a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.010 
the very first step is to create a

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.799 
the very first step is to create a
repair<00:00:12.400> order<00:00:12.699> so<00:00:13.029> the<00:00:13.150> first<00:00:13.360> thing<00:00:13.539> we<00:00:13.660> need

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
repair order so the first thing we need

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.750 
repair order so the first thing we need
to<00:00:13.840> do<00:00:13.990> is<00:00:14.170> to<00:00:14.289> turn<00:00:14.500> the<00:00:14.650> machine<00:00:14.980> on<00:00:15.010> and<00:00:15.309> boot

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
to do is to turn the machine on and boot

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:25.260 
to do is to turn the machine on and boot
the<00:00:15.879> software<00:00:16.330> up<00:00:23.400> from<00:00:24.400> the<00:00:24.550> repair<00:00:24.940> order

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270

the repair order has been filled out we

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.350 
the repair order has been filled out we
can<00:00:41.590> move<00:00:41.680> on<00:00:41.860> to<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.010> hardware<00:00:42.399> section<00:00:42.670> that

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
can move on to the hardware section that

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.880 
can move on to the hardware section that
is<00:00:43.510> putting<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:43.930> scanner<00:00:44.200> underneath<00:00:44.739> the

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
is putting the scanner underneath the

is putting the scanner underneath the
vehicle<00:00:45.040> and<00:00:45.399> to<00:00:45.760> begin<00:00:45.910> assigning<00:00:46.750> targets

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
vehicle and to begin assigning targets

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.110 
vehicle and to begin assigning targets
today<00:00:47.980> I'm<00:00:48.309> going<00:00:48.399> to<00:00:48.460> place<00:00:48.640> it<00:00:48.820> in<00:00:48.880> the<00:00:48.940> very

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
today I'm going to place it in the very

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.940 
today I'm going to place it in the very
center<00:00:49.540> of<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.750> vehicle<00:00:50.200> but<00:00:50.500> you<00:00:50.620> can't

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
center of the vehicle but you can't

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.620 
center of the vehicle but you can't
actually<00:00:51.160> put<00:00:51.460> it<00:00:51.579> anywhere<00:00:51.880> work<00:00:52.239> and<00:00:52.480> still

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
actually put it anywhere work and still

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.590 
actually put it anywhere work and still

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
to the setup page here we will assign

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.649 
to the setup page here we will assign
the<00:01:08.979> targets<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.459> the<00:01:09.490> specification<00:01:10.329> points

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
the targets to the specification points

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.739 
the targets to the specification points
and<00:01:10.780> then<00:01:11.289> hang<00:01:11.679> the<00:01:11.889> targets<00:01:12.280> themselves

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:12.749 
and then hang the targets themselves

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:14.699 
and then hang the targets themselves
typically<00:01:13.749> you<00:01:13.840> want<00:01:13.959> to<00:01:14.109> start<00:01:14.380> with<00:01:14.590> the

repair strategy first let's magnify the
arrow<00:05:47.750> so<00:05:48.050> that<00:05:48.080> we<00:05:48.259> can<00:05:48.380> see<00:05:48.530> them<00:05:48.650> clearly

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
arrow so that we can see them clearly

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.999 
arrow so that we can see them clearly
we'll<00:05:50.360> select<00:05:50.659> an<00:05:50.990> arrow<00:05:51.289> scale<00:05:51.680> of<00:05:51.949> 50

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:54.009 
we'll select an arrow scale of 50

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:56.649 
we'll select an arrow scale of 50
remember<00:05:55.009> the<00:05:55.190> vectors<00:05:55.550> show<00:05:55.820> the<00:05:56.030> direction

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:56.659 
remember the vectors show the direction

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.499 
remember the vectors show the direction
of<00:05:56.780> the<00:05:56.900> damage<00:05:57.610> you<00:05:58.610> want<00:05:58.759> to<00:05:58.940> pull<00:05:59.210> in<00:05:59.419> a

00:05:59.499 --> 00:05:59.509 
of the damage you want to pull in a

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:01.450 
of the damage you want to pull in a
direction<00:06:00.020> opposite<00:06:00.620> of<00:06:00.800> the<00:06:00.919> vectors<00:06:01.280> to

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
direction opposite of the vectors to

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.450 
direction opposite of the vectors to
straighten<00:06:01.880> the<00:06:02.000> damage<00:06:02.770> to<00:06:03.770> see<00:06:03.979> the<00:06:04.130> vectors

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
straighten the damage to see the vectors

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.610 
straighten the damage to see the vectors
better<00:06:04.759> we<00:06:05.030> can<00:06:05.180> click<00:06:05.449> and<00:06:05.659> drag<00:06:05.690> to<00:06:05.960> rotate

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
better we can click and drag to rotate

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.300 
better we can click and drag to rotate
