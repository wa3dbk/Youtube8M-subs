00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240

then<00:01:42.210> they'd<00:01:42.329> had<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> better<00:01:43.079> chance<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.409> run<00:01:43.530> a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
then they'd had a better chance to run a

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.960 
then they'd had a better chance to run a
place<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.100> was<00:01:44.310> even<00:01:44.520> more<00:01:44.909> impressed
