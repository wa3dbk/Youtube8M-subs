00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
it's sort of a change of pace kind of

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.280 
it's sort of a change of pace kind of
thing<00:01:12.549> you<00:01:12.940> know<00:01:12.970> everyone<00:01:13.810> nowadays

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
thing you know everyone nowadays

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.290 
thing you know everyone nowadays
obviously<00:01:15.100> um<00:01:15.340> you<00:01:15.610> know<00:01:15.700> for<00:01:15.940> a<00:01:15.970> good<00:01:16.120> reason

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
obviously um you know for a good reason

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.200 
obviously um you know for a good reason
are<00:01:16.660> only<00:01:16.900> uploading<00:01:17.650> black<00:01:18.160> ops<00:01:18.430> 2<00:01:18.700> not

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
are only uploading black ops 2 not

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.790

because it's the new thing and that's

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.590 
because it's the new thing and that's
probably<00:01:20.980> why<00:01:21.400> everyone<00:01:21.910> wants<00:01:22.060> to<00:01:22.270> see<00:01:22.510> it

the most underutilized gun ever um I
don't<00:01:45.190> understand<00:01:45.730> why<00:01:45.850> it's<00:01:46.060> a<00:01:46.150> pretty

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
don't understand why it's a pretty

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.540 
don't understand why it's a pretty
decent<00:01:47.080> gun<00:01:47.260> I<00:01:47.440> mean<00:01:47.680> I<00:01:47.800> understand<00:01:48.310> it

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
decent gun I mean I understand it

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.900 
decent gun I mean I understand it
doesn't<00:01:49.120> compare<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:50.110> p90<00:01:50.830> clip<00:01:51.220> or<00:01:51.640> it

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
doesn't compare to the p90 clip or it

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.510 
doesn't compare to the p90 clip or it
doesn't<00:01:52.090> compare<00:01:52.510> to<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.780> ump45<00:01:53.500> power<00:01:54.100> um

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
doesn't compare to the ump45 power um

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.180 
doesn't compare to the ump45 power um
but<00:01:55.270> you<00:01:55.660> know<00:01:55.690> it's<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.110> it's<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.440> pretty<00:01:56.680> legit
