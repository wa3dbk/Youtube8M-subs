 for you here the installation of a 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:17.179
 clear cell carrier repeater 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:28.099
 the energy with solar panel in the river of 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.099
 January 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:48.610
 the gain is clear and to each other was 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:55.630
 installed a frame 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:57.790
 to feed solar bananas into energy 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.610
 solar 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.170
 here we have the charge controller 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.470
 here we have a source of revolts 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.570
 as protection a stabilizer that has 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.600
 that has energy and it stays in 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:15.850
 stand by by 24 volt outlet 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.850
 supplementary source in the event of a 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:38.290
 of energy and stay 12 days without sound 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:40.780
 regulating input to the repeater 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:51.820
 power output that sends you 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:55.680
 doing here we have 150 amps in 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.680
 The top we have alive 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:10.590
 the tower place here is low and the woman 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:14.849
 very bad signal between hills here 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:18.660
 between stones as you can see very 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.840
 very bad really bad is totally 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.840
 closed 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.670
 the powers here to be able to improve 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.080
 little sign 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:35.090
 Follow here the cable that is the points 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.090
 which leads the cable to the antenna 1 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.560
 the subject 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.900
 I can not say yes 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.870
 here is the antenna 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:22.319
 here below the property of the person 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.319
 a bad house, huh? 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.939
 in a country house that has no signal 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.939
 some 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.360
 ian i have here is an antenna from 859 1950 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.970
 so she gets so much alive against the 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.970
 Of course you work with 909 850 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.189
 the owner here under a 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.189
 tennis court 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:14.590
 will also be installed in the future with 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.590
 behind the scenes an antenna for this block 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:28.600
 a farm that is located on January 15 and 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:33.870
 we have just finished installing the 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.870
 panels and 120 watts each 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.640
 especially the first one that he 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.640
 purchased 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.310
 how it works very well 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:56.050
 Ourselves and need some help
