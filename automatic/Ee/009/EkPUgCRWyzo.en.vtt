it's a multi-stage map where attackers

it's a multi-stage map where attackers
and<00:01:06.060> defenders<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> series<00:01:07.080> of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
that famous London landmark as you can

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.640 
that famous London landmark as you can
see<00:01:12.420> from<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> footage<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:13.110> still<00:01:13.350> an<00:01:13.500> early

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
see from the footage it's still an early

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.380 
see from the footage it's still an early
blocking<00:01:14.250> stage<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:14.729> very<00:01:14.939> few<00:01:15.119> textures

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
blocking stage with very few textures

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.630 
blocking stage with very few textures
applied<00:01:15.650> so<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.740> has<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> slightly<00:01:17.189> detached

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
applied so it has a slightly detached

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.300 
applied so it has a slightly detached
feeling<00:01:17.939> compared<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.630> existing<00:01:19.020> maps<00:01:19.310> but

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
feeling compared to existing maps but

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.800 
feeling compared to existing maps but
you<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.549> tell<00:01:20.729> there's<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.030> heavy<00:01:21.270> influence

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
you can tell there's a heavy influence

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.320 
you can tell there's a heavy influence
of<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:21.960> parkour<00:01:22.500> system<00:01:22.650> at<00:01:22.890> work<00:01:23.040> here

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
of that parkour system at work here

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.219 
of that parkour system at work here
players<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.479> access<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.020> much<00:01:25.200> more

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
players have access to much more

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.469 
players have access to much more
vertical<00:01:25.890> areas<00:01:26.189> than<00:01:26.369> map<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:27.240> such<00:01:27.450> you

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
vertical areas than map and as such you

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.899 
vertical areas than map and as such you
find<00:01:27.900> yourself<00:01:28.259> having<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.829> aware<00:01:29.130> much

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
find yourself having to be aware much

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.730 
find yourself having to be aware much
more<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> environment<00:01:30.810> around<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.320> we

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
more of the environment around you we

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.380 
more of the environment around you we
don't<00:01:31.860> want<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.220> get<00:01:32.369> ambushed<00:01:32.909> from<00:01:33.090> above

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
don't want to get ambushed from above

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.380 
don't want to get ambushed from above
it's<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.320> larger<00:01:34.650> map<00:01:34.799> than<00:01:34.950> were<00:01:35.070> used<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.390> we

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
it's a larger map than were used to we

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.300 
it's a larger map than were used to we
not<00:01:36.509> only<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> vast<00:01:37.200> topside<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.159> there

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
not only have a vast topside but there

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.649 
not only have a vast topside but there
are<00:01:38.369> also<00:01:38.460> connecting<00:01:39.000> tunnels<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.600> allow

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
are also connecting tunnels that allow

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.810 
are also connecting tunnels that allow
attackers<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.470> defenders<00:01:40.530> two<00:01:41.400> flanking

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
attackers and defenders two flanking

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.149 
attackers and defenders two flanking
routes<00:01:42.030> around<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.420> map<00:01:42.710> if<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.829> had<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.070> be

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
routes around the map if I had to be

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.950 
routes around the map if I had to be
critical<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.390> Internet<00:01:45.780> so

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
critical and this is the Internet so

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.929 
critical and this is the Internet so
obviously<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.380> do<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.189> critical<00:01:47.579> and

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
obviously I do have to be critical and

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.460 
obviously I do have to be critical and
say<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.750> certainly<00:01:49.049> feels<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
say that it certainly feels like a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.109 
say that it certainly feels like a
different<00:01:49.710> style<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.310> map<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> ones<00:01:50.939> that

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
different style of map to the ones that

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.359 
different style of map to the ones that
we've<00:01:51.240> been<00:01:51.270> playing<00:01:51.600> recently<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:52.290> know<00:01:53.189> that

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
we've been playing recently I know that

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.100 
we've been playing recently I know that
it<00:01:53.460> doesn't<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:53.759> textures<00:01:54.390> currently<00:01:54.810> but

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
it doesn't have textures currently but

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.310 
it doesn't have textures currently but
somehow<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.829> feels<00:01:55.979> less<00:01:56.250> relatable<00:01:56.820> as<00:01:56.939> well

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
somehow it feels less relatable as well

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.840 
somehow it feels less relatable as well
we<00:01:58.320> don't<00:01:58.469> feel<00:01:58.680> like<00:01:58.829> streets<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.640> more

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
we don't feel like streets it's more

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.209 
we don't feel like streets it's more
