00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.930
 walked out 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.860
 survived the fluid did not even show 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.750
 the instrument should be no such personal 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.290
 supports 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.290
 but you 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.010
 as 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.650
 given inheritance 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.860
 better not be stopped throws services 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.860
 Paris 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.840
 will be 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.440
 where they and place in the middle of the road and 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:26.549
 stopping now he stopped 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:34.290
 continue skoda parish destroy he 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:37.370
 does not recognize the same if there is a possibility 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.370
 in 30 years 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.499
 here 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.980
 here is the protocol man he sits 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.490
 and logical violated despite the fact that 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.740
 on the mountain 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.880
 nine two zeros to when it creates 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.530
 This question interests me already 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.450
 several years and books and going away 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.530
 why if the driver broke they 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.540
 make up from the fire interested in the question 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.610
 why when drivers break i 'm coming 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.230
 I recently witnessed to check 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.950
 broke on it don't make a protocol and 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.079
 including me 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.970
 I broke and told the inspector that I 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.480
 violated and asked to create a protocol they 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.470
 I refused in every way for what you do not 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.470
 I know 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.040
 save 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.040
 we started walking without protocol well 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:05:05.270
 so you didn't make up the driver but on 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:12.520
 you were not the protocol you are simply not 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:16.540
 took to and by the way why 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:20.210
 show a unique case of this device 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:22.190
 called a battery for the device weasel 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.840
 here she is who does not know the battery river 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.390
 called finger grant from the barrels 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.970
 portable battery portable such 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.420
 battery helps to cook 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:38.150
 work this device 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:40.360
 that's literally oh how about now i will 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.360
 work 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.830
 recharge and how much and how much consumption 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.610
 gasoline your recharging per hour so 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.319
 donate this battery need see 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.270
 in this case, I will show you was brought 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.340
 they you told about commented something 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.770
 what if we don't let start 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.360
 periodically visit means gasoline 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:06.069
 use directly 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:09.330
 directly led therefore 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:12.539
 how much gasoline per hour bizim consumes 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.539
 based 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.230
 he 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.930
 do not get tired it works on gasoline 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.430
 Zazi it depends on the fuel if 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.870
 fuel conchita in this car already what 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:35.870
 already stop working over time 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:38.210
 now attention question how much is given 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.710
 buz facial generator per hour what am i 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.870
 vladimir and not those could answer 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:46.990
 about an hour this car is 0 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.990
 two and a half liters three liters of gasoline 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:54.529
 spend at least an hour a day worked 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.110
 15 minutes three or four times to bring 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:59.569
 attention question how much consumes and 7 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:04.059
 gasoline per hour all 33 liters that means 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:04.059
 about 40 minutes 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:13.270
 razher ii with numbers nine from 30 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.259
 by fishing 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.970
 sent decorator yes about the other not 

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:18.160
 have seen 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:21.160
 looks like 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.370
 we have not seen jump like that enough 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.710
 fast its composition 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:30.270
 fast enough him or when he's already 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.270
 drove up you already filled out . 

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:38.749
 looking at which 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:41.479
 by number there actually was to draw up 

00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:46.810
 protocol for exceeding everything is yes 

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:46.810
 Of course we will make art all the best in
