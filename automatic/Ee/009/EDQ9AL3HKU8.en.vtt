00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.880 
these archer towers cover all of the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
area around the base another thing I

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.410 
area around the base another thing I
like<00:00:47.039> about<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.309> base<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:48.090> my<00:00:48.210> town

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
like about this base is that my town

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.060 
like about this base is that my town
hall<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.809> more<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.260> right<00:00:49.500> side<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.950> it's

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
hall is more on the right side so it's

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.619 
hall is more on the right side so it's
like<00:00:50.190> an<00:00:50.309> Eastern<00:00:50.670> teaser<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.300> most<00:00:51.480> people

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
like an Eastern teaser and most people

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.750 
like an Eastern teaser and most people
actually<00:00:51.870> attack<00:00:52.260> from<00:00:52.469> there<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.370> my<00:00:53.550> town

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
actually attack from there so my town

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.580 
actually attack from there so my town
hall<00:00:53.940> absorbs<00:00:54.420> all<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.780> damage<00:00:54.989> while<00:00:55.350> all

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
hall absorbs all that damage while all

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.920

any kind of lava attack early and then

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.800 
any kind of lava attack early and then
it<00:01:17.100> kind<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.400> screws<00:01:17.640> up<00:01:17.820> their<00:01:17.939> raid<00:01:18.180> alright

that's<00:01:18.930> enough<00:01:19.049> talking<00:01:19.380> let's<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
that's enough talking let's get to the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.190 
that's enough talking let's get to the
defense<00:01:20.400> replay<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.540> have<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> number<00:01:21.930> one

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
defense replay so we have the number one

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.499 
defense replay so we have the number one
guy<00:01:22.350> from<00:01:22.710> nine<00:01:23.040> west<00:01:23.369> attacking<00:01:23.909> me<00:01:24.060> his<00:01:24.330> name

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
guy from nine west attacking me his name

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.280 
guy from nine west attacking me his name
is<00:01:24.659> fr3<00:01:25.500> Durst<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.820> think<00:01:27.119> Durst<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.840> German

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
is fr3 Durst and I think Durst is German

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.010 
is fr3 Durst and I think Durst is German
for<00:01:28.320> thirst<00:01:29.009> or<00:01:29.280> thirsty<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.570> maybe<00:01:30.720> he's<00:01:30.900> just

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
for thirst or thirsty so maybe he's just

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.380 
for thirst or thirsty so maybe he's just
a<00:01:31.200> thirsty<00:01:31.590> mother<00:01:31.799> or<00:01:31.979> something<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.030> he's

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
a thirsty mother or something so he's

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.480 
a thirsty mother or something so he's
gonna<00:01:33.540> take<00:01:33.750> my<00:01:33.900> base<00:01:34.079> from<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.350> top<00:01:34.740> right

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
gonna take my base from the top right

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.850 
gonna take my base from the top right
side<00:01:36.030> where<00:01:36.750> normally<00:01:37.110> people<00:01:37.380> attack<00:01:37.650> from

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
side where normally people attack from

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.310 
side where normally people attack from
and<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.700> said<00:01:38.759> before<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.479> clan<00:01:39.780> castle<00:01:40.020> is

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
and as I said before this clan castle is

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.060 
and as I said before this clan castle is
so<00:01:40.740> hard<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.610> pull<00:01:42.000> CC<00:01:42.810> troops<00:01:43.020> from<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.979> he

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
so hard to pull CC troops from so he

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.889 
so hard to pull CC troops from so he

for<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.020> guys<00:01:55.549> but<00:01:56.549> as<00:01:56.670> he's<00:01:57.000> breaking

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
for you guys but as he's breaking

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.209 
for you guys but as he's breaking
through<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.630> base<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.229> realized<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.040> he

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
through this base I realized that he

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.920 
through this base I realized that he
doesn't<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.579> single<00:01:59.939> wall<00:02:00.390> breaker<00:02:00.689> which

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
doesn't have a single wall breaker which

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.510 
doesn't have a single wall breaker which
i<00:02:01.020> think<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.259> pretty<00:02:01.469> interesting<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.430> he

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
i think is pretty interesting but he

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.370 
i think is pretty interesting but he
does<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> jump<00:02:03.119> ball<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.840> once<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.229> get

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
does have a jump ball so once you get

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.649
