00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.759
 cool cats and today 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.030
 or literally shorter recently I 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.370
 stumbled upon some very clever too 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.280
 young people in the comments under my 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.139
 video type how to build a powerful comp for 10 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.740
 mowers, in principle, I described everything very 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.369
 right 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.650
 the truth there is a little embellished what 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.960
 was but still they said at home and 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.150
 grandmother to the cottage computer horse what 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.029
 He doesnâ€™t have any games for maximals 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.009
 pull will not that shit at all well in 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.200
 In principle, this could be said by 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.989
 then the video card I said that 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.700
 buy a new video card and in principle it 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.680
 happened i wanted to even gash on her 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.170
 review but somehow did not grow together 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.500
 it turned out that the camera was discharged 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.590
 stoppard and new did not fit the world 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.449
 in short everything did nâ€™t happen 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.129
 and there will be no review on the video card 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.239
 will be of type second extra 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:01.070
 review on what's inside my computer 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.329
 shorter guys all there was shorter 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.040
 can just see in the past 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.830
 Review link will be in the description under the video 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.320
 and now in the annotation you can click and 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.510
 see what I was talking about in short 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.030
 the main thing is our video card and here it is 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.150
 this here looks so arranged 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.400
 I will not pull out well because a little 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.400
 Is it damaged but I'm just shorter 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.240
 lazy hockey figured it out but u 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.850
 me 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.920
 I got photos on the Internet this video 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.200
 cards and it looks like this 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.619
 such is the 2 giga video card itself 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.680
 In principle, all games at max speeds 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.720
 the more I have not full hd monitor so 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.420
 that will even battlefield 4 on 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.610
 maximum settings and noticeably of this 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.310
 nothing i'm pixels here even 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.040
 across the forehead and can't see 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.860
 so we go the monitor is quite a not 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.240
 need shorter and said that the processor 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.880
 also some not so hot 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.969
 well here i am 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.920
 I will show you this processor xtm 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:06.320
 4300 core processor if you donâ€™t 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.539
 You can read here of course 3 8 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.489
 gigahertz on 4 cores is enough 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.540
 powerful guys sometimes talk to me here 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.280
 account and he during the game my skyrim even 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.680
 on 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.180
 it seems like there is a percentage in 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.849
 principle, you can see but I already 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.410
 too lazy well well even 50 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.580
 percent there was not taken this 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.120
 processors like i played rather them so 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.849
 What's the point 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:36.190
 more powerful processor to buy if only on 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:39.650
 battlefield 4 4 4 but i don't have them and i 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.519
 we play the most high-graded plays 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:47.180
 and I have a shorter goal and 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.640
 skyrim skyrim is just beautiful before god 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.819
 I need a big increase in fps 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.920
 show tests with 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.519
 fps and here it will be shorter from above 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.360
 bathe 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:02.209
 and you can see how much it will be 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.350
 in ps on my ultra settings with koimi 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:12.440
 and also ps head no well wait short 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:15.170
 Now it will be the best test test 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.040
 skyrime ultra graphics settings now 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.040
 look at fps 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.880
 Of course it would be better if I did as 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.160
 it did it all differently but still 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.730
 even though at least this way and not having time ps 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.190
 it seems to be here and no longer 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.220
 compare 5 fps let's see here 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.210
 find the thing you know enough 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:47.170
 beautiful water 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:51.220
 all 75 fps guys more and less not 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:54.180
 It turns out so the game is locked in principle 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:59.440
 even without overclocking the 75 question is very 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:03.700
 ok there but boils from the plant 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:07.030
 everyone has some water for him 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:12.070
 hint and 75 performed so far shorter 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:14.370
 skyrim this time it was a cross 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.750
 video cards in counter-strike global 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.220
 offencive shorter here with us 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.080
 counter-strike maximum settings 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.840
 graphics grafonchik grafonchik 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:27.310
 all such reflection kity nyashki all 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:31.630
 ok how much we have in our belt 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:36.760
 better setup 170-180 fps seemingly 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:40.560
 okay karacheva this is the video that 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.560
 tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu
