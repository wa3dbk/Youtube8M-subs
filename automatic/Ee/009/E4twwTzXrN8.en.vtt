00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.850
 ah 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.000
 now 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.880
 hello very good my name is carob 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.150
 linens and well this is the first video 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.580
 that I'm going to upload to my YouTube channel 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:27.170
 with about the vehicle is the first one going to 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.620
 be logically about a boxing that a 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.130
 boxing is good unpacking 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.650
 and I'm going to show what it has in the box 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.410
 of school is worth in the future I would like 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.060
 upload a couple of more videos if I see that 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.430
 there is quite acceptance as they will be 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.620
 videos will be enough videos about 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.410
 multiplayer that you can do with others 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.270
 friends 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.270
 but as I say now I want to show you 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.870
 what this package also brings 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.920
 important and the retreats that I 've 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.900
 bought from a German distributor and for 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.390
 So I've had another offer that has 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.100
 come with other devices all that 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.910
 come here you can buy it also in 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.380
 Spain or in any other country is worth 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.860
 It happens that as I say here I came with a 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.909
 offer and I have chosen therefore to take 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.640
 the mat that you can see 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.859
 the pulsometer absolutely everything is worth 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.950
 then I'm going to show you this the first 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:27.069
 package with the mat is the one that 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.409
 puts under the roller bicycle 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:33.560
 because it is for the theme of society 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.030
 and the sweat so that it does not fall to the ground 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.430
 Well, we made a small 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.350
 transition so as not to disturb them with 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.549
 noise of the cartons and the truth is that 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.399
 I am a bit aggressive when it comes to 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.140
 take things out of the package and once 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.390
 that we have it all together 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.299
 I show you quickly that it contains and 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.280
 we will make another francis transition for 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.250
 attract the bicycle so you can see how 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.570
 mounts that is very easy still mounted 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.210
 but I guess it will be very easy for that 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.189
 is what I have been told and good 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.310
 so to make a first video of 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.409
 information of a boxing and how how 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.319
 ride the bike then good as 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.610
 showed in the beginning that we have the 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.459
 mat that we put under the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.660
 bicycle and roller is precisely 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.970
 so that the ground does not fall 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.370
 dirt and coats of sweat 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.150
 the roller logically then here comes 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.930
 a small package that is with him 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.720
 the stick with the fish and good the adapter 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.569
 of current this here black is for 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.650
 put the front wheel then we have 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.650
 The Spanish 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:44.330
 basically it's to tighten the wheel 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.010
 back with the roller and the manual 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.870
 instructions in German so we do not 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.600
 serves what happens that I'm not going to 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.050
 comment me all of you then you're 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.650
 are the little things here is 11 the biggest 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.950
 decadence also important and the band 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.070
 of heart rate monitor as I say you can 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.290
 buy packages that contain all this 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.569
 or you can buy packages where you are not 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.890
 the heart rate monitor or wake 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.230
 to the mat 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.510
 I think that others do not need 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.730
 I'm sure if also in some 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.950
 Spanish distributor the means of 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.810
 cadence will sell us that what 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.110
 I do not know how I say this is a package 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.959
 that everything was included from a 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.240
 German distributor from where as 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.580
 I say where where I'm living and 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.200
 it left at a price that is quite 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.209
 alright then well I'm going to make a 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.370
 small a small break here a 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.260
 small transition can bring the 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.410
 bicycle and I show you how it's going to 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.060
 ride vale come up now good and 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.670
 once we have the mat already placed 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.380
 and also the roller since the roller 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.940
 it comes to us already 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.710
 comes to us already assembled we do not have to 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.140
 mount nothing else then we have to remove 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.790
 the quick closing of the bicycle of the 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.930
 rear wheel logically and put the one 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.210
 comes to us in the vehicle to not 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.950
 spoil spoiling what we have if 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.650
 we want we can also keep the one 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.480
 we have what happens that the closure that 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.060
 has the vehicle because maybe what 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.890
 stripe or lose color then good is 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.100
 very easy to put it on and remove it I think 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.950
 we all know when we have it 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.800
 we take the bicycle the roller and what 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.890
 first of all I recommend you 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:27.740
 place the thread that has the thread that 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.810
 it's there on the right where you see 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.330
 some some bikes a little more 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.529
 wide or narrower then they need 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.889
 we need to touch up that 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:40.760
 that thread and then it's very easy to 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.830
 Left just have to pull 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.140
 of this not what you are seeing already 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.950
 automatically closes automatically 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:51.050
 manually but very very easily ale 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.520
 the next step is very easy the only thing 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.460
 what we have to do is place the 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.280
 support for the front wheel and then already 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.410
 if we want we can put the vehicle to 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.170
 the electric current in the box 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.240
 white because this cable appeared to us 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.880
 we just have to plug it in as I say 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.409
 any plug and in the back area 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.719
 of the vehicle as it appears 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:16.860
 in two or three holes one of them is 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:20.219
 for this then we went to place 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.589
 mount the cadence meter and the 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:25.139
 speed as you see here as there is a 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:29.480
 manual is very easy very simple it comes out 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:31.790
 some instructions to place it 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.900
 you just have to read it a moment ago and 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.430
 It is done 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.740
 First of all, we should 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.120
 place the magnet is a normal magnet and 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.960
 current as those of the 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.100
 odometer is known by a radio and 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:48.410
 then we put 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:50.850
 magnet for the connecting rod is the magnet for 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.910
 revolution counter comes to us too 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.220
 with lives to put the magnets and to 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.380
 put them the meters as I say very 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.020
 easy then we just have to cut the 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.819
 piece of life that we have left 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.280
 of course the magnet we are going to put 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:08.849
 behind the connecting rod and on the opposite side 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.480
 to the ecological chain and then as 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:13.600
 you are watching 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.310
 the meter goes the cadence meter goes 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.580
 ahead is the cadence meter 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:22.270
 that bold that is a narrow tube and the 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:24.870
 of the odometer is put behind the 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:28.930
 letters go out is to say the 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.760
 opening for the batteries goes inside and 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.200
 well that's all I hope you have 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.050
