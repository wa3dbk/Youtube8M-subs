00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:04.119
 the windows theme 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:07.320
 It has a very solid white and texture 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.320
 different from the one that is currently 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.320

 that is to say goods of all all desk 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.670

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.360
 content on the screen will be seeing

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:36.280
 ours anyway if they still do not 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.470
 it is clear all the content is all 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.750

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.960

 the display folders seeing that 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.960
 allows to put the cover and data of 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.940
 the song on the desk the icons 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.770
 that are all the icons that they see 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:02.280
 the pro-Franco moralist orchestra 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.280
 the king poke 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.270
 for example this 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.980
 of complications 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.980
 these two 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.670
 the end of the law 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.960
 established can take 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.640
 and with a bottom 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.190
 206 is leaving is 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.540
 select the windows theme that this one 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.380
 keep in mind 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.780
 look at the windows are different 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.530
 others 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.430
 [Music] 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.700
 different 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.590
 that would be the piper's theme 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.720
 [Music] 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.980
 for that for girls and in this case not 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.980
 I got a lot of practice 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.800
 so I said it as an alternative 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.800
 I have cycles 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.060
 the paper are these I also wrote with 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.060
 a screen that separating 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:09.489
 neither in the alternatives are these 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.810
 two pardon 4 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:18.430
 this topic fits very well but in 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.430
 this alternative case and the minis 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.220
 the images 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:33.220
 if he caught me talking he is not nervous 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.220
 weather 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:43.270
 but in the system because it had taken 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:48.080
 each theme and options 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:51.940
 or 40 lights first thing to come
