abrupt<00:00:02.880> climate<00:00:03.060> change<00:00:03.719> is<00:00:05.479> the<00:00:06.479> stuff<00:00:06.720> we

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
abrupt climate change is the stuff we

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:19.850 
abrupt climate change is the stuff we
don't<00:00:07.080> expect<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.769> we<00:00:07.920> expect<00:00:18.320> if<00:00:19.320> we<00:00:19.410> keep

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
don't expect that we expect if we keep

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.310 
don't expect that we expect if we keep
burning<00:00:20.100> fossil<00:00:20.520> fuels<00:00:21.000> we<00:00:21.360> keep<00:00:21.630> turning<00:00:22.170> up

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
burning fossil fuels we keep turning up

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.859 
burning fossil fuels we keep turning up
the<00:00:22.530> Earth's<00:00:22.680> thermostat<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.940> gets<00:00:24.330> warmer

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
the Earth's thermostat it gets warmer

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.370 
the Earth's thermostat it gets warmer
and<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.560> average<00:00:25.800> we<00:00:26.310> expect<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.539> warm<00:00:28.050> and

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
and on average we expect it to warm and

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.209 
and on average we expect it to warm and
so<00:00:28.770> you'll<00:00:28.949> see<00:00:29.010> all<00:00:29.190> these<00:00:29.520> curves<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:31.219> smooth

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
so you'll see all these curves of smooth

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.090 
so you'll see all these curves of smooth
warming<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.510> if<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.109> look<00:00:34.289> at<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.499> history<00:00:35.010> of

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
warming and if we look at the history of

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.599 
warming and if we look at the history of
Earth's<00:00:35.460> climate<00:00:35.989> what<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.170> never<00:00:37.440> see<00:00:37.949> is

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:38.609 
Earth's climate what we never see is

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:43.209 
Earth's climate what we never see is
this<00:00:39.649> what<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:40.800> see<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.690> this

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
this what we see is this

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.989 
this what we see is this
and<00:00:44.690> so<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.229> surprising<00:00:47.039> things<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.549> abrupt

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:47.999 
and so the surprising things the abrupt

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:51.709 
and so the surprising things the abrupt
things<00:00:48.389> are<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:49.559> great<00:00:50.100> interest<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:51.030> Earth's

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
things are of great interest the Earth's

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.000 
things are of great interest the Earth's
system<00:00:52.019> is<00:00:52.589> full<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:54.679> components<00:00:55.679> that<00:00:55.829> can

system is full of components that can

system is full of components that can
respond<00:00:56.459> very<00:00:56.670> abruptly<00:00:57.889> abrupt<00:00:58.889> climate

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
respond very abruptly abrupt climate

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.969 
respond very abruptly abrupt climate
change<00:00:59.549> is<00:01:00.209> not<00:01:00.479> just<00:01:00.510> an<00:01:01.049> abrupt<00:01:01.440> change<00:01:01.499> in

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
change is not just an abrupt change in

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.479 
change is not just an abrupt change in
climate<00:01:02.190> itself<00:01:02.959> but<00:01:03.959> slowly<00:01:04.949> changing

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
climate itself but slowly changing

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.410 
climate itself but slowly changing
climate<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:06.090> push<00:01:06.980> systems<00:01:08.150> including<00:01:09.150> human

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
climate can push systems including human

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.300 
climate can push systems including human
systems<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.080> ecological<00:01:10.620> systems<00:01:10.650> past

systems and ecological systems past
thresholds<00:01:11.910> themselves<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.080> possible

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
thresholds themselves and it is possible

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.710 
thresholds themselves and it is possible
that<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.040> push<00:01:14.340> something<00:01:14.790> very<00:01:15.000> gradually

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
that you push something very gradually

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.280 
that you push something very gradually
and<00:01:16.070> suddenly<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.340> hits<00:01:17.700> stuff<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:18.990> care

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
and suddenly it hits stuff that we care

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.940 
and suddenly it hits stuff that we care
about<00:01:19.760> either<00:01:20.760> the<00:01:21.180> storm<00:01:22.020> surge<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.380> just

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
about either the storm surge is just

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.310 
about either the storm surge is just
