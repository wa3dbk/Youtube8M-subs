00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:48.789 
some of the newer editions I think

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:52.110 
some of the newer editions I think
starting<00:06:49.090> in<00:06:49.210> about<00:06:49.300> 04<00:06:50.460> I<00:06:51.460> believe<00:06:51.849> the<00:06:52.000> year

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
starting in about 04 I believe the year

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.080 
starting in about 04 I believe the year
after<00:06:52.330> this<00:06:52.599> one<00:06:52.870> that<00:06:53.770> red<00:06:53.979> line<00:06:54.190> drops

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090 
after this one that red line drops

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.920 
after this one that red line drops
considerably<00:06:55.690> down<00:06:56.380> to<00:06:56.740> I<00:06:56.770> think<00:06:57.009> it's<00:06:57.130> about

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
considerably down to I think it's about

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.680 
considerably down to I think it's about
6500<00:06:58.930> 7,000<00:06:59.770> right<00:06:59.889> in<00:07:00.039> there<00:07:00.160> so<00:07:00.539> this<00:07:01.539> is<00:07:01.660> a
