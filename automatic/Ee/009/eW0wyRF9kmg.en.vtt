hello disobey me and I just wanted to
give<00:00:35.870> some<00:00:36.050> more<00:00:36.200> details<00:00:36.620> on<00:00:36.950> how<00:00:37.250> to<00:00:37.310> do<00:00:37.520> the

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
give some more details on how to do the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.370 
give some more details on how to do the
illusion<00:00:38.120> trick<00:00:38.270> that<00:00:38.570> I've<00:00:38.660> adapted<00:00:38.960> to

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
illusion trick that I've adapted to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.540 
illusion trick that I've adapted to
hooping<00:00:39.770> and<00:00:40.600> there's<00:00:41.600> two<00:00:41.930> main<00:00:42.430> elements<00:00:43.430> of

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
hooping and there's two main elements of

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.550 
hooping and there's two main elements of
the<00:00:43.670> trick<00:00:43.880> and<00:00:44.540> I'll<00:00:44.660> go<00:00:45.200> through<00:00:45.350> both<00:00:45.530> of

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
the trick and I'll go through both of

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.100 
the trick and I'll go through both of
those<00:00:45.800> but<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:46.670> first<00:00:46.910> thing<00:00:47.120> need<00:00:47.870> to<00:00:47.900> figure

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
those but the first thing need to figure

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.110 
those but the first thing need to figure
out<00:00:48.350> is<00:00:48.620> which<00:00:48.890> leg<00:00:49.250> you're<00:00:49.880> going<00:00:49.910> to<00:00:50.060> be

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
out is which leg you're going to be

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.160 
out is which leg you're going to be
planting<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:50.960> spinning<00:00:51.410> on<00:00:51.580> and<00:00:52.960> I'm<00:00:53.960> going

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
planting and spinning on and I'm going

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.850 
planting and spinning on and I'm going
to<00:00:54.230> be<00:00:54.320> planting<00:00:54.620> on<00:00:55.220> my<00:00:56.180> left<00:00:56.540> and<00:00:56.900> spinning

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
to be planting on my left and spinning

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.250 
to be planting on my left and spinning
to<00:00:58.100> my<00:00:58.220> right<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:59.000> I<00:00:59.120> think<00:00:59.390> my<00:00:59.540> left<00:00:59.809> because

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
to my right and I think my left because

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.410 
to my right and I think my left because
it's<00:01:00.920> easier<00:01:01.190> for<00:01:01.220> me<00:01:01.400> to<00:01:01.550> do<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.820> splits<00:01:02.090> on

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
it's easier for me to do the splits on

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
it's easier for me to do the splits on
my<00:01:02.630> left<00:01:02.900> side

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
my left side

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.689 
my left side
those<00:01:03.590> left<00:01:03.800> hamstrings<00:01:04.339> are<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.520> little

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
those left hamstrings are a little

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.090 
those left hamstrings are a little
looser<00:01:05.140> you're<00:01:06.140> kicking<00:01:06.530> that<00:01:06.650> other<00:01:06.860> leg

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
looser you're kicking that other leg

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.770 
looser you're kicking that other leg
back<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:07.400> you<00:01:07.640> just<00:01:07.729> want<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:07.940> make<00:01:08.090> sure<00:01:08.270> that

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
back so you just want to make sure that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.760 
back so you just want to make sure that
those<00:01:08.990> muscles<00:01:09.530> are<00:01:09.650> really<00:01:10.610> loose<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:11.440> so<00:01:12.440> if

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
those muscles are really loose and so if

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.430 
those muscles are really loose and so if
you're<00:01:12.890> looser<00:01:13.190> on<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:13.400> right<00:01:13.610> then<00:01:14.450> going<00:01:15.320> to

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
you're looser on the right then going to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.260 
you're looser on the right then going to
transpose<00:01:16.040> all<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.580> directions<00:01:17.000> that<00:01:17.090> I'm

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
transpose all the directions that I'm

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.999 
transpose all the directions that I'm
giving<00:01:17.860> but<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.990> you're<00:01:21.140> also<00:01:21.380> be<00:01:21.470> doing

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
giving but and you're also be doing

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.790 
giving but and you're also be doing
everything<00:01:22.310> opposite<00:01:22.880> so<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:24.380> first<00:01:24.590> thing

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
everything opposite so the first thing

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.370 
everything opposite so the first thing
you<00:01:24.890> should<00:01:25.160> practice<00:01:25.700> is<00:01:25.910> just<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.660> 360<00:01:27.350> spin

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
you should practice is just a 360 spin

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.920 
you should practice is just a 360 spin
and<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.550> hoop<00:01:28.820> is<00:01:28.970> gonna<00:01:29.150> be<00:01:29.360> in<00:01:29.780> the

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
and the hoop is gonna be in the

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.740 
and the hoop is gonna be in the
horizontal<00:01:30.170> position<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:31.820> I<00:01:32.090> transfer<00:01:32.720> it

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
horizontal position and I transfer it

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.980 
horizontal position and I transfer it
once<00:01:33.020> behind<00:01:33.500> me<00:01:33.740> about<00:01:34.610> just<00:01:34.790> fine<00:01:34.970> fine<00:01:35.780> that

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
once behind me about just fine fine that

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.469 
once behind me about just fine fine that
that's<00:01:36.200> easier<00:01:36.650> to<00:01:36.800> keep<00:01:37.340> my<00:01:37.490> balance<00:01:37.670> so<00:01:38.390> it

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
that's easier to keep my balance so it

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.740 
that's easier to keep my balance so it
looks<00:01:38.630> like<00:01:38.780> this<00:01:38.960> on<00:01:42.580> my<00:01:43.580> left<00:01:43.850> spinning<00:01:44.510> to

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
looks like this on my left spinning to

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.940 
looks like this on my left spinning to
my<00:01:44.840> right<00:01:47.320> and<00:01:48.320> once<00:01:48.680> you're<00:01:48.799> comfortable

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
my right and once you're comfortable

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.610 
my right and once you're comfortable
with<00:01:49.370> that<00:01:49.520> then<00:01:50.330> you're<00:01:50.960> gonna<00:01:51.110> add<00:01:51.320> the

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
with that then you're gonna add the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.070 
with that then you're gonna add the
second<00:01:52.100> part<00:01:52.700> of<00:01:52.760> the<00:01:52.909> trick<00:01:53.150> which<00:01:53.750> is<00:01:53.900> the

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
second part of the trick which is the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.789 
second part of the trick which is the
kick<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:55.630> it<00:01:56.630> feels<00:01:57.049> pretty<00:01:57.260> crazy<00:01:57.560> at<00:01:57.770> first

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
kick and it feels pretty crazy at first

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.920 
kick and it feels pretty crazy at first
because<00:01:58.159> you're<00:01:58.340> kicking<00:01:58.790> and<00:01:58.940> spinning<00:01:59.240> at

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
because you're kicking and spinning at

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.830 
because you're kicking and spinning at
the<00:02:00.080> same<00:02:00.290> time<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:01.070> I'm<00:02:02.060> just<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.330> warn<00:02:02.570> you

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
the same time so I'm just to warn you

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.380 
the same time so I'm just to warn you
you<00:02:03.229> might<00:02:03.409> end<00:02:03.560> up<00:02:03.740> on<00:02:03.920> your<00:02:04.040> butt<00:02:04.220> like<00:02:05.150> me

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
you might end up on your butt like me

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.880 
you might end up on your butt like me
still<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.970> but<00:02:07.970> it's<00:02:08.149> still<00:02:08.299> fun<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:09.619> don't<00:02:09.799> be

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
still and but it's still fun so don't be

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.570 
still and but it's still fun so don't be
afraid<00:02:10.070> of<00:02:10.160> that<00:02:10.280> I<00:02:10.790> mean<00:02:11.420> so<00:02:12.580> basically

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
you're gonna be taking the hoop from the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.699 
you're gonna be taking the hoop from the
horizontal<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.690> vertical<00:02:18.200> alongside

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
horizontal to the vertical alongside

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.130 
horizontal to the vertical alongside
your<00:02:19.280> body<00:02:19.489> and<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.720> can<00:02:20.840> also<00:02:20.989> be

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
your body and you can also be

your body and you can also be
transferring<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.769> opposite<00:02:22.100> hand<00:02:22.660> as

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
transferring it to the opposite hand as

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.880 
transferring it to the opposite hand as
you<00:02:23.840> come<00:02:23.989> yet<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:26.110> let<00:02:27.110> me<00:02:27.200> just<00:02:27.350> try<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.650> do

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.440 

no<00:03:09.760> that's<00:03:09.940> basically<00:03:10.480> it<00:03:10.780> it's<00:03:10.960> not<00:03:11.110> perfect

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
no that's basically it it's not perfect

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.600 
no that's basically it it's not perfect
also<00:03:13.450> because<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:13.960> put<00:03:14.590> my<00:03:14.710> hand<00:03:15.010> down<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.430> help
