 He's going to hit us and now the guys 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.440
 friends who spoke from 93 years to 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.760
 here's another video on the channel and 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.220
 people saying here another episode 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.160
 of the range with those inscribed on the map called 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.720
 Glasses challenge is a good map 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.180
 interesting place where we have a 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.310
 kind of a bridge is in check 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.580
 continues at the end and we must pass 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.220
 by these tv 4 glasses and collects 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.470
 I followed here and I got the 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.239
 So check it down there and it looks like it 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.800
 arrested the one who got out 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.199
 so today 's goal is to arrive 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.840
 until that check point and we have other 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.300
 things that are also common with me a jump 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.230
 There jump rope in motorcycle races and 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.480
 challenge 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.489
 2 is the second challenge so come on 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.420
 Let's try what you 're talking about here. 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:56.530
 best record to jump rope our guy 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.760
 He told all this damn 1225 I will 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.289
 talk in glasses here 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.230
 take to have enough people here 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.360
 on the map because it makes it easier for us 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.190
 success to the check point and my god 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.520
 sky will be very difficult guys because 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.340
 not only four are more than six or 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.580
 seven others here on the map and that's where it goes 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.119
 to make us everything 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.520
 So, let's go and go there. 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.180
 We are almost able to jump on the 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.100
 eye 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.820
 Look, we could only do a parco in the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.330
 head, why not? 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.520
 pork one because a pork bacon is 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.950
 a little bit we can not 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.680
 You do not even have to wear glasses, but it's very difficult. 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.329
 if it's not as difficult as it seems 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.950
 One hour we 'll make it. I know. 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.619
 What an hour we'll get then 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:50.229
 Let's go, let's continue here. 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:53.649
 look here look here รณ been skipped 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.899
 understood jumped is the item one more coming 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.700
 here he is going to hit us and wake up 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.460
 people it's now that we enjoy it 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.460
 we got caught the jetpack beauty does not have 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.960
 How do you get it right that you know that our 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.610
 lady is ours 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.130
 So, guys, what I discovered is the 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.049
 There is no way to pick up the check 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.630
 Bridge is over for you to get the jetpack. 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.420
 It's just for you and it has that feeling of 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.370
 I got here in the end I got it 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.020
 it's not so difficult 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.230
 only it's not so easy either 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.720
 it's a level there it 's more or less not so 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.950
 difficult then let's see the other things 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.050
 what you have on the map right? 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.400
 and I found it very cool and technical I 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.220
 I found it very cool enough to taste 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.770
 people pose challenges with glasses 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.670
 then we see that we have beyond mistakes and 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.220
 to run away 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.600
 I stopped in limbo now, you do not want me 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.460
 keep it here again so let's see what 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.170
 We have a motorcycle running here. 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.400
 see if you jump rope that I 'm very curious 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.800
 that face time than that at the time of 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.350
 Time I wanna believe that says man hit 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.610
 at my door I had to put the club 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.930
 Gaucho, wait there guys 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.670
 We're going to have to clean this up here. 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.450
 because it's totally wrong for us 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:07.890
 Needs to be cleaned up a staircase 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:12.460
 that law business here is beauty beauty 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.560
 the question makes us sin that for this 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.880
 then we take the danger here 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.520
 It's the club with which we'll go up there because 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.100
 If I do not have the club an x- ray I'm 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.700
 here my business is if we do not have 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.700
 me we can not release the 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.720
 Jump rope is the owner of the 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.209
 map 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.300
 put protection on teleports 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.320
 not occur and that business right 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.780
 so come on 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.120
 We're going up my god I do not 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.560
 I think it's up to us and still 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.750
 Dying, that's what's funny, I wanted to. 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.660
 both play the judgment I wanted both 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.150
 played by the rope but I do not think so 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.920
 give to play today to die again 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.560
 let's leave the pre agreement with the next 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.050
 and who knows how here in the second 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.940
 challenge of the curious good to see second 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.400
 challenge and let's see what we have here 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.620
 right is not fumbles with eta 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.670
 interesting are the people 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:18.489
 For me, do not get in the way. 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.079
 tie understands and since then we have here a 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.110
 of platforms right 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.940
 the invisible mac platforms it is and 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.770
 This we have to jump on, right? 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.250
 So we can get to the place. 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.310
 That's right, it 's the end, it's just that. 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.800
 have made a way here, the boom that 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.800
 it facilitates then it ends up facilitating 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.720
 here access is the only thing that 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.639
 the map owner should do is correct 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.740
 this error of the club 11 so that 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.960
 happen here because otherwise lose 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.080
