00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.090 

still<00:00:56.050> sorry<00:00:57.930> not<00:00:58.930> constantly<00:00:59.530> but<00:00:59.890> maybe

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
still sorry not constantly but maybe

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.170 
still sorry not constantly but maybe
once<00:01:00.370> every<00:01:00.550> minute<00:01:00.970> or<00:01:01.030> two

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.840 

the<00:01:07.690> salt<00:01:07.990> helps<00:01:08.230> the<00:01:08.620> onions<00:01:08.980> to<00:01:09.190> release<00:01:09.490> a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
the salt helps the onions to release a

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.670 
the salt helps the onions to release a
little<00:01:10.630> bit<00:01:10.780> of<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:10.990> moisture<00:01:11.170> so<00:01:11.650> that

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
little bit of the moisture so that

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.430 
little bit of the moisture so that
they'll<00:01:11.980> keep<00:01:12.190> them<00:01:12.400> sticking<00:01:13.140> now<00:01:14.140> I'm<00:01:14.290> just

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
they'll keep them sticking now I'm just

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.730 
they'll keep them sticking now I'm just
using<00:01:14.620> a<00:01:15.070> nonstick<00:01:15.670> pan<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:19.500> didn't<00:01:20.500> use

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
using a nonstick pan and I didn't use

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.830 
using a nonstick pan and I didn't use
any<00:01:21.010> oil<00:01:21.310> or<00:01:21.870> Pam<00:01:22.870> this<00:01:23.470> time<00:01:27.300> also<00:01:28.300> I<00:01:28.330> think<00:01:28.600> it

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
any oil or Pam this time also I think it

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.720 
any oil or Pam this time also I think it
might<00:01:29.020> make<00:01:29.050> a<00:01:29.290> bit<00:01:29.530> of<00:01:29.620> a<00:01:29.710> difference<00:01:30.130> on<00:01:30.400> what

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
might make a bit of a difference on what

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.540 
might make a bit of a difference on what
type<00:01:31.000> of<00:01:31.030> onions<00:01:31.630> you<00:01:31.930> choose<00:01:32.230> I<00:01:32.560> like<00:01:33.190> to<00:01:33.370> use

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
type of onions you choose I like to use

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.780 
type of onions you choose I like to use
the<00:01:33.760> sweet<00:01:34.030> onions<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:34.830> I<00:01:35.830> think<00:01:36.430> that<00:01:36.610> they

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
the sweet onions and I think that they

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.480 
the sweet onions and I think that they
may<00:01:37.000> caramelize<00:01:37.660> a<00:01:37.690> little<00:01:38.020> bit<00:01:38.410> better<00:01:39.160> than

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
may caramelize a little bit better than

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:55.110 
may caramelize a little bit better than
the<00:01:39.580> regular<00:01:40.030> white<00:01:40.480> or<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:41.020> yellow<00:01:41.230> onion

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.400 

slowly<00:01:56.120> you'll<00:01:56.480> notice<00:01:56.810> your<00:01:56.990> onions<00:01:57.290> are

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
slowly you'll notice your onions are

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.490 
slowly you'll notice your onions are
coming<00:01:57.650> more<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:57.860> more<00:01:58.010> Brown<00:01:59.290> it's<00:02:00.290> a<00:02:00.380> good

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
coming more and more Brown it's a good

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.540 
coming more and more Brown it's a good
idea<00:02:00.650> to<00:02:01.100> keep<00:02:01.700> a<00:02:01.970> couple<00:02:02.510> of<00:02:02.570> water<00:02:02.840> handy<00:02:03.550> so

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
idea to keep a couple of water handy so

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.510 
idea to keep a couple of water handy so
that<00:02:04.970> if<00:02:05.360> your<00:02:05.810> onions<00:02:06.440> start<00:02:06.740> looking<00:02:07.280> too

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
that if your onions start looking too

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.180 
that if your onions start looking too
dry<00:02:07.820> or<00:02:08.179> if<00:02:08.240> they<00:02:08.390> start<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.869> stick<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:10.160> can

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
dry or if they start to stick you can

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.000 
dry or if they start to stick you can
import<00:02:10.790> just<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:11.780> few<00:02:12.140> tablespoons<00:02:12.470> of<00:02:12.830> water

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010
