this<00:00:01.350> is<00:00:01.500> a<00:00:01.530> final<00:00:01.979> part<00:00:02.190> of<00:00:02.340> repairing<00:00:02.730> a

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
this is a final part of repairing a

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.749 
this is a final part of repairing a
stewart's<00:00:03.330> on<00:00:03.510> steam<00:00:03.840> engine<00:00:04.310> this<00:00:05.310> is<00:00:05.490> part

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
stewart's on steam engine this is part

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.610 
stewart's on steam engine this is part
three<00:00:06.060> and<00:00:06.270> you<00:00:06.569> see<00:00:06.779> me<00:00:06.930> cutting<00:00:07.170> out<00:00:07.410> the

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
three and you see me cutting out the

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.650 
three and you see me cutting out the
base<00:00:07.799> plate<00:00:08.099> from<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.000> piece<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.330> mild<00:00:09.570> steel

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
base plate from a piece of mild steel

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.180 
base plate from a piece of mild steel
using<00:00:10.469> my<00:00:10.590> milling<00:00:10.889> machine<00:00:12.650> this<00:00:13.650> video<00:00:14.009> is

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
using my milling machine this video is

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.039 
using my milling machine this video is
of<00:00:14.340> course<00:00:14.549> speeded<00:00:15.000> up<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.450> much<00:00:15.780> slower

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
of course speeded up is a much slower

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.779 
of course speeded up is a much slower
process<00:00:16.289> than<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.279> it's<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.520> good<00:00:17.640> idea

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
process than this and it's a good idea

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.450 
process than this and it's a good idea
to<00:00:18.029> use<00:00:18.330> some<00:00:18.630> coolant<00:00:19.140> but<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.039> purposes

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
to use some coolant but for the purposes

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.920 
to use some coolant but for the purposes
of<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.789> video<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.390> fact<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.750> don't

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
of the video and the fact that I don't

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.570 
of the video and the fact that I don't
like<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.260> smell<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.680> stuff<00:00:22.949> I'm<00:00:23.430> not

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
like the smell of the stuff I'm not

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.790 
like the smell of the stuff I'm not
using<00:00:24.029> coolant<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.900> just<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.170> very<00:00:25.439> sharp

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
using coolant this is just a very sharp

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.179 
using coolant this is just a very sharp
slop<00:00:26.160> drill<00:00:27.170> plus<00:00:28.170> I'm<00:00:28.320> only<00:00:28.470> taking<00:00:28.920> shallow

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
slop drill plus I'm only taking shallow

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.269 
slop drill plus I'm only taking shallow
cuts<00:00:29.580> never<00:00:30.539> take<00:00:30.929> deep<00:00:31.199> cuts<00:00:31.529> with<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> piece

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
cuts never take deep cuts with a piece

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.979 
cuts never take deep cuts with a piece
of<00:00:32.309> metal<00:00:32.640> sticking<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.390> far<00:00:33.660> out<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
of metal sticking so far out of the

of metal sticking so far out of the
machine<00:00:34.380> vise<00:00:35.690> also<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.899> good<00:00:37.050> idea<00:00:37.200> to

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
machine vise also it's a good idea to

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.290 
machine vise also it's a good idea to
wear<00:00:37.710> some<00:00:37.980> sort<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.340> personal<00:00:38.879> protective

equipment or PPE as is known I know a
little<00:00:43.350> bit<00:00:43.590> about<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.010> health<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.370> safety

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
little bit about the health and safety

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.819 
little bit about the health and safety
routines<00:00:45.270> because<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.110> couple<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.469> years<00:00:46.620> ago

in my recording studio I recorded quite

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.229 
in my recording studio I recorded quite
a<00:00:48.989> lot<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.350> narrative<00:00:49.559> all<00:00:50.340> about<00:00:50.789> health<00:00:51.090> and

do not hit you in the eye one thing that

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.740 
do not hit you in the eye one thing that
is<00:01:11.130> very<00:01:11.189> important<00:01:11.909> when<00:01:12.000> using<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.479> milling

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
is very important when using a milling

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.630 
is very important when using a milling
machine<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.560> direction<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.250> which<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
machine is the direction in which the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.510 
machine is the direction in which the
cutter<00:01:14.880> needs<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.390> move<00:01:15.570> against<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> work

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
cutter needs to move against the work

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.010 
cutter needs to move against the work
the<00:01:17.520> milling<00:01:17.850> cutter<00:01:17.880> always<00:01:18.630> needs<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.960> be

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the milling cutter always needs to be

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.780 
the milling cutter always needs to be
moving<00:01:19.470> towards<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> bit<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.310> metal<00:01:20.640> that

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
moving towards the bit of metal that

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.510 
moving towards the bit of metal that
you're<00:01:20.939> cutting<00:01:21.290> never<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:23.009> for

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you're cutting never with it for

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.460 
you're cutting never with it for
instance<00:01:23.880> here<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.509> see<00:01:24.720> me<00:01:24.840> cutting<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.290> end

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
instance here you see me cutting the end

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.039 
instance here you see me cutting the end
parts<00:01:25.979> which<00:01:26.220> quite<00:01:26.549> thin<00:01:26.850> by<00:01:27.060> now<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.540> I'm

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
parts which quite thin by now and I'm

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.499 
parts which quite thin by now and I'm
moving<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.590> milling<00:01:28.829> cutter<00:01:29.180> towards<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
moving the milling cutter towards the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.690 
moving the milling cutter towards the
piece<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.900> metal<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.920> go<00:01:32.070> with<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.579> other

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
piece of metal if I go with it the other

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.670 
piece of metal if I go with it the other
way<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.299> likely<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.869> grab<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.290> piece<00:01:34.470> of

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
way it's likely to grab the piece of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.770 
way it's likely to grab the piece of
metal<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.189> everything<00:01:36.119> will<00:01:36.240> be<00:01:36.270> destroyed

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
metal and everything will be destroyed

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.050 
metal and everything will be destroyed
the<00:01:37.320> milling<00:01:37.590> cutter<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.130> my<00:01:38.640> piece<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.030> work

the milling cutter and my piece of work

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.000 
the milling cutter and my piece of work
another<00:01:41.390> good<00:01:41.510> thing<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:41.780> remember<00:01:42.140> is<00:01:42.710> when

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
another good thing to remember is when

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.410 
another good thing to remember is when
you<00:01:43.100> turn<00:01:43.310> around<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.700> piece<00:01:43.880> of<00:01:44.030> metal<00:01:44.180> in

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
you turn around the piece of metal in

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.050 
you turn around the piece of metal in
the<00:01:44.510> machine<00:01:44.840> lice<00:01:45.110> brush<00:01:46.070> off<00:01:46.310> any<00:01:46.520> swath

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
the machine lice brush off any swath

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.700

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
left in place as an undercoat this

left in place as an undercoat this
original<00:03:35.750> green<00:03:35.989> paint<00:03:36.290> was<00:03:36.470> so<00:03:36.680> well<00:03:36.920> baked

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
original green paint was so well baked

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.400 
original green paint was so well baked
onto<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.760> engine<00:03:37.910> probably<00:03:38.900> from<00:03:39.079> years<00:03:39.350> of

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
onto the engine probably from years of

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.319 
onto the engine probably from years of
running<00:03:39.769> on<00:03:39.890> steam<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:40.640> seemed<00:03:40.880> like<00:03:41.060> a<00:03:41.090> good

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
running on steam it seemed like a good

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.880 
running on steam it seemed like a good
idea<00:03:41.390> to<00:03:41.720> leave<00:03:41.959> it<00:03:42.140> where<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:42.410> was<00:03:42.530> as<00:03:42.769> an

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
idea to leave it where it was as an

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.160 
idea to leave it where it was as an
undercoat<00:03:43.340> all<00:03:44.239> I'm<00:03:44.510> doing<00:03:44.780> now<00:03:44.959> is

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
undercoat all I'm doing now is

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.289 
undercoat all I'm doing now is
accurately<00:03:45.769> marking<00:03:46.220> out<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.489> bed<00:03:46.670> plate<00:03:46.940> and

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
accurately marking out the bed plate and

after machining the bed plate to the
finished<00:03:49.700> size<00:03:49.940> I<00:03:50.300> drilled<00:03:50.930> and<00:03:51.050> reamed<00:03:51.349> four

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
finished size I drilled and reamed four

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.570 
finished size I drilled and reamed four
holes<00:03:52.040> in<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.550> mounting<00:03:52.909> lugs

holes in the mounting lugs

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.970 
holes in the mounting lugs
then<00:03:54.120> over<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.630> lathe<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.110> all<00:03:55.560> I<00:03:55.590> had<00:03:55.830> to

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
then over to the lathe and all I had to

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.880 
then over to the lathe and all I had to
do<00:03:56.130> was<00:03:56.310> turn<00:03:56.550> 4-step<00:03:57.420> bushes<00:03:57.930> that<00:03:58.140> pressed

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
do was turn 4-step bushes that pressed

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.830 
do was turn 4-step bushes that pressed
into<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.310> quarter<00:03:59.520> inch<00:03:59.850> reamed<00:04:00.180> holes<00:04:00.480> and

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
into the quarter inch reamed holes and

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.200 
into the quarter inch reamed holes and
the<00:04:01.590> hole<00:04:01.770> in<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.070> center<00:04:02.490> of<00:04:02.580> these<00:04:02.730> bushes

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
the hole in the center of these bushes

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.330 
the hole in the center of these bushes
was<00:04:03.600> five<00:04:03.960> thirty<00:04:04.290> seconds<00:04:04.770> of<00:04:04.860> an<00:04:04.980> inch<00:04:05.130> in

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
was five thirty seconds of an inch in

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.580 
was five thirty seconds of an inch in
diameter<00:04:05.720> here's<00:04:06.720> one<00:04:06.990> of<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.200> bush<00:04:07.380> is

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
diameter here's one of the bush is

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.120 
diameter here's one of the bush is
almost<00:04:07.950> complete<00:04:08.490> before<00:04:08.940> final<00:04:09.390> party<00:04:09.810> off
