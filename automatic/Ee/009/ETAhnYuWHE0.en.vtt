00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 welcome experience available net it 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.200
 look forward to a tough match 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.280
 against foot close solid 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:17.820
 athletically and who develops a good 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:19.500
 4th mazembe his chronicles it's going to be my 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.250
 difficult because it's sure 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.500
 is we on the outside they already have to be 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.390
 but difficult all had each 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.220
 team as long as one and will be the first goal 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.820
 and wants to fold the match and in the morning 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.850
 try to knock us from the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.530
 morning the good ones it's up to us from them 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.719
 try to counter them and try to 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.710
 thwart them plans to try to be 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.090
 to have the malice of the euro to 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.129
 intelligence on all levels 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.390
 tactically physically athletically 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.649
 to be able to give everything all and massalit 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.270
 not to have regrets later for 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.160
 the match earlier 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.160
 how will be really started behind 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.899
 wait and let it come to the scenario 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.600
 it was better to ask the coach 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.449
 so far 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.840
 the park talk about it is him the most 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.040
 clever he knows if it's right 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.990
 he knows what tactics we will use 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.820
 all the senses we just work are 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.500
 indeed tried our generation 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.659
 because there we already had first 5 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.190
 mathieu a bit difficult in the league 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.750
 whose training we try to have 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.250
 a little milk unrolled to the global I 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.100
 tell me from today will try 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.590
 from us a community of our masters 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.440
 Antarctic in place so far we do not 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.819
 do not know how we have zapa kemer on 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.700
 does all that one makes insane who will 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.050
 found the formula to be able to us 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.659
 say you have to wait for them if you have to 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.770
 rely on them to look up and and 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.270
 I know it's a lucky 2007 yannick 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.069
 we felt a particular pressure 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.229
 with this awareness for a 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:55.100
 big final in the players goes because 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.729
 that I do not have a pressure 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.600
 additional 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.280
 I do not put pressure 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.440
 extra already it's a match to 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.570
 pressure if we have to add the 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.700
 poetry still there 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.350
 this match a football match it's here 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.209
 if good matches to play is that of 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.860
 happiness for me and if we play at 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.030
 football it's here for enough for 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.470
 able to arrive at this stage of the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.450
 competition that's why I wish 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.770
 it's matches and after we go 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.110
 to age we will tell our children 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.060
 so we know that happiness is that 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.830
 pleasure if I went to play beyond the 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.540
 languages 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.010
 Beyond the importance of this game and 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.810
 it's what you do and it risks the 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.000
 football going to go down there goes on 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.800
 had to play our football we do not know 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.780
 do something else that I can not find 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.850
 we tried to play with our strengths 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.150
 and toys with our forces to 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.750
 a good world 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.750
 championship 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.849
 yeah different in the context in 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.439
 in the mood and everything but me 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.930
 frankly I'm heading aboard all 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.730
 matches in the same way people 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.560
 were concentrated for the championship 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.030
 national and 4 difficult months good that's it 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.799
 is we won in the pronounced the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.140
 dive changed it's true on a 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.629
 semi final but it's still football 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.580
 after all that in the clinics and 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:10.690
 of football it's true that 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.680
 I'm trying to big crisis made good 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.770
 matches 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.480
 matches because as a footballer we 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.680
 liked you want to play if you play football 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.380
 based to participate in matches like 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.630
 that in the water goes there with a lot 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:28.440
 of shine soil much envied to do 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:31.440
 your stars how to guide the population 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.790
 this against an opponent when the 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.819
 preparation I 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.950
 I would say it's 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.060
 the staff and the coach who loved place and 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.860
 palpitations 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.200
 good things matches that every day in 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.700
 is aware of this kind of match in 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.800
 six matches and we do not even have 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.920
 need to tell you no I see this 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.260
 what to do or xy because already you 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.370
 know the importance of the match in the 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.370
 too soon is aware of the importance 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.380
 of the match and I hope my teammates 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.150
 have squeezed me it's a good day do it 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.819
 perfect match the scales in the match 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.080
 and example and to see if all 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.650
 physically physically plans 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.300
 tactically in duels and touba 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.010
 fall is really very strong there 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.010
 to be able to have a good time
