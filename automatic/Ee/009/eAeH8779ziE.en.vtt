00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:17.900
 before he has mandolin his house that 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.450
 it is an instrument that does not help 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.830
 cut it well similar to one of the same 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.810
 size if you do not have the mandolin 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.760
 just the monkeys and escorted him to 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.710
 knife for a uniform size you do not 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.600
 you want you to have more captain more 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.029
 great than others that we are going to fry 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.920
 you could bake the whole banana 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.090
 with aluminum foil wrapped and then 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.430
 he alternated in the houses and that he wants it 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.220
 do a little fries like who is 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:47.260
 first this I always do this as 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:47.260
 sauce in the background to help you 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.340
 then we come with the first capita 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.100
 If you read that the ground meat I made it with 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.360
 a little onion chopped a 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.900
 little bit of sofrito has also 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.570
 has the same bean sauce 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.080
 tomato date and also has salsita 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.150
 marinate all the time this meat is 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.480
 very important they in balls with 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.390
 easy to see this egg technique 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.520
 shake remember that this goes after 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.560
 for the oven to be 85 I think it's 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.960
 that as egg we do not want these 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.270
 bananas obviously like they stick 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.100
 between them and incorporate themselves as 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:37.220
 I mentioned screaming I was watching on Monday 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:39.710
 ancestor here the kitchen day by day and 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.509
 I was making a lasagna if I did not 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.090
 wrong chicken and he added cheese 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.310
 cream to the meat cheese is tremendous idea 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.660
 and I said good I usually put the 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.130
 great and the cream cheese on top because not 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.170
 we mix it and we have todita and 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.030
 uniform and that I learned from it and look 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.290
 it was in fact then united was what 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.970
 We did our meat once 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.119
 as the mentions with sofrito onion 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.280
 garlic tomato sauce we add it once 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.500
 cooked the cream cheese and that's why 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.369
 turns this color as well as more pink 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.369
 and it looks nice 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.870
 How do I think this looks good 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:16.510
 compact a little bit of that is obviously 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.510
 let's put another bigger layer and 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.290
 on that side crying for you in 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.959
 your house and you know in size plus one 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:29.690
 pretty couple stage in the kitchen good 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:31.580
 with such in the same way as now another 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.769
 another delicacy if you have also you come 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.650
 you cut it and if not now we come 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.510
 with the egg so that the beaten egg 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.190
 around two to three eggs less 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.260
 the size of the eggs and for these 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.560
 Exquisite to see where the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.510
 yellow is that egg do its function and 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.970
 to paste is to welcome to do cited now yes 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.340
 It's ok 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.490
 need so that we have more or less 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.490
 the same 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.300
 that has but perfect then another 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.650
 capita of meat you already know with a mention 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.630
 is that it has cream cheese that's why it has 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.470
 this nice legal chorus and so 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.570
 successively we make another layer of 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.730
 yellows to take and so we end up 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.830
 the mozzarella cheese we go to the oven to 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.230
 350 degrees until it is gratin and that 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.480
 that and cook the egg very important 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.130
 this is going to compact after we leave 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.500
 that went a bit we cut it and that I 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.420
 treat as it was left that it is 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.810
