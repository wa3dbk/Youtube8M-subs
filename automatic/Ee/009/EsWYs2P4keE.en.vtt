in his egg and that is the gimmick I

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.699 
in his egg and that is the gimmick I
thought<00:02:17.240> maybe<00:02:17.660> there<00:02:18.200> will<00:02:18.260> be<00:02:18.319> a<00:02:18.440> spring

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
thought maybe there will be a spring

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.500 
thought maybe there will be a spring
spring-loaded<00:02:19.459> feature<00:02:19.819> where<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.330> head

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
spring-loaded feature where the head

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.580

pops<00:02:20.780> up<00:02:21.640> unfortunately<00:02:22.640> with<00:02:22.970> this<00:02:23.090> one<00:02:23.590> it

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
pops up unfortunately with this one it

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.070

doesn't<00:02:24.860> had<00:02:25.310> just<00:02:25.580> wobbles<00:02:26.030> but<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.780> still

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
doesn't had just wobbles but I still

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.930
