they're not getting enough protein

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.539 
they're not getting enough protein
sometimes<00:00:13.440> it's<00:00:13.799> because<00:00:14.040> they<00:00:14.190> just<00:00:14.309> don't

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
sometimes it's because they just don't

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
know which foods are rich in protein

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.510 
know which foods are rich in protein
they<00:00:16.440> think<00:00:16.680> fruits<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.039> vegetables<00:00:17.430> contain

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
protein which they don't or it's because

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.050 
protein which they don't or it's because
they<00:00:19.890> just<00:00:20.070> don't<00:00:20.279> like<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.580> taste<00:00:20.609> of

protein or they don't like preparing
protein<00:00:22.949> protein<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.090> food<00:00:24.269> that's<00:00:24.449> the

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
protein protein is the food that's the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.660 
protein protein is the food that's the
least<00:00:24.810> convenient<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.680> today's<00:00:26.130> society<00:00:26.310> you

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
least convenient in today's society you

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.670 
least convenient in today's society you
usually<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.300> cook<00:00:27.480> your<00:00:27.599> protein<00:00:27.990> so

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
usually have to cook your protein so

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.560 
usually have to cook your protein so
it's<00:00:29.070> not<00:00:29.189> quite<00:00:29.460> as<00:00:29.670> easy<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.939> pick<00:00:30.210> up<00:00:30.359> you

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
it's not quite as easy to pick up you

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.179 
it's not quite as easy to pick up you
know<00:00:30.599> protein<00:00:31.170> as<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.650> pick<00:00:31.769> up<00:00:31.890> carbs

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
know protein as it is to pick up carbs

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.100 
know protein as it is to pick up carbs
or<00:00:32.309> fat<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:32.820> as<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.030> result<00:00:33.210> our<00:00:33.570> diets<00:00:33.840> are<00:00:33.960> low

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
or fat so as a result our diets are low

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.810 
or fat so as a result our diets are low
in<00:00:34.260> protein<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:35.219> really<00:00:35.430> gonna<00:00:35.550> hinder

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
in protein and it's really gonna hinder

from<00:01:03.149> setting<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.960> finally<00:01:04.619> protein<00:01:04.979> is

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
from setting in and finally protein is

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.770 
from setting in and finally protein is
also<00:01:05.489> great<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:05.850> helping<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.240> recover<00:01:06.510> from

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
your workout sessions because protein

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.490 
your workout sessions because protein
basically<00:01:09.030> contains<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.689> amino<00:01:09.990> acids<00:01:10.470> that

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
basically contains the amino acids that

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.280 
basically contains the amino acids that
the<00:01:10.619> muscles<00:01:11.369> are<00:01:11.490> milk<00:01:11.700> made<00:01:12.090> out<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.720> by

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the muscles are milk made out of so by

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.810 
the muscles are milk made out of so by
giving<00:01:13.439> your<00:01:13.650> muscles<00:01:14.040> protein<00:01:14.460> after<00:01:14.729> your

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
giving your muscles protein after your

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.179 
giving your muscles protein after your
workout<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.270> help<00:01:15.479> restart<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.619> full

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
workout you help restart the full

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.649 
workout you help restart the full
rebuilding<00:01:17.670> process<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.509> can

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
rebuilding process so that you can

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.210 
rebuilding process so that you can
recover<00:01:18.900> faster<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.680> back<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> gym

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
recover faster and get back in the gym

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.880 
recover faster and get back in the gym
so<00:01:20.549> protein<00:01:21.299> really<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> must<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.560> your<00:01:22.590> diet

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
so protein really is a must in your diet

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.109 
so protein really is a must in your diet
and<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.159> need<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.400> be<00:01:23.520> eating<00:01:23.670> protein<00:01:23.970> with

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
and you need to be eating protein with

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.480 
and you need to be eating protein with
every<00:01:24.299> meal<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.810> every<00:01:24.960> snack<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.310> have

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
every meal and every snack that you have

every meal and every snack that you have
so<00:01:26.790> let's<00:01:27.299> look<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.540> little<00:01:27.750> bit<00:01:27.960> about<00:01:28.200> some<00:01:28.860> of

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
so let's look a little bit about some of

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.050 
so let's look a little bit about some of
the<00:01:29.040> protein<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.549> should<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.030> your

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the protein that you should have in your

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.300 
the protein that you should have in your
diet<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.990> first<00:01:31.200> protein<00:01:31.530> source<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:32.040> one

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
diet the first protein source is one

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.069 
diet the first protein source is one
that<00:01:32.460> usually<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.909> most<00:01:33.210> common<00:01:33.689> among<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
that usually is most common among the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.810 
that usually is most common among the
most<00:01:34.439> women<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.100> chicken<00:01:35.310> breasts

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
most women and it's chicken breasts

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.240 
most women and it's chicken breasts
chicken<00:01:36.180> breasts<00:01:36.450> are<00:01:36.509> lean<00:01:36.750> low<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.530> fat<00:01:37.740> they

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
chicken breasts are lean low in fat they

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.859 
chicken breasts are lean low in fat they
can<00:01:38.430> prepared<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.000> number<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.390> different<00:01:39.720> ways

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
can prepared a number of different ways

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.080 
can prepared a number of different ways
so<00:01:40.170> they're<00:01:40.890> one<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.340> should<00:01:41.369> add<00:01:41.820> into

contains iron and women also are usually
low<00:02:12.160> in<00:02:12.280> iron<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:12.760> iron<00:02:12.970> is<00:02:13.180> important

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
low in iron and iron is important

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.640 
low in iron and iron is important
because<00:02:13.750> you're<00:02:13.930> gonna<00:02:14.050> lose<00:02:14.319> some<00:02:14.560> each
