00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
injustice it was running 1080i and

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.430 
injustice it was running 1080i and
schoolgirls<00:00:56.149> I<00:00:56.360> believe<00:00:56.809> with<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.079> high<00:00:57.230> C

goes<00:00:57.590> to<00:00:57.620> 720p<00:00:58.610> so<00:00:59.420> when<00:00:59.600> you're<00:00:59.750> switching

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
goes to 720p so when you're switching

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.900 
goes to 720p so when you're switching
the<00:01:00.230> resolution<00:01:00.829> between<00:01:00.980> games<00:01:01.550> their

the resolution between games their

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.630 
the resolution between games their

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
device actually lose the signal and they

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.520 
device actually lose the signal and they
won't<00:01:04.879> find<00:01:05.210> it<00:01:05.390> again<00:01:05.689> as<00:01:05.960> you<00:01:06.110> can<00:01:06.170> see<00:01:06.290> right

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
for the video and I check it all the

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.880 
for the video and I check it all the
wires<00:04:08.690> will<00:04:08.840> correct<00:04:09.170> it<00:04:09.320> properly<00:04:09.650> which

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
wires will correct it properly which

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.039 
wires will correct it properly which
they<00:04:10.070> are<00:04:10.299> that's<00:04:11.299> it<00:04:11.510> right<00:04:11.630> now

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
they are that's it right now

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.259 
they are that's it right now
I<00:04:12.079> don't<00:04:12.920> know<00:04:13.010> why<00:04:13.220> it<00:04:13.280> does<00:04:13.549> this<00:04:13.579> but<00:04:14.000> it

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
I don't know why it does this but it

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:15.490 
I don't know why it does this but it
does<00:04:14.390> one<00:04:14.570> of<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:14.720> problems<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.079> encounter

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
does one of the problems I encounter

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.750 
does one of the problems I encounter
with<00:04:15.650> that<00:04:15.680> what<00:04:15.980> they<00:04:16.100> all<00:04:16.190> got<00:04:16.370> -<00:04:16.519> it<00:04:16.609> doesn't

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
with that what they all got - it doesn't

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.319 
with that what they all got - it doesn't
do<00:04:16.970> this<00:04:17.120> so<00:04:17.870> this<00:04:18.109> is<00:04:18.289> a<00:04:18.320> huge<00:04:18.650> dam<00:04:19.160> or<00:04:19.910> de<00:04:20.150> red

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
do this so this is a huge dam or de red

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.030 
do this so this is a huge dam or de red

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
now everything works perfectly fine

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.850 
now everything works perfectly fine
there's<00:04:33.870> nothing<00:04:34.110> wrong<00:04:34.260> with<00:04:34.320> it<00:04:34.590> every

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
there's nothing wrong with it every

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.500 
there's nothing wrong with it every
course<00:04:35.070> everything<00:04:35.460> fine<00:04:35.700> it<00:04:35.940> does<00:04:36.210> what<00:04:36.390> it's

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510

course everything fine it does what it's
supposed<00:04:36.540> to<00:04:36.810> do<00:04:37.050> if<00:04:37.230> it<00:04:38.040> doesn't<00:04:38.100> have<00:04:38.400> the

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
supposed to do if it doesn't have the

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.320 
supposed to do if it doesn't have the
shaking<00:04:38.850> screen<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.850> graphics<00:04:42.210> are

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
shaking screen and the graphics are

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.000 
shaking screen and the graphics are
perfectly<00:04:42.840> fine<00:04:42.990> like<00:04:43.230> they<00:04:43.350> should<00:04:43.560> normally

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
perfectly fine like they should normally

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.440

nothing<00:04:48.450> much<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.600> say<00:04:48.990> but<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.470> video<00:04:49.740> speaks

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
nothing much to say but the video speaks

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.830 
nothing much to say but the video speaks
for<00:04:50.070> itself

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840

elgato or they wear medium because they

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.080 
elgato or they wear medium because they
were<00:05:46.979> perfectly<00:05:47.460> fine<00:05:47.669> there's<00:05:47.970> nothing

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
were perfectly fine there's nothing

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.640 
were perfectly fine there's nothing
wrong<00:05:48.389> with<00:05:48.600> either<00:05:48.720> those<00:05:49.020> two<00:05:49.229> things<00:05:49.410> the

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
wrong with either those two things the

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.140 
wrong with either those two things the
only<00:05:49.740> reason<00:05:50.130> I<00:05:50.190> made<00:05:50.400> this<00:05:50.550> video<00:05:50.729> to<00:05:50.910> show

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
only reason I made this video to show

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.879 
only reason I made this video to show
you<00:05:51.210> the<00:05:51.360> comparison<00:05:51.720> between<00:05:52.169> the<00:05:52.500> AV

you the comparison between the AV

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.629 
you the comparison between the AV

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:30.389 
recording for their Elgato you actually

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:31.969 
recording for their Elgato you actually
could<00:06:30.539> record<00:06:30.780> PC<00:06:31.229> recording<00:06:31.650> world<00:06:31.830> or

could record PC recording world or

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.310 
could record PC recording world or
gateau<00:06:32.460> but<00:06:32.940> I<00:06:32.970> wasn't<00:06:33.180> really<00:06:33.479> meant<00:06:33.930> to<00:06:34.080> do

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
gateau but I wasn't really meant to do

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.370 
gateau but I wasn't really meant to do
that<00:06:34.349> because<00:06:34.800> the<00:06:35.430> other<00:06:35.610> option<00:06:36.080> it's<00:06:37.080> there

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
that because the other option it's there

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.830 
that because the other option it's there
for<00:06:37.620> you<00:06:37.710> to<00:06:37.830> record<00:06:38.039> a<00:06:38.160> PC<00:06:38.490> like<00:06:39.449> I<00:06:39.539> said<00:06:39.720> it

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
for you to record a PC like I said it

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.990 
for you to record a PC like I said it
was<00:06:39.960> not<00:06:40.110> really<00:06:40.259> meant<00:06:40.620> to<00:06:40.680> be<00:06:40.740> done<00:06:41.039> but<00:06:41.940> you

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
was not really meant to be done but you

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.149 
was not really meant to be done but you
could<00:06:42.360> do<00:06:42.479> it<00:06:42.630> I'm<00:06:43.320> not<00:06:43.530> gonna<00:06:43.740> bother<00:06:43.889> doing

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:44.159 
could do it I'm not gonna bother doing

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:45.950 
could do it I'm not gonna bother doing
it<00:06:44.370> because<00:06:44.669> there<00:06:44.820> was<00:06:44.849> now<00:06:45.120> really<00:06:45.360> one<00:06:45.840> of

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
it because there was now really one of

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.140 
it because there was now really one of
the<00:06:46.050> features<00:06:46.500> of<00:06:46.530> the<00:06:46.919> capture<00:06:47.250> core<00:06:47.460> but

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
the features of the capture core but

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.110 
the features of the capture core but
what<00:06:48.270> the<00:06:48.360> avermedia<00:06:49.370> does<00:06:50.370> it<00:06:50.760> tells<00:06:51.030> you

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
what the avermedia does it tells you

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.790 
what the avermedia does it tells you
right<00:06:51.150> there<00:06:51.270> after<00:06:51.659> that<00:06:51.690> logical<00:06:52.229> record<00:06:52.500> PC

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
right there after that logical record PC

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.810 
right there after that logical record PC
and<00:06:52.979> that<00:06:53.130> was<00:06:53.250> one<00:06:53.460> of<00:06:53.490> their<00:06:53.669> main
