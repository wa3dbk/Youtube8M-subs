00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:05.449
 Y 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.550
 or the one that we have the good tuberos 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:22.070
 Welcome to this new video tutorial 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.460
 in short lately I was not climbing 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.160
 many videos and updating the channel in 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.470
 have been asking me a lot 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.690
 links of many programs that I have been 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.170
 dropped the mediafire account click 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:39.410
 mediafire had to be in order that I'm going to 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.860
 update them I do not know when it 's very 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.650
 probable but very soon but I do not promise 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.020
 nothing in the end the case is that 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.140
 this is an authority and let's not talk about 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.390
 another thing without more 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.060
 Today I 'm going to show you how to update 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.610
 your windows 8 without the need for programs 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.420
 nor be accessing any kind of 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.340
 websites nor be looking at 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.310
 your own computer entering the 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.520
 controllers directly we're not going to 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.010
 use in this case windows update x 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.040
 windows update or windows update is the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.740
 automatic search engine of windows that is 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.340
 in which he updates us directly the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.860
 drivers updates windows 8 in 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.409
 the antivirus even and some programs 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.609
 what windows brings 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.110
 and that but we must take a lot into account 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:37.650
 what 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.050
 this could download us the windows like this 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.600
 that we are going to make some configurations 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.100
 very simple completely simple 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.680
 nothing of the product to be able to use this 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.780
 this type of update or 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.950
 non-web driver updates let's go 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.450
 to see how this is done first 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.900
 tell them that this works in windows 8 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.080
 and windows 7 I'm not too sure in the 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.760
 working windows xp and neither 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.390
 in the operation of windows seen 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.520
 so here we go first we're going to 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.540
 access control panel in this case 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:19.230
 I'm going to use windows 8 configuration panel 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.390
 Windows Update control suddenly 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.959
 windows 7 bring another name 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.300
 updates or I do not know but it's almost what 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.220
 same no and the interface is completely 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.350
 similar ok 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.900
 first let's go and change 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.300
 configuration clearly this we should 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.870
 do after even having 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.629
 formatted our computer 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.510
 we are not going to select this in this case 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.860
 this section that says look 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.200
 Update updates but 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.349
 allow me to choose if you want to download and 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:57.739
 install we put them select that 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:59.510
 that option and we can accept ready now 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.209
 done this let's look for the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.239
 updates this is going to take a 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.489
 little depends on the speed of 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.270
 our internet obviously for this is 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.210
 completely necessary internet 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.370
 and ready let's see 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.260
 and we are going to be able to install 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.820
 updates this obviously not what 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.160
 do not recommend it at all 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.720
 because they could is to create the program in 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.060
 this case we will have to select 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:31.220
 everything that has to do with windows 8 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.140
 with windows 8 we are going to deactivate the 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.170
 disable the in this case disable 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.569
 those windows 8 transitions because to 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.790
 Although this improves a bit and 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.220
 could fix some bugs errors of 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.800
 windows 8 or whatever version they have 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.780
 of windows he can download the 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.060
 program not since it has is there is some 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.599
 type of security in test I do not know that 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.519
 bring but the fact is that you run the 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.860
 risk that the program waits for you 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.390
 that's why we deactivate all kinds of 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.230
 update that has to do with 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.810
 windows 8 ok 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.200
 and other options would be the 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.290
 optional to me I do not get any to 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.250
 no update of drivers already 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:19.670
 that I have all obviously updated 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.190
 so I do not have any will not be a 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.650
 example but I'll make an example with 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.630
 the ned fragment that is giving me 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.480
 I also have an update on this 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.430
 case of this and this is a clear example 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.710
 that not only updates their drivers 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.650
 it also updates some programs 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.890
 needed for windows 8 ok 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.470
 so here we go for example here I have 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.470
 ok let's update the package 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.860
 codecs for the microsoft camera for 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:53.360
 windows 8 ok I have a camera and then 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:57.180
 when it is updated 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.820
 well let's install in this case that 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.850
 and we will go to install we select 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.100
 obviously this and installing this is going to 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.440
 delay depends on the speed of your 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.000
 Internet 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.960
 and we wait for it not to be installed 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.960
 obviously 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.130
 and in this way we are going to install 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.800
 our updates on windows 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.810
 update with only one previous windows 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.930
 we do not need need 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:31.100
 absolutely no bullshit this is 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.900
 very easy easy so do not forget 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.410
 leave the comments in the part of 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.990
 below any doubt I answer messages or 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.230
 whatever is subscribed for more videos in 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:45.820
 end that would be all for today 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.820
 like favorites and until next time
