old tutorials but um I never actually

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.760 
old tutorials but um I never actually
just<00:00:18.570> starting<00:00:18.810> guide<00:00:18.930> on<00:00:19.140> how<00:00:19.410> you're<00:00:19.619> really

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
just starting guide on how you're really

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.070 
just starting guide on how you're really
supposed<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.070> start<00:00:20.340> out<00:00:20.430> bolts<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.480> uh<00:00:21.510> yeah

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
supposed to start out bolts so uh yeah

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.650 
supposed to start out bolts so uh yeah
let's<00:00:22.350> just<00:00:22.500> say<00:00:22.680> uh<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:23.369> scenario<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.480> have<00:00:24.510> a

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
let's just say uh in scenario you have a

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.240 
let's just say uh in scenario you have a
house<00:00:24.869> going<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.439> started<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.800> fold<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.070> world

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
house going you started a fold to world

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.670 
house going you started a fold to world
and<00:00:26.519> yeah<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.119> got<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> nice<00:00:27.539> house<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.050> you

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
and yeah you got a nice house and you

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.929 
and yeah you got a nice house and you
got<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> pretty<00:00:29.099> good<00:00:29.220> amount<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.490> materials

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
got a pretty good amount of materials

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.640 
got a pretty good amount of materials
but<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.359> don't<00:00:30.900> understand<00:00:31.320> what<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.560> do

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
but you just don't understand what to do

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.060 
but you just don't understand what to do
with<00:00:31.740> bolts<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.910> will<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.630> showing<00:00:33.660> you

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
with bolts so I will be showing you

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.620 
with bolts so I will be showing you
pretty<00:00:35.070> much<00:00:35.219> basic<00:00:35.610> electricity<00:00:36.120> today<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
pretty much basic electricity today and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.319 
pretty much basic electricity today and
some<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.680> basic<00:00:37.800> things<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.370> bolts<00:00:38.790> so

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
some of the basic things of bolts so

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.670 
some of the basic things of bolts so
yeah<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.540> got<00:00:39.750> your<00:00:39.809> nice<00:00:39.989> little<00:00:40.260> house<00:00:40.350> here

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
yeah you got your nice little house here

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.860 
yeah you got your nice little house here
nothing<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.940> obviously<00:00:42.329> because<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.719> just

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
nothing in it obviously because I just

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.310 
nothing in it obviously because I just
built<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:43.829> any<00:00:44.010> way<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.430> nice

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
built this if any way you have a nice

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.560 
built this if any way you have a nice
experimentation<00:00:46.320> basement<00:00:47.030> where<00:00:48.030> I'll<00:00:48.420> be

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
experimentation basement where I'll be

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.479 
experimentation basement where I'll be
showing<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.989> what<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.500> do<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.309> first

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
showing you what to do so the first

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.979 
showing you what to do so the first
thing<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.090> need<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.539> electricity

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
thing that you can need is electricity

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.000 
thing that you can need is electricity
once<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.739> actually<00:00:53.160> get<00:00:53.489> bolts<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:55.010> for

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
once you actually get bolts and for

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.029 
once you actually get bolts and for
electricity<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.699> basic<00:00:57.120> most<00:00:57.890> efficient<00:00:58.890> way

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
electricity the basic most efficient way

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.060 
electricity the basic most efficient way
to<00:00:59.309> get<00:00:59.870> energy<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.500> beginning<00:01:01.620> when<00:01:02.010> you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
to get energy in the beginning when you

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.420 
to get energy in the beginning when you
first<00:01:02.250> start<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.820> coal<00:01:03.030> generator<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.430> this

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
first start is a coal generator and this

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.800 
first start is a coal generator and this
is<00:01:05.519> how<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.670> craft<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.060> coal<00:01:06.210> generator<00:01:06.600> it's

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
is how you craft a coal generator it's

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.149 
is how you craft a coal generator it's
steel<00:01:07.170> ingots<00:01:08.659> furnace<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.170> motor<00:01:10.409> now<00:01:11.130> uh

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
steel ingots furnace and a motor now uh

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.330 
steel ingots furnace and a motor now uh
this<00:01:11.939> all<00:01:12.150> might<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.510> new<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.840> um<00:01:13.340> steel

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
this all might be new to you um steel

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.960 
this all might be new to you um steel
you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:15.000> acquire<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.549> couple<00:01:17.549> different<00:01:17.820> ways

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
you can acquire a couple different ways

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.320 
you can acquire a couple different ways
actually<00:01:18.590> I<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:20.009> other<00:01:20.369> tutorials<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:21.119> that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
actually I have other tutorials for that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.060 
actually I have other tutorials for that
we're<00:01:21.930> now<00:01:22.049> we'll<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.380> doing<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> basic

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
we're now we'll just doing like a basic

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.190 
we're now we'll just doing like a basic
electricity<00:01:23.400> guide<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.659> yeah<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:24.990> want<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
electricity guide so yeah if you want to

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.810 
electricity guide so yeah if you want to
check<00:01:25.290> out<00:01:25.439> my<00:01:25.650> tutorial<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.580> see<00:01:26.790> how

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
check out my tutorial on that to see how

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.679 
check out my tutorial on that to see how
to<00:01:26.939> get<00:01:27.150> steel<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.799> motors<00:01:28.850> are<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.210> more

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
to get steel and motors are just more

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.039 
to get steel and motors are just more
steel<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.290> some<00:01:31.829> copper<00:01:32.130> wires<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.820> wires<00:01:33.750> is

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
steel and some copper wires and wires is

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.240 
steel and some copper wires and wires is
another<00:01:34.290> big<00:01:34.500> thing<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.070> how<00:01:35.189> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
another big thing so this is how you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.350 
another big thing so this is how you
craft<00:01:35.880> wires<00:01:36.270> wires<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.619> um<00:01:37.920> leather<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
craft wires wires is um leather on the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.440 
craft wires wires is um leather on the
sides<00:01:39.619> or<00:01:40.619> wool<00:01:40.979> on<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> sides<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.790> prefer<00:01:42.180> wool

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
sides or wool on the sides I prefer wool

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.149 
sides or wool on the sides I prefer wool
and<00:01:42.689> then<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.439> have<00:01:43.530> your<00:01:43.649> copper<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
and then you have your copper in the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.850 
and then you have your copper in the
middle<00:01:44.369> which<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.759> um<00:01:44.909> any<00:01:45.240> ingot<00:01:45.860> just

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
middle which is just um any ingot just

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.740 
middle which is just um any ingot just
like<00:01:47.009> any<00:01:47.159> other<00:01:47.310> ignant<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.850> have<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> copper

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
like any other ignant you have a copper

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.090 
like any other ignant you have a copper
which<00:01:48.990> is

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
which is

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.710 
which is
new<00:01:50.250> or<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.670> they<00:01:50.760> add<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.180> game<00:01:51.330> it

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
new or that they add to the game it

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.469 
new or that they add to the game it
looks<00:01:51.900> like<00:01:52.009> this<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.670> one<00:01:54.150> of<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.330> words

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
looks like this this is one of the words

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.630 
looks like this this is one of the words
that<00:01:54.659> they<00:01:54.780> had<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.320> looks<00:01:55.650> like<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.340> and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
that they had it looks like that and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.330 
that they had it looks like that and
then<00:01:57.600> yeah<00:01:57.780> that's<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.619> one<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.100> basic

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
then yeah that's a one of the basic

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.289 
then yeah that's a one of the basic
things<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.670> you're<00:01:59.759> gonna<00:01:59.850> need

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
things that you're gonna need

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.899 
things that you're gonna need
so<00:02:00.780> we'll<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.560> plop<00:02:02.009> these<00:02:02.220> down<00:02:02.460> our<00:02:02.640> cold

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
so we'll just plop these down our cold

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.289 
so we'll just plop these down our cold
generators<00:02:03.799> down<00:02:04.799> right<00:02:05.250> here<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.700> need<00:02:06.180> them

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
generators down right here we need them

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.699 
generators down right here we need them
to<00:02:06.450> face<00:02:07.039> backwards<00:02:09.050> place<00:02:10.050> pour<00:02:10.289> down<00:02:10.470> for

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
to face backwards place pour down for

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.650 
to face backwards place pour down for
right<00:02:10.830> now<00:02:11.000> break<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.120> wall<00:02:12.270> over<00:02:12.569> here

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
right now break the wall over here

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.640 
right now break the wall over here
because<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:12.989> actually<00:02:13.110> need<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.410> get<00:02:13.470> behind

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
because we actually need to get behind

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.160 
because we actually need to get behind
them<00:02:13.940> there<00:02:14.940> will<00:02:15.030> be<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.150> little<00:02:15.390> black<00:02:15.660> output

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
them there will be a little black output

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.910 
them there will be a little black output
where<00:02:16.739> we<00:02:16.920> can<00:02:17.100> get<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.420> electricity<00:02:18.989> so<00:02:19.620> make

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
where we can get the electricity so make

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.979 
where we can get the electricity so make
a<00:02:20.090> wall<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.120> little<00:02:21.300> bit<00:02:21.510> out<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.660> little<00:02:21.810> bit

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
a wall a little bit out a little bit

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.229 
a wall a little bit out a little bit
more<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.680> then<00:02:23.040> yet<00:02:23.250> as<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.790> can<00:02:23.910> see<00:02:24.000> there's

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
more and then yet as you can see there's

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.110 
more and then yet as you can see there's
these<00:02:24.390> black<00:02:25.370> hexagons<00:02:26.370> because<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.760> texture

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
these black hexagons because the texture

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.340 
these black hexagons because the texture
fact<00:02:27.300> I'm<00:02:27.450> using<00:02:27.630> but<00:02:27.810> they<00:02:27.900> might<00:02:28.050> be<00:02:28.170> just

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
fact I'm using but they might be just

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.350 
fact I'm using but they might be just
circles<00:02:28.709> or<00:02:28.980> squares<00:02:29.160> this<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.150> where<00:02:30.269> you

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
circles or squares this is where you

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.410 
circles or squares this is where you
actually<00:02:30.420> gonna<00:02:30.660> connect<00:02:30.959> up<00:02:31.140> your<00:02:31.170> wire<00:02:32.420> so

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
actually gonna connect up your wire so

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.650 
actually gonna connect up your wire so
we'll<00:02:33.750> bring<00:02:33.900> our<00:02:34.080> wire<00:02:34.230> out<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.830> then<00:02:35.760> uh<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
we'll bring our wire out and then uh the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.490 
we'll bring our wire out and then uh the
next<00:02:36.870> thing<00:02:36.930> you're<00:02:37.140> gonna<00:02:37.200> need<00:02:37.319> is<00:02:37.440> a

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
next thing you're gonna need is a

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.900 
next thing you're gonna need is a
battery<00:02:37.860> box<00:02:38.010> this<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.340> where<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.519> can<00:02:38.640> store

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
battery box this is where you can store

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.530 
battery box this is where you can store
your<00:02:38.970> energy<00:02:40.280> you<00:02:41.280> know<00:02:41.370> keep<00:02:41.549> so<00:02:42.269> we<00:02:42.390> have

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
your energy you know keep so we have

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.360 
your energy you know keep so we have
more<00:02:43.170> steel<00:02:43.470> sides<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:43.860> can<00:02:43.950> see<00:02:44.069> you<00:02:44.160> need

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
more steel sides you can see you need

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.580 
more steel sides you can see you need
lots<00:02:44.610> of<00:02:44.700> steel<00:02:45.000> for<00:02:45.180> this<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.540> also<00:02:46.410> some

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
lots of steel for this and also some

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.100 
lots of steel for this and also some
batteries<00:02:47.030> batteries<00:02:48.030> are<00:02:48.239> just<00:02:48.480> ten<00:02:48.690> ingots

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
batteries batteries are just ten ingots

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.840 
batteries batteries are just ten ingots
which<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.530> another<00:02:49.799> or<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.010> can<00:02:50.400> be<00:02:50.459> mined<00:02:50.670> up

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
which is another or that can be mined up

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.270 
which is another or that can be mined up
regular<00:02:51.840> coal<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.260> regular<00:02:52.590> redstone<00:02:52.980> so

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
regular coal and regular redstone so

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.460 
regular coal and regular redstone so
that's<00:02:53.580> not<00:02:53.880> too<00:02:54.090> challenging<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.870> then

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
that's not too challenging and then

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.800 
that's not too challenging and then
we'll<00:02:55.650> plop<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:56.010> down<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:57.470> for<00:02:58.470> this<00:02:59.600> you<00:03:00.600> can

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
we'll plop that down so for this you can

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.740 
we'll plop that down so for this you can
as<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:01.620> can<00:03:01.769> see<00:03:01.890> black<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.400> out<00:03:02.579> so<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.720> next

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
as you can see black is out so the next

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.030 
as you can see black is out so the next
thing<00:03:04.110> that<00:03:04.140> you're<00:03:04.350> going<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.530> need<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.890> a

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
thing that you're going to need is a

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.840 
thing that you're going to need is a
wrench<00:03:05.510> wrenches<00:03:06.510> are<00:03:06.690> pretty<00:03:07.109> important<00:03:07.530> but

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
wrench wrenches are pretty important but

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.599 
wrench wrenches are pretty important but
very<00:03:08.850> expensive<00:03:09.090> if<00:03:09.480> you're<00:03:09.600> just<00:03:09.750> starting

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
very expensive if you're just starting

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.729 
very expensive if you're just starting
the<00:03:11.609> recipe<00:03:11.880> for<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.329> to<00:03:12.600> steel<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.140> the

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
the recipe for this is to steel and the

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.620 
the recipe for this is to steel and the
diamond<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.700> would<00:03:15.060> actually<00:03:15.390> recommend

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
diamond so I would actually recommend

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.330 
diamond so I would actually recommend
not<00:03:15.900> using<00:03:15.959> these<00:03:16.260> for<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.530> beginning<00:03:16.799> and

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
not using these for the beginning and

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.830 
not using these for the beginning and
try<00:03:17.609> to<00:03:17.700> place<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.060> down<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.269> right<00:03:18.420> way<00:03:18.600> just

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
try to place it down the right way just

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.990 
try to place it down the right way just
angle<00:03:19.590> yourself<00:03:19.859> differently<00:03:20.160> but<00:03:20.640> for<00:03:20.700> right

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
angle yourself differently but for right

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.240 
angle yourself differently but for right
now<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.209> will<00:03:21.630> just<00:03:21.660> put<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.109> red<00:03:22.320> that<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.070> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
now I will just put the red that is the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.640 
now I will just put the red that is the
input<00:03:23.760> this<00:03:24.329> is<00:03:24.510> very<00:03:24.720> important<00:03:25.260> black<00:03:25.500> is

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
input this is very important black is

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.729 
input this is very important black is
output<00:03:26.040> Brenna's<00:03:26.700> input<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:27.810> yeah<00:03:28.410> all<00:03:28.620> you

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
output Brenna's input so yeah all you

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.340 
output Brenna's input so yeah all you
got<00:03:28.859> to<00:03:28.920> do<00:03:28.980> for<00:03:29.010> these<00:03:29.310> is<00:03:29.549> um<00:03:29.959> plop<00:03:30.959> down<00:03:31.140> some

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
got to do for these is um plop down some

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.770 
got to do for these is um plop down some
:<00:03:31.680> them<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:31.980> they<00:03:32.130> will<00:03:32.280> generate<00:03:32.640> 120<00:03:33.480> volts

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
: them and they will generate 120 volts

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.750 
: them and they will generate 120 volts
that<00:03:33.989> is<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.230> lowest<00:03:34.620> form<00:03:34.799> of<00:03:34.950> voltage<00:03:35.310> in

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
that is the lowest form of voltage in

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.390 
that is the lowest form of voltage in
volts<00:03:36.019> and<00:03:37.019> we<00:03:37.290> got<00:03:37.410> some<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.680> their<00:03:37.890> will<00:03:38.160> plop

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
volts and we got some of their will plop

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.200 
volts and we got some of their will plop
some<00:03:38.579> down<00:03:38.790> there

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
some down there

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.060 
some down there
there<00:03:41.170> and<00:03:42.100> then<00:03:42.370> lastly<00:03:42.730> there<00:03:43.060> so<00:03:43.960> um<00:03:44.200> as<00:03:44.890> you

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
there and then lastly there so um as you

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.830 
there and then lastly there so um as you
can<00:03:45.130> see<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.490> heat<00:03:45.700> percentage<00:03:46.150> is<00:03:46.330> going<00:03:46.570> up

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
can see the heat percentage is going up

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.090 
can see the heat percentage is going up
and<00:03:47.320> once<00:03:47.470> that<00:03:47.560> gets<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.770> hundred<00:03:48.040> percent

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
and once that gets a hundred percent

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.570 
and once that gets a hundred percent
it'll<00:03:48.640> be<00:03:48.910> producing<00:03:49.420> 120<00:03:50.260> volts<00:03:50.590> per<00:03:51.010> second

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
it'll be producing 120 volts per second

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.640 
it'll be producing 120 volts per second
and<00:03:52.270> as<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:52.840> can<00:03:52.930> see<00:03:52.990> this<00:03:53.230> is<00:03:53.380> starting<00:03:53.620> to

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
and as you can see this is starting to

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.550 
and as you can see this is starting to
fill<00:03:53.890> up<00:03:53.920> this<00:03:54.550> will<00:03:54.820> fill<00:03:55.270> up<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.720> four<00:03:56.260> mega

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
fill up this will fill up to four mega

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.060 
fill up this will fill up to four mega
joules<00:03:56.800> and<00:03:57.040> if<00:03:57.580> you<00:03:57.700> do<00:03:57.850> try<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.210> take<00:03:59.050> out<00:03:59.290> any

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
joules and if you do try to take out any

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.730 
joules and if you do try to take out any
uh<00:04:00.450> any<00:04:01.450> electricity<00:04:02.050> from<00:04:02.170> this<00:04:02.350> it<00:04:02.530> would<00:04:02.710> be

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
uh any electricity from this it would be

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.520 
uh any electricity from this it would be
in<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.490> form<00:04:03.730> of<00:04:03.880> 120<00:04:04.630> volts<00:04:04.900> as<00:04:05.050> you<00:04:05.290> can<00:04:05.410> see

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
in the form of 120 volts as you can see

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.690 
in the form of 120 volts as you can see
it<00:04:05.650> says<00:04:05.800> under<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.730> red<00:04:06.880> bar<00:04:07.090> voltage<00:04:07.750> 120

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
it says under the red bar voltage 120

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.370 
it says under the red bar voltage 120
and<00:04:09.700> yeah<00:04:09.850> that's<00:04:10.030> basically<00:04:10.150> it<00:04:10.570> for<00:04:10.600> basic

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
and yeah that's basically it for basic

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.770 
and yeah that's basically it for basic
electricity<00:04:11.740> there<00:04:12.250> are<00:04:12.460> many<00:04:13.210> ways<00:04:13.450> to<00:04:13.510> get

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
electricity there are many ways to get

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.220 
electricity there are many ways to get
electricity<00:04:14.640> most<00:04:15.640> of<00:04:15.850> them<00:04:15.940> are<00:04:16.090> actually

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
electricity most of them are actually

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.530 
electricity most of them are actually
nuclear<00:04:17.230> others<00:04:18.130> like<00:04:18.370> solar<00:04:18.640> generators<00:04:19.330> and

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
nuclear others like solar generators and

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.410 
nuclear others like solar generators and
solar<00:04:19.780> power<00:04:19.989> those<00:04:20.410> are<00:04:20.970> those<00:04:21.970> are<00:04:22.030> not

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
solar power those are those are not

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.980 
solar power those are those are not
nuclear

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
nuclear

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.660 
nuclear
so<00:04:23.380> key<00:04:23.530> generators<00:04:24.010> but<00:04:24.220> yeah<00:04:24.370> I<00:04:24.400> have<00:04:24.640> a

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
so key generators but yeah I have a

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.100 
so key generators but yeah I have a
whole<00:04:24.850> bunch<00:04:25.060> other<00:04:25.150> tutorials<00:04:25.750> on<00:04:25.870> how<00:04:26.050> to

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
whole bunch other tutorials on how to

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.810 
whole bunch other tutorials on how to
use<00:04:26.320> those<00:04:26.500> things<00:04:26.560> make<00:04:27.310> sure<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:27.520> check<00:04:27.670> them

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
use those things make sure to check them

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.810 
use those things make sure to check them
out<00:04:27.940> but<00:04:28.780> yeah<00:04:29.560> then<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.220> last<00:04:30.370> thing<00:04:30.550> I<00:04:30.640> want

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
out but yeah then the last thing I want

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.510 
out but yeah then the last thing I want
to<00:04:30.910> go<00:04:30.970> over<00:04:31.270> is<00:04:31.480> the<00:04:31.690> stone<00:04:31.990> axel<00:04:32.470> this<00:04:33.400> is

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
to go over is the stone axel this is

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.690 
to go over is the stone axel this is
just<00:04:33.700> um<00:04:33.910> a<00:04:34.470> different<00:04:35.470> tool<00:04:35.680> that<00:04:35.980> volts<00:04:36.580> has

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
just um a different tool that volts has

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.590 
just um a different tool that volts has
bring<00:04:37.200> volts<00:04:38.200> brings<00:04:38.440> to<00:04:38.650> us<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:39.090> it<00:04:40.090> is<00:04:40.300> just

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
bring volts brings to us and it is just

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.530 
bring volts brings to us and it is just
stone<00:04:40.840> shovel<00:04:41.110> stone<00:04:41.950> pickaxe<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.330> stone

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
stone shovel stone pickaxe and the stone

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.180 
stone shovel stone pickaxe and the stone
axe<00:04:43.720> but<00:04:43.900> this<00:04:43.990> can<00:04:44.200> be<00:04:44.290> for<00:04:44.440> any<00:04:44.620> material

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
axe but this can be for any material

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.250 
axe but this can be for any material
whatsoever<00:04:45.340> and<00:04:45.820> two<00:04:46.510> sticks<00:04:46.720> in<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.050> middle

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
whatsoever and two sticks in the middle

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.860 
whatsoever and two sticks in the middle
and<00:04:47.410> that'll<00:04:47.620> give<00:04:47.710> us<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:47.950> stone<00:04:48.190> axel

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
and that'll give us a stone axel

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.080 
and that'll give us a stone axel
honestly<00:04:49.870> I<00:04:50.380> don't<00:04:51.130> really<00:04:51.520> like<00:04:51.820> them<00:04:51.940> too

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
honestly I don't really like them too

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.660 
honestly I don't really like them too
much<00:04:52.320> because<00:04:53.320> um<00:04:53.710> they<00:04:54.070> actually<00:04:54.250> have<00:04:54.580> the

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
much because um they actually have the

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.150 
much because um they actually have the
same<00:04:54.850> durability<00:04:55.420> as<00:04:55.600> a<00:04:55.630> regular<00:04:56.440> pickaxe<00:04:56.920> or

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
same durability as a regular pickaxe or

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.730 
same durability as a regular pickaxe or
any<00:04:57.640> tool<00:04:58.060> which<00:04:58.720> is<00:04:58.960> uh<00:04:58.990> for<00:04:59.470> the<00:04:59.530> in<00:04:59.620> this

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
any tool which is uh for the in this

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.300 
any tool which is uh for the in this
case<00:04:59.800> and<00:05:00.220> it's<00:05:00.340> 131<00:05:01.120> so<00:05:01.690> say<00:05:01.960> I<00:05:01.990> mined<00:05:02.530> 131

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
case and it's 131 so say I mined 131

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.530 
case and it's 131 so say I mined 131
blocks<00:05:03.550> with<00:05:03.730> this<00:05:03.850> it<00:05:04.030> would<00:05:04.180> be<00:05:04.360> destroyed

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
blocks with this it would be destroyed

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:11.100 
blocks with this it would be destroyed
when<00:05:05.820> if<00:05:06.820> you<00:05:07.060> mind<00:05:07.390> up<00:05:07.660> say<00:05:09.690> 131<00:05:10.690> blocks<00:05:10.930> with

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
when if you mind up say 131 blocks with

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.170 
when if you mind up say 131 blocks with
the<00:05:11.140> pickaxe<00:05:11.530> you<00:05:11.800> would<00:05:12.280> still<00:05:12.520> have<00:05:12.550> the

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
the pickaxe you would still have the

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.830 
the pickaxe you would still have the
shovel<00:05:13.660> and<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:14.740> axe<00:05:15.040> left<00:05:15.490> over<00:05:15.850> so<00:05:16.660> yeah

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
shovel and the axe left over so yeah

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.870 
shovel and the axe left over so yeah
anyway<00:05:17.320> what<00:05:17.830> this<00:05:18.010> does<00:05:18.220> it's<00:05:18.460> basically<00:05:18.760> a

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
anyway what this does it's basically a

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.200 
anyway what this does it's basically a
three<00:05:19.180> in<00:05:19.300> one<00:05:19.330> thing<00:05:20.080> it<00:05:20.320> can<00:05:20.530> mine<00:05:20.970> dirt<00:05:21.970> as

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
three in one thing it can mine dirt as

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.010 
three in one thing it can mine dirt as
you<00:05:22.360> just<00:05:22.540> saw<00:05:22.690> right<00:05:22.750> there

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
you just saw right there

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.860 
you just saw right there
it<00:05:23.710> come<00:05:23.890> on<00:05:24.010> stone<00:05:24.340> and<00:05:24.370> it<00:05:24.820> can<00:05:25.000> also<00:05:25.510> mine

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
it come on stone and it can also mine

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.040 
it come on stone and it can also mine
wood<00:05:26.680> if<00:05:27.610> I<00:05:27.790> just<00:05:28.060> grab<00:05:28.390> some<00:05:28.660> wood<00:05:28.870> out<00:05:29.020> of

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
wood if I just grab some wood out of

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.280 
wood if I just grab some wood out of
here

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
here

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.650 
here
so<00:05:31.920> it<00:05:32.220> can<00:05:32.490> it<00:05:32.670> works<00:05:32.850> this<00:05:32.940> an<00:05:33.090> axe<00:05:33.300> also

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
so it can it works this an axe also

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.430 
so it can it works this an axe also
that's<00:05:33.930> as<00:05:34.440> you<00:05:34.590> saw<00:05:34.890> that<00:05:34.920> was<00:05:35.130> in<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.370> recipe

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
that's as you saw that was in the recipe

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.830 
that's as you saw that was in the recipe
and<00:05:37.440> we'll<00:05:37.650> just<00:05:37.770> pop<00:05:38.100> that<00:05:38.130> down<00:05:38.310> there<00:05:38.840> and

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
and we'll just pop that down there and

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.660 
and we'll just pop that down there and
it<00:05:40.290> can<00:05:40.470> mine<00:05:40.680> that's<00:05:40.860> pretty<00:05:41.070> fast<00:05:41.280> so<00:05:41.430> yeah

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:41.670 
it can mine that's pretty fast so yeah

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.420 
it can mine that's pretty fast so yeah
it's<00:05:41.820> just<00:05:41.910> a<00:05:42.060> three<00:05:42.270> in<00:05:42.360> one<00:05:42.570> and<00:05:42.600> obviously

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
it's just a three in one and obviously

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.340 
it's just a three in one and obviously
if<00:05:44.430> you<00:05:44.640> make<00:05:44.820> it<00:05:45.000> with<00:05:45.120> a<00:05:45.150> more<00:05:45.960> costly

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
if you make it with a more costly

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.990 
if you make it with a more costly
material<00:05:46.890> such<00:05:47.070> as<00:05:47.100> diamonds<00:05:47.430> it'll<00:05:47.910> go

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
material such as diamonds it'll go

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.660 
material such as diamonds it'll go
faster<00:05:48.510> but<00:05:49.230> yeah<00:05:49.500> anyway<00:05:49.980> this<00:05:50.130> is<00:05:50.310> just<00:05:50.550> a

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 
faster but yeah anyway this is just a

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
faster but yeah anyway this is just a
short<00:05:51.120> tutorial<00:05:51.720> on<00:05:51.930> basic<00:05:52.590> electricity<00:05:53.250> and

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
short tutorial on basic electricity and

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.200 
short tutorial on basic electricity and
the<00:05:54.690> stone<00:05:54.960> Paxil<00:05:55.560> so<00:05:55.950> yeah<00:05:56.550> make<00:05:57.030> sure<00:05:57.060> to
