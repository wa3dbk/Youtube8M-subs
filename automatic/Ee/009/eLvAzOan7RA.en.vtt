00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.760 
why I did that but anyway let's go on to
review<00:01:47.409> here<00:01:47.969> this<00:01:48.969> guy<00:01:49.179> is<00:01:49.210> a<00:01:49.840> little<00:01:50.079> tank<00:01:50.499> in

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
review here this guy is a little tank in

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.969 
review here this guy is a little tank in
my<00:01:50.829> opinion<00:01:51.630> for<00:01:52.630> what<00:01:52.810> you<00:01:52.929> get<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.740> weight

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
my opinion for what you get the weight

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.069 
my opinion for what you get the weight
of<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.249> knife<00:01:54.399> I<00:01:54.729> found<00:01:55.270> how<00:01:55.329> small<00:01:55.600> just<00:01:55.899> five

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
of the knife I found how small just five

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.080 
of the knife I found how small just five
points<00:01:56.259> three<00:01:56.499> ounces<00:01:56.710> in<00:01:57.520> my<00:01:57.670> opinion<00:01:57.999> really

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
points three ounces in my opinion really

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.349 
points three ounces in my opinion really
isn't<00:01:58.479> that<00:01:58.600> heavy<00:01:59.219> for<00:02:00.219> a<00:02:00.249> pocket<00:02:00.729> knife<00:02:00.939> but

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
isn't that heavy for a pocket knife but

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.359 
isn't that heavy for a pocket knife but
for<00:02:01.539> how<00:02:01.630> small<00:02:01.689> it<00:02:02.049> is<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.289> it<00:02:02.799> kind<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.219> is

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
for how small it is it it kind of is

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.450 
for how small it is it it kind of is
when<00:02:03.969> you<00:02:04.090> have<00:02:04.299> for<00:02:04.600> instance<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:05.049> rat<00:02:05.460> 1/4

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
when you have for instance the rat 1/4

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.320 
when you have for instance the rat 1/4
here<00:02:06.909> that's<00:02:07.450> just<00:02:07.810> 5<00:02:07.990> ounces<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:09.520> know<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:09.880> lot

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
here that's just 5 ounces you know a lot

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.150 
here that's just 5 ounces you know a lot
bigger<00:02:10.600> a<00:02:10.929> lot<00:02:11.200> longer<00:02:11.350> blade<00:02:11.800> a<00:02:11.830> lot<00:02:12.040> longer

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
bigger a lot longer blade a lot longer

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.200 
bigger a lot longer blade a lot longer
handle<00:02:12.990> but<00:02:13.990> still<00:02:14.350> within<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:16.180> same<00:02:16.450> weight

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
handle but still within the same weight

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.630 
handle but still within the same weight
so<00:02:19.210> that's<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.510> little<00:02:19.690> bit<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:21.040> downside<00:02:21.250> is

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
so that's a little bit of a downside is

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.730 
so that's a little bit of a downside is
the<00:02:21.790> weight<00:02:21.940> for<00:02:22.210> such<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.390> small<00:02:22.630> knife<00:02:22.840> you

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
the weight for such a small knife you

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.980 
the weight for such a small knife you
get<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.130> because<00:02:24.460> of<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.760> handles<00:02:25.150> which

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
get that because of the handles which

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.600 
get that because of the handles which
are<00:02:26.230> two<00:02:26.740> sides<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.420> aluminum<00:02:28.769> which<00:02:29.769> are<00:02:29.950> very

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
are two sides of aluminum which are very

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.949 
are two sides of aluminum which are very
nice<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:30.940> very<00:02:31.090> comfortable<00:02:31.450> they<00:02:31.720> have<00:02:31.780> this

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
nice and very comfortable they have this

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.320 
nice and very comfortable they have this
very<00:02:32.200> smooth<00:02:32.590> texture<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.459> them

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
very smooth texture to them

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.840 
very smooth texture to them
which<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.500> lot<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.710> people<00:02:35.860> will<00:02:36.280> say<00:02:36.490> well<00:02:36.700> you

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
which a lot of people will say well you

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.670 
which a lot of people will say well you
know<00:02:37.090> I<00:02:37.150> like<00:02:37.300> my<00:02:37.360> knife<00:02:37.630> with<00:02:37.840> texturing<00:02:38.620> on

stud pretty cool I'm praying genius not

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.360 
stud pretty cool I'm praying genius not
really<00:03:49.990> sure<00:03:50.260> how<00:03:50.560> much<00:03:50.709> I<00:03:50.860> wasn't<00:03:51.190> going<00:03:51.310> to

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
really sure how much I wasn't going to

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.190 
really sure how much I wasn't going to
take<00:03:51.490> this<00:03:51.610> apart<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:52.150> trying<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.900> figure<00:03:53.050> out

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
take this apart and trying to figure out

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.199 
take this apart and trying to figure out
how<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.590> works<00:03:53.830> but<00:03:54.130> I<00:03:54.160> did<00:03:54.490> notice<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:54.850> the

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
how it works but I did notice that the

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.660 
how it works but I did notice that the
torsion<00:03:55.660> bar<00:03:55.900> if<00:03:56.170> you<00:03:56.290> look<00:03:56.530> inside<00:03:56.860> the

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
torsion bar if you look inside the

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.240 
torsion bar if you look inside the
handle<00:03:58.120> is<00:03:58.300> up<00:03:58.990> along<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.410> spine<00:03:59.770> here<00:04:00.070> and

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
handle is up along the spine here and

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.910 
handle is up along the spine here and
I'm<00:04:00.730> guessing<00:04:01.240> that's<00:04:01.360> how<00:04:01.630> you<00:04:02.350> can<00:04:02.530> actuate

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
I'm guessing that's how you can actuate

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.080 
I'm guessing that's how you can actuate
it<00:04:03.310> on<00:04:03.730> or<00:04:03.910> off<00:04:04.470> most<00:04:05.470> of<00:04:05.830> the<00:04:06.010> kershel<00:04:06.910> knives

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
it on or off most of the kershel knives

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.850 
it on or off most of the kershel knives
that<00:04:07.240> have<00:04:07.300> this<00:04:07.420> piece<00:04:07.600> a<00:04:07.690> set<00:04:07.930> speed<00:04:08.590> safe

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
that have this piece a set speed safe

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.030 
that have this piece a set speed safe
assisted<00:04:09.220> opening<00:04:09.510> has<00:04:10.510> it<00:04:10.720> inset<00:04:11.620> in<00:04:11.800> the

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
assisted opening has it inset in the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.949 
assisted opening has it inset in the
liner<00:04:13.410> so<00:04:14.410> a<00:04:14.440> little<00:04:14.740> bit<00:04:14.830> of<00:04:14.920> a<00:04:14.980> change<00:04:15.130> there

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
liner so a little bit of a change there

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.180 
liner so a little bit of a change there
now<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.020> pocket<00:04:17.380> clip<00:04:17.500> on<00:04:17.680> this<00:04:17.770> knife<00:04:17.980> I<00:04:18.130> know

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190

with it yes I would like it a little bit

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.280 
with it yes I would like it a little bit
