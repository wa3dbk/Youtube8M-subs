would do Bannock some people cook
Bannock<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:59.050> way<00:02:59.170> and<00:03:00.099> then<00:03:00.819> add<00:03:01.060> the

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.170 
we realized we don't have way to cook
the<00:03:59.390> bacon<00:03:59.510> so<00:03:59.930> we<00:04:00.079> took<00:04:00.230> a<00:04:00.790> familiar<00:04:01.790> method

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
the bacon so we took a familiar method

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.759 
the bacon so we took a familiar method
of<00:04:02.769> twirling<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:03.890> bacon<00:04:04.220> but<00:04:04.849> with<00:04:05.000> a<00:04:05.030> twist

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
of twirling the bacon but with a twist

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.729 
of twirling the bacon but with a twist
they<00:04:06.769> each<00:04:06.859> have<00:04:07.040> a<00:04:07.129> hanger<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:08.590> this<00:04:09.590> way

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
they each have a hanger and this way

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.830 
they each have a hanger and this way
they<00:04:09.920> can<00:04:09.950> drip<00:04:10.819> down<00:04:11.030> if<00:04:11.450> anyone<00:04:11.720> was

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
they can drip down if anyone was

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.630 
they can drip down if anyone was
wondering<00:04:11.930> how<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:12.349> get<00:04:12.769> them<00:04:12.950> secured<00:04:13.430> I

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
wondering how to get them secured I

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.719 
wondering how to get them secured I
coiled<00:04:14.420> them<00:04:14.540> from<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:14.870> bottom<00:04:15.200> up<00:04:15.549> this<00:04:16.549> way

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
coiled them from the bottom up this way

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.360 
coiled them from the bottom up this way
it<00:04:16.850> would<00:04:16.940> kind<00:04:17.180> of<00:04:17.239> lock<00:04:17.419> itself<00:04:17.750> into<00:04:18.109> place

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
it would kind of lock itself into place

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.719 
it would kind of lock itself into place
but<00:04:19.370> uh<00:04:19.400> yeah<00:04:21.100> cooking<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.190> woods<00:04:22.370> is<00:04:22.490> fun

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
but uh yeah cooking the woods is fun

jalapenos and cheese and bacon so this

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.860 
jalapenos and cheese and bacon so this
is<00:04:42.979> a<00:04:43.780> banach<00:04:44.780> Pizza<00:04:45.110> number<00:04:45.410> two<00:04:45.610> we<00:04:46.870> decided

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
is a banach Pizza number two we decided

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.690 
is a banach Pizza number two we decided
to<00:04:48.110> make<00:04:48.260> it<00:04:48.289> a<00:04:48.440> little<00:04:48.590> bit<00:04:48.830> thicker<00:04:49.340> this

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
to make it a little bit thicker this

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.900 
to make it a little bit thicker this
time<00:04:49.970> and<00:04:50.560> change<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.889> angle<00:04:52.460> that<00:04:52.580> we<00:04:52.639> have

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
time and change the angle that we have

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.779 
time and change the angle that we have
the<00:04:53.120> rock<00:04:53.300> more<00:04:53.720> like<00:04:54.050> a<00:04:54.139> 45<00:04:54.470> degree<00:04:54.800> angle<00:04:54.979> so

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
the rock more like a 45 degree angle so

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.520 
the rock more like a 45 degree angle so
that<00:04:55.820> the<00:04:56.150> middle<00:04:56.510> would<00:04:56.690> cook<00:04:57.169> a<00:04:57.289> little<00:04:57.440> bit

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
that the middle would cook a little bit

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.990 
that the middle would cook a little bit
more<00:04:57.830> and<00:04:58.070> as<00:04:59.080> you<00:05:00.080> can<00:05:00.260> see<00:05:00.289> is<00:05:00.800> much<00:05:01.729> better

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
more and as you can see is much better

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.180 
more and as you can see is much better
it's<00:05:02.240> been<00:05:02.419> in<00:05:02.539> there<00:05:02.690> for<00:05:02.990> probably<00:05:03.680> less

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
it's been in there for probably less

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.330 
it's been in there for probably less
than<00:05:04.220> 10<00:05:04.910> minutes<00:05:05.150> already<00:05:05.539> and<00:05:05.690> now<00:05:06.530> we'll

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
than 10 minutes already and now we'll

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.460 
than 10 minutes already and now we'll
put<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.669> toppings<00:05:08.090> on<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:08.539> it<00:05:08.630> should<00:05:09.289> be

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
put the toppings on and it should be

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.890 
put the toppings on and it should be
done<00:05:10.099> by<00:05:10.130> the<00:05:10.400> time<00:05:10.490> those<00:05:10.849> cook<00:05:11.389> on<00:05:11.570> there<00:05:11.750> for

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
done by the time those cook on there for

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.409 
done by the time those cook on there for
a<00:05:11.960> while<00:05:12.110> so<00:05:12.729> definitely<00:05:13.729> much<00:05:13.970> better<00:05:14.000> this

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
a while so definitely much better this

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:20.950 
a while so definitely much better this
