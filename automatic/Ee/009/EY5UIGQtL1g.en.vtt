guys can do it I think where Kobe for me
hasn't<00:01:38.970> came<00:01:39.329> tough<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.659> little<00:01:39.900> bit<00:01:40.020> shorter

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
hasn't came tough a little bit shorter

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.410 
hasn't came tough a little bit shorter
than<00:01:40.500> Jordan<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.549> leadership<00:01:42.030> role

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
than Jordan is in the leadership role

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.389 
than Jordan is in the leadership role
Kobe<00:01:42.990> has<00:01:43.140> grown<00:01:43.380> into<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.220> hasn't

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
Kobe has grown into that but it hasn't

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.950 
Kobe has grown into that but it hasn't
been<00:01:44.549> easy<00:01:44.610> for<00:01:45.000> him<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.210> was<00:01:45.329> always<00:01:45.509> natural

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
been easy for him it was always natural

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.600 
been easy for him it was always natural
for<00:01:46.140> Jordan<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.560> take<00:01:46.890> over<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.189> team<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.520> say

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
for Jordan to take over a team and say

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.520 
for Jordan to take over a team and say
you<00:01:47.670> go<00:01:47.970> here<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.240> go<00:01:48.390> here<00:01:48.570> he'd<00:01:49.200> reduced

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
you go here you go here he'd reduced

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.440 
you go here you go here he'd reduced
some<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.770> his<00:01:49.920> own<00:01:50.040> teammates<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.610> tears<00:01:50.970> to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
some of his own teammates to tears to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.300 
some of his own teammates to tears to
get<00:01:51.570> his<00:01:51.720> point<00:01:52.020> across<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.560> didn't<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.070> don't

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
get his point across I didn't I don't

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.789 
get his point across I didn't I don't
think<00:01:53.369> Kobe<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.939> natural<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.020> leader<00:01:55.500> as

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
think Kobe is natural a leader as

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.010 
think Kobe is natural a leader as
Michael<00:01:56.399> Jordan<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.329> guess<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.840> puts

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
Michael Jordan was so I guess that puts

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.260 
Michael Jordan was so I guess that puts
them<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.619> little<00:01:58.649> bit<00:01:59.189> below<00:01:59.340> each<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.149> you

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
them just a little bit below each of you

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.850 
them just a little bit below each of you
had<00:02:00.420> them<00:02:00.540> better<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.899> at<00:02:01.020> least<00:02:01.170> one<00:02:01.500> category

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
had them better in at least one category

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.800 
had them better in at least one category
but<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.579> couldn't<00:02:02.880> go<00:02:03.000> all<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.329> way<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.509> make

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
but you couldn't go all the way and make

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.590 
but you couldn't go all the way and make
them<00:02:03.960> better<00:02:04.170> all<00:02:04.380> together
