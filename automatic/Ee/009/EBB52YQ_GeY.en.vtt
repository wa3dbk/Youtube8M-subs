00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
 Tell me guys who called you holy, bringing you to 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.980
 you guys on gtx quick test today 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.160
 960 on the galaxy a board that already comes with 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.880
 factory overclock here the game is another 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.240
 which simulator 2 in the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.380
 video in the graphics here I go 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.600
 set everything up in culture in full hd and 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.910
 I 'm going to change only one setting 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.640
 in the advanced settings that the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.780
 scaling I'll put in 150% 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.160
 that I realized that in 300% to a penalty of 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.780
 friends 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.149
 I do not know exactly why it works 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.219
 But you wanted to stay pretty 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.030
 creams or loss of approximately one 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.360
 20 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.239
 so I preferred to put it exceeds this 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.570
 sizing by 150% 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.930
 since I did not notice difference in attack 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:02.489
 in the game you can see the graph 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:06.210
 It's very beautiful and in a truck, let's go. 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.900
 Walking around the city here is my 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.340
 computer 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.159
 it is 15 and it has 8 gb of memory is not 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.900
 a spectacular computer but as you 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.840
 can watch the game late keeping 60 and 70 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.880
 sometimes it drops a little to 56 but the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.909
 hole looks pretty good 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.860
 the textures of this game, especially the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.590
 truck asphalt they are very well 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.189
 made and with this graph in transit 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.430
 stay very handsome can see the fluidity 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.439
 Game're having no no 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.899
 expressive loss making game work 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.899
 can see this texture 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:53.290
 now the frames fall a bit stayed in the 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:56.560
 house of 55 cm but nothing that made a 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.660
 big difference in gameplay 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.370
 nothing that counts for example the 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.920
 game symbol 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.600
 Only I have not had the opportunity 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.140
 to play with her but she is 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.090
 showing very good 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:16.540
 the board that was launched a few years ago 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:19.500
 weeks by the galaxy in 1960 and 1961 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.500
 more than three weeks 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.080
 You can see that in this other camera 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.200
 the graphics to take care of the game here me 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.209
 very well for a sign that is a door 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.209
 of this new 900 series 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.400
 stop it a little truck you should be 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.970
 to no one 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.600
 this truck game play texture 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.600
 asphalt 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.710
 this game he sometimes presents a 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.770
 fall from frame but I already noticed a 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.630
 video with other cards even when 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.710
 Sometimes there is an end 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:13.370
 you can hear all the headlights with 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.430
 Nice lighting sometimes makes me a 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.840
 little bigger than it should 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.420
 I believe that the lighting is some 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.220
 kind of bug that same day so the 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.620
 headlights and lights illuminate are half 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.380
 Weird but the game is already a few years old. 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.310
 I still think he still 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.310
 pretty pretty 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.120
 I hope you enjoyed it, I hope I have 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.320
 helped in choosing the video card from 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.320
 you are more
