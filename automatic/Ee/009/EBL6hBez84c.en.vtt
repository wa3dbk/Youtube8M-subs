Weather Channel we get a description of
what<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.650> application<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.369> with<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> option

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
what the application is with the option

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.790 
what the application is with the option
to<00:00:33.300> normally<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.079> would<00:00:34.170> be<00:00:34.200> installed<00:00:34.559> or

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
to normally it would be installed or

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.170 
to normally it would be installed or
uninstalled<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.700> case<00:00:35.850> that's<00:00:36.030> I've

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
uninstalled but in this case that's I've

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.430 
uninstalled but in this case that's I've
installed<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.930> just<00:00:37.050> launch<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.320> from

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
installed it I can just launch it from

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.850 
installed it I can just launch it from
here

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
here

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.740 
here
I'll<00:00:38.489> back<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:38.700> one<00:00:38.969> page<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.420> show<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.570> what

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
I'll back up one page and show you what

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.869 
I'll back up one page and show you what
the<00:00:39.840> actual<00:00:40.410> interface<00:00:40.620> works<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:41.100> looking

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
the actual interface works for looking

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.000 
the actual interface works for looking
for<00:00:41.910> applications<00:00:42.329> looks<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:42.989> right<00:00:43.920> now

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
for applications looks like right now

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.680 
for applications looks like right now
we've<00:00:44.129> got<00:00:44.250> five<00:00:44.430> applications<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.149> they<00:00:45.539> use

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
we've got five applications and they use

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.049 
we've got five applications and they use
various<00:00:46.050> elements<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.680> vehicle<00:00:46.980> data<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.789> we

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
various elements of vehicle data that we

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.910 
various elements of vehicle data that we
provide<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.360> them<00:00:48.629> four<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.469> these<00:00:49.559> are<00:00:49.680> audio

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
provide to them four of these are audio

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.380 
provide to them four of these are audio
based<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.250> heart<00:00:50.430> slack<00:00:50.640> or<00:00:50.789> tune<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.210> NPR

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
based I heart slack or tune in and NPR

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.670 
based I heart slack or tune in and NPR
so<00:00:51.750> they<00:00:51.840> use<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> vehicles<00:00:52.350> audio<00:00:52.530> doesn't

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
so they use the vehicles audio doesn't

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.200 
so they use the vehicles audio doesn't
obviously<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.219> display<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.730> present<00:00:54.090> their

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
obviously this display to present their

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.340 
obviously this display to present their
information<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:54.750> when<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.989> channel<00:00:55.230> does

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
information but when the channel does

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.700 
information but when the channel does
that<00:00:55.469> as<00:00:55.559> well

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that as well

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.410 
that as well
but<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.129> also<00:00:56.250> brings<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.789> lot<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.940> data<00:00:57.090> and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
but it also brings in a lot of data and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.139 
but it also brings in a lot of data and
has<00:00:57.629> another<00:00:57.870> feature<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.559> I'll<00:00:58.649> show<00:00:58.800> you

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
has another feature and I'll show you

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.069 
has another feature and I'll show you
because<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.359> Weather<00:01:00.510> Channel<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.870> more<00:01:01.020> of

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
because the Weather Channel is more of

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.170 
because the Weather Channel is more of
an<00:01:01.170> application<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.800> provides<00:01:02.180> large

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
an application that provides large

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.090 
an application that provides large
amounts<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.570> data<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.650> I'm<00:01:04.799> gonna<00:01:04.890> pause

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
amounts of data and I'm gonna pause

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.980 
amounts of data and I'm gonna pause
right<00:01:05.339> here<00:01:05.369> because<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:06.240> only<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:06.540> 15

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
right here because we only have 15

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.960 
right here because we only have 15
minutes<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> vehicle<00:01:07.650> power<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.640> had<00:01:08.909> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
minutes of the vehicle power so I had to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.670 
minutes of the vehicle power so I had to
recycle<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.390> accessory<00:01:09.780> that's<00:01:10.290> actually<00:01:10.590> to

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
recycle the accessory that's actually to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.780 
recycle the accessory that's actually to
protect<00:01:10.799> us<00:01:11.040> from<00:01:11.189> over<00:01:11.490> draining<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
protect us from over draining the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.920 
protect us from over draining the
battery<00:01:11.970> but<00:01:12.060> we're<00:01:12.180> gonna<00:01:12.299> invert<00:01:12.720> oh<00:01:12.840> right

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
battery but we're gonna invert oh right

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.230 
battery but we're gonna invert oh right
now<00:01:13.020> um<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.040> what's<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> recover<00:01:14.460> we're

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
now um so what's a recover we're

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.249 
now um so what's a recover we're
launching<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.630> Weather<00:01:15.780> Channel<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
launching the Weather Channel and

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.560 
launching the Weather Channel and
because<00:01:17.060> applications<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.360> be<00:01:18.420> very

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
because applications we have to be very

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.820 
because applications we have to be very
careful<00:01:18.810> with<00:01:18.869> our<00:01:18.930> applications<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.530> we

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
careful with our applications that we

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.350 
careful with our applications that we
respect<00:01:20.189> how<00:01:20.490> much<00:01:20.610> distraction<00:01:20.939> they<00:01:21.180> cause

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
respect how much distraction they cause

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.910 
respect how much distraction they cause
something<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.350> The<00:01:22.470> Weather<00:01:22.590> Channel<00:01:22.680> where

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
something like The Weather Channel where

the other features at the weather
channel<00:01:56.630> has<00:01:56.960> is<00:01:57.200> I'm<00:01:57.620> sure<00:01:57.800> most<00:01:58.100> of<00:01:58.250> us<00:01:58.310> are

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
channel has is I'm sure most of us are

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.440 
channel has is I'm sure most of us are
used<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:58.670> seeing<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:58.970> that's<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.180> Doppler

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
used to seeing and that's the Doppler

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.880 
used to seeing and that's the Doppler
radar<00:01:59.480> map<00:01:59.930> this<00:02:00.260> is<00:02:00.410> the<00:02:00.500> kind<00:02:00.650> of<00:02:00.680> feature

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
radar map this is the kind of feature

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.430 
radar map this is the kind of feature
that<00:02:01.130> while<00:02:01.400> it's<00:02:01.520> very<00:02:01.580> compelling<00:02:02.060> and

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
that while it's very compelling and

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.510 
that while it's very compelling and
important<00:02:03.440> for<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.620> customer<00:02:03.740> it's<00:02:04.280> not<00:02:04.430> the

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
important for the customer it's not the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.440 
important for the customer it's not the
kind<00:02:04.640> of<00:02:04.700> feature<00:02:04.850> that<00:02:04.940> we<00:02:05.060> really<00:02:05.270> want

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
kind of feature that we really want

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.490 
kind of feature that we really want
enabled<00:02:05.750> while<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:05.930> vehicle<00:02:06.200> is<00:02:06.230> driving

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
enabled while the vehicle is driving

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.630 
enabled while the vehicle is driving
because<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:06.740> takes<00:02:06.890> too<00:02:07.040> much<00:02:07.160> effort<00:02:07.340> for<00:02:07.490> the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
because it takes too much effort for the

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.950 
because it takes too much effort for the
V<00:02:07.730> for<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:07.910> driver<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:08.450> be<00:02:08.479> looking<00:02:08.810> at<00:02:08.899> this

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
V for the driver to be looking at this

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.969 
V for the driver to be looking at this
and<00:02:09.080> studying<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.410> weather<00:02:09.500> looking<00:02:09.860> at<00:02:09.920> the

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
and studying the weather looking at the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.110 
and studying the weather looking at the
Doppler<00:02:10.100> radar<00:02:10.250> so<00:02:10.700> this<00:02:10.820> is<00:02:10.910> one<00:02:11.000> of<00:02:11.060> the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
Doppler radar so this is one of the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.430 
Doppler radar so this is one of the
features<00:02:11.330> that<00:02:11.360> we<00:02:11.480> would<00:02:11.570> restrict<00:02:12.260> or<00:02:12.410> limit

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
features that we would restrict or limit

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.960 
features that we would restrict or limit
a<00:02:12.830> lot<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:13.010> vehicles<00:02:13.160> moving<00:02:13.430> once<00:02:13.790> it's<00:02:13.910> in

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
a lot of vehicles moving once it's in

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.640 
a lot of vehicles moving once it's in
park<00:02:14.210> this<00:02:14.600> feature<00:02:14.840> all<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.170> features<00:02:15.470> that

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
park this feature all the features that

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.170 
park this feature all the features that
were<00:02:15.950> normally<00:02:16.310> them<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.490> would<00:02:16.790> be<00:02:16.880> back<00:02:17.030> and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
were normally them it would be back and

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.000 
were normally them it would be back and
running<00:02:17.560> so<00:02:18.560> that's<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:18.800> Weather<00:02:18.950> Channel

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.350 
running so that's the Weather Channel
I'll<00:02:19.460> give<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.670> an<00:02:19.790> example<00:02:19.850> of<00:02:20.090> one<00:02:20.210> of<00:02:20.300> our
