has been in great form and let's see
what<00:00:58.969> he<00:00:59.089> can<00:00:59.180> do<00:00:59.359> here<00:01:12.100> first<00:01:13.100> jump<00:01:13.369> is<00:01:13.490> a

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
what he can do here first jump is a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.249 
what he can do here first jump is a
vertical<00:01:13.759> but<00:01:14.149> because<00:01:14.450> he<00:01:14.539> knows<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.080> many

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
vertical but because he knows so many

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:16.899 
vertical but because he knows so many
people<00:01:15.649> are<00:01:15.710> coming<00:01:15.770> after<00:01:16.190> him<00:01:16.429> normally<00:01:16.819> you

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
people are coming after him normally you

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.279 
people are coming after him normally you
might<00:01:17.149> want<00:01:17.330> to<00:01:17.420> be<00:01:17.509> a<00:01:17.539> little<00:01:17.690> slower<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.140> the

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
might want to be a little slower to the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:26.149 
might want to be a little slower to the
vertical<00:01:18.440> but<00:01:18.799> he's<00:01:18.950> going<00:01:19.310> all<00:01:19.460> out<00:01:19.490> anyway

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.130 

to<00:01:26.700> me<00:01:26.850> he<00:01:27.030> seems<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.539> slower<00:01:27.899> than

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
to me he seems a little slower than

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.550 
to me he seems a little slower than
Damian<00:01:28.590> right<00:01:28.799> now<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:30.170> would<00:01:31.170> agree<00:01:31.319> a<00:01:31.409> little

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
Damian right now I would agree a little

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.740 
Damian right now I would agree a little
more<00:01:31.799> careful

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.470 

yeah<00:01:36.410> I<00:01:36.770> see<00:01:37.100> there<00:01:37.370> that<00:01:37.400> turn<00:01:37.880> was<00:01:38.150> a<00:01:38.180> little

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
yeah I see there that turn was a little

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.500 
yeah I see there that turn was a little
bit<00:01:38.630> too<00:01:38.840> sharp<00:01:39.610> pick<00:01:40.610> Adaro<00:01:40.880> never<00:01:41.150> got<00:01:41.360> his

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
bit too sharp pick Adaro never got his

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.620 
bit too sharp pick Adaro never got his
eye<00:01:41.690> on<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:41.930> jump

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.719 

now<00:01:48.200> when<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.409> start<00:01:48.649> pushing<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.070> time<00:01:49.340> then

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
now when you start pushing the time then

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.039 
now when you start pushing the time then
you<00:01:49.820> really<00:01:50.060> have<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.299> play<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.539> your<00:01:50.689> horses

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
you really have to play to your horses

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.600 
you really have to play to your horses
strengths<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:51.500> weaknesses<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.100> you<00:01:52.460> get<00:01:52.579> a

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
strengths and weaknesses and you get a

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.859 
strengths and weaknesses and you get a
big<00:01:52.880> horse<00:01:53.149> that<00:01:53.180> doesn't<00:01:53.509> like<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.689> turn

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
big horse that doesn't like to turn

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.039 
big horse that doesn't like to turn
these<00:01:54.289> nifty<00:01:54.469> turns<00:01:54.829> you're<00:01:55.039> in<00:01:55.130> trouble<00:01:56.049> not

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
these nifty turns you're in trouble not

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:57.969 
these nifty turns you're in trouble not
that<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:57.289> horse<00:01:57.500> falls<00:01:57.740> in<00:01:57.829> that<00:01:57.890> category

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
that this horse falls in that category

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.399 
that this horse falls in that category
but<00:01:58.430> definitely<00:01:59.149> this<00:01:59.270> style<00:01:59.750> makes<00:02:00.170> a<00:02:00.259> big

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
but definitely this style makes a big

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.950 
but definitely this style makes a big
difference<00:02:00.710> at<00:02:00.799> this<00:02:00.890> point<00:02:01.840> well<00:02:02.840> I<00:02:02.899> think

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
difference at this point well I think

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.960 
difference at this point well I think
you're<00:02:03.229> really<00:02:03.710> down<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.130> wire<00:02:04.220> here<00:02:04.429> this

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
you're really down to the wire here this

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.389 
you're really down to the wire here this
is<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.119> great<00:02:05.479> field<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:05.990> very<00:02:06.259> fast<00:02:06.710> riders<00:02:07.220> and

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
is a great field of very fast riders and

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.130 
is a great field of very fast riders and
very<00:02:07.640> fast<00:02:07.970> horses<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.569> you've<00:02:08.690> got<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:08.959> take

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
very fast horses and you've got to take

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.259 
very fast horses and you've got to take
a<00:02:09.170> shot<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.950> I<00:02:10.069> think<00:02:10.130> luck<00:02:10.550> is<00:02:10.729> also<00:02:11.060> going<00:02:11.209> to

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
a shot and I think luck is also going to
