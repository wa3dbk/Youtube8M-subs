the<00:00:37.129> metal<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.250> me<00:00:38.370> I'm<00:00:38.579> not<00:00:38.730> sure<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.870> certain

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the metal to me I'm not sure the certain

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.069 
the metal to me I'm not sure the certain
boat<00:00:40.440> does<00:00:40.649> film<00:00:41.300> sounds<00:00:42.300> metal<00:00:42.480> as<00:00:42.660> well<00:00:42.809> I

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
boat does film sounds metal as well I

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.170 
boat does film sounds metal as well I
think<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.680> whole<00:00:43.770> thing's<00:00:44.010> metal<00:00:44.370> might<00:00:45.090> be

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
think the whole thing's metal might be

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.380 
think the whole thing's metal might be
wrong<00:00:45.359> it's<00:00:46.230> cold<00:00:46.460> feels<00:00:47.460> metal<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.000> think<00:00:48.239> it's

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
wrong it's cold feels metal I think it's

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.560 
wrong it's cold feels metal I think it's
all<00:00:48.510> metal

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
all metal

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.810

what's<00:01:57.780> not<00:01:57.930> quite<00:01:58.080> solid<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.620> think<00:01:58.800> that's

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
what's not quite solid I think that's

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.220 
what's not quite solid I think that's
like<00:01:59.190> plate<00:01:59.550> or<00:01:59.790> something<00:02:00.020> that's<00:02:01.020> pretty

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
like plate or something that's pretty

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.950 
like plate or something that's pretty
chunky<00:02:01.530> though<00:02:02.510> you<00:02:03.510> know<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.630> think<00:02:03.720> that's

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
chunky though you know I think that's

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.560 
chunky though you know I think that's
pretty<00:02:04.080> good<00:02:04.170> value<00:02:04.470> for<00:02:04.500> money

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
pretty good value for money

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.180 
pretty good value for money
quite<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.600> cool-looking<00:02:06.870> prop<00:02:07.380> replica<00:02:07.860> so

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
quite a cool-looking prop replica so

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.339 
quite a cool-looking prop replica so
there's<00:02:09.030> something<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.390> bit<00:02:09.420> different<00:02:09.660> looks

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
there's something a bit different looks

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.780 
there's something a bit different looks
pretty<00:02:10.590> cool<00:02:10.770> whether<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.160> use<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.579> to<00:02:11.670> weigh

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
pretty cool whether you use it to weigh

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.070 
pretty cool whether you use it to weigh
down<00:02:11.819> paper<00:02:12.450> or<00:02:12.780> you

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
