off<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.670> bat<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:44.850> have<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.240> say<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.570> Christian

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
off the bat I have to say that Christian

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.050 
off the bat I have to say that Christian
Eriksen<00:02:46.110> does<00:02:46.500> play<00:02:46.710> best<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.400> central<00:02:47.880> role

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
Eriksen does play best in a central role

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.360 
Eriksen does play best in a central role
so<00:02:48.330> either<00:02:48.480> Center<00:02:48.840> tacky<00:02:49.050> mid<00:02:49.380> or<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.980> center

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
so either Center tacky mid or a center

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.590 
so either Center tacky mid or a center
forward<00:02:50.670> position<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.180> something<00:02:51.480> like<00:02:51.570> a

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
forward position and something like a

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.780 
forward position and something like a
4-3-3<00:02:52.140> false-9<00:02:52.800> that's<00:02:53.310> where<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.490> played<00:02:53.670> it

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
4-3-3 false-9 that's where I played it

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.250 
4-3-3 false-9 that's where I played it
for<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:53.970> majority<00:02:54.210> of<00:02:54.360> these<00:02:54.450> clips<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.930> I

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
for the majority of these clips and I

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.140 
for the majority of these clips and I
found<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.650> works<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.070> best<00:02:56.100> for<00:02:56.490> him<00:02:56.640> his

major<00:02:57.390> Pro<00:02:57.720> for<00:02:58.140> me<00:02:58.320> was<00:02:58.650> his<00:02:58.830> dribbling<00:02:59.370> he's

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
major Pro for me was his dribbling he's

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.400 
major Pro for me was his dribbling he's
able<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.090> beat<00:03:00.240> most<00:03:00.540> defenders<00:03:01.050> off<00:03:01.230> the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
the major con that I have to talk about

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.330 
the major con that I have to talk about
is<00:03:56.310> his<00:03:56.610> speed<00:03:57.030> especially<00:03:57.740> it<00:03:58.740> does<00:03:59.040> take<00:03:59.220> him

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
is his speed especially it does take him

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.470 
is his speed especially it does take him
a<00:03:59.430> while<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.670> get<00:03:59.850> going<00:03:59.880> so<00:04:00.330> because

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
a while to get going so because

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.810 
a while to get going so because
acceleration<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:01.260> not<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.500> best<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:02.040> mean<00:04:02.520> even

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
acceleration is not the best I mean even

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.890 
acceleration is not the best I mean even
for<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:02.970> center<00:04:03.180> attacking<00:04:03.540> maybe<00:04:03.660> you<00:04:03.750> don't

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
for a center attacking maybe you don't

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.479 
for a center attacking maybe you don't
need<00:04:04.020> a<00:04:04.200> lot<00:04:04.410> of<00:04:04.440> speed<00:04:04.680> but<00:04:04.890> I<00:04:04.920> just<00:04:05.130> found<00:04:05.250> it

need a lot of speed but I just found it

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.860 
need a lot of speed but I just found it
takes<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.820> while<00:04:05.910> to<00:04:06.030> get<00:04:06.180> going<00:04:06.209> but<00:04:06.630> once<00:04:06.810> he

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870
