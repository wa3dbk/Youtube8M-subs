the design of the traffic when noise is

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:16.270 
the design of the traffic when noise is
reduced<00:06:07.340> when<00:06:08.210> you're<00:06:08.330> going<00:06:08.480> at<00:06:08.690> high<00:06:08.840> speeds

loading<00:06:21.890> into<00:06:22.160> the<00:06:22.280> side<00:06:22.520> and<00:06:23.360> it<00:06:23.510> should<00:06:23.540> be

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
loading into the side and it should be

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:31.570 
loading into the side and it should be
easy
