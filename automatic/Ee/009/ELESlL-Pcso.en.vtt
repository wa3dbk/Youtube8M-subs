hey<00:00:00.780> guys<00:00:01.020> I<00:00:01.050> sword<00:00:01.350> here<00:00:01.680> and<00:00:01.829> this<00:00:02.129> looks

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
hey guys I sword here and this looks

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.269 
hey guys I sword here and this looks
perfectly<00:00:02.850> normal<00:00:02.939> right<00:00:03.510> well<00:00:04.380> think<00:00:05.130> again

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
perfectly normal right well think again

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.500 
perfectly normal right well think again
if<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:06.210> go<00:00:06.359> here<00:00:06.629> look<00:00:07.140> at<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:07.410> x-ray<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.510> this

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
if I go here look at that x-ray and this

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.919 
if I go here look at that x-ray and this
is<00:00:09.750> how<00:00:10.110> bad<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.950> lag<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:12.480> happened

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
is how bad the lag is this happened

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.140 
is how bad the lag is this happened
because<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.200> creeper<00:00:13.889> exploded<00:00:14.639> but<00:00:14.880> it<00:00:15.000> looks

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
because a creeper exploded but it looks

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.060 
because a creeper exploded but it looks
like<00:00:15.299> no<00:00:15.450> damage<00:00:15.809> was<00:00:15.990> done<00:00:16.020> until<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.859> actually

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
like no damage was done until I actually

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.390 
like no damage was done until I actually
went<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.670> there<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.150> then<00:00:18.390> look<00:00:18.660> at<00:00:18.720> that

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
went in there and then look at that

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.920 
went in there and then look at that
basically<00:00:20.400> all<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.970> little<00:00:21.240> blocks<00:00:21.449> are<00:00:21.689> gone

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
basically all the little blocks are gone

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.279 
basically all the little blocks are gone
are<00:00:22.350> still<00:00:22.650> there<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.160> it's<00:00:24.150> gone<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.720> don't

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
are still there but it's gone I don't

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.320 
are still there but it's gone I don't
know<00:00:25.380> how<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.529> explain<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.910> there

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
know how to explain it but it's there

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.540 
know how to explain it but it's there
and<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.349> not<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.890> blocks<00:00:29.130> are<00:00:29.250> actually

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
and it's not the blocks are actually

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.150 
and it's not the blocks are actually
gone<00:00:29.760> but<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.750> legging<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.439> bad<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.980> he's

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
gone but it's legging so bad that he's

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.650 
gone but it's legging so bad that he's
not<00:00:32.309> rendering<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.000> blocks<00:00:33.239> are<00:00:33.420> gone

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
not rendering that the blocks are gone

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.590 
not rendering that the blocks are gone
that's<00:00:34.440> how<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.219> jump<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.239> then<00:00:36.450> it

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
that's how it is I jump in and then it

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.470 
that's how it is I jump in and then it
causes<00:00:36.780> like<00:00:37.440> an<00:00:37.770> x-ray<00:00:38.219> glitch<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.090> that's

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
causes like an x-ray glitch so that's

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.610 
causes like an x-ray glitch so that's
the<00:00:39.570> only<00:00:39.780> thing<00:00:39.930> that's<00:00:40.110> actually<00:00:40.410> cool

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the only thing that's actually cool

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.430 
the only thing that's actually cool
about<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.160> little<00:00:41.930> rendering<00:00:42.930> lag<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
about this little rendering lag and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.229 
about this little rendering lag and
especially<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.040> slag<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.820> get<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.090> see

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
especially the slag we get to see

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.090 
especially the slag we get to see
everything<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:46.020> see<00:00:46.170> all<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> tunnels<00:00:46.710> that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
everything we see all the tunnels that

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.040 
everything we see all the tunnels that
are<00:00:47.160> there<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:48.059> see<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> skylight<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.930> we're

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
are there we see the skylight that we're

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.779 
are there we see the skylight that we're
still<00:00:49.230> making<00:00:49.440> there's<00:00:49.890> two<00:00:50.129> sheets<00:00:50.489> over

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
still making there's two sheets over

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.729 
still making there's two sheets over
there<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.149> at<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.780> very<00:00:51.809> bottom<00:00:52.260> there's

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
there and at the very bottom there's

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.580 
there and at the very bottom there's
three<00:00:53.100> torch<00:00:53.430> path<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.410> basically<00:00:55.410> we're

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
three torch path so basically we're

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.080 
three torch path so basically we're
going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> make<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.920> skylight<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.610> goes<00:00:56.820> all

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
going to make a skylight that goes all

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.430 
going to make a skylight that goes all
the<00:00:57.120> way<00:00:57.270> down<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.480> three<00:00:57.750> torch<00:00:57.989> path<00:00:58.230> and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the way down to three torch path and

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.779 
the way down to three torch path and
we're<00:00:58.530> going<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.680> make<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.829> skylight<00:00:59.250> at<00:00:59.399> every

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
we're going to make a skylight at every

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.520 
we're going to make a skylight at every
corner<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.449> then<00:01:00.840> we're<00:01:01.020> going<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.199> go<00:01:01.260> back

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
corner and then we're going to go back

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.520 
corner and then we're going to go back
at<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.340> bedrock<00:01:03.329> level<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:03.930> mine<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
at to bedrock level and just mine the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.950 
at to bedrock level and just mine the
entire<00:01:04.890> last<00:01:05.610> three<00:01:05.880> layers<00:01:06.150> we<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.630> all<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
entire last three layers we get all the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.810 
entire last three layers we get all the
resources<00:01:07.290> needed<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.340> could<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.670> give

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
resources needed so we could just give

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.859 
resources needed so we could just give
everybody<00:01:09.210> tools<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.500> now<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:12.299> leg<00:01:12.570> is

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
everybody tools but for now the leg is

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.320 
everybody tools but for now the leg is
just<00:01:13.229> what<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.680> killing<00:01:14.070> me<00:01:14.430> at<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.760> point<00:01:15.090> I

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
just what is killing me at this point I

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.570 
just what is killing me at this point I
know<00:01:15.689> people<00:01:15.990> had<00:01:16.350> told<00:01:16.560> me<00:01:16.710> well<00:01:17.159> people<00:01:17.400> have

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
know people had told me well people have

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.190 
know people had told me well people have
told<00:01:17.729> me<00:01:17.880> if<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.150> were<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.330> hover<00:01:18.479> over<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> item

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
told me if I were to hover over the item

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.920 
told me if I were to hover over the item
and<00:01:19.290> hold<00:01:19.890> LT<00:01:20.369> it'll<00:01:20.759> actually<00:01:20.939> make<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and hold LT it'll actually make the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.920 
and hold LT it'll actually make the
blocks<00:01:22.920> disappear<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.970> ones<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.240> adjust<00:01:24.630> mind

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
blocks disappear the ones I adjust mind

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.260 
blocks disappear the ones I adjust mind
but<00:01:25.170> they<00:01:25.229> keep<00:01:25.380> reappearing<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.189> then<00:01:26.790> I've

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
but they keep reappearing and then I've

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.149 
but they keep reappearing and then I've
also<00:01:27.420> been<00:01:27.689> told<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> patch<00:01:28.740> update

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
also been told that and the patch update

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.010 
also been told that and the patch update
they're<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.460> fix<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.150> little<00:01:30.540> lag<00:01:30.720> that

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
they're going to fix the little lag that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.289 
they're going to fix the little lag that
we're<00:01:31.409> all<00:01:31.590> having<00:01:32.130> right<00:01:32.310> now<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:32.970> for<00:01:33.119> now

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
we're all having right now but for now

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.510 
we're all having right now but for now
this<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:34.020> one<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.409> things<00:01:34.560> well<00:01:35.159> first<00:01:35.400> of

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
this is one of the things well first of

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.249 
this is one of the things well first of
all<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.000> how<00:01:36.119> i<00:01:36.150> fix<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:37.079> to

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
all this is how i fix it it's just to

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.719 
all this is how i fix it it's just to
place<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> block<00:01:37.920> right<00:01:38.189> there<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.670> now

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
place a block right there and now

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.819 
place a block right there and now
everything<00:01:39.509> that's<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:39.810> gone<00:01:40.200> blown<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.710> by
