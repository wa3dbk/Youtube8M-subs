00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
that is the LTC it 1/5 dial is an open

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.540 
that is the LTC it 1/5 dial is an open
can<00:00:38.879> dial<00:00:40.129> and<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.540> makes<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.960> lot<00:00:43.550> more

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
can dial and that makes it a lot more

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.850 
can dial and that makes it a lot more
powerful<00:00:44.610> than<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.450> closed<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:46.110> dial<00:00:46.500> +

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
powerful than a closed can dial +

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.740 
powerful than a closed can dial +

on an Xbox 360 HD DVD Drive and the
reason<00:01:59.130> for<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.510> dial<00:02:02.180> has

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
reason for that is that that dial has

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.340 
reason for that is that that dial has
been<00:02:04.070> damaged<00:02:05.480> I'm<00:02:06.480> not<00:02:06.810> sure<00:02:06.960> what<00:02:07.110> caused<00:02:07.320> it

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
been damaged I'm not sure what caused it

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.020 
been damaged I'm not sure what caused it
could<00:02:07.680> be<00:02:07.770> static<00:02:08.160> electricity<00:02:08.580> or<00:02:08.910> something

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
could be static electricity or something

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.840 
could be static electricity or something
like<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.510> but<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.869> dial<00:02:10.290> is<00:02:10.380> no<00:02:10.500> longer

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
like that but that dial is no longer

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.800 
like that but that dial is no longer
usable<00:02:11.850> so<00:02:12.360> I've<00:02:12.510> swapped<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:13.140> out<00:02:14.010> for<00:02:14.430> this

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
usable so I've swapped that out for this

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.890

milliamps for for best results but I I

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.240 
milliamps for for best results but I I

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
wanted to turn the power down a little

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.560 
wanted to turn the power down a little
bit<00:02:41.459> just<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:43.100> preserve<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.400> diodes<00:02:44.730> life<00:02:45.180> and

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
bit just to preserve the diodes life and

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.650 
bit just to preserve the diodes life and
I<00:02:45.660> found<00:02:45.989> this<00:02:46.320> diode<00:02:46.730> very<00:02:47.730> powerful<00:02:48.270> anyway

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
I found this diode very powerful anyway

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.930 
I found this diode very powerful anyway
so<00:02:48.900> there's<00:02:49.080> no<00:02:49.230> need<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.530> drive<00:02:49.770> it<00:02:49.920> at<00:02:50.040> more

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
so there's no need to drive it at more

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.990 
so there's no need to drive it at more
than<00:02:51.060> 400<00:02:51.270> milliamps<00:02:54.890> from

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
than 400 milliamps from

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.630 
than 400 milliamps from
from<00:02:57.630> basic<00:02:57.990> calculation<00:02:58.950> theoretically

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
from basic calculation theoretically

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.580 
from basic calculation theoretically
this<00:02:59.850> would<00:03:00.540> work<00:03:00.720> with<00:03:00.960> two<00:03:01.350> batteries

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
this would work with two batteries

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.500 
this would work with two batteries
because<00:03:04.590> six<00:03:05.310> volts<00:03:05.730> would<00:03:05.910> be<00:03:06.000> sufficient

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
because six volts would be sufficient

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.740 
because six volts would be sufficient
but<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:06.840> had<00:03:07.350> problems<00:03:07.860> getting<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.670> run<00:03:08.790> six

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
but I had problems getting to run six

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.220 
but I had problems getting to run six
volts

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
volts

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.800 
volts
earlier<00:03:11.220> with<00:03:11.430> my<00:03:11.580> other<00:03:11.730> other<00:03:12.450> two

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
earlier with my other other two

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.930 
earlier with my other other two
batteries<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.560> decided<00:03:14.550> to<00:03:14.730> stick<00:03:14.880> with

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
batteries so I decided to stick with

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.060 
batteries so I decided to stick with
three<00:03:15.720> batteries<00:03:16.310> instead<00:03:18.710> this<00:03:19.710> is<00:03:19.770> very

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
three batteries instead this is very

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:27.250 
three batteries instead this is very
powerful<00:03:20.490> diodes<00:03:21.210> is<00:03:21.420> very<00:03:22.020> important<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:25.580> to

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
powerful diodes is very important to to

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.310 
powerful diodes is very important to to
to<00:03:28.260> take<00:03:28.550> basic<00:03:29.550> safety<00:03:29.790> precautions<00:03:30.320> always

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
to take basic safety precautions always

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.550 
to take basic safety precautions always
wear<00:03:31.650> protective<00:03:33.050> goggles<00:03:35.570> safe<00:03:36.570> productive

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
wear protective goggles safe productive

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.770 
wear protective goggles safe productive
as<00:03:37.770> safety<00:03:38.430> laser<00:03:38.850> goggles<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:40.340> always<00:03:41.340> 'm<00:03:41.780> is

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
as safety laser goggles and always 'm is

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.300 
as safety laser goggles and always 'm is
always<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.140> good<00:03:43.290> idea<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.650> keep<00:03:43.770> a<00:03:43.830> cap<00:03:44.100> on<00:03:44.280> like

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
always a good idea to keep a cap on like

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.020 
always a good idea to keep a cap on like
this<00:03:44.700> too

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
this too

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.960 
this too

to protect against you know accidentally

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.880 
to protect against you know accidentally
hitting<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.510> switch<00:03:51.720> on<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.260> hitting

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.820 
comes out a lot para is a lot easier to
focus<00:04:38.550> it's<00:04:39.000> not<00:04:39.180> more<00:04:39.450> distinct<00:04:39.990> and<00:04:40.260> sharper

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
focus it's not more distinct and sharper

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.930 
focus it's not more distinct and sharper
and<00:04:41.040> most<00:04:41.700> importantly<00:04:42.950> it<00:04:43.950> allows<00:04:44.250> more<00:04:44.790> of

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
and most importantly it allows more of

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
this video but it's actually very very

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.040 
this video but it's actually very very
powerful<00:05:22.830> as<00:05:23.830> you<00:05:23.979> can<00:05:24.160> see<00:05:24.340> the<00:05:25.050> plastics

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.670 

tried<00:05:34.030> an<00:05:34.180> experiment<00:05:36.060> using<00:05:37.060> this<00:05:37.419> to<00:05:37.780> punch

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
tried an experiment using this to punch

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.969 
tried an experiment using this to punch
a<00:05:38.889> hole<00:05:39.070> through<00:05:39.490> a<00:05:39.520> black<00:05:39.910> CD<00:05:40.330> case<00:05:40.570> and<00:05:41.169> I<00:05:41.919> was

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
a hole through a black CD case and I was

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:47.040 
a hole through a black CD case and I was
able<00:05:42.310> to<00:05:42.340> do<00:05:42.550> it<00:05:42.669> up<00:05:43.150> to<00:05:43.830> 3<00:05:44.830> meters<00:05:45.220> away<00:05:46.050> and

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
able to do it up to 3 meters away and

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.990 
able to do it up to 3 meters away and
from<00:05:47.229> one<00:05:47.380> end<00:05:47.560> of<00:05:47.680> my<00:05:47.919> room<00:05:48.160> to<00:05:48.370> the<00:05:48.490> other<00:05:48.520> so

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
from one end of my room to the other so

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.469 
from one end of my room to the other so
it<00:05:49.270> is<00:05:49.360> very<00:05:49.900> very<00:05:50.139> powerful<00:05:50.320> and<00:05:50.770> if<00:05:51.760> I<00:05:52.030> focus

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
it is very very powerful and if I focus

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:58.620 
it is very very powerful and if I focus
the<00:05:54.030> beam<00:05:55.030> to<00:05:55.210> infinity<00:05:56.070> I<00:05:57.070> can<00:05:58.030> shiny<00:05:58.330> that

the beam to infinity I can shiny that

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.629 
the beam to infinity I can shiny that
just<00:05:59.590> about<00:05:59.740> anything<00:06:00.010> I<00:06:00.190> can<00:06:00.340> see<00:06:00.490> in<00:06:00.580> a

I've<00:06:14.880> I've<00:06:15.880> tried<00:06:16.180> so<00:06:16.360> far<00:06:16.389> it<00:06:16.840> is<00:06:17.130> it<00:06:18.130> is<00:06:18.389> more

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
I've I've tried so far it is it is more

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:22.710 
I've I've tried so far it is it is more
than<00:06:19.539> powerful<00:06:20.110> enough<00:06:20.410> to<00:06:20.910> to<00:06:21.910> hit<00:06:22.539> any

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
than powerful enough to to hit any

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.250 
than powerful enough to to hit any
object<00:06:23.229> in<00:06:23.500> the<00:06:23.860> distance<00:06:23.979> and<00:06:24.610> also<00:06:25.240> when<00:06:25.840> you

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
object in the distance and also when you

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.200 
object in the distance and also when you
turn<00:06:26.620> this<00:06:26.770> on<00:06:26.949> at<00:06:27.669> night<00:06:29.039> in<00:06:30.039> the<00:06:30.520> outdoors

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
turn this on at night in the outdoors

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.990 
turn this on at night in the outdoors
you<00:06:31.479> will<00:06:31.510> immediately<00:06:31.930> see<00:06:32.409> a<00:06:32.650> red<00:06:32.889> great<00:06:33.729> big

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
you will immediately see a red great big

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.930 
you will immediately see a red great big
project<00:06:34.690> up<00:06:34.840> to<00:06:35.620> the<00:06:35.740> sky<00:06:35.979> and<00:06:36.310> it's<00:06:36.669> very

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
project up to the sky and it's very

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.490 
project up to the sky and it's very
obviously<00:06:37.360> don't<00:06:37.510> have<00:06:37.630> to<00:06:37.780> look<00:06:37.930> hard<00:06:38.229> to

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
obviously don't have to look hard to

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.460 
obviously don't have to look hard to
spot<00:06:38.800> the<00:06:38.949> beam<00:06:39.130> it's<00:06:39.479> it's<00:06:40.479> very<00:06:40.690> distinct

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
spot the beam it's it's very distinct

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.330 
spot the beam it's it's very distinct
and<00:06:41.680> everyone<00:06:43.620> around<00:06:44.620> you<00:06:44.830> will<00:06:44.860> be<00:06:45.159> able<00:06:45.220> to

and everyone around you will be able to

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.740 
and everyone around you will be able to
see<00:06:45.520> that<00:06:45.639> beam<00:06:45.880> it<00:06:46.330> is<00:06:46.599> very<00:06:47.070> very<00:06:48.070> distinct

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
see that beam it is very very distinct

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.399 
see that beam it is very very distinct
so<00:06:49.750> um<00:06:50.610> thanks<00:06:51.610> for<00:06:51.639> watching<00:06:52.060> and<00:06:52.240> I<00:06:52.360> hope<00:06:52.720> you
