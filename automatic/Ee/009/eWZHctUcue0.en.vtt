the strings although that's always good
to<00:01:08.990> do<00:01:09.260> in<00:01:09.380> your<00:01:09.670> when<00:01:10.670> you're<00:01:10.820> cleaning<00:01:12.729> but

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.510 
to do in your when you're cleaning but
I'm<00:01:14.180> just<00:01:14.450> going<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:17.020> kind<00:01:18.020> of<00:01:18.160> take<00:01:19.160> care<00:01:19.400> of

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
I'm just going to kind of take care of

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.670 
I'm just going to kind of take care of
some<00:01:19.670> of<00:01:19.760> this<00:01:19.850> this<00:01:20.240> dirt<00:01:21.820> on<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:23.090> high<00:01:23.680> high

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
some of this this dirt on the high high

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.170 
some of this this dirt on the high high
streets<00:01:25.100> here<00:01:27.910> I<00:01:28.910> guess<00:01:29.509> this<00:01:29.690> would<00:01:29.840> be<00:01:29.900> the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
streets here I guess this would be the

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:39.959 
streets here I guess this would be the
eighth<00:01:32.180> fret<00:01:33.850> I'll<00:01:34.850> just

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.809 

we'll<00:01:40.329> just<00:01:40.479> do<00:01:40.659> half<00:01:40.899> of<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.460> frets<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.670> high

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819 
we'll just do half of the frets the high

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:50.899 
we'll just do half of the frets the high
e<00:01:43.359> b<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.140> g<00:01:44.170> strings<00:01:44.649> here

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.760 

and<00:01:51.180> I've<00:01:51.570> got<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> soft<00:01:52.140> cloth<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:55.380> I'm<00:01:55.439> just

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
and I've got a soft cloth so I'm just

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.210 
and I've got a soft cloth so I'm just
going<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.189> kind<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.670> wipe<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:58.770> again<00:01:59.070> this

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
going to kind of wipe and again this

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.800 
going to kind of wipe and again this
would<00:01:59.340> probably<00:01:59.640> be<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.759> lot<00:01:59.880> easier

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
would probably be a lot easier

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.399 
would probably be a lot easier
remove<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> strings<00:02:02.210> but<00:02:03.210> sometimes<00:02:03.689> you

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
remove the strings but sometimes you

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.569 
remove the strings but sometimes you
don't<00:02:04.560> want<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> do<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.979> Wow
