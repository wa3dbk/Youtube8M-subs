 No information about the advent calendar 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.000
 that means that's the first one 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.440

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.900
 video is simply about it so the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.029
 Advent calendar videos will be a series 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.420

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.399
 behind a door for you a man 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.440
 upload with a moped 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.030
 It may be a standard it is 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.829
 can be a fancy wedding 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.160
 it can also have to be like it 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.559
 I am that I wanted some 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.520
 There are really many 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.899
 different moves you sit here 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.879
 be presented or 24 different 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.219
 and yes the whole was per 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.049
 randomly selected who at which 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.110
 Tag can finally upload like that 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.119
 base already gives 24 politicians in 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.490
 Germany as you said the people you 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.830
 you can just watch the videos 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.210
 you could decide afterwards 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.740
 okay the person is pretty personable 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.150
 I'll take a look at that or that 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.220
 I do not like that person so I'm waiting 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.549
 the man is so active only free 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.380
 Decisions how you find that and yes 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.090
 as I said there you can still 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.850
 look forward to it right now you have real 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.380
 many videos available you have something 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.070
 you have now in adventskalender 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.259
 you do not have them like the l and yet 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.939
 other videos will be added 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.060
 that's what december will come to 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.720
 Pretty studi premium still december 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.430
 will be pretty much clapped 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.920
 and yes, I would say the city works 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.670
 at the yard set and how should it be 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.649
 be different 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.149
 we should come back the pokémon 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.610
 I am glad that I do not have any 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.170
 music video to have made even if I 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.149
 even a smart would have it because he has it now 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.920
 after failed set which word 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.180
 use this because mine is like plc 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.300
 that will work most now 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.979
 done has what many 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.360
 So many people have asked himself hey 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.250
 racer how do you play the whole thing 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.050
 Maybe I'll say something or something 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.550
 the people wrote people tolerated 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.590
 there will be a video to come 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.330
 and here it is the first 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.610
 advent calendar so that 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.580
 adventskalender video will be that 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.400
 be set to tag okay we drive at times 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.650
 the basics application is leaky 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.940
 with the ability ropes so one 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.250
 other ability even has 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.800
 not and we play our train with that 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.840
 Focus short focus will not be much 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.830
 explaining shows is very fragile too 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.800
 the ability we play on it 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.180
 become 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.890
 seldom does it survive a nice one 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.930
 what I am good at are psycho attacks 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.240
 rhythms by the camouflage psychiatrist 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.900
 intercept 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:56.990
 but otherwise it is pretty fragile and 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.240
 therefore the focus is short or choosy 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.260
 Mostly you can live it too 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.360
 play for maximum damage 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.170
 extract or trend in glass or 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.050
 depending on how you play it back around 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.300
 then stop back as take games super 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.980
 or to play but I am 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.720
 our short before the fox we come 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.860
 even for ev distribution ev 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.700
 distribution is 252 initiative 196 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.550
 attack and 62 special attack the whole 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.140
 is easy to recognize higher 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.760
 Special attack as the physical 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.230
 attack from the pace and it should be so 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.970
 be about the same 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.360
 so I signed up for this outlook 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.370
 selected it can be to a bit 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.990
 restructure as you want, the 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.730
 you can also do more 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.960
 special attack go up and less 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.070
 attack but that is for everyone 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.020
 leave 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.030
 we come to broom the essence of 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.080
 this train is hurriedly that is too 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.670
 what I appealed again 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.750
 why i have the focus good because 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:58.680
 reading hastily does not mean attacking 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.960
 fans and defense down because care 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.700
 one way or another is forgiven and through 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.580
 the ability is just it 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.920
 varela also comes moves namely 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:14.670
 Let's play back the ones on fire 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:17.370
 on the foot kick the dip and the 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.350
 strauchler the stacker when you say that 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.860
 very simple 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:26.130
 flame throw is easy in the moment 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.750
 an often seen move and there so if 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.850
 pokémon flambeau can extend 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.770
 and right but not specifically asked 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.770
 Actually, this pokémon has almost always 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.480
 flames book times apart from pokémon 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.280
 like butter landing or so taking it out 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.680
 hamburg could if you special 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.260
 would play depending on 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.290
 but almost everything in the moment meter has 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:51.350
 hamburg you have seen the footstep 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:55.229
 is very very good for haas already 1 for 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.810
 no idea yes normal pokémon 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.490
 actually so just for healers and 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.350
 Canada also are seen in none 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.720
 pokémon is really a foot step 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.330
 decent attack then we have the 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.940
 simply sting because of pyro and step 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.650
 and you know , I think I have to 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.390
 not much to say and last but not least 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.640
 the strauchler the stapler is easy 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.370
 which makes the roads good for 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.490
 bone rock pokémon so or murder or 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.290
 other because there are many pokémon with 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.630
 a fourfold plant weakens the 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.510
 are very heavy from the weight 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.090
 from there is punishable there again 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.190
 a very good move ground pokémon 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.110
 rock pokémon are just easy 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:38.669
 heavy chunks with exceptions such as 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:41.460
 example like Roger Walsh there is the 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:45.250
 shrub not necessarily so perfect 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.720
 but most of the water bottom 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.910
 rock pokémon are just from the weight 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.960
 really very hard 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.000
 Therefore, the punishment is a good one here too 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.500
 Variation if that's better 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 could know that was something else but 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.350
 since I only smoke it non smoker 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.110
 We have the order here 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.509
 strauchler on it okay that was already 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.430
 my advent calendar video as I said 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:07.820
 is now 24 days a day every day 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:11.600
 a door to be opened with others 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.789
 politicians today it was my door and 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.840
 There are 23 more or I want 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.639
