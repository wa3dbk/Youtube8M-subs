blue like the outside the deck and I was

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.050 
blue like the outside the deck and I was

like bull where the red ones have the
red<00:04:31.210> one<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:31.600> red<00:04:31.990> lines<00:04:32.500> around<00:04:32.800> it<00:04:33.010> but<00:04:33.370> no

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
red one the red lines around it but no

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.880 
red one the red lines around it but no
they're<00:04:34.000> exactly<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:35.050> same<00:04:35.260> and<00:04:35.560> there's<00:04:35.740> no

differences between the actual colorings
of<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:39.490> two<00:04:39.730> different<00:04:40.150> colors<00:04:40.540> of<00:04:40.810> deck<00:04:42.780> but

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
of the two different colors of deck but

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.530

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
overall deck of cards I would have to

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.660 
overall deck of cards I would have to
give<00:04:57.370> this<00:04:57.760> deck<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.300> 4<00:04:59.230> out<00:04:59.470> of<00:04:59.500> 5<00:04:59.890> it's<00:05:00.250> it's

very well presented but sometimes it

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.360 
very well presented but sometimes it
does<00:05:04.330> plump<00:05:04.690> when<00:05:04.960> you<00:05:05.230> spread<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:06.040> when<00:05:06.160> you

does plump when you spread and when you

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.940 
does plump when you spread and when you
fan<00:05:07.150> it<00:05:07.330> just<00:05:07.360> like<00:05:07.660> all<00:05:07.840> other<00:05:08.020> decks<00:05:08.320> do<00:05:08.590> and

really a grey it's flat and then when
you<00:05:58.930> open<00:05:58.960> the<00:05:59.260> actual<00:05:59.590> deck<00:05:59.860> the<00:06:00.070> cards<00:06:00.460> are

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
you open the actual deck the cards are

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.610 
you open the actual deck the cards are
blue<00:06:01.270> and<00:06:01.300> they're<00:06:01.750> visibly<00:06:02.140> blue<00:06:02.380> and<00:06:02.560> you

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
blue and they're visibly blue and you

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.990 
blue and they're visibly blue and you
can<00:06:02.770> tell<00:06:03.010> that<00:06:03.510> now<00:06:04.510> I<00:06:04.840> do<00:06:05.650> like<00:06:06.430> the<00:06:06.730> look<00:06:06.880> of

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
can tell that now I do like the look of

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.909 
can tell that now I do like the look of
this<00:06:07.120> deck<00:06:07.390> I<00:06:07.540> think<00:06:07.720> the<00:06:07.900> colors<00:06:08.230> pop<00:06:08.530> in<00:06:08.800> the

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
this deck I think the colors pop in the

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.890 
this deck I think the colors pop in the
blue<00:06:09.160> but<00:06:09.430> the<00:06:09.550> red<00:06:09.760> I<00:06:10.000> think<00:06:10.240> it<00:06:10.540> needs<00:06:10.690> to<00:06:10.780> be

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
blue but the red I think it needs to be

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.440 
blue but the red I think it needs to be
more<00:06:11.110> shiny<00:06:11.560> and<00:06:11.710> it<00:06:12.010> needs<00:06:12.160> to<00:06:12.400> pop<00:06:12.850> more<00:06:13.150> and

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
more shiny and it needs to pop more and

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.900 
more shiny and it needs to pop more and
I<00:06:13.630> think<00:06:13.810> it<00:06:13.900> needs<00:06:14.080> to<00:06:14.370> it<00:06:15.370> should<00:06:15.610> have<00:06:15.730> had<00:06:15.880> a

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
I think it needs to it should have had a

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.700 
I think it needs to it should have had a
little<00:06:16.060> bit<00:06:16.300> more<00:06:16.330> work<00:06:16.600> done<00:06:17.020> on<00:06:17.080> it<00:06:17.380> to<00:06:17.560> make

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
little bit more work done on it to make

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.980 
little bit more work done on it to make
it<00:06:17.770> look<00:06:18.130> like<00:06:18.640> the<00:06:19.150> blue<00:06:19.300> deck<00:06:19.510> because<00:06:19.900> the

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
it look like the blue deck because the

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.240 
it look like the blue deck because the
blue<00:06:20.110> leg<00:06:20.290> does<00:06:20.500> look<00:06:20.710> better<00:06:20.890> than<00:06:21.040> the<00:06:21.130> red

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
blue leg does look better than the red

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.950 
blue leg does look better than the red
deck<00:06:21.460> and<00:06:21.640> if<00:06:21.760> you<00:06:21.820> have<00:06:22.000> to<00:06:22.180> choose<00:06:22.360> colors<00:06:22.750> I

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
deck and if you have to choose colors I

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.290 
deck and if you have to choose colors I
would<00:06:23.320> suggest<00:06:23.800> the<00:06:24.370> blue<00:06:24.550> deck<00:06:24.730> and<00:06:24.940> not<00:06:25.150> the

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
would suggest the blue deck and not the

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.820 
would suggest the blue deck and not the
red<00:06:25.450> deck<00:06:25.660> because<00:06:25.900> the<00:06:25.960> blue<00:06:26.110> deck<00:06:26.260> is<00:06:26.500> better

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
red deck because the blue deck is better

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.280 
red deck because the blue deck is better
in<00:06:27.100> my<00:06:27.340> opinion<00:06:27.700> if<00:06:28.240> you<00:06:28.419> like<00:06:28.600> red<00:06:28.810> decks<00:06:28.990> get

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.290 
in my opinion if you like red decks get

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.800 
in my opinion if you like red decks get
it<00:06:29.410> but<00:06:29.890> if<00:06:29.979> you<00:06:30.039> had<00:06:30.190> to<00:06:30.220> choose<00:06:30.550> colors<00:06:31.090> get

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
it but if you had to choose colors get

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.450 
it but if you had to choose colors get
the<00:06:31.960> blue<00:06:32.169> otherwise<00:06:32.710> get<00:06:33.160> them

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
the blue otherwise get them

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.180 
the blue otherwise get them
now<00:06:34.330> the<00:06:34.840> look<00:06:34.990> of<00:06:35.110> this<00:06:35.230> deck<00:06:35.500> I<00:06:35.710> really<00:06:36.040> do

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.000 
now the look of this deck I really do
like<00:06:36.370> it<00:06:36.640> I<00:06:36.820> think<00:06:36.880> the<00:06:37.480> color<00:06:37.990> palette<00:06:38.470> on<00:06:38.590> the

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
like it I think the color palette on the

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.100

court<00:06:39.430> cards<00:06:39.550> looks<00:06:39.970> fantastic

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110
