00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.620 

so<00:00:03.490> there<00:00:03.639> are<00:00:03.699> two<00:00:03.790> very<00:00:04.090> different<00:00:04.330> ways<00:00:04.569> to

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:04.630 
so there are two very different ways to

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.200 
so there are two very different ways to
approach<00:00:04.870> your<00:00:05.170> climb<00:00:05.380> you<00:00:06.220> can<00:00:06.370> plan<00:00:06.549> this<00:00:06.700> be

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.210 
approach your climb you can plan this be

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.840 
approach your climb you can plan this be
seated<00:00:07.569> you<00:00:07.720> can<00:00:07.960> be<00:00:08.049> planned<00:00:08.350> to<00:00:08.469> stand<00:00:08.950> and

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:09.850 
seated you can be planned to stand and

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:10.980 
seated you can be planned to stand and
you<00:00:09.910> know<00:00:09.969> there's<00:00:10.150> a<00:00:10.210> third<00:00:10.450> way<00:00:10.630> which<00:00:10.840> is

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
you know there's a third way which is

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.509 
you know there's a third way which is
you<00:00:11.080> know<00:00:11.170> a<00:00:11.200> mixture<00:00:11.559> seated<00:00:11.980> in<00:00:12.099> standing

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:12.519 
you know a mixture seated in standing

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.999 
you know a mixture seated in standing
and<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:13.750> this<00:00:13.929> little<00:00:14.139> segment<00:00:14.500> here<00:00:14.530> I'm

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.009 
and in this little segment here I'm

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:16.920 
and in this little segment here I'm
going<00:00:15.219> to<00:00:15.280> show<00:00:15.580> you<00:00:15.639> the<00:00:16.150> differences<00:00:16.540> like

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
going to show you the differences like

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.660 
going to show you the differences like
in<00:00:17.050> my<00:00:17.170> body<00:00:17.380> position<00:00:17.590> between<00:00:17.980> the<00:00:18.160> two<00:00:18.400> and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
in my body position between the two and

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.630 
in my body position between the two and
what<00:00:19.480> different<00:00:20.140> ways<00:00:20.650> of<00:00:20.949> climbing<00:00:21.310> allow<00:00:21.490> me

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
what different ways of climbing allow me

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.900 
what different ways of climbing allow me
to<00:00:21.730> accomplish<00:00:21.850> differently<00:00:22.859> so<00:00:23.859> follow<00:00:24.760> me

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
to accomplish differently so follow me

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.310 
to accomplish differently so follow me
so<00:00:27.910> obviously<00:00:28.300> you<00:00:28.449> start<00:00:28.750> off<00:00:28.900> seated

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
so obviously you start off seated

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.900 
so obviously you start off seated
because<00:00:29.680> you<00:00:29.890> need<00:00:30.010> to<00:00:30.130> get<00:00:30.250> into<00:00:30.400> your<00:00:30.490> pedals

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
because you need to get into your pedals

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.080 
because you need to get into your pedals
and<00:00:31.090> get<00:00:31.210> stationary<00:00:32.199> and<00:00:32.410> being<00:00:33.370> all<00:00:33.550> seated

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
and get stationary and being all seated

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.670 
and get stationary and being all seated
like<00:00:34.180> this<00:00:34.390> allows<00:00:34.600> me<00:00:34.809> to<00:00:34.840> climb<00:00:35.110> relatively

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
like this allows me to climb relatively

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.040 
like this allows me to climb relatively
slowly<00:00:35.980> I'm<00:00:36.700> pulling<00:00:37.390> down<00:00:37.630> on<00:00:37.960> the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
slowly I'm pulling down on the

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.660 
slowly I'm pulling down on the
handlebars<00:00:38.530> really<00:00:38.920> you<00:00:39.100> know<00:00:39.190> driving<00:00:39.460> the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
handlebars really you know driving the

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.030 
handlebars really you know driving the
back<00:00:39.820> wheel<00:00:40.030> into<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.329> ground<00:00:40.600> and<00:00:40.980> for<00:00:41.980> a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
back wheel into the ground and for a

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.410 
back wheel into the ground and for a
situation<00:00:42.520> like<00:00:42.610> this<00:00:42.790> I<00:00:42.879> can<00:00:43.030> get<00:00:43.149> out<00:00:43.239> of<00:00:43.360> the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
situation like this I can get out of the

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.299 
situation like this I can get out of the
saddle<00:00:43.690> when<00:00:44.320> I<00:00:44.379> get<00:00:44.530> out<00:00:44.620> of<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.800> saddle<00:00:45.010> I

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
saddle when I get out of the saddle I

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.639 
saddle when I get out of the saddle I
keep<00:00:45.879> my<00:00:46.030> butt<00:00:46.239> real<00:00:46.450> low<00:00:46.660> get<00:00:47.379> my<00:00:47.469> weight

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
keep my butt real low get my weight

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.790 
keep my butt real low get my weight
forward<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:49.300> move<00:00:49.750> my<00:00:49.930> butt<00:00:50.110> back<00:00:50.320> and<00:00:50.710> it

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
forward but move my butt back and it

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.369 
forward but move my butt back and it
enables<00:00:51.190> me<00:00:51.250> to<00:00:51.399> have<00:00:51.940> a<00:00:52.840> little<00:00:53.020> bit<00:00:53.230> more

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
enables me to have a little bit more

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.290 
enables me to have a little bit more
room<00:00:53.590> to<00:00:53.620> maneuver<00:00:53.860> so<00:00:54.340> I<00:00:54.730> can<00:00:54.879> pick<00:00:55.030> up<00:00:55.149> the

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
room to maneuver so I can pick up the

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.049 
room to maneuver so I can pick up the
bike<00:00:55.480> to<00:00:55.750> get<00:00:55.840> up<00:00:55.989> over<00:00:56.230> obstacles<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.430> stuff

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
bike to get up over obstacles and stuff

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:04.310 
bike to get up over obstacles and stuff
like<00:00:58.180> that

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.440 

so<00:01:04.860> when<00:01:05.160> we<00:01:05.309> started<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.970> know<00:01:06.060> when<00:01:06.360> you

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
so when we started you know when you

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.320 
so when we started you know when you
start<00:01:06.660> off<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.260> you're<00:01:07.760> you<00:01:08.760> know<00:01:08.880> choosing

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
start off and you're you know choosing

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.400 
start off and you're you know choosing
if<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.480> want<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.690> be<00:01:09.840> seated

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
if you want to be seated

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.440 
if you want to be seated
choosing<00:01:11.370> if<00:01:11.550> you<00:01:11.610> want<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.090> know<00:01:12.180> stand

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
choosing if you want to you know stand

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.940 
choosing if you want to you know stand
or<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.780> know<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> mixture<00:01:13.350> between<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.710> two

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
or you know a mixture between the two

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.740 
or you know a mixture between the two
then<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.730> have<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.940> take<00:01:15.150> into<00:01:15.330> account<00:01:15.420> our

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
then you have to take into account our

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.020 
then you have to take into account our
traction<00:01:17.930> you<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.160> find<00:01:20.160> more<00:01:20.460> traction<00:01:20.760> when

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
traction you can find more traction when

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.640 
traction you can find more traction when
you're<00:01:21.150> seated<00:01:21.300> because<00:01:22.200> your<00:01:22.410> weight<00:01:22.560> is

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
you're seated because your weight is

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.560 
you're seated because your weight is
distributed<00:01:22.680> much<00:01:23.340> more<00:01:23.580> evenly<00:01:23.880> more<00:01:24.420> weight

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
distributed much more evenly more weight

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.480 
distributed much more evenly more weight
on<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> back<00:01:24.930> wheel<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.440> as<00:01:26.130> long<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.310> you

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
on the back wheel and as long as you

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.270 
on the back wheel and as long as you
just<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.240> know<00:01:27.330> get<00:01:27.479> low<00:01:27.690> and<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:28.350> practice

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
just you know get low and to practice

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.240 
just you know get low and to practice
that<00:01:29.400> rowing<00:01:29.760> motion<00:01:29.910> with<00:01:30.450> your<00:01:31.130> with<00:01:32.130> your

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
that rowing motion with your with your

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.550 
that rowing motion with your with your
arms<00:01:32.580> you<00:01:33.270> keep<00:01:33.510> that<00:01:33.660> wheel<00:01:33.840> driven<00:01:34.080> in<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
arms you keep that wheel driven in and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.650 
arms you keep that wheel driven in and
you'll<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:35.160> able<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.370> climb<00:01:35.520> even<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.540> really

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
you'll be able to climb even a really

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.510 
you'll be able to climb even a really
slippery<00:01:37.220> slope<00:01:38.390> with<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:40.520> standing

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
slippery slope with the standing

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.100 
slippery slope with the standing
technique<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.300> can<00:01:42.450> get<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> little<00:01:42.869> bit<00:01:42.990> more

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
technique you can get a little bit more

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.190 
technique you can get a little bit more
power<00:01:43.320> because<00:01:44.040> plus<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.360> know<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.690> addition

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
power because plus you know in addition

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.930 
power because plus you know in addition
to<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.680> force<00:01:47.160> that<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.490> generate<00:01:47.850> with

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
to the force that you can generate with

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.580 
to the force that you can generate with
your<00:01:48.119> legs<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:48.990> put<00:01:49.170> your<00:01:49.290> body<00:01:49.410> weight

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
your legs you can put your body weight

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.740 
your legs you can put your body weight
into<00:01:50.040> each<00:01:50.160> stroke<00:01:50.400> which<00:01:50.610> helps<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> lot<00:01:51.030> but

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
into each stroke which helps a lot but

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.150 
into each stroke which helps a lot but
the<00:01:51.840> power<00:01:52.050> application<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.130> way<00:01:54.619> more<00:01:55.619> cyclic

it's<00:01:56.400> not<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:56.670> smooth<00:01:56.940> like<00:01:57.180> an<00:01:57.270> electric

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
it's not as smooth like an electric
