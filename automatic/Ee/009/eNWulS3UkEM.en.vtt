00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
sponges and they come in a 4-pack and I

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.030 
sponges and they come in a 4-pack and I
don't<00:04:30.010> like<00:04:30.310> these<00:04:30.550> sponges<00:04:31.980> they<00:04:32.980> were

don't like these sponges they were
really<00:04:33.370> cheap<00:04:33.460> so<00:04:33.910> I've<00:04:34.090> got<00:04:34.360> what<00:04:34.600> I<00:04:34.630> paid<00:04:34.720> for

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
really cheap so I've got what I paid for

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.250 
really cheap so I've got what I paid for
I<00:04:35.230> guess<00:04:36.210> so<00:04:37.210> they're<00:04:37.510> really<00:04:37.720> really<00:04:38.110> hard

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260

I guess so they're really really hard
and<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:40.720> don't<00:04:41.260> feel<00:04:41.470> like<00:04:41.710> they<00:04:41.950> would<00:04:42.160> blend

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
and I don't feel like they would blend

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.940 
and I don't feel like they would blend
the<00:04:42.760> foundation<00:04:43.230> nicely<00:04:44.230> because<00:04:44.500> of<00:04:44.950> how

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
the foundation nicely because of how

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.040 
the foundation nicely because of how
hard<00:04:47.950> they<00:04:48.250> are<00:04:48.280> they're<00:04:48.700> not<00:04:48.730> bouncy<00:04:49.570> and
