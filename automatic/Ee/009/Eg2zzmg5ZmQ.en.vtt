00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
know I worked hard last year but this

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.699 
know I worked hard last year but this
year<00:02:11.489> I'm<00:02:11.730> going<00:02:11.940> above<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:12.780> beyond<00:02:13.140> working

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
year I'm going above and beyond working

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.160 
year I'm going above and beyond working
with<00:02:13.860> myself<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.550> team<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.390> feel<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.019> lot

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
with myself and the team so I feel a lot

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.720 
with myself and the team so I feel a lot
better<00:02:16.320> than<00:02:16.440> last<00:02:16.560> year<00:02:16.920> they're<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.580> good

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
better than last year they're a good

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.259 
better than last year they're a good
team<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:18.239> I<00:02:18.900> think<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.800> think<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.190> way<00:02:20.370> we

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
team but I think I think in a way we

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.360 
team but I think I think in a way we
came<00:02:21.420> out<00:02:21.600> on<00:02:21.720> top<00:02:21.870> in<00:02:21.930> some<00:02:22.080> matches<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:23.130> was

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
came out on top in some matches it was

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.340 
came out on top in some matches it was
pretty<00:02:23.519> well<00:02:23.700> pretty<00:02:24.150> tough<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:25.110> they're

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
pretty well pretty tough and they're

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.720 
pretty well pretty tough and they're
good<00:02:25.500> team<00:02:25.739> but<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.070> think<00:02:26.400> we<00:02:26.459> did<00:02:26.610> well

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
good team but I think we did well

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.789 
good team but I think we did well
overall<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.810> think<00:02:27.989> that<00:02:28.140> that's<00:02:28.530> what<00:02:28.709> we

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
overall and I think that that's what we

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.190 
overall and I think that that's what we
needed<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.430> prove<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.880> ourselves<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.450> we're

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
needed to prove to ourselves that we're

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.870 
needed to prove to ourselves that we're
good<00:02:31.350> team<00:02:31.560> they're<00:02:32.160> just<00:02:32.370> like<00:02:32.489> us<00:02:32.640> they're

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
good team they're just like us they're

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.550 
good team they're just like us they're
students<00:02:33.209> at<00:02:33.360> school<00:02:33.720> they're<00:02:34.350> in<00:02:34.440> high

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
students at school they're in high

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.250 
students at school they're in high
school<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:35.160> mean<00:02:35.600> it's<00:02:36.600> basically<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:37.110> same

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
school I mean it's basically the same

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.500 
school I mean it's basically the same
thing
