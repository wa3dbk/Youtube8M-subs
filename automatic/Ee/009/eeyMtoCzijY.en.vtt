00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.570 
welcome to today's video and this is how
to<00:00:06.029> increase<00:00:06.569> Windows<00:00:07.550> vistas<00:00:09.260> performance

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
to increase Windows vistas performance

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.610 
to increase Windows vistas performance
now<00:00:11.580> all<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.420> people<00:00:12.990> out<00:00:13.230> there<00:00:13.290> is

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
now all of you people out there is

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.499 
now all of you people out there is
running<00:00:13.920> Windows<00:00:14.219> Vista<00:00:14.370> know<00:00:14.759> how<00:00:14.880> much<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.059> a

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
running Windows Vista know how much of a

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.540 
running Windows Vista know how much of a
pain<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.199> now<00:00:16.470> how<00:00:16.590> slowly<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.340> load

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
pain it is now how slowly is to load

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.250 
pain it is now how slowly is to load
folders<00:00:18.500> so<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.890> just<00:00:20.699> load<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.539> whole<00:00:21.720> system

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
folders so I just load the whole system

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.970 
folders so I just load the whole system
in<00:00:22.560> general<00:00:22.910> takes<00:00:23.910> about<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.539> couple<00:00:24.980> of

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
in general takes about a couple of

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.330 
in general takes about a couple of
seconds<00:00:26.730> but<00:00:26.970> still<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:28.199> pretty<00:00:28.410> slow<00:00:29.900> now

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
seconds but still it's pretty slow now

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.200 
seconds but still it's pretty slow now
these<00:00:32.390> options<00:00:33.390> will<00:00:34.040> disable<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.489> couple<00:00:36.120> of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
these options will disable a couple of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.850 
these options will disable a couple of
the<00:00:36.329> useless<00:00:36.780> features<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.440> don't<00:00:37.680> need

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
the useless features that you don't need

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.770 
the useless features that you don't need
and<00:00:38.160> keep<00:00:38.640> some<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.090> cool<00:00:39.300> features<00:00:39.329> of

in the background to stand on when
you're<00:00:56.370> whole<00:00:56.520> system<00:00:56.699> will<00:00:56.969> look<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.239> same

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
you're whole system will look the same

you're whole system will look the same
but<00:00:57.510> run<00:00:58.109> completely<00:00:58.559> faster<00:01:00.079> now<00:01:01.160> do<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.340> go

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
but run completely faster now do you go

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.260 
but run completely faster now do you go
to<00:01:04.939> performance<00:01:05.939> options<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.530> go<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
to performance options so just go to

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.620 
to performance options so just go to
your<00:01:09.270> Start<00:01:10.280> menu<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.760> type<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.299> go<00:01:12.570> to

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
search and type in performance options

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:33.020 
search and type in performance options
and<00:01:16.740> then

go<00:01:43.540> over<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.840> go<00:01:43.990> with<00:01:44.200> you<00:01:45.539> system<00:01:46.539> and

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
go over to go with you system and

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.840 
go over to go with you system and
maintenance<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:49.420> go<00:01:49.570> to<00:01:50.220> use<00:01:51.220> tools<00:01:51.610> to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
maintenance and you go to use tools to

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.219 
maintenance and you go to use tools to
improve<00:01:52.180> performance<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:56.729> then<00:01:58.170> where<00:01:59.170> it

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
improve performance and then where it

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.440 
improve performance and then where it
says<00:01:59.289> tasks<00:01:59.979> you<00:02:00.159> go<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.399> adjust<00:02:00.909> visual

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
says tasks you go to adjust visual

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.190 
says tasks you go to adjust visual
effects<00:02:01.869> and<00:02:02.369> then<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:06.240> then<00:02:07.240> okay<00:02:07.869> then<00:02:08.080> you

effects and then and then okay then you

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.900 
effects and then and then okay then you
go<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.350> adjust<00:02:08.739> visual<00:02:09.220> effects<00:02:09.519> if<00:02:09.670> it<00:02:09.759> said

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
go to adjust visual effects if it said

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.880 
go to adjust visual effects if it said
twice<00:02:10.149> massari<00:02:10.539> um<00:02:10.720> then<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.739> get<00:02:11.860> your

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
twice massari um then you get your

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.520 
twice massari um then you get your
performance<00:02:12.580> options<00:02:14.519> right<00:02:15.519> there<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:17.380> can

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
performance options right there you can

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.890 
performance options right there you can
exit<00:02:17.799> that<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:19.470> then<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:22.450> will<00:02:22.750> be<00:02:22.930> all<00:02:23.170> tipped

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
exit that and then it will be all tipped

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.090 
exit that and then it will be all tipped
built<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.110> I've<00:02:26.620> done<00:02:26.830> this<00:02:26.980> in<00:02:27.220> Windows<00:02:27.489> XP<00:02:27.730> so

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
built it I've done this in Windows XP so

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.890 
built it I've done this in Windows XP so
try<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.160> find<00:02:30.400> this<00:02:30.519> and<00:02:30.760> found<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.120> so<00:02:31.810> you

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
try to find this and found it so you

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.060 
try to find this and found it so you
just<00:02:32.730> leave<00:02:34.410> animated<00:02:35.410> controls<00:02:35.859> and

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
just leave animated controls and

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.840 
just leave animated controls and
