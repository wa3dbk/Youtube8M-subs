00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello to all and all his rivals 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.950
 leave and I find you for a 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.230
 explanatory video about what will happen 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.080
 I was attacking pokemon version 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.420
 verfeuil which is similar to larouche feu 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.860
 and got stuck only from the very first 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.230
 pokemon versions that came out at 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.240
 we red and blue so why 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.620
 an explanatory video 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.030
 I usually do not do it because 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.470
 that it's not going to be an adventure all to 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.890
 is normal and I 'm going to be in mode 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.530
 roleplay so it's not really that can 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.060
 to be a solution of the game but it's more 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.980
 an adventure to crack my pear 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.660
 tell bullshit about things 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.940
 completely incomprehensible and see 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.480
 the story of the game on my point of view 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.160
 but because the game pokemon what is good 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.989
 is that the hero he moved and so we 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.489
 can make him say what I want 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.230
 think pokemon is a good choice and 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.570
 then you were many to have me 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.120
 asked already nothing but pokemon and me 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.500
 I propose it to you in roleplay and on 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.019
 their Facebook page you were many to 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.120
 have given your approval on this 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.250
 project so I do how a video 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.659
 explanatory for what would happen from 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.729
 nowhere that would ask but 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.100
 what the fuck the sweet because there the 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.570
 the prologue will arrive which is very 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.310
 short but very intense 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.860
 finally you will finally see it's my opinion 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.330
 I'm happy with what I did but 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.250
 finally here I do not say more I'm you 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.650
 leave the surprise 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.360
 so this roleplay adventure so well 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.729
 sure as its name indicates it will be hard 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.440
 roleplay I put myself in the shoes of the 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.820
 hero I'm acting like it's me 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.580
 who lived the events that took place 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.870
 will necessarily pass I would do it a 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.430
 totally offbeat way to a humor c 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.590
 that's like I'm used to 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.990
 do it and then there would be a Meme it 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.420
 list of challenges also next so 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.360
 as a list of challenges to a team that 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.310
 is predefined already finally there is a 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.320
 team that when I should get to 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.050
 the pokemon league I have to have such 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.590
 list that I'm exposing you now 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:57.220
 florise ar wheel carnage staros voltalis 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.110
 trio bitters and fenard so I think 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.640
 that I will enter the pokemon league there 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.950
 must I try so pokemon in my 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.990
 team I do it in normal mode this is at 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.470
 to say that it's not giving back 1 in C 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.840
 major 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.129
 I do it in normal, that is to say that 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.629
 in the first zone and errata size 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.040
 culpa wheels will have ratatouille 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.170
 of raucoules there will be nothing to 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.780
 kind oh my god a wild voter I 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.610
 crying länder but hwan park not so 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.080
 I use I could use others 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.890
 pokemon during the adventure but he 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.930
 must I 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.810
 I have this list there to do the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.459
 counsel 4 then as deficient reached 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.700
 catch all possible pokemons 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.870
 so yes I know of a penis it's not 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.700
 possible to catch all pokemon 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.780
 in a diversion because already there is 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.950
 pokemon who are in the green 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.990
 leaves but not in the hair wheel 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.330
 example everything con in the f version 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.230
 hate but in the other and arcane 1 he 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.540
 not both at the same time 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.840
 at least at hatches abl if you have to do 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.930
 exchanges but I should get to the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.569
 term of this adventure having caught the 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.480
 maximum possible 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.370
 then as your challenge the acquired 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.110
 lolish at the possible given a nickname to 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.500
 all the pokemon I would have captured 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.800
 even what I will not use so that 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.410
 it's all stupid here is a challenge a little more 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.930
 hardcore without being so much 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.400
 it's when I'm doing an arena I do not 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.750
 will not allow me more than two 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.970
 back and forth with the outside 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.950
 that is, I enter the arena 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.959
 I want to try it but pokemon 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.090
 I once went back to the queen 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.680
 I'm going out twice and 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.060
 when I go back a third time 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.739
 in the arena I would not have the right 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.160
 to come out again to go to the center 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.530
 pokemon and for no more to buy 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.360
 other care items will require that 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.010
 I take precautions because I 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.690
 I tell you in my cradle parts what 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.860
 that I often did is that 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.630
 I was going in 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.000
 in the stop finally I was going into the arena 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.380
 I was doing a trainer I came out I 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.860
 was doing a kind trainer was going out etc 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.940
 etc. 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.600
 because it's very long and tedious 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.720
 and this is by no means pgm at all so 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.730
 that's a challenge in quotation marks all 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.220
 as hardcore especially to have 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.410
 some pokémons use that 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.330
 basic pokéball or zorn'o or 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.410
 off-bowl areas or quinon bowls that 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.030
 do not have the desired effect I explain myself 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.440
 a basic pokéball to increase it to the 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.080
 pana logo not the catch rate it is 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.100
 cold honors bolt it's the same 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.420
 just that when you buy said 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.980
 pokéball at the same time for those who do not 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.329
 do not know when you buy more than 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.519
 ten pokéball at the same time you have a 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.900
 in white gold more so it's like if 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.850
 you had a pokéball in addition to the 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.500
 same effect and admit that I use 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.850
 a girl the bowls that is three times 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.160
 more efficient on pokemon type 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.940
 insects and if I use people on a 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.380
 pokemon rock neither water nor insects ben it 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.440
 is that it will count anyway since 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.730
 that at x 1c could be fun young 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.390
 girl the bowls and in there is a 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.140
 pokemon fire where I do not know so this will be 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.070
 the only cases where you can use 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:47.710
 this kind of bowl finally short I'll try 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.090
 to have like other sons who would 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.260
 raises a little more arduous 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.530
 it is to have the best nature 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.960
 possible for a pokemon to give each 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.570
 pokemon to a nature and that nature 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.520
 increases the stats differently 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.300
 there are natures that do not increase the 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:08.650
 stats like modest nature and by 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.960
 example for volta lis that I oblige myself to 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.590
 have we will say the best nature is 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.780
 would be modest for him as it diminishes 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.360
 the tacc and she increases the tax bit of 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.020
 10% I believe compared to a pokemon 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.550
 who does not have this stats boost and there a 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.650
 other challenge he completely con 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.990
 completely lolish but completely 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.400
 anything and especially to that not 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.080
 I forget here because he was not 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.940
 obvious in a way it's from 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.440
 mouthing sausages when I arrive in 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.120
 an area that I have not discovered 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.520
 previously 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:43.210
 let me explain 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.550
 kind i'm going to get to argentat and that 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.599
 I'll get to Argentina the little thing 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.479
 at the top of the screen that would say that I 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.400
 got here I would stick sausages yes 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:52.509
 well there I do not goal because I have not 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.960

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:56.949
 yes yes it's completely con I 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.990
 wanted something out of the ordinary 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:01.270
 because every time at the end of that 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.190
 I could see on the net the people and 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.190
 to give girls challenges 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.330

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.270
 and of course all of this will be explained 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.159
 in the roleplay because yelling this 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.710
 scop it for no reason it's not 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:28.389

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.669

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:35.490
 logical in the key role in the 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:38.319
 continuity
