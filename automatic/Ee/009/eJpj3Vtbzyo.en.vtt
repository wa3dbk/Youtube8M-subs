00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:54.940
 many we come to see friends so 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.220

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.990
 red punk garage is weird so in 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.180
 So here is after it is the ace marck 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.490
 and start then have who installs so 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.020
 was makeup on it I reminded you was 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.510
 obviously a granny facilities 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.550
 to tread where I know more what and then so 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:15.730
 here is Alexis on start now 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:19.150
 his loss I want the edges I do not want 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.580
 the boroughs is not important so 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.900
 so here at the beginning you start 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.180
 good thursday doing a little bit of 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.750
 fake stuff the action suckers face 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.750
 nothing actually 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.820
 So if you see maps of 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.600
 kind zelda stuff machin stuff thing 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.460
 machine 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.850
 so in fact that's all maps 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.960
 I did not test them all 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.920
 I just have terror and on time 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.140
 it's the lapse he looks good 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.640
 I think I know the notes and 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.150
 dirty diamonds and note since she is 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.480
 very well endowed 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.630
 I took this to test and then 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.860
 so 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.990
 so if you want to be charged yourself 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.410
 quit success acquired its value in 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.650
 the matte jeans zelda adventure these are the 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.510
 friends 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.060
 so we will not do it because I 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.880
 thought to do it to the good score on 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.280
 look at a friend we find ourselves 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.660

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.860
 field 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.590
 after two sets of do not know too much 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.970

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.970
