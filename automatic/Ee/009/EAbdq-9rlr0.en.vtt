00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
collecting cold the okay and I should

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.479 
collecting cold the okay and I should
not<00:00:33.000> have<00:00:33.210> done<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.950> will<00:00:34.950> get<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.309> al

Qaeda back and I'll show you just place
it<00:00:37.230> down<00:00:37.469> like<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.520> right<00:00:38.700> click

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
it down like this and you right click

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
with kona switch over to survival mode

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.170 
with kona switch over to survival mode
so<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.140> won't<00:00:43.500> happen<00:00:43.770> again<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.460> then<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
so that won't happen again and then the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.000 
so that won't happen again and then the
end<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.600> next<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.170> second<00:00:46.500> allocate<00:00:46.860> I've

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
end the next of the second allocate I've

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.610 
end the next of the second allocate I've
put<00:00:47.280> sand<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.789> here<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.260> arrows

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
put sand in here and it is the arrows

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.299 
put sand in here and it is the arrows
look<00:00:49.860> where<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.070> arrows<00:00:50.399> are<00:00:50.430> pointing<00:00:52.309> okay

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
look where the arrows are pointing okay

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.250 
look where the arrows are pointing okay
it's<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> very<00:00:53.850> good<00:00:53.969> example<00:00:54.239> okay<00:00:54.989> look

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
it's not a very good example okay look

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.510 
it's not a very good example okay look
with<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.530> arrows<00:00:55.800> are<00:00:55.920> pointing<00:00:56.219> now<00:00:56.309> their

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
with the arrows are pointing now their

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.639 
with the arrows are pointing now their
arrows<00:00:56.879> are<00:00:57.000> pointing<00:00:57.360> towards<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.109> furnace

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
arrows are pointing towards the furnace

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.760 
arrows are pointing towards the furnace
so<00:00:59.370> if<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.420> actual<00:01:00.840> thing<00:01:01.050> works<00:01:01.500> correctly

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
so if the actual thing works correctly

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.979 
so if the actual thing works correctly
we<00:01:02.520> should<00:01:02.730> get<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> coal<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> furnace

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
we should get the coal and the furnace

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.020 
we should get the coal and the furnace
together<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.589> make<00:01:04.769> some<00:01:04.979> glass<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.580> let's<00:01:05.850> go

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
together to make some glass so let's go

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.030 
together to make some glass so let's go

these<00:01:23.820> mine<00:01:24.150> carts<00:01:24.479> are<00:01:24.630> very<00:01:24.960> buggy<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:25.530> they

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
these mine carts are very buggy now they

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.160 
these mine carts are very buggy now they
are<00:01:25.860> go<00:01:26.070> speed<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.729> speed<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.150> very<00:01:27.390> rampant

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.359 
are go speed the speed is very rampant
and<00:01:28.530> outraging<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:29.759> here<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.810> glass

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
and outraging but here we have the glass

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.160 
and outraging but here we have the glass
is<00:01:32.369> actually<00:01:32.729> smelting<00:01:33.360> currently<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:34.140> have

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
is actually smelting currently we have

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.200 
is actually smelting currently we have
all<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> coal<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.310> all<00:01:35.520> these<00:01:35.700> sand

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
all the coal and we have all these sand

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.880 
all the coal and we have all these sand
included<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.020> don't<00:01:37.200> think<00:01:37.320> that's<00:01:37.439> all<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
included I don't think that's all the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.859 
included I don't think that's all the
sand<00:01:38.159> though<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.729> are<00:01:38.880> still<00:01:39.090> collecting<00:01:39.329> one

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
sand though we are still collecting one

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.870 
sand though we are still collecting one
by<00:01:40.049> one<00:01:40.229> each<00:01:40.380> revolution<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:41.130> gives<00:01:41.280> off<00:01:41.430> one

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
by one each revolution it gives off one

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.010 
by one each revolution it gives off one
sort<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.570> block<00:01:43.380> or<00:01:43.729> item<00:01:44.729> as<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.210> goes<00:01:45.420> past<00:01:45.450> so

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
sort of block or item as it goes past so

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.389 
sort of block or item as it goes past so
you<00:01:46.079> can<00:01:46.200> see<00:01:46.350> continued<00:01:46.829> filling<00:01:47.009> up<00:01:47.250> there

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
you can see continued filling up there

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.210 
you can see continued filling up there
goes<00:01:47.549> six<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.090> once<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.570> turns<00:01:48.930> around<00:01:49.320> again

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
goes six and once it turns around again

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.520 
goes six and once it turns around again
it's<00:01:50.430> very<00:01:50.640> slow<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.570> add<00:01:51.899> their<00:01:52.170> go<00:01:52.320> goes

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
it's very slow if you add their go goes

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.469 
it's very slow if you add their go goes
up<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.829> six<00:01:53.070> now<00:01:53.430> I've<00:01:53.549> used<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.850> all<00:01:54.030> my<00:01:54.060> cult

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
up to six now I've used up all my cult

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.660 
up to six now I've used up all my cult
so<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.200> won't<00:01:55.470> have<00:01:55.590> any<00:01:55.799> coal<00:01:56.070> left<00:01:56.250> but<00:01:56.520> there

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
so I won't have any coal left but there

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.850 
so I won't have any coal left but there
you<00:01:56.790> can<00:01:56.939> see<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.450> giving<00:01:58.020> off<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
you can see that it is giving off the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.469 
you can see that it is giving off the
glass<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.159> that's<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.640> pretty<00:01:59.820> cool<00:02:00.000> effect<00:02:00.299> if

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
glass and that's a pretty cool effect if

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.350 
glass and that's a pretty cool effect if
you<00:02:00.840> want<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.469> automate<00:02:01.979> everything<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:03.000> this

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
you want to automate everything and this

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.179 
you want to automate everything and this
this<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> definite<00:02:04.560> inclusion<00:02:05.070> into

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
this is a definite inclusion into

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.190 
this is a definite inclusion into
Minecraft<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.820> can<00:02:05.969> see<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.270> happening<00:02:06.659> now

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
Minecraft I can see this happening now

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.100 
Minecraft I can see this happening now
the<00:02:07.500> next<00:02:07.740> one<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:07.920> called<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.759> jump<00:02:09.090> pad<00:02:09.479> now

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
the next one is called the jump pad now

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.229 
the next one is called the jump pad now
this<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.649> basically<00:02:11.160> like<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.400> trampoline<00:02:11.849> you

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
this is basically like a trampoline you

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.640 
this is basically like a trampoline you
basically<00:02:12.750> jump<00:02:13.170> on

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
basically jump on

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.819 
basically jump on
ad<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.519> acts<00:02:14.760> as<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> jumping<00:02:15.870> castle<00:02:16.379> of

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
ad and it acts as a jumping castle of

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.940 
ad and it acts as a jumping castle of
joy<00:02:17.730> such<00:02:18.360> as<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> trampoline<00:02:18.989> now<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.650> only

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
joy such as a trampoline now the only

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.130 
joy such as a trampoline now the only
complaint<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:20.640> have<00:02:20.819> about<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.299> is<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:21.629> if

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
complaint I have about this is that if

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.020 
complaint I have about this is that if
you<00:02:22.290> hold<00:02:22.470> shift<00:02:22.799> you<00:02:23.250> should<00:02:23.459> be<00:02:23.610> able<00:02:23.730> to

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
you hold shift you should be able to

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.970 
you hold shift you should be able to
stop<00:02:24.269> jumping<00:02:24.720> there<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.019> no<00:02:25.319> way<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.620> actually

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
stop jumping there is no way of actually

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.949 
stop jumping there is no way of actually
stopping<00:02:26.579> jumping<00:02:27.180> without<00:02:27.299> hurting

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959

sort of jump pad to actually get
anything<00:02:36.239> out<00:02:36.569> of<00:02:36.599> it<00:02:36.810> then<00:02:37.019> they're<00:02:37.260> just

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
anything out of it then they're just

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.259 
anything out of it then they're just
jumping<00:02:37.650> up<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:37.980> maybe<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.430> higher<00:02:38.700> story<00:02:39.090> maybe

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
jumping up to maybe a higher story maybe

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.720 
jumping up to maybe a higher story maybe
maybe<00:02:39.840> instead<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.319> using<00:02:40.769> doors<00:02:41.189> maybe<00:02:41.609> you

maybe instead of using doors maybe you
can<00:02:41.879> use<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.150> jump<00:02:42.450> pad<00:02:42.629> to<00:02:42.780> jump<00:02:43.079> over<00:02:43.470> to

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
can use this jump pad to jump over to

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.619 
can use this jump pad to jump over to
your<00:02:43.829> house<00:02:44.099> I'll<00:02:44.340> be<00:02:44.459> pretty<00:02:44.640> cool<00:02:44.909> jump<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.599> a

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
your house I'll be pretty cool jump to a

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.809 
your house I'll be pretty cool jump to a
second<00:02:46.049> story<00:02:46.349> part<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.129> your<00:02:47.250> house<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.639> like

second story part of your house I like

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.819 
second story part of your house I like
that<00:02:47.970> idea<00:02:48.150> now<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.930> way<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.230> craft<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.739> the

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
that idea now the way you craft of the

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.520 
that idea now the way you craft of the
actual<00:02:50.250> jump<00:02:50.849> pad<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.239> by<00:02:51.629> using<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.959> slime<00:02:52.319> ball

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
actual jump pad is by using a slime ball

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.559 
actual jump pad is by using a slime ball
and<00:02:52.769> a<00:02:52.889> pressure<00:02:53.159> plate<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.609> create<00:02:53.849> for<00:02:54.180> jump

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
and a pressure plate to create for jump

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.559 
and a pressure plate to create for jump
pads<00:02:54.900> now<00:02:55.440> also<00:02:55.799> i<00:02:56.400> forgot<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.090> show<00:02:57.299> you<00:02:57.329> how

redstone signal if I take some items out
it<00:04:02.760> also<00:04:03.030> gives<00:04:03.389> a<00:04:03.510> redstone<00:04:03.810> signal<00:04:04.139> so<00:04:04.500> it's

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
it also gives a redstone signal so it's

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.759 
it also gives a redstone signal so it's
a<00:04:04.919> a<00:04:05.099> nice<00:04:05.549> sort<00:04:05.760> of<00:04:05.879> anti<00:04:06.269> air<00:04:06.599> protection<00:04:06.989> if

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
get pushed and pushed and there we go so

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.920

the<00:05:26.680> way<00:05:26.770> craft<00:05:27.190> the<00:05:27.340> fan<00:05:27.550> is<00:05:27.789> is<00:05:28.180> by<00:05:28.630> using

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
the way craft the fan is is by using

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.749 
the way craft the fan is is by using
that<00:05:29.440> you<00:05:29.770> don't<00:05:29.919> want<00:05:30.039> me<00:05:30.159> show<00:05:30.310> you<00:05:30.370> there<00:05:30.639> we

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
that you don't want me show you there we

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.180 
that you don't want me show you there we
go<00:05:30.849> is<00:05:31.030> by<00:05:31.449> using<00:05:31.659> cobblestone<00:05:32.380> iron<00:05:32.710> ingots

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
go is by using cobblestone iron ingots

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.460 
go is by using cobblestone iron ingots
and<00:05:33.310> also<00:05:33.789> redstone<00:05:34.360> now<00:05:34.750> all<00:05:34.930> four<00:05:35.259> of<00:05:35.289> these

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
and also redstone now all four of these

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.020 
and also redstone now all four of these
blocks<00:05:35.800> should<00:05:36.070> be<00:05:36.190> implemented<00:05:36.789> in<00:05:36.849> my

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
blocks should be implemented in my

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.670 
blocks should be implemented in my
opinion<00:05:37.360> into<00:05:37.720> Minecraft<00:05:38.259> there<00:05:38.530> and

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
opinion into Minecraft there and

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.350 
opinion into Minecraft there and
hopefully<00:05:39.099> they<00:05:39.400> do<00:05:39.460> maybe<00:05:39.820> some<00:05:40.120> of<00:05:40.270> them

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
hopefully they do maybe some of them

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.110 
hopefully they do maybe some of them
over<00:05:40.750> the<00:05:40.930> others<00:05:41.229> the<00:05:41.889> jump<00:05:42.159> had<00:05:42.430> Ruby<00:05:42.729> forth

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
over the others the jump had Ruby forth

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.320 
over the others the jump had Ruby forth
and<00:05:43.570> the<00:05:44.199> actual<00:05:44.620> fan<00:05:45.070> would<00:05:45.370> be<00:05:45.550> third<00:05:45.849> the

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
and the actual fan would be third the

first there that's my ordering of my
opinion<00:05:51.669> and<00:05:51.849> I<00:05:52.210> give<00:05:52.360> this<00:05:52.449> mod<00:05:52.659> a<00:05:52.780> 9<00:05:53.020> out<00:05:53.199> of

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
opinion and I give this mod a 9 out of

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.140 
opinion and I give this mod a 9 out of
10<00:05:53.500> Ferb's<00:05:53.979> one<00:05:54.400> thing<00:05:54.580> that<00:05:54.699> this<00:05:54.759> mod<00:05:54.969> can

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
10 Ferb's one thing that this mod can

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.010 
10 Ferb's one thing that this mod can
fix<00:05:55.389> up<00:05:55.539> on<00:05:55.719> is<00:05:56.259> the<00:05:56.440> fan<00:05:56.770> maybe<00:05:57.219> a<00:05:57.870> just<00:05:58.870> the

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
fix up on is the fan maybe a just the

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.810 
fix up on is the fan maybe a just the
make<00:05:59.440> it<00:05:59.590> a<00:05:59.650> little<00:05:59.800> bit<00:05:59.949> more<00:06:00.099> smoother<00:06:00.699> the

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
make it a little bit more smoother the

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.670 
make it a little bit more smoother the
animation<00:06:01.360> of<00:06:01.479> that<00:06:01.630> because<00:06:02.259> we<00:06:02.380> don't<00:06:02.560> want

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
animation of that because we don't want

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.620 
animation of that because we don't want
to<00:06:02.740> see<00:06:02.860> any<00:06:03.009> jagged<00:06:03.430> movements<00:06:04.090> in<00:06:04.180> Minecraft

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
to see any jagged movements in Minecraft

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.510 
to see any jagged movements in Minecraft
that<00:06:04.750> doesn't<00:06:05.050> feel<00:06:05.259> or<00:06:05.560> look<00:06:05.889> too<00:06:06.370> appealing

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
that doesn't feel or look too appealing

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.689 
that doesn't feel or look too appealing
to<00:06:07.150> the<00:06:07.599> minecraft<00:06:07.810> user<00:06:08.380> and<00:06:08.860> also<00:06:09.310> the<00:06:09.430> jump

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:09.699 
to the minecraft user and also the jump

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:11.490 
to the minecraft user and also the jump
at<00:06:09.880> being<00:06:10.180> able<00:06:10.330> to<00:06:10.539> get<00:06:10.659> off<00:06:10.810> the<00:06:11.080> jump<00:06:11.259> pad

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
at being able to get off the jump pad

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.709 
at being able to get off the jump pad
nice<00:06:12.219> and<00:06:12.490> safely<00:06:12.880> if<00:06:13.090> you<00:06:13.210> hold<00:06:13.389> the<00:06:13.509> shift

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
nice and safely if you hold the shift

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:15.390 
nice and safely if you hold the shift
key<00:06:13.840> once<00:06:14.199> you<00:06:14.320> jump<00:06:14.500> on<00:06:14.680> the<00:06:14.770> jump<00:06:14.979> pad<00:06:15.190> and

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
key once you jump on the jump pad and

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.550 
key once you jump on the jump pad and
that<00:06:16.360> should<00:06:16.539> stop<00:06:16.780> you<00:06:16.900> from<00:06:17.020> jumping<00:06:17.440> that's

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
that should stop you from jumping that's

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.899 
that should stop you from jumping that's
just<00:06:17.800> my<00:06:17.949> opinion<00:06:17.979> I've<00:06:18.400> seen<00:06:18.610> that<00:06:18.699> in<00:06:18.820> the

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
just my opinion I've seen that in the

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:21.089 
just my opinion I've seen that in the
trampoline<00:06:19.449> mud<00:06:19.659> so<00:06:20.050> I'm<00:06:20.289> just<00:06:20.500> I'm<00:06:20.770> sort<00:06:21.039> of

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:21.099 
trampoline mud so I'm just I'm sort of

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:23.550 
trampoline mud so I'm just I'm sort of
borrowing<00:06:21.550> that<00:06:21.669> idea<00:06:22.030> from<00:06:22.780> the<00:06:23.110> trampling

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
borrowing that idea from the trampling

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.170 
borrowing that idea from the trampling
mod<00:06:23.740> and<00:06:23.919> implementing<00:06:24.490> it<00:06:24.580> into<00:06:24.789> the<00:06:24.880> jump

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
mod and implementing it into the jump

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.060 
mod and implementing it into the jump
pad<00:06:25.389> and<00:06:25.599> that'll<00:06:26.229> make<00:06:26.380> it<00:06:26.440> a<00:06:26.590> much<00:06:26.830> more

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
pad and that'll make it a much more

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.189 
pad and that'll make it a much more
safer<00:06:27.520> experience<00:06:28.120> so<00:06:28.539> I<00:06:28.570> think<00:06:28.900> you<00:06:29.050> guys

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 
safer experience so I think you guys

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:30.990 
safer experience so I think you guys
