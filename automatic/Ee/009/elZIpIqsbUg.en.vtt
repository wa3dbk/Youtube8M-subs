00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
basically gameplay that I get over a

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.529 
basically gameplay that I get over a
week<00:02:07.799> or<00:02:08.190> maybe<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.550> few<00:02:08.759> days

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
week or maybe a few days

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
and I compile it into I guess you can

call<00:02:12.329> it<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.569> mini<00:02:12.810> Taj<00:02:13.019> series<00:02:13.469> if<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.769> have<00:02:13.890> to

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
make them and there I could make them

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.119 
make them and there I could make them
much<00:02:20.730> more<00:02:21.060> frequent<00:02:21.719> than<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.959> montage<00:02:22.379> and<00:02:22.799> if

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
but I feel like if if you play black ops

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.059 
but I feel like if if you play black ops
for<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.389> long<00:03:48.930> time<00:03:49.139> that<00:03:49.169> you'll<00:03:49.709> just<00:03:49.919> become

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
for a long time that you'll just become
