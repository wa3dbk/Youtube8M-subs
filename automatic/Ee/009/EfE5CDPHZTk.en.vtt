essentially<00:00:25.320> cornering<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.800> market<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.220> think

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
essentially cornering the market I think

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.339 
essentially cornering the market I think
at<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.580> point<00:00:26.760> on<00:00:27.060> modern<00:00:27.449> vehicles<00:00:27.660> which

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
at this point on modern vehicles which

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.259 
at this point on modern vehicles which
is<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> good<00:00:28.740> thing<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.010> think<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.849> those<00:00:29.970> people

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
this piece of some flash on it but

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.999 
this piece of some flash on it but
that's<00:01:47.100> not<00:01:47.310> actually<00:01:47.490> used<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.090> that's<00:01:48.270> fine

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009

and<00:01:51.259> again<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.380> like<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> way<00:01:52.740> they<00:01:52.860> wrap

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
and again I like the way they wrap

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.080 
and again I like the way they wrap
things<00:01:53.430> lately<00:01:53.700> with<00:01:53.970> protecting<00:01:55.850> parts<00:01:56.850> like

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
things lately with protecting parts like

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.370 
things lately with protecting parts like
that<00:01:57.119> they<00:01:57.329> have<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> lot<00:01:57.659> less<00:01:57.869> trouble<00:01:58.079> and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
that they have a lot less trouble and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.459 
that they have a lot less trouble and
the<00:01:58.439> one<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> long<00:01:59.040> run

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
the one in the long run

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.319 
the one in the long run
again<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.040> some<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.310> wheels<00:02:02.939> and

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
again this is some of the wheels and

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.330 
again this is some of the wheels and
other<00:02:03.600> coils<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.530> things<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.070> some<00:02:05.250> of

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
other coils and things like that some of

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.819 
other coils and things like that some of
the<00:02:05.430> suspension<00:02:05.939> some<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.020> looks<00:02:07.710> like

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
the suspension some of the looks like

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.680 
the suspension some of the looks like
wishbone<00:02:08.250> ease<00:02:08.459> type<00:02:08.759> suspension<00:02:08.970> pieces

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
wishbone ease type suspension pieces

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.130 
wishbone ease type suspension pieces
there

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
there

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.560 
there
and<00:02:10.880> another<00:02:11.880> section<00:02:12.270> here<00:02:12.330> that's

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
and another section here that's

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.720 
and another section here that's
protected<00:02:13.170> or<00:02:13.290> two<00:02:13.500> sections<00:02:13.920> probably<00:02:14.550> the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
protected or two sections probably the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.420 
protected or two sections probably the
same<00:02:14.940> she<00:02:15.180> traversed<00:02:15.720> maybe<00:02:16.230> yes<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.280> looks

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
same she traversed maybe yes it looks

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.750 
same she traversed maybe yes it looks
like<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:19.260> then<00:02:19.410> we<00:02:19.500> have<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.980> last<00:02:20.340> large

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
like it and then we have the last large

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.200 
like it and then we have the last large
sheet<00:02:21.240> which<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.840> bed<00:02:22.050> or<00:02:22.670> I<00:02:23.670> think<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
sheet which is the bed or I think is the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.050 
sheet which is the bed or I think is the
bed<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.750> truck<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:26.190> might<00:02:26.370> not<00:02:26.550> be<00:02:26.730> not

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
bed of the truck you might not be not

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.280 
bed of the truck you might not be not
sure<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:29.280> one<00:02:29.810> interesting<00:02:30.810> let's<00:02:31.020> see

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
sure and this one interesting let's see

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.930 
sure and this one interesting let's see
I<00:02:31.530> guess<00:02:31.980> we<00:02:32.160> get<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:37.790> seeing<00:02:38.790> how

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
I guess we get to that seeing how

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.550 
I guess we get to that seeing how
they're<00:02:39.090> doing<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.390> yet<00:02:39.860> here's<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.040> cab

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
they're doing it yet here's the cab

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.730 
they're doing it yet here's the cab
again<00:02:43.560> one<00:02:44.250> one<00:02:44.670> piece<00:02:44.940> kind<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.330> nice<00:02:45.740> and

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
again one one piece kind of nice and

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.210 
again one one piece kind of nice and
here's<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.130> front<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.640> vehicle<00:02:47.730> and

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
here's the front of the vehicle and

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.050 
here's the front of the vehicle and
here's<00:02:50.870> part<00:02:51.870> yet<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.530> be<00:02:52.620> identified<00:02:53.060> some

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
here's part yet to be identified some

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.890 
here's part yet to be identified some
