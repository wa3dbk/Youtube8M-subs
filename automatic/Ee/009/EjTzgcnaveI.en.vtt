hours a day for 10 weeks and what is
it's<00:00:56.969> similar<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> technique<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.739> use<00:00:59.010> in

it's similar to a technique we use in

breast reconstruction called tissue

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.160 
breast reconstruction called tissue
expansion<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.879> are<00:01:03.030> pulling<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.690> this

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
expansion that you are pulling on this

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.789 
expansion that you are pulling on this
tissue<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.610> prolonged<00:01:06.299> pulling<00:01:06.960> will

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
tissue and that prolonged pulling will

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.800 
tissue and that prolonged pulling will
pull<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> manufacturer<00:01:09.450> says

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
pull it out and the manufacturer says

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.870 
pull it out and the manufacturer says
that<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.560> good<00:01:10.740> thing<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.189> you're

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
that the good thing is that you're

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.960 
that the good thing is that you're
pulling<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.360> all<00:01:12.479> directions<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.970> got

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
pulling in all directions so you got

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.840 
pulling in all directions so you got
palacios<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:17.009> gravity<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.700> that's

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
palacios and like like gravity so that's

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.480 
palacios and like like gravity so that's
a<00:01:18.000> big<00:01:18.180> plus<00:01:18.330> you're<00:01:19.200> more<00:01:19.740> likely<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.189> get<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
a big plus you're more likely to get a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.340 
a big plus you're more likely to get a
good<00:01:20.700> result<00:01:20.880> if<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:21.900> some<00:01:22.140> breast

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
good result if you have some breast

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.289 
good result if you have some breast
tissue<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.770> begin<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.939> don't<00:01:24.150> have

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
tissue to begin with if you don't have

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.149 
tissue to begin with if you don't have
any<00:01:24.479> Brett's<00:01:24.780> breast<00:01:25.110> tissue<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.619> stretch<00:01:25.890> out

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
any Brett's breast tissue to stretch out

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.640 
any Brett's breast tissue to stretch out
probably<00:01:27.150> not<00:01:27.299> going<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.509> see<00:01:27.750> big<00:01:28.229> games<00:01:28.470> but

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
probably not going to see big games but

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.740 
probably not going to see big games but
the<00:01:28.740> company<00:01:29.159> claims<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.720> can

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
the company claims that you can you can

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.960 
the company claims that you can you can
increase<00:01:31.380> from<00:01:31.590> anywhere<00:01:32.070> from<00:01:32.130> half<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.729> cup

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
increase from anywhere from half a cup

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.910 
increase from anywhere from half a cup
and<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.780> would<00:01:33.930> guess<00:01:34.140> that's<00:01:34.380> somebody's

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
and I would guess that's somebody's

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.740 
and I would guess that's somebody's
small<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:36.060> actually<00:01:36.450> two<00:01:36.630> cup<00:01:36.869> size<00:01:38.210> $995<00:01:39.210> for
