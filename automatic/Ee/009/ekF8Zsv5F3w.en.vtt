of<00:00:39.989> us<00:00:40.140> had<00:00:40.350> parents<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.920> were<00:00:41.100> baby<00:00:41.730> boomers

and potentially disillusioned hippies

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.819 
and potentially disillusioned hippies
they<00:00:45.210> supported<00:00:45.690> our<00:00:45.809> creative<00:00:46.230> side<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
they supported our creative side and

they supported our creative side and
somehow<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.700> caught<00:00:48.120> their<00:00:48.360> idealism<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.260> now

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
somehow we caught their idealism and now

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.709 
somehow we caught their idealism and now
we're<00:00:49.890> interested<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.879> structure<00:00:51.510> of

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
we're interested in the structure of

we're interested in the structure of
money<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.440> think<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.280> gonna<00:00:53.399> be<00:00:53.579> really

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
money I think it's gonna be really

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.049 
money I think it's gonna be really
incumbent<00:00:54.180> upon<00:00:54.860> those<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.129> us<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.850> whom

incumbent upon those of us for whom

incumbent upon those of us for whom
digital<00:00:57.750> technology<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.350> more<00:00:58.530> natural<00:00:58.739> to

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
digital technology is more natural to

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.380 
digital technology is more natural to
invent<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> systems<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.140> future<00:01:05.390> how

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
invent the systems of the future how

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.410 
invent the systems of the future how
many<00:01:06.659> great<00:01:06.930> ideas<00:01:07.320> out<00:01:07.500> there<00:01:07.560> are<00:01:08.340> buried<00:01:09.299> in

the backs of the minds of people of
young<00:01:11.490> students<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> lot<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.290> who

just don't have the ability to pursue

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.899 
just don't have the ability to pursue
them<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.439> shackling<00:01:17.220> our<00:01:17.400> innovators

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
them it's like shackling our innovators

and if you can base credit on future
potential<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.380> needs<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.590> lot<00:01:31.680> more<00:01:31.740> people

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
potential that needs a lot more people

potential that needs a lot more people
in<00:01:32.159> financial<00:01:32.610> inclusion<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.630> actually<00:01:34.110> not

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
in financial inclusion it's actually not

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.560 
in financial inclusion it's actually not
a<00:01:34.290> question<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.310> pay<00:01:35.610> for<00:01:36.150> what<00:01:36.390> you

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
a question that you pay for what you

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.219 
a question that you pay for what you
already<00:01:36.780> got<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:38.490> actually<00:01:39.090> pay<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:39.689> what

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
already got you actually pay for what

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.370 
already got you actually pay for what
you<00:01:40.380> will<00:01:40.650> get<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.909> things<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:43.079> made

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
you will get the things that can be made

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.960 
you will get the things that can be made
because<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.729> paid

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
because you paid

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.640 
because you paid
I<00:01:48.630> think<00:01:49.630> one<00:01:49.810> of<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:50.020> things<00:01:50.260> that's<00:01:50.440> going

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
I think one of the things that's going

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.320 
I think one of the things that's going
on<00:01:50.800> right<00:01:50.860> now<00:01:51.280> is<00:01:51.580> a<00:01:52.710> reexamination<00:01:53.710> of<00:01:53.860> value

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
on right now is a reexamination of value

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.550 
on right now is a reexamination of value
and<00:01:55.330> of<00:01:55.960> wealth<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.680> of<00:01:57.670> assets<00:01:58.300> and<00:01:59.140> a<00:01:59.260> lot<00:01:59.530> of

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
and of wealth and of assets and a lot of

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.200 
and of wealth and of assets and a lot of
words<00:01:59.890> that<00:02:00.220> have<00:02:00.370> a<00:02:00.400> lot<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:00.790> do<00:02:00.910> with<00:02:01.060> money

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
words that have a lot to do with money

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.180 
words that have a lot to do with money
but<00:02:01.540> really<00:02:01.840> aren't<00:02:01.990> about<00:02:02.260> money<00:02:02.470> money

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
but really aren't about money money

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.430 
but really aren't about money money
itself<00:02:03.610> seems<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.330> be<00:02:04.510> a<00:02:04.540> mystery<00:02:04.930> for<00:02:05.230> most

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
itself seems to be a mystery for most

business and I do think that there's a

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.860 
business and I do think that there's a
great<00:06:46.330> money-making<00:06:48.070> opportunity<00:06:49.070> and

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:49.870 
great money-making opportunity and

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.600 
great money-making opportunity and
currency<00:06:50.870> innovation<00:06:51.440> so<00:06:51.830> that<00:06:51.860> rather<00:06:52.340> than

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
currency innovation so that rather than

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.190 
currency innovation so that rather than
simply<00:06:52.910> innovating<00:06:53.600> in<00:06:53.720> terms<00:06:53.960> of<00:06:54.080> the

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
simply innovating in terms of the

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.830 
simply innovating in terms of the
financial<00:06:54.860> instruments<00:06:55.640> built<00:06:55.850> on<00:06:56.120> top<00:06:56.570> of

the current currency system you go
