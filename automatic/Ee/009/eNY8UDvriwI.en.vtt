offseason<00:01:44.640> we<00:01:44.729> finally<00:01:45.090> finished<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.570> season

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
offseason we finally finished a season

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.620 
offseason we finally finished a season
we're<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> offseason<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.909> we<00:01:48.420> get

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
we're going to the offseason and we get

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.690 
we're going to the offseason and we get
a<00:01:48.840> really<00:01:49.259> fun<00:01:49.500> draft<00:01:49.829> upcoming<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
a really fun draft upcoming and

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.569 
a really fun draft upcoming and
obviously<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.439> two<00:01:52.710> first-round<00:01:52.950> picks

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
obviously we have two first-round picks

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.670 
obviously we have two first-round picks
because<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.180> rg3<00:01:54.810> trade<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> couple<00:01:55.500> years

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
because of the rg3 trade a couple years

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.219 
because of the rg3 trade a couple years
ago<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.820> Redskins<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.450> season<00:01:57.780> one<00:01:57.990> they

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
ago and the Redskins in season one they

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.149 
ago and the Redskins in season one they
did<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.409> little<00:01:58.590> better<00:01:58.770> than<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.009> had<00:01:59.130> hoped

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
did a little better than I had hoped

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.219 
did a little better than I had hoped
they<00:01:59.490> would<00:01:59.670> do<00:01:59.880> nine<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.450> seven<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.110> get

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
they would do nine and seven so we get

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.319 
they would do nine and seven so we get
about<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.560> mid<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.009> high-teens<00:02:02.189> pick<00:02:03.030> along

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
about a mid to high-teens pick along

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.690 
about a mid to high-teens pick along
with<00:02:03.540> our<00:02:03.719> first<00:02:04.140> round<00:02:04.469> pick<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.009> I've

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
with our first round pick and I've

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.069 
with our first round pick and I've
looked<00:02:05.880> through<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.210> scouting<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.750> haven't

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
looked through the scouting I haven't

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.260 
looked through the scouting I haven't
spent<00:02:07.320> too<00:02:07.439> many<00:02:07.530> scouting<00:02:08.039> points<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:09.030> I've

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
spent too many scouting points but I've

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.999 
spent too many scouting points but I've
saved<00:02:09.539> most<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:10.020> them<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.379> offseason<00:02:10.979> so

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
saved most of them for the offseason so

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.710 
saved most of them for the offseason so
we<00:02:11.280> could<00:02:11.430> use<00:02:11.580> them<00:02:11.790> after<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.300> year<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.569> over

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
we could use them after the year is over

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.490 
we could use them after the year is over
we<00:02:13.140> know

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
we know

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.860 
we know
the<00:02:14.010> positions<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.700> need<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:15.450> we<00:02:15.570> can<00:02:15.690> focus

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
the positions of need that we can focus

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.690 
the positions of need that we can focus
on<00:02:16.170> scouting<00:02:16.410> points<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:17.010> those<00:02:17.250> positions

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
on scouting points on those positions

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.360 
on scouting points on those positions
and<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.780> have<00:02:18.930> like<00:02:19.100> 44,000<00:02:20.100> right<00:02:20.220> now

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
and so I have like 44,000 right now

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.860 
and so I have like 44,000 right now
banked<00:02:20.820> up<00:02:20.940> we're<00:02:21.120> going<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.300> use<00:02:21.510> those<00:02:21.720> in

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
banked up we're going to use those in

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.300 
banked up we're going to use those in

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.890 
the live stream and we're going to go
through<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.550> positions<00:02:24.030> find<00:02:24.360> players<00:02:24.690> that

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
through the positions find players that

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.660 
through the positions find players that
can<00:02:25.020> potentially<00:02:25.110> become<00:02:25.620> st.<00:02:26.160> Louis<00:02:26.430> Rams

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670
