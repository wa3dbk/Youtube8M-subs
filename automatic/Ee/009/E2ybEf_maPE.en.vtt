 reasons why people buy this 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.239
 It's very nice that they motivate the purchase of 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.060
 where the impulse of a person or 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.620
 from a customer to buy there are different 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.450
 reasons there are different relationships for 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.610
 that someone can buy a product or 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.070
 a service but the people and the customers 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.110
 they buy for their reasons not for yours 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.120
 not because your product is very good 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.270
 very cheap it is very pretty very tasty 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.479
 people buy for their reasons not for 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.390
 yours then you to be successful and 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.210
 to be able to sell better you must focus on your 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.360
 needs not yours to those of 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.070

 because he buys good people because 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.840
 has a reason that reason we are going to 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.970
 call the ndp people buy because 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.100

 they mean those acronyms of the word n 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.140
 of ope good people buy because 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.479
 have a need or people buy 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.100
 because you have a desire or a client you 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.080
 buy because it has a goal a 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.930
 customer buys because he has a problem 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.330
 and wants to fix what this means 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.270
 good people buy for a need 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.190
 because he is missing or because he has a lack 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.770
 something people buy because they have a 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.229
 desire aspires something or has some 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.420
 I long for some dream or people buy 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.760
 because he has a goal he wants to achieve something 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.200
 wants to achieve something or people buy 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.540
 because he has a problem he has a 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.840
 difficulty has an impediment has 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.160
 a disappointment then someone who 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.020
 buy a product you are going to buy 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.250
 any of those four reasons we're going 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.950
 to give an example that will help us 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.810
 much imagine oranges these are 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.050
 oranges are oranges that are sold in 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.250
 we are not going to sell them and we 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.160
 we are going to face four clients 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.500
 that can buy us then this is 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.650
 a 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.150
 a restaurant wants to buy oranges 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.750
 Well, he's going to buy it out of necessity 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.850
 because he has a lack or a lack 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.520
 the lack or lack that you see above 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.860
 it means that you stay without trying 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.050
 product I will often call you if 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.080
 he is missing product he is going to buy 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.360
 oranges to you to solve that 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.800
 need you have but another restaurant 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.770
 You can buy oranges because you have a 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.380
 I wish because I want to have a more menu 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.350
 natural to offer their clients or 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.390
 another customer can buy oranges for 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.890
 his restaurant because he wants to improve his 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.870
 average sale at breakfast is 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.630
 say if you sell an orange juice goes to 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.820
 sell 10 pesos more or 15 pesos more or 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.420
 someone can buy orange because 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:28.300
 have a problem does not sell the juice well 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.890
 packaging people do not like and that is 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.230
 the problem that you have then give 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.090
 account although it is the same product that 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.220
 offers you the same restaurant there 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.110
 various reasons why someone is going to 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.910
 buy as a restaurateur like today in 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.360
 the cafeteria nothing else we will see another 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.950
 example let's see it with nopales this 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.750
 is a housewife in a restaurant is 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.230
 a housewife who goes to buy nopales 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.209
 very well 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.190
 let's see what you are 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.060
 offering your product is cactus in 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.520
 brine 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.160
 for housewife very well is in zamora 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.140
 there is a cup by necessity this mistress of 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.400
 home you say you know that I do not time that no 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.160
 I have time to cook 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.319
 so how do I lack time like I do? 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.130
 lack of time 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:14.819
 I buy in brine not and bottled or two 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.919
 a woman has a desire they aspired the 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.739
 something she is going to compare this nopal 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.870
 because he wants to lose weight or other people 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.090
 he will do it because he has a goal which is 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.580
 your goal needs to increase the 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.860
 amount of fiber you consume in your 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.979
 daily diet and someone because he has a 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.440
 problem you put the normal cool no 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.660
 has way you have to understand by 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.400
 what customers buy what are their 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.590
 needs when you understand 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.810
 essentials you stop selling the 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.320
 people start buying very well 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.790
 then who will sell better then 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.310
 as it says who the image is not being 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.980
 donkey who sells better who wants 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:57.380

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.560
 the problems and the wishes of the client 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.449
 who understands that and satisfies this 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.720
 is something very important the truth is that 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:11.330
 The customer does not buy products 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.300
 client does not buy services the client 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.540
