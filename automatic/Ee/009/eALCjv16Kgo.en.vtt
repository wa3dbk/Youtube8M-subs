00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.270
 speaking staff see you are talking about and 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.580
 welcome to another video on 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.389
 Today's video we have new skins 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:16.049
 exactly not two, not three 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:19.770
 six new skins that are in tb them 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.640
 were officially announced yesterday and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.769
 today I came to do it for you, it's a little 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.240
 more in the details and how they are in 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.519
 guinea 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.090
 reminding the staff that it is already the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.059
 pb and can undergo changes 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.149
 ok we have 12 skins I'm not mistaken is the 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.840
 braga soon driven that they are without 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.360
 so I believe that something in the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.770
 their voice may change it is not 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.489
 sure but we'll have to wait 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.010
 to see 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.949
 and if you really change there I 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.960
 I bring video to you as you already 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.129
 they know they are not accustomed 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.230
 Good, I'll speak the name of the 15 then and I 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.000
 The English way is because in Portuguese 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.100
 did not officially leave the business of 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.240
 bring rumor does not speak english 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.590
 we have the star prime time drive and 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:17.909
 super duck fan striker luke go keeper 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:21.170
 malka and jet kart all this is done only the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.780
 skis there to celebrate the world cup 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.680
 which I do not know people used 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.869
 released is not because it has 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.500
 also other football all research 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.479
 more with your football and maybe they 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.689
 are also released during 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.700
 together with the new 500 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.000
 I have to wait and see I have almost 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.090
 sure but I can not say here that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.860
 I 'm not sure there's still 15 she 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.090
 it's priceless 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.810
 Believe me, I came by 975 or maybe 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.020
 some net site promotion in a good mood or 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.229
 95 I believe that how are you? 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.560
 seeing they are simple skins not only changes 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.860
 there's really a schin champion clothing 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.370
 not change is the skills in nothing to 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.310
 only one that has an ass 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.159
 hearing is a little more significant is 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.830
 drive that might change the lines 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:23.019
 him and also changes Rick to his because 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.879
 the other people I showed a good boy 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.879
 because it does not change 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:31.599
 It's all overpriced - except for the drive that 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:36.519
 Then you'll see the video is good. 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:41.430
 after having seen all 15 of my 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:45.400
 opinion I thought they stayed 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.829
 Simple I do not know if I explain, maybe 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.890
 I did not wait, I do not know, they stayed 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.970
 a little yes 15 too many maybe the ones I 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.890
 more like 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.379
 out of the bank falls that you are seeing 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.010
 now I loved this fall node chile was 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:02.769
 super cool is it fact he will play 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.480
 little trees his skin must go to the ball 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:10.720
 and have 11 on the beam upon it if then 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.290
 I found super super fantastic advocaat 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.920
 I liked drugs too, so you go. 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.450
 to see 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.269
 I think after that I found drugs well 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:27.370
 cool, I thought it was weird doing some 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:30.400
 fifth, because after the ric of the 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.010
 because they made him the braga if all 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.889
 world knows that it has been half and 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.349
 maybe they did six to go back 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:41.199
 to encourage the people to play right 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.510
 I do not know 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:46.419
 and there is also another one that I liked was the 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.930
 driver that looked different I do not know if 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:52.840
 It's good maybe they chose drive by theme 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.449
 but the drive the champion that que esq 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.750
 His gladiator has not left for so long. 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:04:00.970
 and there are many other champions who 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.889
 could their spin 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.019
 but perhaps because of time and by 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.660
 cause of the champion's personality and they 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.250
 They found all the game would be better there 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.109
 receive this schin 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.090
 I would particularly choose another one 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.989
 The worst thing is that there's no time without 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.599
 to receive 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.849
 skin are you going or drugs drugs guy 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:22.169
 believe even the piggy bank then it is 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:24.610
 really is a fan of the same 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.720
 way to paint the face painted the hair 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.450
 and 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.850
 a safe appeared that we know how to 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.820
 is that it's fans and stadium and only 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.040
 the goods more plump and full of good 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.080
 You're in heaven, right? 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.930
 you saw that the ax it turns out that 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.870
 now saw two microphones that would be 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.610
 he is the narrator, right? 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.500
 I do not know what the translation will be like 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.690
 that today he would be the narrator 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.690
 there and the other champions 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:56.800
 taking braga are the players and the braga 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.680
 joe the fan 10 is you see what changes 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.800
 a little bit from the particle of the 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.020
 that of him when he throws the find 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.280
 has a different animation that is a 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.180
 microphone 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.930
 so everything indicating there is a narrator is 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.900
 same 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.080
 So people, how do you know the ones that 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.100
 It has no release date but it prevents 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.800
 I'm going to throw it with this cup with the 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.080
 cup begins on the 12th and not 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.150
 release with the opening of the 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.760
 Day 12 We 'll have to wait and see. 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.280

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.410

 You 're going to buy it for sure. 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.950
 you need to have 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.220
 so this is what I hope you have 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.440

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.720
