clock riddle which is pretty easy to do
if<00:03:42.670> you<00:03:42.760> know<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.030> solution<00:03:43.210> which<00:03:43.660> happens

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
if you know the solution which happens

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
need for the one hundred percent sync

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.870 
need for the one hundred percent sync
just<00:04:19.560> keep<00:04:19.739> going<00:04:20.040> towards<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.459> objective

just keep going towards the objective

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.650 
just keep going towards the objective
marker<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:22.610> you<00:04:23.610> get<00:04:23.730> a<00:04:23.760> cut<00:04:24.000> scene<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.510> then
