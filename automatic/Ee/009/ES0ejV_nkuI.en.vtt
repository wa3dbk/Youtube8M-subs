I go back I can pop and chip it and
break<00:01:48.509> all<00:01:48.720> these<00:01:48.899> pieces<00:01:49.229> back<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.880> that's

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
break all these pieces back and that's

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.249 
break all these pieces back and that's
what's<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> give<00:01:51.570> me<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.720> really<00:01:52.079> nice

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
what's going to give me a really nice

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.990 
what's going to give me a really nice
look<00:01:53.840> what<00:01:54.840> I'm<00:01:54.930> using<00:01:55.280> for<00:01:56.280> plaster<00:01:56.790> is

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
look what I'm using for plaster is

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.510 
look what I'm using for plaster is
Tuscan<00:01:57.899> stone<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:59.090> I<00:02:00.090> really<00:02:00.810> like<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.170> it's

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
Tuscan stone and I really like it it's

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.179 
Tuscan stone and I really like it it's
it's<00:02:02.520> nice<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.939> creamy<00:02:03.210> as<00:02:03.920> you<00:02:04.920> know<00:02:05.070> I've

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
it's nice and creamy as you know I've

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.300 
it's nice and creamy as you know I've
used<00:02:05.219> darkest<00:02:05.729> tone<00:02:05.939> in<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.149> past<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.950> some

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
used darkest tone in the past and some

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.400 
used darkest tone in the past and some
some<00:02:08.789> difficulties<00:02:09.450> with<00:02:09.479> it

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
some difficulties with it

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.340 
some difficulties with it
some<00:02:11.190> cracking<00:02:11.520> here<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.150> there<00:02:15.110> which<00:02:16.110> for

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
some cracking here and there which for

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.390 
some cracking here and there which for
this<00:02:16.500> look<00:02:16.710> probably<00:02:17.100> isn't<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.460> bad<00:02:17.700> but

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
this look probably isn't that bad but

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.430 
this look probably isn't that bad but
who<00:02:20.400> likes<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.880> have<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.660> deal<00:02:21.870> with<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.110> if

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
who likes to have to deal with that if

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.030 
who likes to have to deal with that if
it<00:02:22.890> ever<00:02:22.950> becomes<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.460> problem<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:25.440> Tuscan

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
it ever becomes a problem so Tuscan

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.460 
it ever becomes a problem so Tuscan
stone<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.700> what<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.330> did<00:02:27.600> was<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:28.020> combine

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
stone and what I did was I combine

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.750 
stone and what I did was I combine
several<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.160> their<00:02:29.310> colors<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:32.430> i'll<00:02:32.580> have

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
several of their colors and i'll have

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
what those colors I'm just going to just

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.150 
what those colors I'm just going to just
basically<00:02:38.580> put<00:02:39.060> all<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:39.330> stuff<00:02:39.570> up<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:41.010> can

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.990 
basically put all this stuff up you can
see<00:02:41.400> I'm<00:02:41.520> just<00:02:41.870> being<00:02:42.870> real<00:02:43.050> random<00:02:43.820> with<00:02:44.820> my

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
see I'm just being real random with my

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.470 
see I'm just being real random with my
mind<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:47.370> plasterers<00:02:48.030> out<00:02:48.180> there<00:02:48.360> are

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
mind you plasterers out there are

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.080 
mind you plasterers out there are
probably<00:02:48.690> cringing<00:02:52.460> but<00:02:53.460> I'm<00:02:53.550> really<00:02:53.910> just

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
probably cringing but I'm really just

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:05.720 
probably cringing but I'm really just
looking<00:02:54.210> for<00:03:00.110> just<00:03:01.110> basic<00:03:01.350> coverage

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.450 

and<00:03:06.730> also<00:03:07.120> before<00:03:07.780> my<00:03:07.960> mud<00:03:08.560> gets<00:03:08.770> it<00:03:09.310> has<00:03:09.430> a

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
and also before my mud gets it has a

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.640 
and also before my mud gets it has a
chance<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.850> dry<00:03:10.240> I'm<00:03:11.200> going<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.380> go<00:03:11.440> back<00:03:11.620> and

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
chance to dry I'm going to go back and

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.150 
chance to dry I'm going to go back and
lift<00:03:12.430> my<00:03:12.610> tape<00:03:13.290> because<00:03:14.290> if<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:14.650> don't<00:03:14.830> your

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
lift my tape because if you don't your

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.700 
lift my tape because if you don't your
tapes<00:03:15.400> just<00:03:15.640> going<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.820> get<00:03:16.320> welded<00:03:17.320> into
