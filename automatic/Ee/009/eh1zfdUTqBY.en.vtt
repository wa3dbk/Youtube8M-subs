00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
a brave design choice this wasn't a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.569 
a brave design choice this wasn't a
fiscal<00:01:00.989> decision<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.530> fact<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.190> choice<00:01:02.399> has

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
fiscal decision in fact this choice has

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.219 
fiscal decision in fact this choice has
almost<00:01:02.789> certainly<00:01:03.030> lost<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.719> company<00:01:03.989> money

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229

but<00:01:04.589> they<00:01:04.710> made<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:04.979> because<00:01:05.430> they<00:01:05.549> felt<00:01:05.729> like

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
but they made it because they felt like

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.700 
but they made it because they felt like
it<00:01:06.030> was<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.180> right<00:01:06.299> choice<00:01:06.510> they<00:01:07.350> made<00:01:07.560> it

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
it was the right choice they made it

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.410 
it was the right choice they made it
because<00:01:08.010> they<00:01:08.220> felt<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.520> without<00:01:09.090> taking

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420

anything away from the game they could

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.500 
anything away from the game they could
use<00:01:11.340> design<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.060> give<00:01:12.180> us<00:01:12.270> another

look like you in a first-person game
okay<00:03:02.120> but<00:03:02.450> just<00:03:02.630> imagine<00:03:03.290> what<00:03:03.440> that<00:03:03.590> means

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
okay but just imagine what that means

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.800 
okay but just imagine what that means

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
character that looks like them think

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.900 
character that looks like them think
about<00:03:12.110> how<00:03:12.440> many<00:03:12.500> people<00:03:12.740> lose<00:03:13.280> out<00:03:13.610> on<00:03:13.640> the

about how many people lose out on the

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
everyone my only complaint with the

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.910 
everyone my only complaint with the
diversity<00:03:23.660> in<00:03:23.780> rust<00:03:24.050> is<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.470> right<00:03:24.709> now

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
diversity in rust is that right now

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.560 
diversity in rust is that right now
they've<00:03:25.190> only<00:03:25.340> got<00:03:25.550> one<00:03:25.580> character<00:03:26.120> model<00:03:26.420> and

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
they've only got one character model and

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.020 
they've only got one character model and
it's<00:03:26.989> male<00:03:27.200> but<00:03:27.709> as<00:03:28.040> it's<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.430> survival<00:03:28.880> game

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
it's male but as it's a survival game

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.699 
it's male but as it's a survival game
where<00:03:29.300> you<00:03:29.420> start<00:03:29.660> out<00:03:29.810> completely<00:03:30.200> naked

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
where you start out completely naked

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.770 
where you start out completely naked
I<00:03:31.190> unfortunately<00:03:31.970> understand<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.600> choice

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
I unfortunately understand the choice

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.720 
I unfortunately understand the choice
it's<00:03:33.320> pretty<00:03:33.560> depressing<00:03:33.709> that<00:03:34.160> not<00:03:34.400> giving

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
it's pretty depressing that not giving

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.430 
it's pretty depressing that not giving
players<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.090> naked<00:03:35.450> female<00:03:35.630> character<00:03:36.170> model

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
players a naked female character model

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.990 
players a naked female character model
because<00:03:36.739> of<00:03:36.860> what<00:03:37.100> it<00:03:37.220> would<00:03:37.340> do<00:03:37.550> to<00:03:37.580> your<00:03:37.790> game

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
because of what it would do to your game

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.750 
because of what it would do to your game
makes<00:03:38.420> sense<00:03:38.570> but<00:03:39.200> there<00:03:39.739> it<00:03:39.860> is<00:03:39.890> I<00:03:40.190> hope<00:03:40.580> they

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
makes sense but there it is I hope they

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.820 
makes sense but there it is I hope they
can<00:03:40.910> find<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.209> solution<00:03:41.660> but<00:03:42.170> despite<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:42.620> I

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
can find the solution but despite that I

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.530 
can find the solution but despite that I
think<00:03:43.160> there's<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.370> lot<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.790> learn<00:03:43.970> from<00:03:44.030> rust

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
think there's a lot to learn from rust

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.330 
think there's a lot to learn from rust
because<00:03:44.810> rust<00:03:45.290> shows<00:03:45.620> us<00:03:45.800> just<00:03:45.830> how<00:03:46.190> much

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
because rust shows us just how much

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.979 
because rust shows us just how much
impact<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.180> game<00:03:47.360> can<00:03:47.600> have<00:03:47.810> on<00:03:47.959> our

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
impact a game can have on our

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.960 
impact a game can have on our
understanding<00:03:48.739> of<00:03:48.800> society<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.489> each<00:03:49.700> other

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
understanding of society and each other

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.520 
understanding of society and each other
without<00:03:50.450> hitting<00:03:50.690> us<00:03:50.900> over<00:03:51.020> the<00:03:51.170> head<00:03:51.260> with

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
without hitting us over the head with

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.500 
without hitting us over the head with
the<00:03:51.680> message<00:03:51.980> without<00:03:52.340> even<00:03:52.790> impacting<00:03:53.270> play

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
the message without even impacting play

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.020 
the message without even impacting play
a<00:03:53.750> game<00:03:54.290> doesn't<00:03:54.650> have<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:54.890> be<00:03:55.010> about<00:03:55.459> race<00:03:55.820> to

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
a game doesn't have to be about race to

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.850 
a game doesn't have to be about race to
teach<00:03:56.330> us<00:03:56.480> about<00:03:56.750> race<00:03:56.989> or<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.500> get<00:03:57.650> us<00:03:57.739> to

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
teach us about race or to get us to

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.590 
teach us about race or to get us to
better<00:03:58.010> understand<00:03:58.580> ourselves<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:59.239> to

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
better understand ourselves and to

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.720 
better understand ourselves and to
better<00:03:59.780> understand<00:04:00.230> one<00:04:00.440> another<00:04:00.680> instead<00:04:01.400> it

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
better understand one another instead it

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.670 
better understand one another instead it
only<00:04:01.910> has<00:04:02.239> to<00:04:02.390> just<00:04:02.600> give<00:04:02.810> us<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:02.989> tiniest

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
only has to just give us the tiniest

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.350 
only has to just give us the tiniest
taste<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:04.220> what<00:04:04.520> it<00:04:04.610> can<00:04:04.700> be<00:04:04.850> like<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.209> be

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
taste of what it can be like to be
