 what else will we know us 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.010
 alpha testing of dota 2 was once 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:45.660
 everyone knows it and can do this 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.960
 Here is the fortress was in testing dough 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:52.220

 I will try maybe how the fountain works 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:11.940
 if i put here to nothing 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:15.380
 It happens they wanted to do this already 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.060
 forgot how called but I understood 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.020
 a fortress of light such was supposed to be yes 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.100
 but it looks like this so what else can 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.100
 beat to make 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.150
 You know I saw there is such a cockroach 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.909
 cockroach 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.860
 which can be controlled if they are not on 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.980
 causes no damage and can 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.970
 drive and she is very timely place 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:48.000
 germana slit girls as usual bloodworm and 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:53.079
 I washed these freaks out 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.840
 in attack but malaise they inflict 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.690
 just then the joke do not know why them 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.250
 not removed from here 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:05.079
 it is not clear at all it is not clear who knows 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.870
 courier if i'm not mistaken this is a courier 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:14.920
 black mane to do now 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:20.379
 look only he has the strength he has 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:28.140
 there are bane's powers only they somehow don't 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:32.250
 yuzayu went bar 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.530
 the fact is, and this can happen here 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:40.310
 make not only such a form make and 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:43.830
 such as we can now do and just 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.340
 you can do this too 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.590
 lina 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:55.110
 but you can do it and if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:58.770
 green greens how it is 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.300
 and just go with them usually 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.560
 couriers and here already 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.880
 attacking until then, so let this 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:13.970
 probably all discuss while there is time 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:20.100
 you know was once even perfect 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:24.850
 served in the frame will be because I cleaned 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:29.919
 and with perry as he calls see 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.100
 you know the rush little thing dry the sand a 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:36.710
 let's 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:41.660
 Twins arranged the world Auchan having filled up Roshan 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.860
 who who are you there 350 have this gotta 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.740
 hammer on those 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:50.870
 why does he not beat him very strange 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:55.330
 Now this later to make it more Roshan 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.330
 can do can do 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.340
 the building also has some kind of flip 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.700
 alpha testing when only 1 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.800
 dota was designed like this 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.650
 just this is most likely here goes 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:15.640
 garbage building yes I realized what it is 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.640
 yes listening and it will be possible 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.500
 agis take no aegis he will not take 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:24.610
 fucking neighbors thanks for being you 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.610
 repairs started to do 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:34.349
 and now we are some ancient hunter 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:38.729
 made see this we have a bat 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:45.690
 so let's say they, too, should have 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:50.639
 be in dota 2 but for some reason they added 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:56.220
 although still noman that you still have and 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:59.250
 did not give the name of this garbage invisible 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:03.870
 hrenovina called here we have it 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:08.659
 that something is not clear that she even 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.659
 there is a whole damage and she beats 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.780
 invisible crap just called so 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.690
 probably some garbage should 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.840
 it could be awesome but if there is 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.310
 damage means something living and 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.909
 let's see what else is left and 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:32.460
 stayed 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:34.949
 media villas and it is not written courier he 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.979
 fighting just remember the courier with 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:40.800
 international who gave it to everyone 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:44.129
 here is a fight who runs 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.590
 only a table if it is not a courier why 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:58.409
 nothing shines on us let 's go 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:07:00.449
 Our gang where I attack the cattle is not ebay 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:03.840
 I donâ€™t know what it is 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:05.810
 there was to be couriers as I understand that 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.840
 should have but create bullshit when 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:11.669
 did when the international planned here 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.439
 it was last year that there was a conclusion 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:17.039
 such couriers if I'm not mistaken 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:19.650
 go that I don't remember it anymore 

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:22.110
 I do not understand what kind of garbage but such here 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.300
 10 things I should have painted h5 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.370
 today but these are the 10 things we have 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.599
 at dota 2 when you which we are on the verge 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.020
 cinema dota 

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:36.150
 when you just can by 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:39.569
 addicted to friends can make your 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:42.240
 show show let's say that we challenge 

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:44.879
 there will be dragons and rate them 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.849
 dragons let friends or disputes 

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:49.560
 the mystics of this tower is the fortress of light 

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:52.229
 there should have been such a mole 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:55.110
 once asked the doctor the like 

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:57.419
 that is, you can safely talk about it 

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:59.129
 talk to your friends show 

00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:01.650
 im that there is such a blow if you this 

00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:03.479
 interesting there is a reference in the description field 

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:07.270
 More precisely not a reference in the description is all 

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:10.470
 so let's say cheat codes to 4 

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:13.300
 someone slapped that you are 

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:15.340
 saw what I calmly took advantage of 

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.440
 and you can use them torah so 

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:20.670
 that this is all to new meetings all 

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.670
 good luck everyone bye
