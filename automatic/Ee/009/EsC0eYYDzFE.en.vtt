00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
is lighter there's much more

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.200 
is lighter there's much more
transparency<00:02:02.100> than<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.550> dresses<00:02:03.000> the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
transparency than the dresses the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.780 
transparency than the dresses the
layering<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:04.140> each<00:02:04.440> dress<00:02:04.830> it<00:02:05.220> looks<00:02:05.520> like

layering of each dress it looks like

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.120 
layering of each dress it looks like
it's<00:02:06.000> simple<00:02:06.300> but<00:02:06.930> there's<00:02:07.260> a<00:02:07.410> lot<00:02:07.620> more<00:02:07.860> work

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
it's simple but there's a lot more work

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.969 
it's simple but there's a lot more work
in<00:02:08.460> them<00:02:08.729> initially<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:10.170> determine<00:02:10.770> what

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
in them initially to determine what

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:24.180 
in them initially to determine what
colors<00:02:11.400> are<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.120> under<00:02:12.390> layer

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.220 

it<00:02:25.190> was<00:02:25.520> a<00:02:25.550> lot<00:02:25.940> of<00:02:25.970> effort<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.690> come<00:02:26.870> up<00:02:27.020> with<00:02:27.200> a

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
it was a lot of effort to come up with a

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.340 
it was a lot of effort to come up with a
collection<00:02:27.830> like<00:02:27.860> this<00:02:28.100> one<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:29.420> handwork<00:02:29.900> is

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
collection like this one the handwork is

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.860 
collection like this one the handwork is
immense<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.340> it's<00:02:31.520> a<00:02:31.790> tremendous<00:02:32.390> amount<00:02:32.660> of

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
immense and it's a tremendous amount of

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.060 
immense and it's a tremendous amount of
work<00:02:33.140> but<00:02:34.040> we<00:02:34.220> did<00:02:34.430> starts<00:02:34.940> way<00:02:35.180> before

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
work but we did starts way before

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.100 
work but we did starts way before
knowing<00:02:37.070> that<00:02:37.280> three<00:02:37.820> weeks<00:02:38.210> before<00:02:38.720> we<00:02:38.930> had

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
knowing that three weeks before we had

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.980 
knowing that three weeks before we had
another<00:02:39.680> ready-to-wear<00:02:40.370> show<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.850> do<00:02:41.150> so<00:02:41.480> this

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
another ready-to-wear show to do so this

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.350 
another ready-to-wear show to do so this
was<00:02:42.260> well<00:02:42.530> thought<00:02:42.890> of<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.700> is<00:02:43.850> not<00:02:44.060> something

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
was well thought of it is not something

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.780 
was well thought of it is not something
we<00:02:44.600> put<00:02:44.780> together<00:02:44.960> just<00:02:45.320> like<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:45.860> I've<00:02:46.520> been

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
we put together just like that I've been

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.570 
we put together just like that I've been
thinking<00:02:47.000> about<00:02:47.360> this<00:02:47.660> for<00:02:47.720> six<00:02:48.200> months<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.770> I

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
thinking about this for six months and I

00:02:49.580 --> 00:03:03.800 
thinking about this for six months and I
think<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:50.120> shows

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.160

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
it was stunning one after the other was
