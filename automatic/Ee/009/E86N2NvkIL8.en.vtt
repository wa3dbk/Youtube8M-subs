we're going to be doing is making an

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.320 
we're going to be doing is making an
automated<00:00:07.170> cobblestone<00:00:07.740> generator<00:00:07.770> now<00:00:08.639> to

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
automated cobblestone generator now to

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.450 
automated cobblestone generator now to
do<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:09.750> what<00:00:10.019> I'd<00:00:10.139> recommend<00:00:10.559> doing<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:11.280> you

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
do this what I'd recommend doing is you

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.039 
do this what I'd recommend doing is you
know<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.610> harvest<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.240> bunch<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.570> cobble<00:00:12.900> from

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
know you harvest a bunch of cobble from

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.169 
know you harvest a bunch of cobble from
this<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.799> place<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.190> down<00:00:14.340> like<00:00:14.639> this<00:00:14.849> and

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
this you place it down like this and

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.689 
this you place it down like this and
we're<00:00:15.420> just<00:00:15.480> going<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.690> break<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.139> with<00:00:16.379> our

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
we're just going to break this with our

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.859 
we're just going to break this with our
hammer<00:00:17.699> like<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.180> that's<00:00:18.449> going<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.660> give<00:00:18.779> us

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
hammer like this that's going to give us

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.740 
hammer like this that's going to give us
some<00:00:18.990> gravel<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.949> with<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.820> gravel<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.390> want

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
some gravel and with the gravel you want

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.250 
some gravel and with the gravel you want
to<00:00:21.869> turn<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.199> into<00:00:22.519> sand<00:00:23.519> like<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:24.260> you're

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
to turn that into sand like this you're

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.420 
to turn that into sand like this you're
going<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.410> need<00:00:25.470> quite<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.800> lot<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.220> but

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
going to need quite a lot of this but

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.189 
going to need quite a lot of this but
because<00:00:26.550> you've<00:00:26.760> got<00:00:26.849> cobble<00:00:27.180> now<00:00:27.300> automated

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
because you've got cobble now automated

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.740 
because you've got cobble now automated
you<00:00:28.439> don't<00:00:28.590> actually<00:00:28.710> need<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:28.980> worry<00:00:29.750> you're

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
you don't actually need to worry you're

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.170 
you don't actually need to worry you're
going<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.960> turn<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.399> into<00:00:32.399> dust<00:00:32.759> like<00:00:33.000> this

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
going to turn this into dust like this

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.580 
going to turn this into dust like this
and<00:00:33.480> you're<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.079> sift<00:00:34.260> through<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and you're going to sift through the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.139 
and you're going to sift through the
dust<00:00:34.829> obviously<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.460> see<00:00:35.489> free<00:00:35.760> sand<00:00:36.000> as

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
dust obviously you can see free sand as

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.790 
dust obviously you can see free sand as
well<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.780> probably<00:00:36.930> already<00:00:37.140> realize<00:00:37.559> that

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
well you probably already realize that

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.709 
well you probably already realize that
but<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.489> will<00:00:38.579> actually<00:00:38.730> start<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.420> give<00:00:39.570> you

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
but that will actually start to give you

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.729 
but that will actually start to give you
some<00:00:39.899> more<00:00:40.020> stuff<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.469> you've<00:00:40.620> got

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
some more stuff like you've got

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.430 
some more stuff like you've got
pulverized<00:00:40.980> gold<00:00:41.520> profiles<00:00:42.090> quartz<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.320> all

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
pulverized gold profiles quartz and all

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.500 
pulverized gold profiles quartz and all
of<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.770> sort<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.040> stuff<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.969> will<00:00:45.390> actually

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
of that sort of stuff you will actually

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.080 
of that sort of stuff you will actually
get<00:00:46.320> lucky<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.070> end<00:00:47.489> up<00:00:47.610> with<00:00:47.730> some<00:00:47.879> redstone

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
get lucky and end up with some redstone

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.430 
get lucky and end up with some redstone
and<00:00:48.329> that's<00:00:48.600> what<00:00:48.750> you're<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.020> need<00:00:49.200> for

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
and that's what you're going to need for

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.260 
and that's what you're going to need for
this<00:00:49.559> next<00:00:49.890> bits<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.820> we're<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.090> do

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
this next bits that we're going to do

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.930 
this next bits that we're going to do
here<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:52.469> I'm<00:00:52.649> going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.280> make<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.789> the

here so what I'm going to make is the
easiest<00:00:54.329> possible<00:00:54.570> course<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.680> automated

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
easiest possible course that automated

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.500 
easiest possible course that automated
cobblestone<00:00:56.640> generator<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.390> will

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
cobblestone generator and it will

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.720 
cobblestone generator and it will
generate<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.960> crap<00:00:58.320> ton<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.590> cobble<00:00:59.039> trust<00:00:59.370> me

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
generate a crap ton of cobble trust me

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.250 
generate a crap ton of cobble trust me
so<00:01:01.879> my<00:01:02.879> cats<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.300> my<00:01:03.329> room<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:03.899> hear<00:01:04.080> him

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
make is a transfer node now shut up this

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.789 
make is a transfer node now shut up this
guy<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.880> you're<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> transfer<00:01:19.259> pipe<00:01:19.650> in

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
guy is you're going to transfer pipe in

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.320 
guy is you're going to transfer pipe in
a<00:01:19.860> transfer<00:01:20.250> node<00:01:20.460> let's<00:01:20.729> start<00:01:21.150> with<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
a transfer node let's start with the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.050 
a transfer node let's start with the
transfer<00:01:21.750> node<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.979> I'm<00:01:23.100> going<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.310> press<00:01:23.670> R<00:01:23.880> on

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
transfer node so I'm going to press R on

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.490 
transfer node so I'm going to press R on
this<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.140> thing<00:01:25.380> is

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
this and you can see that this thing is

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.830 
this and you can see that this thing is
quite<00:01:25.710> expensive<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.220> make<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.540> make<00:01:27.720> it

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
quite expensive to make you can make it

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.270 
quite expensive to make you can make it
either<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.200> these<00:01:28.290> ways<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.860> should<00:01:28.920> know<00:01:29.159> how

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
either of these ways you should know how

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.859 
either of these ways you should know how
to<00:01:29.310> get<00:01:29.520> all<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.790> these<00:01:29.880> materials<00:01:30.420> by<00:01:30.570> now<00:01:30.750> if

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
to get all of these materials by now if

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.780 
to get all of these materials by now if
you've<00:01:30.990> built<00:01:31.229> mob<00:01:31.439> farm<00:01:31.740> then<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.700> get

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
you've built mob farm then you can get

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.090 
you've built mob farm then you can get
an<00:01:32.939> ender<00:01:33.210> pearl<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.720> make<00:01:33.900> 4<00:01:34.200> or<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:34.979> use

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
an ender pearl and make 4 or you can use

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.859 
an ender pearl and make 4 or you can use
a<00:01:35.130> redstone<00:01:35.400> block<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:35.820> get<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.299> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
a redstone block and just get one to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:37.760 
a redstone block and just get one to
make<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.110> though<00:01:37.170> you're<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.470> need<00:01:37.590> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
make that though you're going to need a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.460 
make that though you're going to need a
transfer<00:01:38.460> pipe<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.909> recommend<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.259> click

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
transfer pipe I recommend so if I click

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.420 
transfer pipe I recommend so if I click
on<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.710> that's<00:01:40.979> going<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.189> require<00:01:41.310> some

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
on this that's going to require some

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.130 
on this that's going to require some
glass<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.210> smell<00:01:42.420> sand<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.810> get<00:01:42.930> that

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
glass you just smell sand to get that

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.440 
glass you just smell sand to get that
redstone<00:01:43.380> which<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.640> from<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.970> dust<00:01:45.180> and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
redstone which you get from the dust and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.870 
redstone which you get from the dust and
some<00:01:45.720> stone<00:01:45.990> slabs<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.590> once<00:01:47.340> I've<00:01:47.520> got<00:01:47.549> some

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
some stone slabs so once I've got some

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.200 
some stone slabs so once I've got some
of<00:01:48.000> these<00:01:48.090> let's<00:01:48.450> just<00:01:48.630> grab<00:01:48.869> some<00:01:50.119> what<00:01:51.119> I'm

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
of these let's just grab some what I'm

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.270 
of these let's just grab some what I'm
going<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.390> do<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.840> place<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.560> transfer<00:01:53.070> node

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
going to do is place a transfer node

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.969 
going to do is place a transfer node
like<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.700> against<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.799> cobblestone<00:01:55.799> block

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
like this against the cobblestone block

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.440 
like this against the cobblestone block
here<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.640> see<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.909> that's<00:01:57.060> already

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
here and you can see that that's already

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.350 
here and you can see that that's already
filling<00:01:57.899> up<00:01:58.020> that's<00:01:58.229> how<00:01:58.350> fast<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.360> so

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
filling up that's how fast that is so

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
filling up that's how fast that is so
you<00:02:00.420> know<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.659> could<00:02:00.810> probably<00:02:00.990> place

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
you know you could probably place

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.870 
you know you could probably place
another<00:02:01.649> one<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:01.950> side<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.430> probably

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
another one this side that probably

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.240 
another one this side that probably
would<00:02:03.299> fill<00:02:03.509> up<00:02:03.540> I'm<00:02:04.140> guessing<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.770> haven't

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
would fill up I'm guessing I haven't

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.770 
would fill up I'm guessing I haven't
actually<00:02:05.340> tried<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.820> before<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.600> good

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
actually tried this before so it's good

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.719 
actually tried this before so it's good
to<00:02:06.810> see<00:02:07.590> yeah<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.979> don't<00:02:08.160> think<00:02:08.399> that's<00:02:08.520> filling

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
to see yeah I don't think that's filling

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.339 
to see yeah I don't think that's filling
up<00:02:08.849> as<00:02:09.030> fast<00:02:09.270> oh<00:02:09.539> yeah<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.020> is

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
up as fast oh yeah it is

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.589 
up as fast oh yeah it is
so<00:02:10.979> yeah<00:02:11.220> pixel<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.060> other<00:02:12.270> side<00:02:12.420> if<00:02:12.540> you

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
so yeah pixel on the other side if you

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.790 
so yeah pixel on the other side if you
want<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:12.900> not<00:02:12.959> absolutely<00:02:13.349> crucial

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
want it's not absolutely crucial

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.670 
want it's not absolutely crucial
it<00:02:14.420> sorry<00:02:15.420> it's<00:02:15.630> not<00:02:15.750> absolutely<00:02:16.200> crus

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
it sorry it's not absolutely crus

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.220 
it sorry it's not absolutely crus
crucial<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:18.210> then<00:02:18.360> link<00:02:18.570> these<00:02:18.690> guys<00:02:18.900> up<00:02:19.080> with

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
crucial and then link these guys up with

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.230 
crucial and then link these guys up with
your<00:02:19.410> transfer<00:02:19.860> pipes<00:02:20.100> now<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.400> get<00:02:20.730> like<00:02:21.030> a

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
your transfer pipes now you get like a

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.900 
your transfer pipes now you get like a
crap<00:02:21.690> ton<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.930> these<00:02:22.110> for<00:02:22.680> what<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.520> for<00:02:23.850> the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
crap ton of these for what the for the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.400 
crap ton of these for what the for the
recipe<00:02:24.270> but<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.810> don't<00:02:25.080> think<00:02:25.260> they're<00:02:25.380> very

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
recipe but I don't think they're very

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.750 
recipe but I don't think they're very
good<00:02:25.560> pipes<00:02:25.860> they're<00:02:26.070> fine<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.430> start<00:02:26.670> off

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
good pipes they're fine to start off

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.150 
good pipes they're fine to start off
with<00:02:27.000> very<00:02:27.930> cheap<00:02:28.230> just<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.650> get<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:28.860> going

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
with very cheap just to get you going

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.950 
with very cheap just to get you going
and<00:02:29.610> what<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.820> next<00:02:30.120> recommend<00:02:30.510> doing<00:02:30.690> is

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
and what I next recommend doing is

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.560 
and what I next recommend doing is
building<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.530> barrel<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.370> let's<00:02:32.640> build<00:02:33.360> a

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
building a barrel so let's build a

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.330 
building a barrel so let's build a
barrel<00:02:33.990> now<00:02:34.500> these<00:02:34.710> things<00:02:34.920> are<00:02:35.040> from<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
barrel now these things are from the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.680 
barrel now these things are from the
jabber<00:02:35.610> mod<00:02:35.880> if<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:36.360> don't<00:02:36.510> know<00:02:36.570> what<00:02:36.660> that

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
jabber mod if you don't know what that

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.340 
jabber mod if you don't know what that
stands<00:02:36.960> for<00:02:37.080> it's<00:02:37.410> just<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.770> bit<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.010> barrel<00:02:38.190> mod

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
stands for it's just a bit of barrel mod

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.630 
stands for it's just a bit of barrel mod
so<00:02:40.350> if<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.500> type<00:02:40.710> in<00:02:40.830> barrel<00:02:41.160> it's<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.490> one

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
so if I type in barrel it's this one

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.370 
so if I type in barrel it's this one
here<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.880> called<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.120> better<00:02:42.330> barrel<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:43.170> press

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
here is called a better barrel you press

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.480 
here is called a better barrel you press
R<00:02:43.590> on<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.890> you're<00:02:44.040> just<00:02:44.130> going<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.310> need<00:02:44.370> a

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
R on that you're just going to need a

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.780 
R on that you're just going to need a
chest<00:02:45.170> some<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.650> know<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.800> slab<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.190> any<00:02:47.460> kind

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
chest some you know a slab of any kind

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.630 
chest some you know a slab of any kind
and<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.210> know<00:02:48.900> as<00:02:49.080> soon<00:02:49.290> here<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.520> know

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
just put this guy right next to my

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.460 
just put this guy right next to my
transfer<00:02:56.670> note<00:02:56.880> here<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.960> should<00:02:58.230> you

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
transfer note here and this should you

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.020 
transfer note here and this should you
know<00:02:58.590> hook<00:02:58.770> everything<00:02:59.040> up<00:02:59.280> if<00:02:59.550> you<00:02:59.730> want<00:02:59.910> to

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
know hook everything up if you want to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.270 
know hook everything up if you want to
do<00:03:00.150> this<00:03:00.330> but<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.590> can<00:03:01.740> see<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:02.160> know

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
do this but you can see that you know

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.560 
do this but you can see that you know
you've<00:03:02.430> already<00:03:02.550> got<00:03:02.790> two<00:03:02.820> stacks<00:03:03.300> by<00:03:03.510> the

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
you've already got two stacks by the

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.000 
you've already got two stacks by the
time<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.840> built<00:03:04.080> this<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.590> know<00:03:04.770> you<00:03:04.830> can

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
time I built this so you know you can

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.310 
time I built this so you know you can
