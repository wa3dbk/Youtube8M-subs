that<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:17.070> was<00:00:17.250> actually<00:00:17.430> gonna<00:00:18.180> plan<00:00:18.510> on

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
that I was actually gonna plan on

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.650 
that I was actually gonna plan on
uploading<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.439> video<00:00:19.619> which<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.660> advanced

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
uploading this video which is advanced

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.830 
uploading this video which is advanced
warfare<00:00:21.800> with<00:00:22.800> no<00:00:23.189> exosuits<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.390> there<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.810> a

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
warfare with no exosuits so there is a

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.660 
warfare with no exosuits so there is a
playlist<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.529> advance<00:00:25.859> for<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.250> believe<00:00:26.310> it's

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
playlist in advance for I believe it's

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.609 
playlist in advance for I believe it's
still<00:00:26.880> called<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.180> classic<00:00:27.599> playlist<00:00:28.050> where

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
still called a classic playlist where

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.769 
still called a classic playlist where
you<00:00:28.800> could<00:00:28.920> play<00:00:29.070> with<00:00:29.099> no<00:00:29.340> exosuits<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:29.880> it

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
you could play with no exosuits and it

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.870 
you could play with no exosuits and it
is<00:00:31.019> completely<00:00:31.550> completely<00:00:32.550> completely

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
is completely completely completely

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.900 
is completely completely completely
changes<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.050> game<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:35.040> changes<00:00:35.460> how<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.610> play

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
changes the game it changes how you play

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.910 
changes the game it changes how you play
the<00:00:35.940> game<00:00:36.090> obviously<00:00:36.450> know<00:00:37.020> XO<00:00:37.440> movement<00:00:37.829> you

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the game obviously know XO movement you

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.430 
the game obviously know XO movement you
have<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.309> pretty<00:00:39.090> much<00:00:39.300> use<00:00:39.750> look<00:00:40.230> at<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.379> I

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
have to pretty much use look at this I

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.040 
have to pretty much use look at this I
couldn't<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.489> did<00:00:42.059> not<00:00:42.270> know<00:00:42.540> what<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.870> do<00:00:43.020> to

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
couldn't I did not know what to do to

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.660 
couldn't I did not know what to do to
get<00:00:43.320> up<00:00:43.469> there<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.649> wanted<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.190> get<00:00:44.370> out<00:00:44.520> there

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
get up there I wanted to get out there

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.670 
get up there I wanted to get out there
but<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:44.969> didn't<00:00:45.480> know<00:00:45.600> what<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.780> do<00:00:45.989> you

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
but I just didn't know what to do you

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.380 
but I just didn't know what to do you
have<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.890> find<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.309> ledges<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.210> to

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
have to find the ledges you have to

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.729 
have to find the ledges you have to
actually<00:00:48.539> use<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.140> ladders<00:00:49.500> which

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
actually use the ladders which

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.340 
actually use the ladders which
absolutely<00:00:50.219> nobody<00:00:50.850> uses<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:52.050> know<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
absolutely nobody uses you know in the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.010 
absolutely nobody uses you know in the
regular<00:00:52.649> playlist<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:54.180> my<00:00:54.360> opinion<00:00:54.449> I

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
regular playlist and in my opinion I

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.160 
regular playlist and in my opinion I
think<00:00:55.500> if<00:00:56.070> they<00:00:56.760> would<00:00:57.030> not<00:00:57.270> have<00:00:57.539> put<00:00:57.719> XO

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
think if they would not have put XO

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.279 
think if they would not have put XO
movements<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:59.520> advanced<00:01:00.090> warfare<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.899> think

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
movements in advanced warfare I think

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.930 
movements in advanced warfare I think
this<00:01:01.469> would<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.800> been<00:01:01.829> even<00:01:02.340> worse<00:01:02.489> than

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
this would have been even worse than

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.759 
this would have been even worse than
ghosts<00:01:03.180> because<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.809> lot<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.350> maps<00:01:04.589> are

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
ghosts because a lot of the maps are

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.510 
ghosts because a lot of the maps are
pretty<00:01:05.100> big<00:01:05.540> they<00:01:06.540> play<00:01:06.869> they<00:01:07.619> play<00:01:07.650> small<00:01:08.250> to

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
pretty big they play they play small to

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.149 
pretty big they play they play small to
medium<00:01:08.909> because<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> lot<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.689> times<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:11.070> know

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
medium because a lot of times you know

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.710 
medium because a lot of times you know
i'm<00:01:11.310> playing<00:01:11.610> objective<00:01:12.180> game<00:01:12.390> modes<00:01:12.420> like

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
i'm playing objective game modes like

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.380 
i'm playing objective game modes like
momentum<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.500> everyone<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.100> running<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.670> you

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
momentum so everyone is running to you

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.450 
momentum so everyone is running to you
know<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> specific<00:01:15.810> objective<00:01:16.710> same<00:01:17.310> as

know a specific objective same as

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.580 
know a specific objective same as
domination<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.750> know<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> lot<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.080> times<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
fight for the B flag makes a really fast

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.140 
fight for the B flag makes a really fast
paced<00:01:21.979> Kill<00:01:22.979> Confirmed<00:01:23.009> people<00:01:23.820> are<00:01:23.939> trying

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
to get their tags and stuff plus the XO

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.170 
to get their tags and stuff plus the XO
movements<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.960> could<00:01:28.340> you<00:01:29.340> know<00:01:29.460> double<00:01:29.909> jump

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
movements you could you know double jump

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.480 
movements you could you know double jump
you<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.509> sprint<00:01:30.960> twice<00:01:31.470> before<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.250> need<00:01:32.430> to

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
you can sprint twice before you need to

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.170 
you can sprint twice before you need to
you<00:01:33.450> know<00:01:33.570> regain<00:01:33.780> your<00:01:34.259> XO<00:01:34.710> ability<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.369> it

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
you know regain your XO ability and it

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.300 
you know regain your XO ability and it
just<00:01:36.420> makes<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:37.079> overall<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.829> really

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
just makes it for overall like really

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.100 
just makes it for overall like really
really<00:01:38.700> fast<00:01:39.119> paced<00:01:39.360> game<00:01:39.509> that's<00:01:39.869> probably

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
really fast paced game that's probably

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.560 
really fast paced game that's probably
the<00:01:40.229> fastest<00:01:40.619> pace<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.700> know<00:01:41.820> call<00:01:42.060> duty<00:01:42.270> ever

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
the fastest pace you know call duty ever

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.929 
the fastest pace you know call duty ever
and<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.590> because<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.189> XO<00:01:44.490> movements

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
and it is because of the XO movements

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.270 
and it is because of the XO movements
and<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.540> think<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.590> game<00:01:46.770> would<00:01:46.950> not<00:01:47.130> have

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
and I think if this game would not have

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.069 
and I think if this game would not have
had<00:01:47.460> late<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.880> I'm<00:01:47.939> using<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.329> ladder<00:01:48.479> i'm<00:01:48.750> using

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
had late so I'm using a ladder i'm using

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.870 
had late so I'm using a ladder i'm using
a<00:01:49.409> fucking<00:01:49.740> ladder<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.130> advanced<00:01:50.490> warfare

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
a fucking ladder in advanced warfare

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.030 
a fucking ladder in advanced warfare
that's<00:01:51.030> crazy<00:01:51.299> right<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:52.290> if<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.979> game

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
that's crazy right but if this game

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.889 
that's crazy right but if this game
would<00:01:53.399> would<00:01:53.909> not<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.180> had<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.420> so

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
would would not have had that so

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.929 
would would not have had that so
abilities<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.890> think<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.430> definitely<00:01:56.610> would

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
abilities I think it definitely would

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.340 
abilities I think it definitely would
have<00:01:56.969> been<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> failure<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.840> I'm<00:01:57.990> really<00:01:58.140> glad

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
have been a failure so I'm really glad

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.069 
have been a failure so I'm really glad
that<00:01:58.469> they<00:01:58.770> tried<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.250> out<00:01:59.479> the<00:02:00.479> question<00:02:00.869> is

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
that they tried this out the question is

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.370 
that they tried this out the question is
of<00:02:01.500> course<00:02:01.740> will<00:02:02.610> black<00:02:02.909> ops<00:02:03.149> 3<00:02:03.479> or<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:04.259> know

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
of course will black ops 3 or you know

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.840 
of course will black ops 3 or you know
that's<00:02:04.619> what<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.950> think<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.460> going<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.790> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
that's what I think is going to be the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.760 
that's what I think is going to be the
next<00:02:05.969> call<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.240> duty<00:02:06.299> at<00:02:06.540> least<00:02:06.719> will<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.619> next

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
next call of duty at least will the next

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.949 
next call of duty at least will the next
call<00:02:08.099> duty<00:02:08.280> from<00:02:08.520> treyarch<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.270> EXO

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
call duty from treyarch have EXO

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.250 
call duty from treyarch have EXO
abilities<00:02:09.989> XO<00:02:10.950> whoo

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
abilities XO whoo

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.100 
abilities XO whoo
like<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.250> double<00:02:12.610> jump<00:02:12.909> the<00:02:13.209> boost<00:02:13.599> forward

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
like the double jump the boost forward

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.770 
like the double jump the boost forward
sideways<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:15.579> know<00:02:15.700> pretty<00:02:15.909> much<00:02:16.030> like<00:02:16.480> boost

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
sideways you know pretty much like boost

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.160 
sideways you know pretty much like boost
in<00:02:16.989> any<00:02:17.230> direction<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:19.239> was<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.480> mechanic

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
in any direction and it was a mechanic

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.170 
in any direction and it was a mechanic
that<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.769> took<00:02:20.980> me<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.220> while<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.489> get<00:02:21.790> used<00:02:22.030> to

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
that it took me a while to get used to

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.929 
that it took me a while to get used to
but<00:02:22.329> now<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.840> don't<00:02:23.829> know<00:02:24.069> how<00:02:24.340> I'm<00:02:24.519> going<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.730> be

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
but now I don't know how I'm going to be

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.539 
but now I don't know how I'm going to be
playing<00:02:25.239> without<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.959> because<00:02:26.620> even<00:02:27.129> if<00:02:27.280> like

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
playing without it because even if like

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.550 
playing without it because even if like
for<00:02:27.760> example<00:02:27.849> we<00:02:28.299> go<00:02:28.450> back<00:02:28.659> to<00:02:28.690> multi<00:02:29.079> hot<00:02:29.319> go

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
for example we go back to multi hot go

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.800 
for example we go back to multi hot go
back<00:02:29.769> to<00:02:29.950> black<00:02:30.159> ops<00:02:30.400> 2<00:02:30.640> moving<00:02:31.360> around<00:02:31.659> the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
back to black ops 2 moving around the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.600 
back to black ops 2 moving around the
map<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:32.079> gonna<00:02:32.230> be<00:02:32.349> a<00:02:32.379> little<00:02:32.560> bit<00:02:32.769> weird<00:02:33.010> not

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
map is gonna be a little bit weird not

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.490 
map is gonna be a little bit weird not
being<00:02:33.760> able<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.239> get<00:02:34.420> from<00:02:34.840> point<00:02:35.079> A<00:02:35.319> to<00:02:35.349> point

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
being able to get from point A to point

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.550 
being able to get from point A to point
B<00:02:35.799> like<00:02:36.159> really<00:02:36.610> really<00:02:36.760> fast<00:02:37.180> using<00:02:37.900> like<00:02:38.349> the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
B like really really fast using like the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.890 
B like really really fast using like the
double<00:02:39.129> John<00:02:39.370> double<00:02:39.819> sprint<00:02:40.180> or<00:02:40.390> not<00:02:40.629> double

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
sprint the UH the boost forward and

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
more excitement to the game is going to

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.800 
more excitement to the game is going to

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:19.449 
might make it harder for people to get

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.629 
might make it harder for people to get
on<00:03:19.599> target<00:03:20.109> and<00:03:20.230> stuff<00:03:20.440> like<00:03:20.560> that<00:03:20.620> but<00:03:21.430> now

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
on target and stuff like that but now

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.140 
on target and stuff like that but now
went<00:03:22.000> once<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.449> game<00:03:22.660> came<00:03:22.870> out<00:03:23.879> no<00:03:24.879> one<00:03:25.060> is

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
went once the game came out no one is

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.670 
went once the game came out no one is

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
how I felt playing with no XO movements

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.059 
how I felt playing with no XO movements
and<00:04:07.959> let<00:04:08.109> me<00:04:08.169> know<00:04:08.290> in<00:04:08.379> the<00:04:08.409> comments<00:04:08.829> what<00:04:08.859> you

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
guys think do you guys think that this

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.439 
guys think do you guys think that this
game<00:04:11.530> would<00:04:11.799> have<00:04:11.919> been<00:04:12.099> a<00:04:12.419> complete<00:04:13.419> failure

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:13.449 
game would have been a complete failure

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:15.569 
game would have been a complete failure
if<00:04:14.109> XO<00:04:14.500> movements<00:04:14.919> wouldn't<00:04:15.250> have<00:04:15.370> been

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
if XO movements wouldn't have been

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.009 
if XO movements wouldn't have been
implemented<00:04:16.060> I<00:04:16.419> think<00:04:16.659> it<00:04:16.750> would<00:04:16.870> have<00:04:16.959> been

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
implemented I think it would have been

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.319 
implemented I think it would have been
like<00:04:17.079> ghosts<00:04:17.500> maybe<00:04:17.829> even<00:04:18.130> worse<00:04:18.430> because<00:04:19.090> a

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
like ghosts maybe even worse because a

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.599 
like ghosts maybe even worse because a
lot<00:04:19.719> of<00:04:19.750> these<00:04:19.930> maps<00:04:20.200> are<00:04:20.349> pretty<00:04:20.620> big

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
lot of these maps are pretty big

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.869 
lot of these maps are pretty big
and<00:04:21.699> I<00:04:22.270> think<00:04:22.539> that's<00:04:22.810> a<00:04:23.169> woman's<00:04:23.409> does<00:04:23.919> add<00:04:24.219> a

00:04:24.869 --> 00:04:24.879 
and I think that's a woman's does add a

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.059 
and I think that's a woman's does add a
ton<00:04:25.389> to<00:04:25.599> this<00:04:25.780> game<00:04:26.020> I'm<00:04:26.259> just<00:04:26.500> you<00:04:27.039> know
