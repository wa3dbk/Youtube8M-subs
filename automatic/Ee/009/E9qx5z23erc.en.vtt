skill<00:00:03.169> begin<00:00:04.169> by<00:00:04.320> running<00:00:04.529> your<00:00:04.650> line<00:00:04.920> down

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
skill begin by running your line down

the<00:00:05.340> length<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.819> hook<00:00:05.970> shank<00:00:06.240> then

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:06.630 
the length of the hook shank then

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.870 
the length of the hook shank then

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.900 

straighten<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:54.469> wraps<00:00:54.680> if<00:00:54.920> needed<00:00:55.160> then<00:00:55.670> move

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
straighten the wraps if needed then move

hook and pull the snail tight and this

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.289 
hook and pull the snail tight and this
is<00:01:03.769> what<00:01:03.920> a<00:01:03.949> five<00:01:04.220> turned<00:01:04.549> snow<00:01:04.850> should<00:01:05.089> look

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
is what a five turned snow should look

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.810 
is what a five turned snow should look
like<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:05.810> can<00:01:06.680> also<00:01:06.830> run<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.280> line<00:01:07.490> through
