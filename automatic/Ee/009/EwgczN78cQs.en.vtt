00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 hello my dear and welcome in 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.400
 my world I have the second today 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.170
 lure and heat video for you and me 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.000
 do not have this time with the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.880
 end result started we do that 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.679
 right together and let's go 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.910
 by the way, new lipstick, by the way, me 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.789
 I think I'm addicted but I can 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.710
 do not mind it is just like that 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.689
 the variant that I show you today 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.180
 I would like to do that with calls for mass 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.140
 and that these things are here and there 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.630
 I'll explain you first 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.939
 what karl are looking forward to, and indeed it is 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.669
 so thomas are relatively expensive things 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.270
 which I have here which are now 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.760
 in long and extra wide court of hate 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.260
 and so a kind of curls forma of me 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.390
 unfortunately this material can not 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.500
 describe describe I thought as me 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.090
 you have made me out 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.850
 But it's not like that 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.739
 a network structure that just by the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.129
 Hair can dry and performers are 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.750
 just as trendy variant of the pilots 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.280
 I do not know what you're saying 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.050
 But I guess the variant will open 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.270
 any case come and my 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.129
 body formats it is so that it is in 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.750
 different lengths and also in 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.420
 different sizes are so ever 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.310
 after what you have for long hair or 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.869
 how big you want the bells 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.100
 There are different bodies which one 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.659
 can buy and they are natural 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.979
 also all different prices 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.220
 I have now for those I have here 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.140
 that is 24 pieces I believe 56 euros 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.060
 I had to pay you, I'll lose you 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.650
 page of the call from mars on each 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.970
 fall down in the infobox then you can 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.400
 you see through what maybe 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.130
 for you the best variations of this tree 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.770
 Assist and the principle works 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.150
 So here you have these two 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.189
 different colored call for mass and 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.780
 Although the colors are in the direction of 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.479
 the curls go so you see 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.369
 that the different ones I can here 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.530
 Now maybe say thread 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.520
 alignments therefore have spiral 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.780
 orientations 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.090
 but I have just two different ones 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.770
 directions of curls and could be so 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.880
 vary a bit and therefore too 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.530
 try to put it right like 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.329
 they should lie or you just do it 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.829
 everything completely messed up and scored 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.020
 so a very natural look so 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.210
 as you want or how much reform what 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.039
 you have each delivered with it 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.740
 such a funny died here I can 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.810
 take it apart a bit 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.580
 better fit into this pack here 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.230
 but he should have worked that one 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.790
 it plugged together and you because the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.470
 can stuff through hair 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.930
 that looks like this 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.970
 The hair is just the form of this code 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.130
 to accept for mass by drying like 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.500
 the whole thing worked exactly that 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.970
 I now you for the curls variant 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.130
 of course, you also have to change your hair 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.540
 be slightly damp but not too wet 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.010
 otherwise dry in the hair not 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.630
 or it takes much too long to reach them 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.190
 dry and you can either 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.660
 just moisten by hand and good 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.250
 distribute or you take yourselves 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.230
 small tool year I have one 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.390
 little tip i just have one here 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.299
 bottle from the left curve I cleaned 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.040
 did learn and have the then 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.900
 filled with water and you can use yours 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.910
 hair very fine and targeted 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.400
 you are so afraid of yourselves 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.540
 hair now good at first completely 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.950
 it also really tries pretty much 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.510
 to do evenly otherwise 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.140
 Of course, the curls do not dry too 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.140
 evenly 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.590
 can actually stay that way I think 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.090
 but now completely in Thailand or now 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.860
 I have pretty wet hair and 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.150
 so that the curls hold better I do 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.370
 of course quite a lot 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.290
 otherwise foam-free hang 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.450
 Unfortunately, lure me too fast 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.549
 August, that's why I'm really doing it now 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.890
 neat hair foam pure so that 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.989
 long time keeps your hair now 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.000
 evenly moist are not after 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.200
 but really only wet then you can 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.970
 you already with the head ahead 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.400
 start and for this I have now 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.230
 put this bar on top of each other and then 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.239
 is already relatively long as you can see 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.940
 Now you do it like this 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:41.209
 put this card format on this bar 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.220
 pull it through and thereby you see 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.650
 already that this body is stretched 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.989
 and you have just that hollow space or 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.939
 Fit the hair and now you take 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.530
 drive a strand of yours 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.540
 Now this thing has one here 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.500
 cool hook up and so I can 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.609
 now take the hair 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.530
 and I like that a little bit now 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:03.049
 in the other direction with it one 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.480
 have a little more stop and aim in call 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.480
 girl forma even about it 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.590
 Mega sharp from you have to confess yes 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.420
 and of course I am doing that now 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.550
 whole head and you see that will be 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.550
 look pretty stupid at the end 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.350
 That's what it looks like when you 're all body 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.450
 had finished in there as you see her 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.130
 really really funny you can 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.720
 Of course, this also goes out the way 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.640
 maybe a little stupid 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.620
 and people may keep you 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.670
 bit crazy maybe you can 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.750
 So cool on such a reggae 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.750
 to go to a concert 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.990
 you have to keep that in there now 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.210
 until your hair has dried and that 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.340
 That's about three hours at least 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.410
 depending on your vinas your hair 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.810
 I have now left for three 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.520
 hours in there you can of course also 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.110
 so that you can chase them overnight 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.060
 Last but I tell you one I have 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.160
 now quite a while and also 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.960
 already used a few times to sleep 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.230
 can you on the things at all 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.230
 Not 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.150
 we have to dry it all now 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.770
 and then we'll meet again 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:51.390
 when those three hours are over 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.830
 I have the curls pretty long now 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.360
 Allow to dry and now I'm going to the 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.590
 we'll get out with you and 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.810
 This is quite simple 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.370
 You just have to buy these buyers 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.860
 have to pull out now that can 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.570
 maybe a little tough but actually 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.740
 It is very simple and I will 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.740
 now time to do together with you 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.910
 the 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.850
 the people are done much more 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.350
 I really do not want to 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.630
 its because it is quite late and me 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.670
 I'm tired but as you can see it's very 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.200
 beautiful big voluminous curls become 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.580
 and you, the longer it is allowed to act the 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.260
 So if you really over 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.660
 let it dry overnight 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.010
 they really are incredibly good and 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.720
 I think it's beautiful because 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.850
 Of course we also see the lakes full 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.650
 and it's a bit like this 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.540
 victoria secret world and i think that 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.220
 just really cute that 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.960
 only one is just that one as well as 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.970
 not at all then can sleep and 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.530
 that it is not relatively expensive 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.690
 to buy this call from Mars 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:55.050
 but on the other hand, if you once 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.880
 then you have her and could always 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.780
 use as you want and then it is 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.640
 maybe a pretty good one too 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.960
 purchase because they are really good 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.090
 And as you said, they are the money 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.040
 really really worth it really I love 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.240
 These curls and I will be the more often 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.920
 use if I'm on the go 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.480
 sleep could write me again 

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.550
 the comments like you this second 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.690
 lure way pleases and I link 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.850
 In any case, mine still 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.680
 first video from the series lure without 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.180
 heat and of course the playlist 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.740
 for all the videos that are yet to come 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.060
 that was it with my again 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.680
 Of course I hope very much that it 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.420
 you would have loved me 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.770
 a thumb upwards or just 

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.400
 about constructive criticism in the 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.170
 comments to 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.450
 and then I would say so 

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:32.040
 Go to sleep now and see you 

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.570
 hopefully at my next video 

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.570
 goodbye until then all the die
