hey dudes what's up today we were
checking<00:00:08.460> out<00:00:08.670> gun<00:00:08.940> brick<00:00:09.150> which<00:00:09.420> came<00:00:10.320> out<00:00:10.380> a

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
checking out gun brick which came out a

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.650 
checking out gun brick which came out a
while<00:00:10.590> ago<00:00:10.650> but<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.670> was<00:00:11.759> another<00:00:12.240> game<00:00:12.630> that

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
while ago but it was another game that

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.930 
while ago but it was another game that
we<00:00:12.870> didn't<00:00:13.019> have<00:00:13.139> video<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.980> talked<00:00:14.790> about

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
we didn't have video of and talked about

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.430 
we didn't have video of and talked about
on<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.120> podcast<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.809> thought<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.199> would<00:00:16.320> be

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
on the podcast and I thought it would be

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.590 
on the podcast and I thought it would be
really<00:00:16.710> good<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> just<00:00:17.279> kind<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.789> always<00:00:18.480> do

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
really good to just kind of I always do

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.450 
really good to just kind of I always do
a<00:00:18.630> little<00:00:18.720> once-over<00:00:19.230> like<00:00:20.010> showing<00:00:20.310> how<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
a little once-over like showing how the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.679 
a little once-over like showing how the
controls<00:00:20.820> work<00:00:20.910> because<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.359> feel<00:00:21.510> like<00:00:21.539> this

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
controls work because I feel like this

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.830 
controls work because I feel like this
is<00:00:21.840> kind<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.170> hard<00:00:22.320> game<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.800> describe<00:00:23.430> and

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
is kind of a hard game to describe and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.240 
is kind of a hard game to describe and
very<00:00:24.840> easy<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.320> understand<00:00:25.740> once<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.010> see<00:00:26.160> it

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
very easy to understand once you see it

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.779 
very easy to understand once you see it
in<00:00:26.340> motion

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
in motion

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.400

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
to live in a future where gun bricks are

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.279 
to live in a future where gun bricks are
the<00:00:42.750> mode<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:42.960> transportation<00:00:44.930> well<00:00:45.930> maybe

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
the mode of transportation well maybe

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.930 
the mode of transportation well maybe
maybe<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.070> could<00:00:47.280> if<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.489> freeze<00:00:47.820> yourself

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.380 
you're blowing it then blowing it well
so<00:02:16.709> this<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.250> kind<00:02:17.489> of<00:02:17.550> like<00:02:18.150> what<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.330> was

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
so this is kind of like what I was

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.640 
so this is kind of like what I was
talking<00:02:18.660> about<00:02:18.720> on<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.959> podcast<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.500> thought

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
talking about on the podcast I thought

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.260 
talking about on the podcast I thought
would<00:02:19.770> be<00:02:19.830> really<00:02:20.040> good<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.670> have<00:02:20.880> a

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
would be really good is to have a

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.290 
would be really good is to have a
counter<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.440> how<00:02:22.620> many<00:02:22.800> times<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.760> need<00:02:24.270> to

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
counter of how many times you need to

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.059 
counter of how many times you need to
rotate<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.140> things<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.590> because<00:02:25.800> I

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
rotate and things like that because I

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.089 
rotate and things like that because I
mean<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.730> was<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.150> was<00:02:27.720> like<00:02:28.349> really<00:02:28.770> pour

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
mean that was that was like really pour

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.290 
mean that was that was like really pour
on<00:02:29.250> my<00:02:29.430> part<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:29.849> feel<00:02:30.030> like<00:02:31.910> yeah<00:02:32.910> but<00:02:33.060> if<00:02:33.150> you

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
on my part I feel like yeah but if you

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.910 
on my part I feel like yeah but if you
know<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.750> level<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.349> can<00:02:34.470> plan

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
know the level and you can plan

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.710 
know the level and you can plan
accordingly<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.700> could<00:02:35.849> be<00:02:36.000> extremely

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
accordingly you could be extremely

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.759 
accordingly you could be extremely
efficient<00:02:37.319> right<00:02:39.230> which<00:02:40.230> i<00:02:40.349> think<00:02:40.410> would<00:02:40.620> be<00:02:40.680> a

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
efficient right which i think would be a

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.920 
efficient right which i think would be a
real<00:02:41.040> neat<00:02:41.340> like<00:02:41.519> secondary<00:02:42.120> objective<00:02:42.660> here

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
real neat like secondary objective here

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.920 
real neat like secondary objective here
yeah<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:43.980> felt<00:02:44.310> included<00:02:44.670> level<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.269> three

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
yeah I felt included level and three

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.300 
yeah I felt included level and three
rotations<00:02:46.470> or<00:02:46.650> whatever

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:01.980 

and<00:02:53.090> got<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.110> gun<00:02:54.260> Burkholder<00:02:57.340> disco<00:02:58.340> party

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:08.340 

see<00:03:02.990> here<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.560> go<00:03:03.980> down<00:03:04.190> Oh<00:03:04.819> No

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
all right so now this is introducing

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.900 
all right so now this is introducing
another<00:03:11.569> element<00:03:11.959> here<00:03:12.050> in<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:12.650> drawer

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
another element here in that drawer

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.880 
another element here in that drawer
one<00:03:14.300> side<00:03:14.690> is<00:03:14.720> shielded<00:03:17.319> seeing<00:03:18.319> over<00:03:18.620> flames

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
one side is shielded seeing over flames

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.199 
one side is shielded seeing over flames
like<00:03:19.040> I'll<00:03:19.220> just<00:03:19.250> show<00:03:19.550> you<00:03:19.580> what<00:03:19.760> happens<00:03:20.060> if

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
to did the shield on the right spot see

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.940 
to did the shield on the right spot see
ya<00:03:43.730> this<00:03:44.060> is<00:03:44.239> uh<00:03:44.350> it's<00:03:45.350> kind<00:03:45.620> of<00:03:45.680> what<00:03:45.769> you<00:03:45.830> do

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
ya this is uh it's kind of what you do

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:56.620 
ya this is uh it's kind of what you do
in<00:03:46.069> gun<00:03:46.250> brick<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:55.280> here's<00:03:55.430> another<00:03:55.640> part

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
in gun brick so here's another part

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.650 
in gun brick so here's another part
where<00:03:56.900> I'm<00:03:57.500> doing<00:03:57.829> I<00:03:58.190> feel<00:03:58.760> like<00:03:58.880> this<00:03:59.030> is<00:03:59.180> very

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
where I'm doing I feel like this is very

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.640 
where I'm doing I feel like this is very
very<00:03:59.900> suboptimal<00:04:00.500> as<00:04:01.010> far<00:04:01.220> as<00:04:02.019> gun<00:04:03.019> shooting

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
very suboptimal as far as gun shooting

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:15.020 
very suboptimal as far as gun shooting
is<00:04:03.799> concerned<00:04:04.310> right

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
a position where I could rotate up hmm

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.990 
a position where I could rotate up hmm
don't<00:04:43.090> remember<00:04:43.360> I<00:04:43.480> did<00:04:43.720> this<00:04:43.750> before<00:04:45.000> get

in<00:05:41.730> one<00:05:42.000> more<00:05:42.270> rotation<00:05:51.290> all<00:05:52.290> right

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.760 

see<00:05:56.850> now<00:05:57.240> we're<00:05:57.360> cooking<00:06:00.410> so<00:06:01.410> it's<00:06:01.530> basically

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
see now we're cooking so it's basically

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.190 
see now we're cooking so it's basically
how<00:06:01.980> the<00:06:02.090> the<00:06:03.090> game<00:06:03.240> goes<00:06:03.420> I<00:06:03.510> mean<00:06:03.690> it's<00:06:03.960> just

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
how the the game goes I mean it's just

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.470 
how the the game goes I mean it's just
kind<00:06:04.380> of<00:06:04.410> showing<00:06:04.620> you<00:06:04.800> the<00:06:04.980> main<00:06:05.970> mechanics

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
kind of showing you the main mechanics

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
kind of showing you the main mechanics
here<00:06:06.720> is<00:06:07.520> you<00:06:08.520> know<00:06:09.080> moving<00:06:10.080> your<00:06:10.200> brick

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
here is you know moving your brick

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.590 
here is you know moving your brick
around<00:06:10.680> so<00:06:11.160> your<00:06:11.310> gun<00:06:11.580> and<00:06:11.820> your<00:06:11.940> shield<00:06:12.000> are

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
around so your gun and your shield are
