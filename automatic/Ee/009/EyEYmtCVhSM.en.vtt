once<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.800> throw<00:00:22.859> away<00:00:22.980> but<00:00:23.550> something<00:00:23.789> that

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
once and throw away but something that

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.330 
once and throw away but something that
they<00:00:23.970> would<00:00:24.090> use<00:00:24.240> an<00:00:24.390> ongoing<00:00:24.539> basis<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.439> given

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
they would use an ongoing basis so given

that<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.519> World<00:00:26.760> Cup<00:00:26.970> what<00:00:27.480> happens<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:28.230> a

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
that the World Cup what happens for a

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.279 
that the World Cup what happens for a
portion<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.279> year<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:30.599> thought<00:00:31.170> it

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
portion of the this year I thought it

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.840 
portion of the this year I thought it
might<00:00:31.380> be<00:00:31.529> useful<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.949> build<00:00:32.579> an<00:00:32.700> application

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
might be useful to build an application

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.459 
might be useful to build an application
that<00:00:33.239> was<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> little<00:00:33.510> bit<00:00:33.660> more<00:00:33.780> robust<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.320> lot

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
that was a little bit more robust a lot

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.020 
that was a little bit more robust a lot
of<00:00:34.530> people<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.920> monitor<00:00:35.399> league<00:00:35.700> play

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
of people to monitor league play

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.660 
of people to monitor league play
throughout<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.140> year<00:00:37.410> for<00:00:37.950> whatever<00:00:38.399> teams

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
throughout the year for whatever teams

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.610 
throughout the year for whatever teams
they<00:00:38.940> were<00:00:39.000> interested<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.629> what<00:00:40.200> we<00:00:40.410> have

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
they were interested in what we have

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.819 
they were interested in what we have
here<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.690> just<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.079> application<00:00:43.710> itself

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
here is the just the application itself

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.670 
here is the just the application itself
but<00:00:44.399> before<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.760> get<00:00:44.850> into<00:00:45.050> using<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.170> let<00:00:46.590> me

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
but before I get into using it let me

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.350 
but before I get into using it let me
just<00:00:46.860> show<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.070> some<00:00:47.489> PowerPoint<00:00:48.090> slides

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
just show you some PowerPoint slides

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.600 
just show you some PowerPoint slides
about<00:00:48.600> its<00:00:49.230> functionality<00:00:51.020> now<00:00:52.430> some<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.550> the

about its functionality now some of the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.670 
about its functionality now some of the
things<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:55.020> our<00:00:55.199> previous

the rotating soccer ball has no

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.840 
the rotating soccer ball has no
functionality<00:01:01.109> whatsoever<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.520> there

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
functionality whatsoever but it's there

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.600 
functionality whatsoever but it's there
and<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.600> makes<00:01:04.140> them<00:01:04.320> look<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.650> lil<00:01:04.860> nice<00:01:05.100> they

also have a couple of interactive

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.859 
also have a couple of interactive
buttons<00:01:08.100> here<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.330> circle

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
buttons here one is just the circle

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.850 
buttons here one is just the circle
