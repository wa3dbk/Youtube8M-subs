are<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:41.239> batteries<00:00:41.659> and<00:00:42.650> I'm<00:00:42.800> gonna<00:00:42.920> it<00:00:43.909> fits

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
are the batteries and I'm gonna it fits

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.710 
are the batteries and I'm gonna it fits
in<00:00:44.329> there<00:00:45.790> so<00:00:46.790> that's<00:00:46.879> a<00:00:47.059> fitting<00:00:47.329> certain<00:00:47.600> way

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
in there so that's a fitting certain way

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.240 
in there so that's a fitting certain way
to<00:00:47.780> fit<00:00:48.079> in<00:00:48.170> that<00:00:48.320> you<00:00:48.620> know<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:48.829> battery<00:00:49.190> and

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
to fit in that you know the battery and

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.819 
to fit in that you know the battery and
all<00:00:49.339> that<00:00:49.519> I'll<00:00:49.640> put<00:00:49.790> this<00:00:49.909> back<00:00:50.199> and<00:00:51.199> to

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
all that I'll put this back and to

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.530 
all that I'll put this back and to
fitting<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.190> tool<00:00:52.760> that's<00:00:53.059> to<00:00:53.149> fit<00:00:53.360> certain

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
fitting the tool that's to fit certain

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.509 
fitting the tool that's to fit certain
way<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.050> I'm<00:00:54.710> gonna<00:00:54.829> pretty<00:00:55.760> much<00:00:57.309> take<00:00:58.309> that

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
way so I'm gonna pretty much take that

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.020 
way so I'm gonna pretty much take that
off<00:00:58.760> a<00:00:59.149> couple<00:01:00.140> leads<00:01:00.320> on<00:01:00.590> it<00:01:00.800> so<00:01:01.670> I<00:01:01.730> can<00:01:01.760> hook

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
off a couple leads on it so I can hook

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.740 
off a couple leads on it so I can hook
it<00:01:02.210> to<00:01:03.339> any<00:01:04.339> battery<00:01:05.080> I<00:01:06.080> have<00:01:06.740> over<00:01:07.009> here<00:01:07.750> but

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
it to any battery I have over here but

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.840 
it to any battery I have over here but
all<00:01:08.869> have<00:01:09.020> leads<00:01:09.259> coming<00:01:09.350> off<00:01:09.590> of<00:01:09.619> this<00:01:09.979> I'll

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
all have leads coming off of this I'll

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.370 
all have leads coming off of this I'll
put<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.030> reverse<00:01:11.330> leads<00:01:11.600> on<00:01:11.750> this<00:01:11.869> guy<00:01:11.990> and

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
put the reverse leads on this guy and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.139 
put the reverse leads on this guy and
then<00:01:12.979> I'll<00:01:13.070> figure<00:01:13.250> out<00:01:13.369> a<00:01:13.429> way<00:01:13.550> to<00:01:13.580> attach<00:01:13.759> the

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
then I'll figure out a way to attach the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.580 
then I'll figure out a way to attach the
batteries<00:01:14.570> to<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.960> just<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:17.450> tool<00:01:17.899> so<00:01:18.530> I

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
batteries to the just the tool so I

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.870 
batteries to the just the tool so I
first<00:01:18.890> thing<00:01:19.039> I<00:01:19.100> do<00:01:19.160> is<00:01:19.369> rip<00:01:19.520> this<00:01:19.700> off

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
first thing I do is rip this off

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.850 
first thing I do is rip this off
desolder<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.080> then<00:01:21.200> I'm<00:01:21.289> gonna<00:01:21.380> use<00:01:21.560> my<00:01:21.679> hot

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
desolder and then I'm gonna use my hot

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.100 
desolder and then I'm gonna use my hot
glue<00:01:22.009> gun<00:01:22.100> here<00:01:23.229> to<00:01:24.580> secure<00:01:25.580> it<00:01:25.970> up<00:01:26.179> in<00:01:26.390> here<00:01:26.659> so

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
glue gun here to secure it up in here so

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.930 
glue gun here to secure it up in here so
it<00:01:27.259> doesn't<00:01:27.619> just<00:01:27.800> continuously<00:01:28.550> fall<00:01:28.789> out

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
it doesn't just continuously fall out

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.089 
it doesn't just continuously fall out
not<00:01:29.119> even<00:01:29.149> put<00:01:29.390> some<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:30.319> know<00:01:30.410> black<00:01:30.649> tape<00:01:30.890> on

00:01:31.089 --> 00:01:31.099 
not even put some you know black tape on

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:33.400 
not even put some you know black tape on
but<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:31.429> slides<00:01:32.209> into<00:01:32.539> the<00:01:32.690> charger<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.200> stuff

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
but it slides into the charger and stuff

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.529 
but it slides into the charger and stuff
so<00:01:33.530> I<00:01:33.560> got<00:01:33.679> to<00:01:33.770> be<00:01:33.830> careful<00:01:34.009> what<00:01:34.369> I<00:01:34.399> do<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:35.360> this

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
so I got to be careful what I do to this

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.600 
so I got to be careful what I do to this
particular<00:01:36.110> area<00:01:36.289> otherwise<00:01:36.590> it'll<00:01:36.979> it<00:01:37.399> won't

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
particular area otherwise it'll it won't

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.260 
particular area otherwise it'll it won't
work<00:01:37.729> in<00:01:37.910> the<00:01:38.030> tool<00:01:40.420> all<00:01:41.420> right<00:01:43.149> here's<00:01:44.149> the

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
that I have a battery over here from

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.930 
that I have a battery over here from
another<00:02:24.709> website<00:02:24.950> you<00:02:25.430> might<00:02:25.580> have<00:02:25.700> heard<00:02:25.910> of

anybody can tell me that week telling
should<00:07:38.530> increase<00:07:38.740> but<00:07:38.920> I<00:07:39.010> would<00:07:39.160> guess<00:07:39.340> 3<00:07:39.670> 3

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:40.330 
should increase but I would guess 3 3

should increase but I would guess 3 3
times<00:07:40.570> since<00:07:40.900> there's<00:07:42.090> 3<00:07:43.090> times<00:07:43.270> the<00:07:43.390> size<00:07:43.600> I

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:43.750 
times since there's 3 times the size I

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.130 
times since there's 3 times the size I
guess<00:07:44.130> Thanks
