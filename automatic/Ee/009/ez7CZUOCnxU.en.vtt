00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
the suav so to unlock the suav you need

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.410 
the suav so to unlock the suav you need
the<00:00:19.439> safe<00:00:19.920> raiding<00:00:20.369> achievement<00:00:20.939> which

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
the safe raiding achievement which

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.439 
the safe raiding achievement which
requires<00:00:21.900> one<00:00:22.020> bomber<00:00:22.650> kill<00:00:22.980> it's<00:00:23.939> really

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
requires one bomber kill it's really

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.720 
requires one bomber kill it's really
easy<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.810> do<00:00:25.050> it's<00:00:25.859> just<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.250> bit<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> struggle

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
easy to do it's just a bit of a struggle

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.070 
easy to do it's just a bit of a struggle
to<00:00:27.119> get<00:00:27.240> into<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> bomber<00:00:27.930> at<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.170> moment<00:00:30.080> so

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
to get into the bomber at the moment so

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.760 
to get into the bomber at the moment so
there's<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.380> bomber<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.769> sky<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:33.770> this

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
there's the bomber in the sky and this

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.740 
there's the bomber in the sky and this
is<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> points<00:00:36.090> where<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.329> can

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
is one of the points where you can

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.250 
is one of the points where you can
activate<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.380> bomber<00:00:38.270> so<00:00:39.270> these<00:00:39.719> points<00:00:40.020> are

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
activate the bomber so these points are

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.700 
activate the bomber so these points are
all<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.710> D<00:00:41.399> or<00:00:41.700> around<00:00:42.149> D<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.200> China<00:00:43.440> rising

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
all on D or around D on the China rising

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.420 
all on D or around D on the China rising
maps<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:45.170> when<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.410> available<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:47.309> will

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
maps and when it's available you will

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.229 
maps and when it's available you will
see<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.670> little<00:00:47.910> white<00:00:48.270> icon<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.350> door<00:00:50.239> so

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
see a little white icon on the door so

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.350 
see a little white icon on the door so
most<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.690> time<00:00:51.899> they're<00:00:52.350> being<00:00:52.590> used<00:00:53.360> this

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
most of the time they're being used this

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.360 
most of the time they're being used this
is<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> only<00:00:54.809> one<00:00:55.050> that's<00:00:55.260> not<00:00:55.770> really<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
is the only one that's not really on the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.000 
is the only one that's not really on the
D<00:00:56.699> point<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> valley<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.379> between

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
D point it's in the valley in between

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.830 
D point it's in the valley in between
the<00:00:59.160> mountain<00:00:59.640> close<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.359> D<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:04.010> this<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
the mountain close to D and this is the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.440 
the mountain close to D and this is the
final<00:01:06.840> one<00:01:07.369> so<00:01:08.369> there's<00:01:08.729> usually<00:01:08.909> people

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
final one so there's usually people

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.830 
final one so there's usually people
queuing<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.020> use<00:01:10.229> them<00:01:11.210> but<00:01:12.210> what<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.600> need<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
queuing to use them but what you need to

the<00:01:23.100> bomber<00:01:23.540> this<00:01:24.540> fires<00:01:24.900> J<00:01:25.409> dams<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.950> same<00:01:26.159> as

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the bomber this fires J dams the same as

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.090 
the bomber this fires J dams the same as
the<00:01:26.549> fighter<00:01:26.970> bomber<00:01:27.299> does<00:01:27.829> but<00:01:28.829> there's<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
the fighter bomber does but there's a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.760 
the fighter bomber does but there's a
quite<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> delay<00:01:29.790> before<00:01:30.329> they<00:01:30.840> land<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.619> is

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
quite a delay before they land this is

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.160 
quite a delay before they land this is
by<00:01:31.920> far<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.220> easiest<00:01:32.369> map<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.270> use<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.990> on

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
by far the easiest map to use it on

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.880 
by far the easiest map to use it on
because<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.880> bomb<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.240> quite<00:01:36.509> high<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
because the bomb is quite high and the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.550 
because the bomb is quite high and the
area's<00:01:38.280> flat<00:01:38.659> so<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:40.020> see<00:01:40.229> all<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
area's flat so you can see all the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.460 
area's flat so you can see all the
targets<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.280> ignored<00:01:42.000> infantry<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:43.259> went

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
targets I ignored infantry and just went

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.389 
targets I ignored infantry and just went
for<00:01:43.619> Tanks<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:45.320> just<00:01:46.320> pick<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:46.710> tanks<00:01:47.040> that

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
for Tanks so just pick out tanks that

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.819 
for Tanks so just pick out tanks that
are<00:01:47.520> stationary<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.360> fire<00:01:48.869> J<00:01:49.200> dams<00:01:49.439> at<00:01:49.649> them

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
are stationary and fire J dams at them

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.740 
are stationary and fire J dams at them
and<00:01:50.270> what<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.420> all<00:01:51.570> get<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.619> kill<00:01:53.750> that

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
and what you all get is a kill that

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.109 
and what you all get is a kill that
unlocks<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> safe<00:01:55.710> raiding<00:01:56.070> achievement

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.690 

so<00:02:01.259> completing<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.350> achievement<00:02:02.890> then<00:02:03.399> gives

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
so completing the achievement then gives

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.529 
so completing the achievement then gives
you<00:02:03.939> the<00:02:04.210> suav<00:02:07.440> so<00:02:08.440> that's<00:02:08.619> pretty<00:02:08.860> easy

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
you the suav so that's pretty easy

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.400 
you the suav so that's pretty easy
so<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.840> suav<00:02:11.709> is<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.040> recon<00:02:12.700> gadget<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:13.870> simply

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
so the suav is a recon gadget you simply

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.309 
so the suav is a recon gadget you simply
select<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.370> gadget<00:02:15.519> slot<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.630> it'll<00:02:17.050> be<00:02:17.110> on<00:02:17.200> the

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
select a gadget slot and it'll be on the

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.559 
select a gadget slot and it'll be on the
bottom<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.620> your<00:02:17.650> list<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:18.819> pop<00:02:19.300> it<00:02:19.450> in

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
bottom of your list you just pop it in

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.740 
bottom of your list you just pop it in
and<00:02:19.890> there<00:02:20.890> it<00:02:21.010> is<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:22.239> one<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.599> things

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
and there it is so one of the things

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.960 
and there it is so one of the things
you'll<00:02:22.959> instantly<00:02:23.680> think<00:02:23.890> about<00:02:24.130> is<00:02:24.340> can<00:02:24.819> I

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
you'll instantly think about is can I

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.750 
you'll instantly think about is can I
see<00:02:25.239> for<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.720> suav<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:27.340> answer<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.730> that

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
see for the suav and the answer to that

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.930 
see for the suav and the answer to that
one<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.269> no<00:02:28.599> it<00:02:29.140> launches<00:02:29.680> from<00:02:29.830> your<00:02:30.069> hand<00:02:30.400> so

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
one is no it launches from your hand so

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.870 
one is no it launches from your hand so
you<00:02:31.330> can't<00:02:31.630> put<00:02:31.810> c4<00:02:32.200> on<00:02:32.349> it<00:02:32.440> it's<00:02:33.430> pretty<00:02:33.730> easy

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
you can't put c4 on it it's pretty easy

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.759 
you can't put c4 on it it's pretty easy
to<00:02:34.030> fly<00:02:34.360> because<00:02:34.780> it's<00:02:34.930> slow-moving

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
to fly because it's slow-moving

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.309 
to fly because it's slow-moving
although<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.420> y-axis<00:02:37.420> controls<00:02:37.930> are

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
although the y-axis controls are

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.440 
although the y-axis controls are
inverted<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:39.370> what<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:39.730> think<00:02:40.060> would<00:02:40.209> be<00:02:40.360> up

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
inverted so what you think would be up

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.800 
inverted so what you think would be up
is<00:02:40.630> down<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.140> vice<00:02:41.860> versa<00:02:42.239> so<00:02:43.239> if<00:02:43.569> you're<00:02:43.690> not

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
is down and vice versa so if you're not

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.809 
is down and vice versa so if you're not
used<00:02:44.019> to<00:02:44.110> flying<00:02:44.380> it's<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.190> bit<00:02:45.340> awkward<00:02:45.700> at

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
used to flying it's a bit awkward at

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.080 
used to flying it's a bit awkward at
first<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:47.080> laser<00:02:47.290> designator<00:02:47.890> is<00:02:48.250> always<00:02:48.880> on

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
first the laser designator is always on

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.789 
first the laser designator is always on
so<00:02:49.599> at<00:02:49.720> least<00:02:49.810> we<00:02:49.959> just<00:02:50.140> have<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.410> point

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
so at least we just have to point

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.470 
so at least we just have to point
towards<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.310> vehicle<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.120> will<00:02:52.239> designate

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
towards a vehicle and it will designate

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.229 
towards a vehicle and it will designate
it<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.590> get<00:02:53.709> points<00:02:54.099> for<00:02:54.160> doing<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:54.940> and

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
it and you get points for doing that and

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.420 
it and you get points for doing that and
points<00:02:56.230> for<00:02:56.440> when<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.950> vehicles<00:02:57.370> damaged<00:02:57.880> and

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
points for when the vehicles damaged and

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.120 
points for when the vehicles damaged and
it's<00:03:00.430> quite<00:03:00.790> easy<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.690> keep<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.440> lock<00:03:02.650> although

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
it's quite easy to keep a lock although

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.370 
it's quite easy to keep a lock although
because<00:03:03.310> you're<00:03:03.579> moving<00:03:04.000> you<00:03:04.870> do<00:03:05.079> and<00:03:05.230> have<00:03:05.350> a

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
because you're moving you do and have a

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.520 
because you're moving you do and have a
limited<00:03:05.799> time<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.040> lock<00:03:06.340> on<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:06.579> things<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:08.140> it

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
limited time to lock on to things and it

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.340 
limited time to lock on to things and it
will<00:03:08.680> lock<00:03:08.980> on<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.400> empty<00:03:09.940> vehicles<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.810> two

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
will lock on to empty vehicles and two

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.559 
will lock on to empty vehicles and two
stationary<00:03:11.920> weapons<00:03:12.430> as<00:03:12.609> well<00:03:12.640> which<00:03:13.209> can

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
stationary weapons as well which can

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.479 
stationary weapons as well which can
mean<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.380> will<00:03:14.500> lock<00:03:14.680> on<00:03:14.829> to<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.100> rather<00:03:15.310> than

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
mean it will lock on to that rather than

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.120 
mean it will lock on to that rather than
what<00:03:15.670> you<00:03:15.760> actually<00:03:15.880> want<00:03:16.650> but<00:03:17.650> it's<00:03:17.889> quite

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
what you actually want but it's quite

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.940 
what you actually want but it's quite
easy<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.489> use<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.870> on<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.319> right<00:03:20.500> hand<00:03:20.650> side

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
easy to use so on the right hand side

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.670 
easy to use so on the right hand side
you'll<00:03:21.250> see<00:03:21.340> there's<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.819> box<00:03:22.060> with<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.299> two

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
you'll see there's a box with the two

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.229 
you'll see there's a box with the two
blocks<00:03:23.680> in<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.579> one<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:24.819> them<00:03:24.910> is<00:03:25.000> about<00:03:25.090> to

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
blocks in and one of them is about to

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.509 
blocks in and one of them is about to
vanish<00:03:25.569> because<00:03:26.470> that's<00:03:26.889> the<00:03:27.069> battery

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
vanish because that's the battery

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.349 
vanish because that's the battery
running<00:03:27.730> out<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.209> has<00:03:28.510> a<00:03:28.540> limited<00:03:28.989> lifespan<00:03:30.359> so

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
running out it has a limited lifespan so

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.509 
running out it has a limited lifespan so
you<00:03:32.170> can't<00:03:32.500> keep<00:03:32.709> it<00:03:32.889> in<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.100> air<00:03:33.220> all<00:03:33.489> the

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
you can't keep it in the air all the

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.849 
you can't keep it in the air all the
time<00:03:35.160> but<00:03:36.160> what<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.459> can<00:03:36.670> do<00:03:36.910> is<00:03:37.680> find<00:03:38.680> a

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
time but what you can do is find a

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.809 
time but what you can do is find a
convenient<00:03:39.250> ammo<00:03:39.850> crate<00:03:40.540> because<00:03:41.549> this<00:03:42.549> thing

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
convenient ammo crate because this thing

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.479 
convenient ammo crate because this thing
reloads<00:03:43.450> really<00:03:44.319> quickly<00:03:44.769> I<00:03:44.950> think<00:03:45.340> that's

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
reloads really quickly I think that's

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.400 
reloads really quickly I think that's
going<00:03:45.609> to<00:03:45.700> get<00:03:45.850> nerfed<00:03:46.180> because<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:47.019> can<00:03:47.170> just

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
going to get nerfed because you can just

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.050 
going to get nerfed because you can just
lie<00:03:47.590> there<00:03:47.859> and<00:03:47.980> constantly<00:03:48.250> spam<00:03:48.850> these

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
lie there and constantly spam these

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.640 
lie there and constantly spam these
things<00:03:49.359> at<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.600> moment<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.510> can<00:03:53.260> just

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
things at the moment so you can just

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.879 
things at the moment so you can just
press<00:03:54.280> Q<00:03:54.700> to<00:03:54.910> spot<00:03:55.209> people<00:03:55.630> on<00:03:56.019> vehicles<00:03:56.620> or

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
press Q to spot people on vehicles or

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.710 
press Q to spot people on vehicles or
they<00:03:57.040> just<00:03:57.190> seem<00:03:57.549> to<00:03:57.579> have<00:03:57.790> a<00:03:57.819> motion<00:03:58.150> sensor

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
they just seem to have a motion sensor

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.319 
they just seem to have a motion sensor
on<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:58.989> as<00:03:59.109> well<00:03:59.430> now<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.609> does<00:04:00.819> have<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.180> same

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
on it as well now it does have the same

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.229 
on it as well now it does have the same
outbound<00:04:01.900> limits<00:04:02.290> as<00:04:02.470> soldiers<00:04:03.280> not<00:04:03.639> as<00:04:03.819> air

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
outbound limits as soldiers not as air

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.229 
outbound limits as soldiers not as air
vehicles<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:05.079> as<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.220> can<00:04:06.310> see<00:04:06.489> it<00:04:07.000> will

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
vehicles and as you can see it will

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.319 
vehicles and as you can see it will
quite<00:04:07.540> happily<00:04:07.620> road<00:04:08.620> kill<00:04:08.919> people<00:04:09.340> which<00:04:10.180> is

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
quite happily road kill people which is

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:11.849 
quite happily road kill people which is
why<00:04:10.479> I<00:04:10.509> think<00:04:10.840> is<00:04:10.959> going<00:04:11.169> to<00:04:11.229> get<00:04:11.410> nerfed

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
why I think is going to get nerfed

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.350 
why I think is going to get nerfed
because<00:04:12.280> just<00:04:12.489> laying<00:04:12.729> here<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.090> me

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
because just laying here and me

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.730 
because just laying here and me
means<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:13.690> can<00:04:13.990> just<00:04:14.020> keep<00:04:14.290> throwing<00:04:14.470> these

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
means I can just keep throwing these

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.090 
means I can just keep throwing these
things<00:04:14.800> out<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:17.109> does<00:04:17.410> no<00:04:17.560> damage<00:04:17.590> when<00:04:18.040> he

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
things out it does no damage when he

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.490 
things out it does no damage when he
hits<00:04:18.280> vehicles<00:04:18.730> though<00:04:18.940> so<00:04:19.630> there's<00:04:20.049> no<00:04:20.200> point

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
hits vehicles though so there's no point

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.050 
hits vehicles though so there's no point
in<00:04:20.590> trying<00:04:20.709> that<00:04:22.320> but<00:04:23.320> yeah<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.890> can<00:04:24.100> you<00:04:24.700> just

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
in trying that but yeah you can you just

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.180 
in trying that but yeah you can you just
lie<00:04:25.270> next<00:04:25.510> to<00:04:25.630> an<00:04:25.750> ammo<00:04:25.990> bag<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:26.500> throw<00:04:27.010> these

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
lie next to an ammo bag and throw these
