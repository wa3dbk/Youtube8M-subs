00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
housing is at all right so we've got a

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.020 
housing is at all right so we've got a
couple<00:01:02.980> tools<00:01:03.430> that<00:01:03.640> we're<00:01:03.730> going<00:01:03.760> to<00:01:03.879> be

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
couple tools that we're going to be

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.600 
couple tools that we're going to be
using<00:01:04.420> I<00:01:05.110> like<00:01:05.530> to<00:01:05.650> leave<00:01:05.830> as<00:01:06.040> little<00:01:06.190> impact

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
using I like to leave as little impact

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.730 
using I like to leave as little impact
as<00:01:06.790> it<00:01:06.880> possibly<00:01:07.060> can<00:01:07.479> but<00:01:08.229> on<00:01:08.320> these<00:01:08.440> tabs

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
as it possibly can but on these tabs

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.290 
as it possibly can but on these tabs
basically<00:01:09.280> all<00:01:09.399> we'll<00:01:09.550> be<00:01:09.670> doing<00:01:09.970> is<00:01:10.119> simply

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
basically all we'll be doing is simply

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.469 
basically all we'll be doing is simply
lifting<00:01:10.810> these<00:01:10.899> up<00:01:11.140> kind<00:01:11.740> of<00:01:11.770> like<00:01:11.950> such<00:01:12.479> and

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
lifting these up kind of like such and

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.690 
lifting these up kind of like such and
kind<00:01:13.720> of<00:01:13.780> see<00:01:13.899> how<00:01:13.990> that<00:01:14.050> works<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:15.250> then<00:01:15.580> we

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
kind of see how that works and then we

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.080 
kind of see how that works and then we
should<00:01:15.910> be<00:01:16.030> able<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.420> take<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:18.850> kind<00:01:19.000> of

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
should be able to take this and kind of

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.630 
should be able to take this and kind of
slide<00:01:19.360> it<00:01:19.509> up<00:01:19.630> underneath<00:01:19.869> there<00:01:23.190> voila<00:01:24.190> we'll

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
slide it up underneath there voila we'll

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.240 
slide it up underneath there voila we'll
do<00:01:24.729> that<00:01:24.880> six<00:01:25.119> times<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:26.040> we'll<00:01:27.040> have<00:01:27.160> this

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
do that six times and we'll have this

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
do that six times and we'll have this
off<00:01:27.430> in<00:01:27.610> just<00:01:27.940> a<00:01:28.060> moment<00:01:29.310> all<00:01:30.310> right<00:01:30.369> so<00:01:30.759> we<00:01:31.090> got

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
off in just a moment all right so we got

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.600 
off in just a moment all right so we got
all<00:01:31.720> six<00:01:31.990> of<00:01:32.080> them<00:01:32.200> pulled<00:01:32.380> out<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.890> pretty

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
all six of them pulled out and pretty

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.830 
all six of them pulled out and pretty
much<00:01:33.729> all<00:01:33.940> we're<00:01:34.090> doing<00:01:34.300> now<00:01:34.420> is<00:01:34.600> going<00:01:34.630> to<00:01:34.780> be

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
much all we're doing now is going to be

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.779 
much all we're doing now is going to be
pulling<00:01:35.110> this<00:01:35.229> out<00:01:35.470> so<00:01:36.310> you<00:01:36.340> can<00:01:36.460> tell<00:01:36.610> here

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
pulling this out so you can tell here

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:37.920 
pulling this out so you can tell here
and<00:01:36.910> that'll<00:01:37.090> allow<00:01:37.119> us<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.539> be<00:01:37.630> able<00:01:37.690> to<00:01:37.780> get

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
and that'll allow us to be able to get

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.080 
and that'll allow us to be able to get
into<00:01:38.170> this<00:01:38.380> but<00:01:39.250> this<00:01:39.399> should<00:01:39.610> break<00:01:39.820> free

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
into this but this should break free

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.359 
into this but this should break free
pretty<00:01:40.509> easily<00:01:40.840> just<00:01:41.560> by<00:01:41.740> simply<00:01:42.220> just

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
pretty easily just by simply just

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.249 
pretty easily just by simply just
getting<00:01:43.209> a<00:01:43.270> hold<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.569> it<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:43.840> giving<00:01:44.110> a<00:01:44.140> little

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
getting a hold of it and giving a little

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:50.940 
getting a hold of it and giving a little
bit<00:01:44.440> of<00:01:44.500> a<00:01:44.649> persuasive<00:01:45.399> click<00:01:49.080> there<00:01:50.080> okay<00:01:50.649> and

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
bit of a persuasive click there okay and

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.210 
bit of a persuasive click there okay and
that'll<00:01:51.340> make<00:01:51.399> it<00:01:51.459> so<00:01:51.640> we<00:01:51.729> can<00:01:51.759> get<00:01:51.940> into<00:01:52.090> these

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
that'll make it so we can get into these

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.710 
that'll make it so we can get into these
all<00:01:54.220> right<00:01:54.399> so<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.729> tendency<00:01:54.910> would<00:01:55.330> be<00:01:55.450> just

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
all right so the tendency would be just

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.330 
all right so the tendency would be just
to<00:01:55.780> go<00:01:55.840> ahead<00:01:56.080> and<00:01:56.200> pull<00:01:56.349> these<00:01:56.530> bulbs<00:01:56.860> out<00:01:57.190> and

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
to go ahead and pull these bulbs out and

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.830 
to go ahead and pull these bulbs out and
get<00:01:57.459> all<00:01:57.550> frog<00:01:57.849> you<00:01:58.030> with<00:01:58.209> it<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:58.539> switch

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
get all frog you with it and switch

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.949 
get all frog you with it and switch
things<00:01:59.170> over<00:01:59.649> as<00:02:00.580> we<00:02:00.789> weave<00:02:01.330> pull<00:02:01.539> both<00:02:01.750> sides

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
things over as we weave pull both sides

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
down here not an issue but these are

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.890 
down here not an issue but these are
filled<00:02:45.819> with

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
filled with

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.000

xenon<00:02:47.890> now<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:49.090> symbol<00:02:49.390> for<00:02:49.989> xenon<00:02:50.290> is<00:02:50.500> X<00:02:50.799> II

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
xenon now the symbol for xenon is X II

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.759 
xenon now the symbol for xenon is X II
so<00:02:52.000> therefore<00:02:52.450> these<00:02:52.599> must<00:02:52.840> be<00:02:53.019> some<00:02:53.230> of<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.439> x

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769

had and I've just simply got them over
to<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.129> side<00:03:57.250> we'll<00:03:57.609> put<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:58.169> case<00:03:59.169> back<00:03:59.410> on

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
to the side we'll put the case back on

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.000 
to the side we'll put the case back on
them<00:03:59.829> and<00:04:00.840> we'll<00:04:01.840> go<00:04:01.959> install<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.470> bulbs<00:04:02.799> and

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
we'll be almost done alright so now

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.770 
we'll be almost done alright so now
we're<00:04:06.790> just<00:04:06.819> going<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.090> do<00:04:07.150> this<00:04:07.299> in<00:04:07.449> reverse

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
we're just going to do this in reverse

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.939 
we're just going to do this in reverse
order<00:04:08.079> and<00:04:08.319> put<00:04:08.500> all<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.709> stuff<00:04:08.889> back

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
order and put all the stuff back

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.879 
order and put all the stuff back
together<00:04:09.659> so<00:04:10.659> I<00:04:10.720> went<00:04:10.989> ahead<00:04:11.049> and<00:04:11.290> did<00:04:11.349> a<00:04:11.409> test

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
together so I went ahead and did a test

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.379 
together so I went ahead and did a test
run<00:04:12.099> on<00:04:12.129> it<00:04:12.280> real<00:04:12.639> quick<00:04:12.669> to<00:04:13.000> make<00:04:13.120> sure<00:04:13.239> it's

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
run on it real quick to make sure it's

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.780 
run on it real quick to make sure it's
working<00:04:13.949> before<00:04:14.949> I<00:04:15.099> start<00:04:15.340> tying<00:04:15.519> all<00:04:15.669> these

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
working before I start tying all these

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.670 
working before I start tying all these
screws<00:04:16.120> back<00:04:16.269> up<00:04:16.539> again<00:04:17.169> make<00:04:17.349> sure<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:17.500> that

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
screws back up again make sure that that

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.060 
screws back up again make sure that that
little<00:04:17.889> red<00:04:18.099> clip<00:04:18.430> is<00:04:18.729> pushed<00:04:19.150> down<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:20.590> don't

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
little red clip is pushed down and don't

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.939 
little red clip is pushed down and don't
over<00:04:21.340> tighten<00:04:21.459> those<00:04:21.729> screws<00:04:21.990> remember<00:04:22.990> where

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:23.949 
over tighten those screws remember where

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:24.960 
over tighten those screws remember where
you<00:04:24.039> took<00:04:24.130> them<00:04:24.280> out<00:04:24.370> there<00:04:24.520> probably<00:04:24.820> about

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
you took them out there probably about

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.850 
you took them out there probably about
hand<00:04:25.330> tight<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:25.870> they<00:04:26.440> need<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.650> be<00:04:26.740> about

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
hand tight and they need to be about

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.960 
hand tight and they need to be about
hand<00:04:27.159> tight<00:04:27.340> when<00:04:27.460> you<00:04:27.550> place<00:04:27.699> them<00:04:27.849> back

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
hand tight when you place them back

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.390 
hand tight when you place them back
together<00:04:28.150> all<00:04:29.050> right<00:04:29.080> so<00:04:29.590> we<00:04:29.860> got<00:04:30.010> both<00:04:30.190> sides

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
together all right so we got both sides

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.550 
together all right so we got both sides
in<00:04:30.789> I've<00:04:31.300> probably<00:04:31.510> got<00:04:31.750> maybe<00:04:31.900> 10<00:04:32.260> minutes

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
in I've probably got maybe 10 minutes

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.890 
in I've probably got maybe 10 minutes

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
in there is a clip you got to line that

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.320 
in there is a clip you got to line that
thing<00:05:23.380> up<00:05:23.620> before<00:05:24.010> you<00:05:24.160> get<00:05:24.820> the<00:05:24.940> sink<00:05:25.150> pushed

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
thing up before you get the sink pushed

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.230 
thing up before you get the sink pushed
by<00:05:25.570> gather<00:05:25.810> and<00:05:26.350> it<00:05:27.130> should<00:05:27.340> just<00:05:27.850> click<00:05:28.090> right

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
by gather and it should just click right
