the<00:01:13.290> left<00:01:13.470> side<00:01:13.650> what<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.280> just

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the left side what we have is just

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.460 
the left side what we have is just
basically<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.150> know<00:01:15.240> directly<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.960> speaker

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
volume rocker and that's it you have the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.270 
volume rocker and that's it you have the
ability<00:01:18.960> basically<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.740> locking<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.189> you

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
ability basically of locking in you

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.770 
ability basically of locking in you
notice<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> actual<00:01:21.000> model<00:01:21.270> itself<00:01:21.479> does<00:01:21.750> not

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
notice the actual model itself does not

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.240 
notice the actual model itself does not
look<00:01:22.049> like<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.259> has<00:01:22.500> touchwiz<00:01:22.950> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
look like it has touchwiz and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.980 
look like it has touchwiz and
essentially<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:24.270> once<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.600> press<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.930> hold

manage<00:03:21.490> the<00:03:21.640> panels<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:23.290> go<00:03:23.440> in<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:23.890> have

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
manage the panels you go in you have

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.980 
manage the panels you go in you have
multiple<00:03:24.100> panels<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:24.670> can<00:03:24.730> select<00:03:25.030> them<00:03:25.270> for

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
multiple panels you can select them for

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.570 
multiple panels you can select them for
as<00:03:26.319> far<00:03:26.470> as<00:03:26.620> I<00:03:26.680> remember<00:03:26.709> because<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.310> think<00:03:27.370> if

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
as far as I remember because I think if

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.100 
as far as I remember because I think if
I<00:03:27.670> go<00:03:27.819> anymore<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.270> doesn't<00:03:28.330> allow<00:03:28.690> me<00:03:28.810> anymore

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
I go anymore it doesn't allow me anymore

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.110 
I go anymore it doesn't allow me anymore
but<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:29.800> can<00:03:29.950> just<00:03:30.100> simply<00:03:30.370> deselect<00:03:30.640> one<00:03:30.970> and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
but you can just simply deselect one and

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.449 
but you can just simply deselect one and
add<00:03:31.240> another<00:03:31.510> one<00:03:31.720> so<00:03:31.990> we<00:03:32.140> can<00:03:32.170> go<00:03:32.440> into<00:03:32.709> memory

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
add another one so we can go into memory

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:34.860 
add another one so we can go into memory
match<00:03:33.670> it's<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.150> different<00:03:34.480> game<00:03:34.600> that<00:03:34.810> was

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
match it's a different game that was

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.699 
match it's a different game that was
added<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.380> then<00:03:35.980> by<00:03:36.640> going<00:03:36.910> home<00:03:37.709> actually

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
added and then by going home actually

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.020 
added and then by going home actually
it's<00:03:38.830> art<00:03:38.980> managed<00:03:39.310> panels<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:39.820> we're<00:03:39.910> going

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
it's art managed panels and we're going

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.320 
it's art managed panels and we're going
to<00:03:40.090> add<00:03:40.180> that<00:03:40.209> one<00:03:40.480> back<00:03:41.220> take<00:03:42.220> this<00:03:42.459> thing

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
to add that one back take this thing

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.470 
to add that one back take this thing
once<00:03:43.930> you're<00:03:44.080> done<00:03:44.200> here<00:03:44.980> go<00:03:45.280> home<00:03:45.520> I'm<00:03:46.270> sure

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
once you're done here go home I'm sure

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.620 
once you're done here go home I'm sure
enough

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:04:00.540 

maybe<00:03:50.290> Nash<00:03:50.530> now<00:03:51.100> again<00:03:51.370> we<00:03:51.970> could<00:03:52.120> play<00:03:52.680> start

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.420 

so<00:04:01.650> obviously<00:04:02.650> not<00:04:02.830> one<00:04:02.950> of<00:04:02.980> my<00:04:03.100> finest

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
so obviously not one of my finest

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.050 
so obviously not one of my finest
moments<00:04:03.460> but<00:04:03.820> I<00:04:03.880> could<00:04:04.120> definitely<00:04:04.180> try<00:04:04.710> and

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
moments but I could definitely try and

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.220 
moments but I could definitely try and
pressing<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.120> home<00:04:07.270> generally<00:04:07.630> will<00:04:07.840> reset

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
pressing the home generally will reset

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.080 
pressing the home generally will reset
all<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.470> paths<00:04:08.950> so<00:04:09.250> if<00:04:09.310> i<00:04:09.430> press<00:04:09.610> one<00:04:09.670> here

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
all the paths so if i press one here

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.190 
all the paths so if i press one here
takes<00:04:10.330> me<00:04:10.480> back<00:04:10.600> to<00:04:10.660> this<00:04:10.870> nice<00:04:11.080> little
