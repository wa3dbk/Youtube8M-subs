at<00:01:22.920> me<00:01:23.540> when<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.570> feel<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.080> in

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.320 

tree<00:01:30.170> on<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.350> K<00:01:30.650> in<00:01:30.830> less<00:01:31.760> than<00:01:31.910> seven<00:01:32.240> hours

stuff you want to feel afterwards I mean

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.490 
stuff you want to feel afterwards I mean
that's<00:01:39.110> normal<00:01:39.620> even<00:01:40.370> you<00:01:40.490> have<00:01:40.520> a<00:01:40.640> good<00:01:40.850> shape

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
that's normal even you have a good shape

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.900 
that's normal even you have a good shape
the<00:01:42.500> recovery<00:01:42.979> is<00:01:43.940> not
