bearings if they're noisy replace and
then<00:01:11.400> basically<00:01:11.790> you've<00:01:12.000> got<00:01:12.049> bulbs<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.110> are

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
then basically you've got bulbs that are

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.230 
then basically you've got bulbs that are
all<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> same<00:01:13.590> length<00:01:15.740> one<00:01:16.740> two<00:01:17.040> three<00:01:17.430> four

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
all the same length one two three four

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.530 
five six
obviously<00:01:20.820> bypass<00:01:21.600> worse<00:01:21.869> than<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.520> I've

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
obviously bypass worse than that I've

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.270 
obviously bypass worse than that I've
moved<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.689> wiring<00:01:25.110> from<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.320> TPS<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.159> that

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
moved the wiring from the TPS in that

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.749 
moved the wiring from the TPS in that
just<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.610> give<00:01:27.090> myself<00:01:27.240> access<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.520> pump

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
just to give myself access and the pump

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:37.310 
just to give myself access and the pump
really<00:01:30.570> should<00:01:30.840> slide<00:01:31.829> out<00:01:32.869> somehow<00:01:36.320> anyway

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
really should slide out somehow anyway

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.649 
really should slide out somehow anyway
