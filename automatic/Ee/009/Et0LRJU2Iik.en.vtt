00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:05.150
 We would have liked to have accompanied the Karawanken tour for that already 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:06.770
 Trade goods arranged 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.040
 a whole lot of heavy BossHoss engineering had already been running 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.879
 engine 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.759
 In the USA you can see some examples at events 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:17.429
 in Europe 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.739
 they are the exotics par excellence 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:24.660
 the BossHoss are considered the giants on the street and that 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.410
 rightly 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.499
 besides her interesting appearance 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.710
 But above all, it's all about the engines 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.520
 up to 500 hp from a Chevrolet Beat push button ahead of the race cars 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.670
 The infernal sound of the v8 engine leaves even the good environment 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.660
 a holly 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.660
 a moped 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.340
 even if the massive Forsthaus machine almost by their construction 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.400
 It almost looks like they are in no way 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.640
 a spin on the gas tap 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 have to leave the scenic 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.810
 volunteer in doing what they do for bikes 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.360
 the semi-final round 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.360
 the people in the long run 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.540
 Frankfurt is 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.880
 monitor the clock 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.880
 so the brief leadership was prominent complaints 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.400
 if everything goes on 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.140
 time is left for them 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.120
 when crowd puller 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.270
 until available 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.910
 but no matter who you saw 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.820
 17 years old, he also wanted to reach across the border 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.860
 Euro has been captured 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.660
 but divers searched meanwhile back or Purple Germany reference on place 7 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.999
 to arrive at Brender consumers 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:11.999
 but must be under global leader 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.239
 it was not a success 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.599
 more practical with saxony-anhalt's success is pleased 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.599
 this was clearly denied by urgewald 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.649
 he headed the motorcycle startup Day the Mambo exploded
