 which can we do a restoration of 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.870
 our operating system without reaching 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.059
 waste time making a copy of 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.640

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.960
 we can do it and return our 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.090
 computer 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.210
 now it manufactures the two format without 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.690

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.600
 it reboots do not bring errors and from that 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.360
 way to improve the performance of 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.280
 operating system in this are going to do 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:36.010

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.500
 we just go with our mouse to 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.840
 this corner where it says configuration 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.470
