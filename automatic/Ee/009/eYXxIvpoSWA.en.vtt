00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello youtube users welcome to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.150
 this video that is a personal top of the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.490
 best games I've had pleasure 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.740
 of playing throughout my life are seven 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.570
 and they have all been a before and after 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.429
 in my life gamer I want to clarify that 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.560
 they are all my opinion and there was no 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.600
 any influence on your position well 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.119
 let's start on this site is located 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.619
 undoubtedly and software 3 this 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.449
 game for me was the culmination 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.310
 perfect of a trilogy that was 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.740
 named the best saga of the seventh 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.750
 generation was for its beautiful graphics 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.969
 that helped to give that environment post 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.710
 apocalyptic and sometimes dark the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.750
 culmination of a story not so 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.090
 elaborated but that was not done to 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.010
 steam like in other sagas of the genre a 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.600
 third-person gameplay so 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.520
 perfect that neither the player anymore 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.160
 Fussy could find him flaws 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.500
 this title gives us constant action 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.300
 and some characters with personality 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.489
 varied that will make us identify with 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.289
 even if it's one of them this game was 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.390
 the one that convinced me to try other 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.070
 in addition to those of nintendo but no doubt 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.780
 what most made me enjoy this 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.699
 they were the hours and hours that 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.860
 spend with my friends in the way 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.090
 horde and versus more in the horde mode that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.890
 nothing where between 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.929
 we all made a strategy in 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.000
 set to be able to defeat the waves 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:13.920
 of fairness and company in addition to the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.229
 occasional giant monsters that 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.969
 they appeared make this game one of the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.429
 What a better taste in my mouth 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.679
 in life and in software in the seventh 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.259
 place continuing with the metroid list 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.240
 prime 2 echo is one of the games of 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.759
 experienced exploration first person 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.709
 shooter that best played in his times 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.079
 It was all a treat in sight 

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:35.909
 It showed the power of the game cue despite 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.069
 that he did not have a huge amount of 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.079
 action could be said that the game in 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.119
 that aspect was boring is for his 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.579
 exploration and great level design that 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.979
 this sequel game on the list in addition to 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.349
 present a fairly acceptable challenge 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.299
 for his time in addition to presenting us 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.369
 end to a dark enemy that was not 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.679
 simply a character with details 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.840
 blacks since dark samos despite being 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.179
 similar in form was different in 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.429
 some aspects of the design in the fifth 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.679
 ubiquitous step silent hill game that 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.329
 I recently played via emulator but 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.280
 that in spite of that I kept looking like 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.950
 an excellent excellent game 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.600
 excellent horror handling 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.210
 psychological that leaves fashions 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.890
 lenderman as a children's game besides 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.440
 have an excellent soundtrack 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.180
 maybe the only thing that tarnishes it is that it does not 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.490
 you know you can get different 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.860
 end until you make an accident 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.750
 X thing since the game does not inform you 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.820
 about it but for me it's the best game 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.100
 of horror that I have played to date yet 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.470
 waiting to see if they read hill 2 or 3 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.780
 can overcome it in the fourth site is 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.940
 super smash bros 1000 and for me the best 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.980
 game of the saga since it was more technical 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.440
 that what was raul where the objects 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.330
 they predominate in a thousand and also an improvement 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.040
 graphic in comparison to the 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.230
 64 bit version 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.300
 this game also introduced the mode 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.430
 adventure that for me is simply a 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.260
 flash and with some added but the 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.120
 final battle against a mÃ¡user more 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.950
 large than normal and if you hurry 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.230
 fight with giga bausset was something 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.150
 phenomenal besides that I had my share of the 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.070
 favorite game that was to run with your 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.920
 character one of the 'big' versions 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.930
 blue 'df 0 x I was left with the desire to 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.970
 some part like that in brawn since I 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.920
 would have liked to run a part like that with 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.010
 sonic but I deviate his multiplayer 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.720
 he also had a radical change 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.440
 introducing various modes as a camera 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.780
 slow down 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.850
 of life making us tiny to our 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.310
 characters for me were all little 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.380
 outstanding sincerely rarely 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.630
 I touched one of them but they were a good 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.300
 detail also the introduction of the ipen 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.460
 match was great introducing different 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.620
 challenges and a not easy final battle 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.420
 against giga is going to be ganondorf in you 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.880
 tube super smash bros on my list 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.800
 personal let's continue with my mario kart 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.410
 favorite and to my taste the best they have 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.930
 taken to date mario kart ds that was 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.080
 the first to enter 32 tracks in the 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.090
 Game between 16 own and 16 games 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.910
 earlier something that I would have loved 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.740
 see in doubles but as there were not many 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.720
 predecessors would have gotten many 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.670
 tracks of three games what would have 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.160
 ruined the retro tracks of games 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.380
 future this game is one of the best 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.810
 that I have played in terms of playability 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.030
 refers being impeccable except the one 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.700
 the blue carapaces came out with a lot 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.890
 often the tracks were fun the 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.750
 pretty good retro tracks selection 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.700
 continued with the mode versus 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.680
 contained a string of all the 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.169
 clues thing that inexplicably 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.520
 removed in his portable successor was the 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.440
 first racing game 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.990
 plumber's laptop in having a mode in 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.490
 line with wifi the moments you spend in 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.039
 lonely and in company are 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.650
 incomparable we hope to know if mario 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.240
 cartridge manages to surpass the one of bs we arrived 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.819
 to the first two sites in the list 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.039
 these games for nothing in the world could 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:46.319
 lose his job or at least I think so 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.319
 to date in second place 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:51.090
 find a special title 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:53.430
 it means a lot to me it's about 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.379
 super mario world is not only for me 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.479
 best mario game that I've played in the 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:59.159
 life and for the record that I have played all 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.470
 the plumber's titles the way 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:03.539
 adventure and none surpasses the magic what 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.430
 means to me maybe because it 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.289
 it's about my first Mario game in the 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.690
 life and one of my first video games 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:11.750
 maybe because he has accompanied me from 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.460
 6 years old and keeps many memories 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.860
 invaluable and my childhood but nobody 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.810
 can deny that this game is magical its 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.610
 fantastic style left behind the sober 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.520
 that had been the previous ones 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.620
 deliveries full of bright colors and 96 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.990
 worlds that are excellent for me 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.569
 none has ever seemed boring or 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.790
 silly not even the water this game 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:35.310
 it's one of those games that I'll remember 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.260
 the end of my days super mario world the 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.720
 my childhood game in this list 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.880
 many will wonder if this game 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.040
 means so much to me that game could 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.590
 to be on top of him those who know me 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.120
 they know which one occupies the first site if 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.850
 about you legend of zelda majora's 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.710
 mask and it's not about certain fashion that 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.390
 put our friend from the tee rod for 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.280
 everyone who could believe that 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.170
 ask those who follow me from 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.240
 my beginnings and they will know that since before 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.520
 that guy appeared to love that 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.590
 game of many people say that it is 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.050
 inferior to the ocarina of time but to 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.180
 I find the deeper and more sensitive the 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.980
 true this title was fought with 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.840
 the wind waker for occupying this site 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.060
 but what made him win was that until 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.490
 the date is the only game that has touched 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.770
 my heart is not literally serious 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.480
 touched the deepest part of my heart and it was 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.460
 neither more nor less than the moment when 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.200
 we saved from his spell the father of 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.330
 pamela and she hugs him more 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.490
 that emotional at that time I could feel 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.410
 an alien sensation until then for 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.510
 me because I had played several games 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.520
 but neither the ocarina nor any other 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.010
 had made him have that feeling of 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.360
 maximum concussion is for it and for everything 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.129
 what for years 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.469
 about this game that overcomes 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:45.270
 all the games on this list these are 

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:47.610
 the best titles of my life to the 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.129
 date who knows if later know 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.439
 better titles but honestly what 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:54.840
 I doubt a little unless they take the place 

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:56.819
 of the first two sites you should 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.159
 have their titles that are the best 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:00.659
 for you over all others if 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.650
 you can leave them in the 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:04.819
 comments 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.819
 see you in another video
