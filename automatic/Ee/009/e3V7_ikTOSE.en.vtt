00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.990
 good morning good morning say nothing is that 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.790
 if you have, they have just that 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.710
 that these lenses as consoles and to the south 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:18.440
 but he left his head in the truth 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.440
 conducted by the technician in an hour 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.630
 hi to all well come here on stop 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.880
 droid today we will see how to have in our 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.739
 smartphone face from tablet black fa 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.829
 enlarge and reduce the work space 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.399
 you why they won't understand anything from 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.399
 secret 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.969
 then in practice we modify the dpa 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.670
 enabled own point precisely because 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.949
 maybe they are ago you will know it lies 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.309
 in system so obviously it would be 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.559
 also came a person for all these 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.809
 things here need ruth and change 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.390
 precisely the dpi that practitioner there 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.590
 allow you to have more interface 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.939
 great as if for example track we say 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.490
 let's say smaller in the same 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.159
 screen they know more what to do them 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.170
 understand better for example in the doc below 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.360
 how many applications show you have 5 of them 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.790
 putting smaller will reduce the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.439
 icons and therefore precisely there will be more 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.320
 application therefore having unit face 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.740
 much more we say that how to have his 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.380
 small is like having the size of one 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.329
 work space of an interface of a ago 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.040
 black of a tablet or what 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.930
 you will decide on the screen of the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.119
 your smartphone also vice versa if 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.600
 you have a fable iii the interfaces of a 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.759
 tab the tablet and smart the name of god 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.649
 get yourself a backup because later really 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.229
 I know that after what comes is not 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.540
 watch allowed videos are not right 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.560
 what comes you go open video and 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:00.060
 then he says our well or their is o 400 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.040
 the dpa we enter 200 so and telephone 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.670
 mood look definitely so you do n't 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.619
 in a blackmail for pc and do it is another 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.810
 what to say that obviously we begin a 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.260
 climb the plane 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.270
 for example if you have that I do n't know 480 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.440
 of tall plants slowly more perhaps 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.120
 try 450 don't make 400 200 because 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.209
 it could happen that things become 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.370
 so small and less successful a 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.550
 click them and go slowly to 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.900
 come the actual and exact results 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.739
 so I would say go and see 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.110
 result on the internet we are going to say 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.120
 without activating then nothing we can 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.390
 bring us where I said before then the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.100
 system bring us in build right now 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.269
 drop then let's go to the root file 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.730
 system group system and build prof 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.980
 and we will change it there will be one 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.080
 entry just somewhere now 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.950
 lose your eyes a little to look for it 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.799
 here it is 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.250
 rho point on LCD point between shooting towards 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.980
 right 480 now we have 480 I don't know 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.130
 what have you still are in many to 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:11.120
 end of the year 480 and we already know of 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.859
 go to while 368 which is a good but 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.350
 you don't trust us because this goes 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.630
 well on nex 5 i don't know for the us always 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.079
 calmly I said before with milk 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.170
 plan goes healthy and goes close then 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.950
 let's save precisely we reassemble everything 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.390
 here 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.190
 i no tav has succeeded now 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.859
 we will have to restart the phone then 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.840
 here once again we see that it is 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.700
 already everything smaller we put 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.090
 new launch because the stock lancer of 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.760
 google no longer supports icons in the browser 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.829
 which in the doc then we put 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.049
 new lancer for this and how you can 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.160
 seeing is everything smaller in short there 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.930
 there were many more things now let's see 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.780
 some difference also with the other 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.329
 nexus 5 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.829
 here you see the water comes up to apcom 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.079
 and in short, it reaches safety 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.700
 there are many more applications 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.310
 even here much more application 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.200
 he thought no, so everything is smaller 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.280
 in short, if you want to have everything a little more 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.389
 a little more so and highly recommended 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.950
 because precisely 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.630
 maybe now you can also choose to 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.850
 in short, what you prefer is not 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.709
 necessary to put so small 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.310
 or maybe you want smaller not 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.060
 in short, I know this matter of taste 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.490
 still very nice 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.020
 and it is useful because sometimes yes 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.630
 try to put more applications here 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.660
 below or more applications here and then yes 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.820
 prefer more space if you find some 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.260
 incompatibility maybe with a shopping 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.450
 of applications that could 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.310
 happen that does not install 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:42.270
 applications from the Christ some not 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.190
 you find the apk downloaded or otherwise vi 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.750
 let's leave a description of a program that 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.070
 obvious solution to this problem 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:52.410
 this problem but it is obvious that the same s 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:55.830
 nothing then just ends so ends the 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:59.520
 so video also videos of 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.830
 today ends in the last video then what 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.720
 it must be said we have no sense try 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.910
 let's continue pretend that to a 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.790
 sentiment and we salute the i 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.800
 usual so who are the money if the former 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.919
 urss d'herens enav raid that one is 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.160
 reached among all in description 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:19.710
 find our facebook page for 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.240
 more things done well like because 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.220
 born are at work at so many beautiful 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.229
 little things of another thing 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.479
 silence I wanted to say a caress or not 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.950
 it's not about the song 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.080
 of love 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.350
 the strategy is pretty much in 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.900
 why don't you worry black comes to him 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.090
 and desperate don't pull yourself up 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.800
 unfortunately it will return to the miur the good 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.520
 hiring everyone and see you at a 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.520
 next video
