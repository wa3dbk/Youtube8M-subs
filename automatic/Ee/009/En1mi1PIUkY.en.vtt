00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.390
 teachers went on strike yesterday 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.789
 we understand the need for this strike 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.130
 because the years of government neglect 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.019
 compromised the minimum quality of the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.849
 public education in the state of sÃ£o paulo 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.560
 the crisis of this system capitalism 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.140
 affects the whole world has come strong in 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.700
 brazil federal municipal governments or 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.230
 to maintain the profits of the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.989
 capitalist government imposes a 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.940
 austerity against the public official 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.489
 cutting funding for education 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.590
 it was bad it got even worse in 2015 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.270
 we know that education is not just about 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.340
 teacher's responsibility 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.100
 education is the responsibility of all 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.149
 public education society exists 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.969
 mainly for the class 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.280
 worker and we students support 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.980
 but the teachers ' strike that 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.539
 teachers demand is nothing but the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.210
 that a government that brings education to 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.030
 can provide classrooms with 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.159
 fewer students and journey in the labor 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.560
 maximum of 26 weekly lessons 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.900
 teacher to better prepare his classes 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.180
 schools are not getting going 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.640
 since February the students want 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.159
 improvements and comforting class speech 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.470
 such as blast cabinets 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.560
 senior management manager 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.450
 they need me 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.909
 students in the classroom for a better 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.439
 explanation and we begin to think 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.200
 teachers employed the 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.909
 best gift learning we support 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.409
 the teachers ' strike 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.149
 we are already tired of so much 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.890
 government responsibility 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.539
 We want to have a better future. 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.429
 have a real public school 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.140
 free for all who socialize 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.820
 knowledge is not ignorance 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.009
 for these reasons that we support the 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.600
 free public campaign for all who 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.490
 fight to end debt repayment 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.979
 for transport investment 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.100
 public health education for free 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.080
 all in 2014 alone more than 2 trillion 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.869
 our pib went right into the pocket of the 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.780
 largest business bankers in the world 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.910
 Meanwhile in Brazil, hunger dies in the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.959
 hospital queues and a public school 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.450
 miserable 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.849
 we can not accept anything from the bankers 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.890
 and businessmen and everything to class 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.750
 worker for public education 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.750
