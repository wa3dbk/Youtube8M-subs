I<00:01:44.040> guess<00:01:45.040> incense<00:01:45.430> like<00:01:45.610> fall<00:01:45.820> we're<00:01:46.000> getting

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
I guess incense like fall we're getting

I guess incense like fall we're getting
a<00:01:46.450> line<00:01:46.870> in<00:01:47.110> one<00:01:50.610> we're<00:01:51.610> going<00:01:51.730> to<00:01:51.790> go<00:01:51.910> from<00:01:52.120> our

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
a line in one we're going to go from our

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.330 
a line in one we're going to go from our
yellow<00:01:52.720> and<00:01:53.170> yellow<00:01:54.010> gem<00:01:54.370> now<00:01:54.580> hey<00:01:56.190> looks<00:01:57.190> like

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
yellow and yellow gem now hey looks like

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.649 
yellow and yellow gem now hey looks like
it's<00:01:57.520> all<00:01:57.670> frickin<00:01:58.330> ridiculous

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.020 

so<00:02:03.259> I<00:02:03.649> think<00:02:04.040> we're<00:02:04.310> probably<00:02:04.520> going<00:02:04.759> to<00:02:04.820> go

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
so I think we're probably going to go

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.770 
so I think we're probably going to go
with<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:06.110> some<00:02:06.770> haste<00:02:07.039> because<00:02:08.030> that<00:02:08.479> seems

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
with the some haste because that seems

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.930 
with the some haste because that seems
to<00:02:08.929> be<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.080> cheap<00:02:09.860> buy<00:02:10.670> like<00:02:10.849> five<00:02:11.180> silver

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
to be the cheap buy like five silver

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.070 
to be the cheap buy like five silver
you'll<00:02:13.940> want<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.239> make<00:02:14.420> sure<00:02:14.630> your<00:02:14.810> gems
