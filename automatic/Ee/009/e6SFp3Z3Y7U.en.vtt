00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:17.760
 and greet everyone with his farage and 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.020
 welcome to this little tutorial on train 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.039
 you see behind me 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.890
 elevators then the elevators again 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.070
 once I warn you there is a lot 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.210
 of elevator type difference sure that 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.669
 you can find on youtube 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.230
 I make this video for you 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.270
 show what I used that I find 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.090
 practical because the goal is always 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.239
 no revolutionize youtube bafin 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.579
 minecraft but rather to show you 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.550
 how to do simple things 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.719
 we could do in creative mode 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.250
 so the first lift is this 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.120
 called an elevator to raise the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.070
 next look 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.449
 diop you can ride 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.930
 it's a little stupid system and you 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.820
 get in water and bone you have a 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.379
 swimming pool 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.820
 splash it's because I wanted to do 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:12.360
 but here I go back to the non- bomb 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.040
 stay like this and here you see if I 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.720
 will bring the night tac thigh is 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.619
 illuminated alone and if he comes back 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.909
 the day tac the pool sees her the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.740
 light go out so to see 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.060
 how do you do that click on the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.900
 little link that appears at the top to 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.700
 left of your screen 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.829
 that will take you to the tutorial on 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.479
 lightings now let's move on to 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.220
 the elevator of what you need 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.759
 so this lift is very simple 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.189
 you do a trick like these tac 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.390
 tac tac of three blocks so we're not going 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.729
 to make it very hot it's just for you 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.930
 so show me I put blocks of 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.820
 quartz that I find it pretty but that 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.149
 can be anything obviously you 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.979
 put a sign we will do two 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:55.829
 floors that's how you put a 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.500
 sign every two tubes so a 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.619
 second that a sign a cube cube 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.719
 a sign etc then you put a 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.119
 glass at this level there in front of each 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.299
 placards 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.470
 and it only remains for you that kaka 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.420
 by the way I say anything it's 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.500
 not in front of every point because that's the 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.780
 the tax is the cult of kills between 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.590
 each bridge map and you no longer have 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.569
 that window your nickname and here you are 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.510
 have your water lift that allows 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.890
 as well to go up as to go down 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.269
 even if I make it to you if you do 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.709
 something downhill is a bit long 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.970
 so how does it work for those who 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.390
 do not know in fact must know that if 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.069
 you put a sign 1 and you 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.079
 put a back block of fnh matter 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.720
 what's up ben it's going to stay at 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:47.329
 on because actually the game considers 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.579
 that here there is a block even if it is a 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.140
 sign for the game it's a block so 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.640
 suddenly as there is a block the water does not 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.900
 can not sink below and I will 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.420
 said to put a block of glass here for 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.220
 avoid those who can be pretty 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.750
 hassle 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.019
 So here it is a small elevator 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.659
 very practical and effective beast that 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.519
 allows you to mount whatever you want 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.019
 do something high up and you 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.280
 can very well done in creative mode 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.849
 without any problem now 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.099
 the disadvantage this elevator is that 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:19.250
 we can do only one floor you 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.989
 see here we can do only one floor 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.880
 because if you do other things 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.010
 it 's going to be very complicated with 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.450
 Water will come out and that's what 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.060
 on the other side it's open if you 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.560
 do several floors of the blow I'm 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.620
 am saying but is there any way 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.290
 to make a simple lift another one 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.030
 time that one could use in 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.079
 creation 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.019
 finally not anything in fashion 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:44.540
 adventure in survival mode I'm going there 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.940
 to arrive without using 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.519
 super complex systems we with 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.290
 wide areas of the ca and I found the one 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.750
 so you already see it has three 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.180
 floors it's exactly the same principle 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.060
 than that to what you replace the water 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.569
 and the sign by a ladder and a 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.010
 same principle card 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.019
 the barcares tea laid on the ladder 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.430
 prevent it from falling you get on 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.430
 on the water mind map you are in the 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.480
 mind map you press control 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.410
 in his figures for your 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.849
 go down 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.799
 so obviously there I fall because 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.780
 it's below it's a ladder but 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.479
 if I move forward and press shift in 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.410
 same time there I can go to my 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.450
 first floor 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.560
 now i'm going to go to the second tac 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.700
 I click I'm on the second floor 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.330
 now I want to go to the third 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.270
 tock 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.470
 here we are on the third floor so 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.150
 do not forget each time his figures 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.460
 to get down from the mind maps and 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.780
 do not forget to go forward to not 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.220
 fall below and precisely 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.480
 the advantage of this system is for 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.190
 go down like there are ladders 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.860
 look to get through the mind 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.480
 cards and hop you get off without you 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.560
 hurt because the ladder will brake 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.540
 automatically your fall 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.460
 now the question why did I put 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.020
 glass blocks here I put a block 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.870
 because I actually wanted to say 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.520
 you are in the mind map you do 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.320
 shift to go down and not to fall 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.580
 you advance the problem is that if 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.050
 you advance you may push the 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.660
 mind map and the mind maps could 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.430
 simply fall so the evil the 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.760
 block of glass allows denfert 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.360
 music lovers map at this location 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.490
 so now I'm going to show you 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.990
 how does one build his already oval he goes 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.140
 I need a ladder and mike hart 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:22.850
 so again we will make a 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:24.260
 turn of three blocks like this finally 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.830
 three columns to make a tour of the 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.140
 less m here like that you put in 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.550
 example a ladder here and there I can 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.880
 not ask one man card is 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.000
 Okay 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.820
 the trick you put a block you take 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.919
 a rail you put it you put your 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.200
 mind map on it and there you break the 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.240
 blog below and there paf the masne card 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.500
 is subject to the gravity of the shot he's going 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.960
 fall and he'll be braked by 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.730
 scale then you just have to 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.590
 add your little glass block or 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.270
 block of other things to you can very 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.130
 do a lift like that by 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.860
 example a tower you can nothing 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.680
 does not prevent for example to do something 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.720
 this is the tac tac it's like 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.950
 you see one but I like I 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.830
 find it nice to show the 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.060
 mechanism with the glass blocks so 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.810
 you put a block of glass like this and 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.940
 then attack 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.580
 if you want to make it a 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.160
 other ben yes there's more than already 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:19.720
 December there is more to add 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.720
 a ladder again 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:26.020
 m few blocks people put back the day 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:31.600
 m some blocks to increase the 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:34.270
 height here is your rails the wagon and 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.120
 this is tac you have your second floor 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.400
 after you just have to break the 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.080
 block there before tac 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.910
 here I made them too tight it takes 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.380
 forget to have to say that normally 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.630
 they need to have two blocks of 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.860
 two blocks two or three blocks of 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:52.240
 height between each month a map 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.590
 because otherwise you can not go out 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.220
 if I think here I know very well 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.260
 that I can not go out 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.900
 it would have taken me to do this I 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.630
 break here and I put the ladder here 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.330
 with the mind map just above for 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:10.270
 well we'll do it for that matter 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:11.740
 able to just go out so here 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.470
 it's a stupid system and that is 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.760
 very simple to make 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.580
 it's because I wanted to do it 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.470
 I think it's a system that 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.600
 is I you rope a little longer at 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.090
 do and a little more expensive than 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.530
 the water elevator here that is 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.940
 really very simple the problem is 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.100
 we can only do one floor and 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.570
 to go down to drool 

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.100
 it's quite laborious what because we 

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.530
 is obliged to put a lot of water for 

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.210
 able to ride while the lehman 

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.190
 cards can be spaced out and one can 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.440
 climb very fast and get off just as 

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.580
 quickly I show you them you go 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.150
 pass through the masne map and you 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:49.330
 go down without any problem 

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:50.470
 here it is the little tutorial if we 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.800
 can call that I would say more about them 

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.550
 little tips on elevators in 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.039

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.479
 I hope that these two systems 

00:07:57.039 --> 00:08:00.220
 will have more one more time I will you 

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:01.660
 say I do not do this to revolutionize 

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.500
 minecraft but it's just system 

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.930
 I use 

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.970
 and that one then that I do not know if he 

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:09.070
 already exists but in any case I have them 

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.420
 Recently developed because 

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.370
 I needed to do something with 

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.960
 several floors so I hope in everything 

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.280
 case that will help you leave a small 

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.510
 green thumb if you liked it and I you 

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.410
 see you soon for an upcoming tutorial 

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.410
