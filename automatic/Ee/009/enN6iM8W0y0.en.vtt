dang it it's tougher than it looks
you'd<00:04:14.730> think<00:04:14.880> it'd<00:04:15.030> be<00:04:15.060> pretty<00:04:15.300> easy<00:04:15.570> to<00:04:15.930> we

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
you'd think it'd be pretty easy to we

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.000 
you'd think it'd be pretty easy to we
whack<00:04:16.320> a<00:04:16.350> plants<00:04:17.810> not<00:04:18.810> in<00:04:18.959> this<00:04:19.080> case<00:04:19.290> so<00:04:19.799> maybe

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
whack a plants not in this case so maybe

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.099 
whack a plants not in this case so maybe
if<00:04:20.160> I<00:04:20.250> run<00:04:20.549> at<00:04:20.700> it<00:04:20.880> it'll<00:04:21.120> be<00:04:21.359> a<00:04:21.390> better<00:04:21.630> more

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
if I run at it it'll be a better more

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.290 
if I run at it it'll be a better more
successful<00:04:22.350> approach<00:04:22.860> there<00:04:23.070> we<00:04:23.190> go<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:24.240> you

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
successful approach there we go so you

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.150 
successful approach there we go so you
can<00:04:24.690> take<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:24.960> out<00:04:25.050> with<00:04:25.080> one<00:04:25.410> critical<00:04:25.860> hit<00:04:26.010> or

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
can take it out with one critical hit or

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.710 
can take it out with one critical hit or
if<00:04:26.490> you<00:04:26.610> do<00:04:26.760> too

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
if you do too

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.270 
if you do too
regular<00:04:28.080> hits<00:04:28.290> with<00:04:28.470> a<00:04:28.500> diamond<00:04:28.860> sword<00:04:29.070> you

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
regular hits with a diamond sword you

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.530 
regular hits with a diamond sword you
should<00:04:29.460> be<00:04:29.580> good<00:04:29.700> to<00:04:29.760> go<00:04:29.970> as<00:04:30.120> well<00:04:30.210> at<00:04:30.420> the

looking<00:04:42.000> forward<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.300> seeing<00:04:42.540> what<00:04:42.660> else<00:04:42.780> he

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
looking forward to seeing what else he

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.660 
looking forward to seeing what else he
can<00:04:43.050> do<00:04:43.230> with<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.590> beautiful<00:04:43.920> animations<00:04:44.430> and

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
can do with the beautiful animations and

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.120 
can do with the beautiful animations and
stuff

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
stuff

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.200 
stuff
hopefully<00:04:47.130> it'll<00:04:47.250> do<00:04:47.370> drop<00:04:47.640> so<00:04:47.850> you<00:04:47.880> can<00:04:48.090> use

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
hopefully it'll do drop so you can use

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.600 
hopefully it'll do drop so you can use
to<00:04:48.360> craft<00:04:48.570> new<00:04:48.660> things<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:49.380> add<00:04:50.220> some

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
to craft new things and add some

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.640 
to craft new things and add some
progression<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:51.360> things<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.110> stuff<00:04:52.290> but<00:04:52.530> for

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
progression and things and stuff but for

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.190 
progression and things and stuff but for
the<00:04:52.740> moment<00:04:52.860> it<00:04:53.430> is<00:04:53.490> uh<00:04:53.790> just<00:04:54.570> some<00:04:54.870> okay<00:04:55.170> I

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
the moment it is uh just some okay I

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
the moment it is uh just some okay I
probably<00:04:55.470> shouldn't<00:04:55.770> have<00:04:55.830> done<00:04:55.920> that<00:04:56.130> in

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
probably shouldn't have done that in

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.140 
probably shouldn't have done that in
survival<00:04:56.640> I'm<00:04:56.790> okay<00:04:58.310> hey<00:04:59.310> I<00:04:59.580> would<00:04:59.880> have<00:04:59.970> died

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
survival I'm okay hey I would have died

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.780 
survival I'm okay hey I would have died
very<00:05:00.420> very<00:05:00.780> swiftly<00:05:01.320> there<00:05:01.650> if<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:02.550> wasn't

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
very very swiftly there if I wasn't

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.950 
very very swiftly there if I wasn't
paying<00:05:03.240> closer<00:05:03.540> attention<00:05:04.970> so<00:05:05.970> I<00:05:06.390> can't

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
paying closer attention so I can't

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.660 
paying closer attention so I can't
remember<00:05:07.200> I<00:05:07.350> mentioned<00:05:07.800> earlier<00:05:08.070> these<00:05:08.310> spawn

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
they won't hurt each other I guess they

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.840 
they won't hurt each other I guess they
can<00:06:20.810> be<00:06:21.810> companions<00:06:22.200> with<00:06:22.650> other<00:06:23.190> full<00:06:23.490> ayats

can be companions with other full ayats

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.820 
can be companions with other full ayats
I<00:06:24.090> guess<00:06:24.419> that<00:06:24.600> sort<00:06:24.870> of<00:06:24.930> works<00:06:25.140> and<00:06:25.440> they<00:06:25.620> make

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
I guess that sort of works and they make

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.310 
I guess that sort of works and they make
very<00:06:26.160> very<00:06:26.430> quick<00:06:26.760> work<00:06:26.940> of<00:06:27.600> any<00:06:27.810> mobs<00:06:28.140> that

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
very very quick work of any mobs that

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.140 
very very quick work of any mobs that
are<00:06:28.560> so<00:06:29.540> unfortunate<00:06:30.540> to<00:06:30.860> walk<00:06:31.970> between<00:06:32.970> them

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
are so unfortunate to walk between them

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.230 
are so unfortunate to walk between them
so<00:06:33.810> uh<00:06:34.470> let's<00:06:35.040> switch<00:06:35.460> I<00:06:35.760> don't<00:06:36.000> know<00:06:36.090> why

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
so uh let's switch I don't know why

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.800 
so uh let's switch I don't know why
don't<00:06:36.300> we<00:06:36.479> go<00:06:36.660> two<00:06:36.720> times<00:06:37.320> that<00:06:37.770> night<00:06:38.070> and

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
don't we go two times that night and

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.600 
don't we go two times that night and
all<00:06:40.260> right<00:06:40.530> so<00:06:40.920> their<00:06:41.070> behavior<00:06:41.220> I<00:06:41.520> have

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
all right so their behavior I have
