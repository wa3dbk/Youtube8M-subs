shapes<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.800> think<00:00:53.160> G<00:00:53.430> major<00:00:53.670> shapes<00:00:54.030> work<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
shapes I think G major shapes work the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.150 
shapes I think G major shapes work the
best<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.020> song<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.890> want<00:00:56.039> to

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
best for this song so if you want to

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.700 
best for this song so if you want to
play<00:00:56.460> along<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.120> song<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:58.289> would<00:00:58.469> just

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
play along with the song you would just

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.160 
play along with the song you would just
capo<00:00:59.190> at<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> fourth<00:00:59.789> fret<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.719> right<00:01:00.899> there

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
capo at the fourth fret so right there

capo at the fourth fret so right there
right<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.649> then<00:01:01.770> you'd<00:01:01.920> make<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.160> G<00:01:02.550> major

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820

so<00:01:14.189> when<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:14.460> play<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.880> G<00:01:15.240> chord<00:01:15.659> with<00:01:16.049> our

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
so when we play that G chord with our

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.350 
so when we play that G chord with our
capo<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> third<00:01:17.189> fret<00:01:17.520> there<00:01:18.119> we'd

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
capo here at the third fret there we'd

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.679 
capo here at the third fret there we'd
actually<00:01:18.540> be<00:01:18.720> playing<00:01:19.049> b-flat<00:01:19.590> major<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.700> I'm

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
actually be playing b-flat major so I'm

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.880 
actually be playing b-flat major so I'm
just<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.020> do<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.350> open<00:01:22.710> position

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
just going to do it in open position

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.280 
just going to do it in open position
because<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.150> know<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.299> can<00:01:24.600> change<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.110> key

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
because you know you can change the key

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.020 
because you know you can change the key
up<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.710> maybe<00:01:26.009> as<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.369> sing<00:01:26.610> along<00:01:26.820> with<00:01:26.970> it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
up to maybe as you sing along with it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.060 
up to maybe as you sing along with it
you'll<00:01:27.240> need<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> different<00:01:27.840> key<00:01:28.259> because<00:01:28.920> it's

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
you'll need a different key because it's

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.640 
you'll need a different key because it's
too<00:01:29.250> high<00:01:29.460> or<00:01:30.030> low<00:01:30.180> for<00:01:30.390> your<00:01:30.479> voice<00:01:30.650> alright

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
too high or low for your voice alright

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.920 
too high or low for your voice alright
so<00:01:31.950> basically<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.850> going<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.390> key<00:01:33.810> of

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
so basically this is going to be key of

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.480 
so basically this is going to be key of
G<00:01:34.140> shapes<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:35.070> think<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.310> we're<00:01:35.400> going

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
G shapes so you can think of we're going

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.100 
G shapes so you can think of we're going
to<00:01:35.579> play<00:01:35.759> G<00:01:36.060> which<00:01:36.270> would<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> 1<00:01:36.750> chord

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
to play G which would be a 1 chord

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.080 
to play G which would be a 1 chord
and<00:01:38.200> then<00:01:38.530> we<00:01:38.650> just<00:01:38.800> go<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.010> D<00:01:39.250> major<00:01:39.490> if<00:01:40.000> you

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
and then we just go to D major if you

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.390 
and then we just go to D major if you
counted<00:01:40.420> through<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.690> alphabet<00:01:40.890> G<00:01:41.890> is<00:01:42.040> the<00:01:42.190> 1

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
counted through the alphabet G is the 1

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.040 
counted through the alphabet G is the 1

that's the progressive G to D to E minor
to<00:02:52.409> D<00:02:52.849> now<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:53.909> chorus<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.690> cool<00:02:54.989> thing<00:02:55.260> about

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
to D now the chorus the cool thing about

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.680 
to D now the chorus the cool thing about
this<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.830> except<00:02:56.370> for<00:02:56.430> one<00:02:56.819> chord<00:02:57.150> changing

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
this is except for one chord changing

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.839 
this is except for one chord changing
it's<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.989> exact<00:02:58.379> same<00:02:58.620> thing<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.489> instead<00:02:59.790> of

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
it's the exact same thing so instead of

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.250 
it's the exact same thing so instead of
playing<00:03:00.120> G<00:03:00.660> you're<00:03:01.110> going<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.290> play<00:03:01.470> C

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
playing G you're going to play C

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.140 
playing G you're going to play C
and<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:03.890> can<00:03:04.010> notice<00:03:04.129> it<00:03:04.370> lifts<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.760> Mellott

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
and you can notice it lifts the Mellott

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.089 
and you can notice it lifts the Mellott
lifts<00:03:05.480> it<00:03:05.599> see<00:03:05.750> that's<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:06.230> higher<00:03:06.560> sound<00:03:06.920> so

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
lifts it see that's that higher sound so

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.400 
lifts it see that's that higher sound so
the<00:03:07.190> melody<00:03:07.519> goes<00:03:07.550> up<00:03:07.849> with<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.180> where<00:03:08.840> did<00:03:09.230> I
