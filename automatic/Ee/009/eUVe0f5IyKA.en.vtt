00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
that just kind of makes things round and

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.690 
that just kind of makes things round and
that's<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.619> way<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.430> know<00:01:44.520> my

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
that's the way that I like you know my

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.780 
that's the way that I like you know my
tone<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.450> enough<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> kind<00:01:46.290> of

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
tone I I have enough of the kind of

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.749 
tone I I have enough of the kind of
grind<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.030> edge<00:01:48.270> from<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.840> amps<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.740> think<00:01:50.399> I

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
grind and edge from the amps I think I

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.490 
grind and edge from the amps I think I
like<00:01:50.939> my<00:01:51.090> OverDrive's<00:01:51.570> my<00:01:51.780> lead<00:01:52.020> stuff<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.380> be

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
like my OverDrive's my lead stuff to be

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.050 
like my OverDrive's my lead stuff to be
just<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.799> little<00:01:52.979> bit<00:01:53.159> smoother<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> vo<00:01:53.729> p9

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
just a little bit smoother the vo p9

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.899 
just a little bit smoother the vo p9
definitely<00:01:54.810> does<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.320> me<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:56.700> way<00:01:56.880> that

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
definitely does that for me the way that

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.480 
definitely does that for me the way that
I<00:01:57.090> use<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.390> aside<00:01:58.290> from<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:59.040> like<00:01:59.340> you

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
I use it aside from that is like you

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.789 
I use it aside from that is like you
know<00:01:59.610> here's<00:01:59.909> my<00:01:59.969> amp<00:02:00.360> levels<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.290> overdrive

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
know here's my amp levels the overdrive

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.800 
know here's my amp levels the overdrive
would<00:02:02.009> be<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.270> know<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.600> don't

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
would be like like this you know I don't

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.789 
would be like like this you know I don't
know<00:02:03.869> if<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.110> even<00:02:04.200> see<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.590> movie

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
know if you can even see that movie

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.760 
know if you can even see that movie
right<00:02:05.399> there<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:06.869> just<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.170> hair<00:02:07.469> in

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
right there but it's just a hair in

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.020 
right there but it's just a hair in
volume<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> hair

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
volume and a hair

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.120 
volume and a hair
gain<00:02:09.330> above<00:02:10.050> what<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.289> amp<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.619> giving<00:02:10.860> me<00:02:10.950> so

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
gain above what the amp is giving me so

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.730 
gain above what the amp is giving me so
let<00:02:11.370> me<00:02:11.430> give<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.640> an<00:02:11.730> example<00:02:12.030> here<00:02:12.740> so

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
let me give you an example here so

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:30.620 
let me give you an example here so
here's<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.130> amp

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.690 

so<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.860> know<00:02:31.980> unless<00:02:32.190> you're<00:02:32.340> listening

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
so you know unless you're listening

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.550 
so you know unless you're listening
really<00:02:33.000> closely<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.720> probably<00:02:34.230> can't<00:02:34.470> even

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
really closely you probably can't even

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.680 
really closely you probably can't even
hear<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.130> difference<00:02:35.790> again<00:02:35.910> for<00:02:36.270> me<00:02:36.420> it's

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
hear the difference again for me it's

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.590 
hear the difference again for me it's
just<00:02:37.110> having<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.560> hair<00:02:37.830> above<00:02:38.270> unity<00:02:39.270> from

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
just having it a hair above unity from

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.180 
just having it a hair above unity from
what<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.840> guitar<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.290> amp<00:02:40.470> are<00:02:40.680> giving

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
what the guitar and the amp are giving

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.820 
what the guitar and the amp are giving
me<00:02:41.280> already<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:42.660> it's<00:02:43.050> kind<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.710> know<00:02:43.800> I

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
me already and it's kind of you know I

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.070 
me already and it's kind of you know I
use<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.220> mostly<00:02:44.340> for<00:02:44.550> leads<00:02:44.880> it's<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.420> bit<00:02:45.630> more

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
use it mostly for leads it's a bit more

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.990 
use it mostly for leads it's a bit more
gain<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.350> bit<00:02:46.620> more<00:02:46.770> volume<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.430> just<00:02:47.700> helps

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
gain a bit more volume and it just helps

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.540 
gain a bit more volume and it just helps
things<00:02:48.210> feel<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.810> lot<00:02:49.320> better<00:02:49.470> for<00:02:49.740> a<00:02:49.800> live<00:02:50.040> you

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
things feel a lot better for a live you

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.370 
things feel a lot better for a live you
know<00:02:50.640> situation<00:02:51.300> like<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.810> said<00:02:52.080> it's<00:02:52.260> also

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
know situation like I said it's also

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.630 
know situation like I said it's also
about<00:02:52.560> color<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.190> have<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.340> lot<00:02:53.520> of

like<00:03:07.230> using<00:03:07.710> us<00:03:07.830> as<00:03:08.070> far<00:03:08.280> as<00:03:08.430> color<00:03:09.170> so<00:03:10.170> again

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
like using us as far as color so again

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:27.760 
like using us as far as color so again
here's<00:03:11.250> here's<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.850> amp<00:03:12.000> by<00:03:12.210> itself

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.199 

again<00:03:28.770> it<00:03:28.890> may<00:03:28.980> not<00:03:29.010> be<00:03:29.280> extremely<00:03:29.790> audible

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
again it may not be extremely audible

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.330 
again it may not be extremely audible
and<00:03:30.300> obvious<00:03:30.810> but<00:03:30.840> it's<00:03:31.170> instantly<00:03:31.740> smoother

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
and obvious but it's instantly smoother

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.180 
and obvious but it's instantly smoother
to<00:03:32.520> my<00:03:32.670> touch<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.569> feel<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:37.190> little

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
to my touch and the feel of it a little

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.930 
to my touch and the feel of it a little
bit<00:03:38.280> darker

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
bit darker

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.770 
bit darker
you<00:03:39.030> know<00:03:39.120> it's<00:03:39.240> giving<00:03:39.450> me<00:03:39.480> more<00:03:39.630> of<00:03:39.750> that

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
you know it's giving me more of that

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.190 
you know it's giving me more of that
class<00:03:40.080> to<00:03:40.260> go<00:03:40.350> overdrive<00:03:40.650> type<00:03:40.860> of<00:03:40.980> sound<00:03:41.220> and

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
class to go overdrive type of sound and

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
class to go overdrive type of sound and
that's<00:03:43.200> kind<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.620> sound<00:03:43.800> that<00:03:43.920> I'm<00:03:44.010> going

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
that's kind of the sound that I'm going

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.650 
that's kind of the sound that I'm going
for<00:03:44.400> right<00:03:44.550> now<00:03:44.580> so<00:03:44.700> it's<00:03:45.000> it's<00:03:45.180> smoother<00:03:45.570> it's

this<00:04:12.740> is<00:04:12.890> really<00:04:13.310> nice<00:04:13.459> to<00:04:13.670> play<00:04:13.819> with<00:04:13.910> you

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
this is really nice to play with you

know<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.990> overdrive<00:04:15.319> on<00:04:15.440> top<00:04:15.620> of<00:04:15.770> an<00:04:15.950> already

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
know the overdrive on top of an already

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.360 
know the overdrive on top of an already
driven<00:04:16.549> amp<00:04:17.139> but<00:04:18.139> I<00:04:18.170> don't<00:04:18.470> want<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:18.709> just<00:04:19.040> kill

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
driven amp but I don't want to just kill

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.150 
driven amp but I don't want to just kill
everything<00:04:20.060> with<00:04:20.180> so<00:04:20.419> much<00:04:20.660> saturation<00:04:21.530> so

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
everything with so much saturation so

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.530 
everything with so much saturation so
it's<00:04:22.280> just<00:04:22.430> a<00:04:22.460> little<00:04:22.639> bit<00:04:22.730> about<00:04:22.880> so<00:04:23.360> that's

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
it's just a little bit about so that's

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.330 
it's just a little bit about so that's
the<00:04:23.960> electric<00:04:24.320> side<00:04:24.500> of<00:04:24.680> things<00:04:24.919> on<00:04:25.160> the

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
the electric side of things on the

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.780 
the electric side of things on the
acoustic<00:04:25.580> side<00:04:26.030> of<00:04:26.210> things<00:04:26.450> I<00:04:26.720> have<00:04:27.290> a<00:04:27.650> cp9<00:04:28.610> Pro

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
acoustic side of things I have a cp9 Pro

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:39.830 
acoustic side of things I have a cp9 Pro
Plus<00:04:29.090> down<00:04:29.630> here<00:04:29.870> on<00:04:29.990> my<00:04:30.020> acoustic<00:04:30.380> board

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.270 

so<00:04:40.840> down<00:04:41.020> here<00:04:41.169> I<00:04:41.229> do<00:04:41.319> have<00:04:41.440> like<00:04:41.949> I<00:04:42.039> said<00:04:42.190> the

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
so down here I do have like I said the

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.770 
so down here I do have like I said the
max<00:04:42.430> on<00:04:42.550> CP<00:04:42.849> 9<00:04:42.970> Pro<00:04:43.210> Plus<00:04:43.509> and<00:04:44.879> with<00:04:45.879> acoustic<00:04:46.539> I

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
max on CP 9 Pro Plus and with acoustic I

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.339 
max on CP 9 Pro Plus and with acoustic I
like<00:04:47.379> it<00:04:47.740> to<00:04:47.919> be<00:04:48.180> slightly<00:04:49.180> chewy<00:04:49.539> you<00:04:50.139> know<00:04:50.229> so

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
like it to be slightly chewy you know so

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:51.230 
like it to be slightly chewy you know so
it's<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.500> bit<00:04:50.650> more<00:04:50.770> of<00:04:50.830> an<00:04:50.919> aggressive

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
it's a bit more of an aggressive

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.659 
it's a bit more of an aggressive
compression<00:04:52.409> so<00:04:53.409> you<00:04:53.949> can<00:04:54.099> see<00:04:54.250> down<00:04:54.400> here<00:04:54.460> on

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
compression so you can see down here on

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.040 
compression so you can see down here on
the<00:04:55.000> on<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.389> pedal<00:04:55.629> here<00:04:55.750> I've<00:04:55.840> got<00:04:55.960> my

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
the on the pedal here I've got my

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.279 
the on the pedal here I've got my
threshold<00:04:56.289> about<00:04:57.190> two<00:04:57.370> and<00:04:57.490> a<00:04:57.550> half<00:04:57.580> my<00:04:58.289> ratio

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
threshold about two and a half my ratio

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:00.990 
threshold about two and a half my ratio
is<00:04:59.740> actually<00:04:59.919> not<00:05:00.250> that<00:05:00.400> high<00:05:00.580> it's<00:05:00.849> only

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
is actually not that high it's only

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.059 
is actually not that high it's only
about<00:05:01.150> two<00:05:01.539> and<00:05:01.840> then<00:05:02.199> my<00:05:02.319> make<00:05:02.500> up<00:05:02.530> gain<00:05:02.860> is

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
about two and then my make up gain is

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:04.559 
about two and then my make up gain is
whatever<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.580> needs<00:05:03.639> to<00:05:03.789> be<00:05:03.970> to<00:05:04.120> bring<00:05:04.240> it<00:05:04.419> back

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:04.569 
whatever it needs to be to bring it back

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:06.779 
whatever it needs to be to bring it back
up<00:05:04.780> to<00:05:04.990> you<00:05:05.500> know<00:05:05.590> to<00:05:05.650> unity<00:05:06.099> or<00:05:06.250> maybe<00:05:06.460> just<00:05:06.699> a

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
up to you know to unity or maybe just a

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.749 
up to you know to unity or maybe just a
hair<00:05:06.970> above<00:05:07.150> that<00:05:07.509> for<00:05:07.780> a<00:05:07.840> live<00:05:08.229> situation<00:05:08.610> but

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:13.649 

one<00:05:12.759> of<00:05:12.819> the<00:05:12.909> reasons<00:05:13.120> I<00:05:13.180> love<00:05:13.389> this

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
one of the reasons I love this

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.320 
one of the reasons I love this
particular<00:05:14.110> compressor<00:05:14.770> is<00:05:14.889> it<00:05:15.159> has<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.639> you

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
particular compressor is it has the you

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.709 
particular compressor is it has the you
know<00:05:16.449> the<00:05:16.599> detection<00:05:17.139> light<00:05:17.650> on<00:05:17.949> it<00:05:18.280> so<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:19.120> lot

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:19.719 
know the detection light on it so a lot

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.270 
know the detection light on it so a lot
of<00:05:19.780> compressors<00:05:20.289> don't<00:05:20.440> have<00:05:20.620> that<00:05:20.830> and<00:05:21.039> you

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
of compressors don't have that and you

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.869 
of compressors don't have that and you
know<00:05:21.370> you<00:05:21.900> if<00:05:22.900> you<00:05:23.110> use<00:05:23.289> it<00:05:23.409> very<00:05:23.500> subtly<00:05:24.009> it

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:24.879 
know you if you use it very subtly it

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:25.950 
know you if you use it very subtly it
kind<00:05:25.150> of<00:05:25.180> doesn't<00:05:25.449> sound<00:05:25.629> like<00:05:25.719> it's<00:05:25.840> doing

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
kind of doesn't sound like it's doing

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.999 
kind of doesn't sound like it's doing
anything<00:05:26.139> it's<00:05:26.500> kind<00:05:26.650> of<00:05:26.680> more<00:05:26.830> of<00:05:26.889> a

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
anything it's kind of more of a

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.040 
anything it's kind of more of a
psychological<00:05:27.240> visual<00:05:28.240> type<00:05:28.479> of<00:05:28.659> thing<00:05:28.840> I

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
psychological visual type of thing I

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.809 
psychological visual type of thing I
like<00:05:29.229> to<00:05:29.560> know<00:05:29.680> that<00:05:29.830> it's<00:05:29.949> working<00:05:30.129> and<00:05:30.400> the

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
like to know that it's working and the

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:36.110 
like to know that it's working and the
LED<00:05:31.120> on<00:05:31.150> here<00:05:31.419> certainly<00:05:31.690> lets<00:05:31.960> me

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.899 

let's<00:05:36.690> me<00:05:36.810> know<00:05:36.840> that<00:05:37.110> it<00:05:37.260> is<00:05:37.380> working

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:40.909 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:43.369 

but<00:05:41.909> it's<00:05:42.029> really<00:05:42.240> slight<00:05:42.659> you<00:05:42.930> know<00:05:43.050> it's

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:43.379 
but it's really slight you know it's

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:45.529 
but it's really slight you know it's
it's<00:05:43.619> slightly<00:05:44.009> chewy<00:05:44.249> yeah<00:05:44.849> I<00:05:44.969> have<00:05:45.210> it<00:05:45.240> you

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
it's slightly chewy yeah I have it you

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.209 
it's slightly chewy yeah I have it you
know<00:05:45.629> a<00:05:45.659> tiny<00:05:46.050> bit<00:05:46.289> aggressive<00:05:46.740> but<00:05:46.919> it<00:05:47.009> is

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:47.219 
know a tiny bit aggressive but it is

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:49.399 
know a tiny bit aggressive but it is
actually<00:05:47.819> really<00:05:47.999> slight<00:05:48.419> and<00:05:48.689> and<00:05:49.050> kind<00:05:49.319> of

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
actually really slight and and kind of

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.409 
actually really slight and and kind of
clear<00:05:49.949> and<00:05:50.129> that's<00:05:50.699> what<00:05:50.969> I<00:05:50.999> really<00:05:51.300> like

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
clear and that's what I really like

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.119 
clear and that's what I really like
about<00:05:51.479> this<00:05:51.779> compressor<00:05:52.319> it<00:05:52.439> doesn't

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:53.129 
about this compressor it doesn't

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:55.850 
about this compressor it doesn't
overtake<00:05:54.029> the<00:05:54.210> tone<00:05:54.479> of<00:05:54.749> the<00:05:55.199> natural<00:05:55.529> guitar

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
overtake the tone of the natural guitar

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.520 
overtake the tone of the natural guitar
so<00:05:56.039> here<00:05:56.219> it<00:05:56.309> is<00:05:56.430> without<00:05:56.550> it

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.470 

and<00:06:01.530> it<00:06:02.010> sounds<00:06:02.250> great<00:06:02.460> but<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:03.030> compressor

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
and it sounds great but the compressor

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.940 
and it sounds great but the compressor
just<00:06:03.660> kind<00:06:03.840> of<00:06:03.960> helps<00:06:04.350> to<00:06:04.440> stain<00:06:04.650> everything

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
just kind of helps to stain everything

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.530 
just kind of helps to stain everything
it<00:06:05.310> kind<00:06:05.490> of<00:06:05.550> gives<00:06:05.700> it<00:06:05.790> a<00:06:05.880> bit<00:06:06.000> more<00:06:06.120> rounder

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
it kind of gives it a bit more rounder

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.420 
it kind of gives it a bit more rounder
type<00:06:06.780> of<00:06:06.930> sound<00:06:07.170> I<00:06:07.350> do<00:06:07.560> have<00:06:07.800> it<00:06:07.950> boosting<00:06:08.370> a

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
type of sound I do have it boosting a

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:17.550 
type of sound I do have it boosting a
tiny<00:06:08.640> bit<00:06:08.820> as<00:06:08.910> well<00:06:09.060> with<00:06:09.240> a<00:06:09.270> makeup<00:06:09.600> game

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.280 

and<00:06:18.560> I<00:06:18.770> do<00:06:18.830> some<00:06:19.760> some<00:06:20.090> acoustic<00:06:20.360> trading<00:06:21.140> with

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.290 
and I do some some acoustic trading with

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.240 
and I do some some acoustic trading with
vide<00:06:21.560> during<00:06:21.920> the<00:06:22.010> show<00:06:22.250> and<00:06:22.550> the<00:06:23.240> the

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
vide during the show and the the

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.810 
vide during the show and the the
compressor<00:06:25.250> certainly<00:06:25.820> helps<00:06:26.150> to<00:06:26.360> make<00:06:27.820> you

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
compressor certainly helps to make you

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.720 
compressor certainly helps to make you
know<00:06:28.910> some<00:06:29.120> of<00:06:29.210> this<00:06:29.300> soloing<00:06:29.900> art<00:06:30.080> acoustic

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730 
know some of this soloing art acoustic

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.300 
know some of this soloing art acoustic
much<00:06:31.730> easier<00:06:32.210> to<00:06:32.390> do<00:06:32.770> again<00:06:33.770> it<00:06:33.920> just<00:06:34.100> kind<00:06:34.250> of

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
much easier to do again it just kind of

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.280 
much easier to do again it just kind of
clips<00:06:34.730> off<00:06:34.880> the<00:06:35.090> attack<00:06:35.690> and<00:06:35.960> it<00:06:36.020> just<00:06:36.170> makes

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.290 
clips off the attack and it just makes

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.040 
clips off the attack and it just makes
things<00:06:36.440> nice<00:06:36.650> and<00:06:36.680> round<00:06:37.100> and<00:06:37.340> and<00:06:37.900> or<00:06:38.900> that<00:06:39.020> I

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050
