00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.679 
with an aps-c size sensor the 24 to 70
is<00:01:21.270> equivalent<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> 38<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.430> 112<00:01:24.119> millimeter

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.660 
is equivalent to a 38 to 112 millimeter
lens<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.560> means<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.979> will<00:01:26.070> perform<00:01:26.430> like

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
lens so that means it will perform like

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.789

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.999 
a semi wide-angle to a medium telephoto
lens<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.270> great<00:01:30.600> all-purpose<00:01:30.869> lens<00:01:31.710> for
