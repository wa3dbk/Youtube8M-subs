00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
distorted because of the way that the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.640 
distorted because of the way that the
cutout<00:01:23.869> goes<00:01:24.200> but<00:01:24.619> um<00:01:25.900> okay<00:01:26.900> she<00:01:27.200> looks<00:01:27.410> a<00:01:27.500> lot

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
better now and to fix it all I did was

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.430 
better now and to fix it all I did was
redo<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.479> eyes<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:33.050> nose<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:34.490> eyes<00:01:35.080> that<00:01:36.080> one

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
redo the eyes and nose the eyes that one

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.600 
redo the eyes and nose the eyes that one
was<00:01:37.009> ever<00:01:37.460> so<00:01:37.910> slightly<00:01:38.210> too<00:01:38.570> far<00:01:38.840> that<00:01:39.110> way

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
was ever so slightly too far that way

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.670 
was ever so slightly too far that way
this<00:01:40.610> one<00:01:40.880> was<00:01:41.119> ever<00:01:41.300> so<00:01:41.600> slightly<00:01:41.930> too<00:01:42.410> high

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
this one was ever so slightly too high

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.730 
this one was ever so slightly too high
so<00:01:43.280> we<00:01:43.610> lowered<00:01:44.420> this<00:01:44.600> one<00:01:44.810> shifted<00:01:45.380> this<00:01:45.530> one

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
so we lowered this one shifted this one

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.380 
so we lowered this one shifted this one
across<00:01:45.979> slowly<00:01:47.530> redid<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.710> nose<00:01:48.920> because<00:01:49.790> it

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
across slowly redid the nose because it

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.830 
across slowly redid the nose because it
was<00:01:50.899> just<00:01:51.200> why<00:01:51.619> off<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.190> the<00:01:52.850> lips<00:01:53.090> moved<00:01:53.570> them

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
was just why off and the lips moved them

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.419 
was just why off and the lips moved them
down<00:01:54.110> ever<00:01:54.350> so<00:01:54.560> slowly<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:56.259> I<00:01:57.259> also<00:01:57.530> increased

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
down ever so slowly and I also increased

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.449 
down ever so slowly and I also increased
her<00:01:58.700> hair<00:01:59.200> before<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:00.619> only<00:02:00.800> came<00:02:01.069> out<00:02:01.280> to
