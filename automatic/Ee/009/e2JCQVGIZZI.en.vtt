other team they spawned rocks slasher

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.780 
other team they spawned rocks slasher
objective<00:06:11.860> and<00:06:12.040> took<00:06:12.190> him<00:06:12.310> out<00:06:14.610> looking<00:06:15.610> for

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
objective and took him out looking for

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.159 
objective and took him out looking for
his<00:06:15.880> snipe<00:06:16.120> one<00:06:16.300> of<00:06:16.390> his<00:06:16.480> teammates<00:06:16.660> must<00:06:17.050> have

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
his snipe one of his teammates must have

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:25.529 
his snipe one of his teammates must have
taken<00:06:17.350> it<00:06:22.290> just<00:06:23.290> looking<00:06:23.560> around

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
taken it just looking around

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:27.790 
taken it just looking around
too<00:06:26.539> goodnight<00:06:26.899> cuz<00:06:27.169> he<00:06:27.259> knows<00:06:27.439> he's<00:06:27.619> get

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
too goodnight cuz he knows he's get

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.989 
too goodnight cuz he knows he's get
there<00:06:27.979> going<00:06:28.129> to<00:06:28.159> be<00:06:28.219> spawning<00:06:28.580> over<00:06:28.879> at

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:28.999 
there going to be spawning over at

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:30.790 
there going to be spawning over at
turret<00:06:29.360> so<00:06:29.629> if<00:06:29.719> he<00:06:29.809> gets<00:06:29.959> an<00:06:30.050> ADA<00:06:30.259> then<00:06:30.589> they'll

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
turret so if he gets an ADA then they'll

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.699 
turret so if he gets an ADA then they'll

hopefully for spawn into shoddy court so

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:36.779 
hopefully for spawn into shoddy court so
that<00:06:33.739> his<00:06:34.069> teammate<00:06:34.519> can<00:06:34.699> clean<00:06:34.879> them<00:06:34.969> up

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:36.789
