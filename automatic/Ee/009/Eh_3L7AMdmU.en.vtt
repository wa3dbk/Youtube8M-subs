I want to just conclude them with
jumping<00:00:03.629> again<00:00:03.870> through<00:00:04.710> an<00:00:05.520> intricate<00:00:06.450> chain

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
jumping again through an intricate chain

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.200 
jumping again through an intricate chain
of<00:00:06.960> argument<00:00:07.500> which<00:00:08.370> i<00:00:08.639> think<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:08.970> straight

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
of argument which i think is straight

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.700 
of argument which i think is straight
forward<00:00:09.450> it's<00:00:09.750> not<00:00:09.840> intricate<00:00:10.290> in<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.500> same

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
forward it's not intricate in the same

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.820 
forward it's not intricate in the same
that<00:00:11.040> sense<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:11.880> it's<00:00:12.030> difficult<00:00:12.509> and

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
that sense it is that it's difficult and

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.650 
that sense it is that it's difficult and
give<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.950> some<00:00:13.980> idea<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.940> what<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.240> think

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
give you some idea of what I think

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.500 
give you some idea of what I think
sexual<00:00:16.230> selection<00:00:16.609> gave<00:00:17.609> us<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.060> terms<00:00:18.270> of

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
sexual selection gave us in terms of

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.359 
sexual selection gave us in terms of
artistic<00:00:19.050> tastes<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.740> read<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.100> list

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
artistic tastes and I read this list

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.880 
artistic tastes and I read this list
because<00:00:20.640> it's<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.060> unfashionable<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.320> it's

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
because it's so unfashionable and it's

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.410 
because it's so unfashionable and it's
not<00:00:23.130> what<00:00:23.550> what<00:00:24.240> modern<00:00:24.720> art<00:00:26.420> enthusiasts

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
not what what modern art enthusiasts

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.740 
not what what modern art enthusiasts
like<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.810> hear<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:29.480> think<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.539> if<00:00:30.929> we<00:00:31.230> take

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
like to hear I think that if we take

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.299 
like to hear I think that if we take
Darwinian<00:00:33.750> sexual<00:00:34.200> selection<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.130> look

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
Darwinian sexual selection and we look

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.010 
Darwinian sexual selection and we look
at<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.550> state<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.969> Arts<00:00:36.210> worldwide<00:00:36.750> we

at the state of the Arts worldwide we

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.990 
at the state of the Arts worldwide we
come<00:00:37.320> up<00:00:37.500> with<00:00:37.530> some<00:00:38.070> predictions<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:38.820> can

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
come up with some predictions we can

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.360 
come up with some predictions we can
make<00:00:39.180> about<00:00:39.360> what<00:00:39.809> people<00:00:40.320> will<00:00:40.710> think<00:00:40.770> about

make about what people will think about

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
and how they'll respond to art and I

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.150 
and how they'll respond to art and I
would<00:00:45.329> summarize<00:00:45.570> these<00:00:45.960> as<00:00:46.230> follows<00:00:46.590> works
