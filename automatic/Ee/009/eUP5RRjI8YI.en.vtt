00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.279
 and then youtube guys I 'm linux 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.919
 brs 1 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.509
 I'm here today to do a review of 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:19.680
 app called chat with one should already have 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:22.949
 seen this app chan un chan that is it 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.260
 he came in no player 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.970
 pm to two years and this is the galaxy 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.330
 player 4.2 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.520
 he came in the box saying that it is 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.500
 possible and here also personal 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.239
 chat on is it possible to talk between 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.489
 between devices are if I 'm not mistaken 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.120
 samsung person because the program 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.780
 samsung between samsung devices via 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.230
 wifi and you exchange messages and can even 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.260
 do videoconferencing but everything via wifi 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.300
 these two devices do not accept is 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.210
 micro sim card is not 3g handsets 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.030
 are all personal wifi devices 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.560
 so I will now demonstrate that as 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.630
 what is the program the program is that I 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.549
 It's already day when you enter the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.369
 program and do not have a phone 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.850
 and ask the country you put and then 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.490
 you put the phone number and the cell phone number and 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.950
 the cell phone it will receive a sms with 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.229
 four digits you go there and dictated 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.560
 then in a field whose skin has validity 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.600
 three minutes in the middle of the message if 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.030
 you do not get them from seeing you again 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.689
 of him again estimating four 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.810
 numbers to validate by validating it passes 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.180
 for putting all the configuration until you reach 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.409
 on the main screen 11 and will run here 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.899
 personal right is already prepared and here 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.590
 a chat on 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.570
 so I personally had to create one for 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.799
 each profile because I created the same profile 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.020
 profile teachers and deal with the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:05.790
 conflict, then it's no use having to 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.920
 obviously a valid pro the number of the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.149
 phone for a profile numbers there to 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.480
 other profile 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.599
 this here 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.150
 linux brs 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:20.019
 so you're seeing the number of 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.019
 phone here, right? 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:40.540

 application but you already have a 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:32.370
 good personal notion of how as for 

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:34.770

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:38.759
