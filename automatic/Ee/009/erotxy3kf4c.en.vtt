power of God to go forward in the step
you<00:02:13.830> know<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.040> verse<00:02:14.190> for<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.790> due<00:02:15.000> to

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
you know the verse for this is due to

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.000 
you know the verse for this is due to
others<00:02:15.480> as<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.900> would<00:02:16.050> like<00:02:16.230> them<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.620> do<00:02:16.770> to

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010

you and so I think what a person can do
with<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:20.910> step<00:02:21.210> is<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.170> make<00:02:22.350> a<00:02:22.380> list<00:02:22.680> of

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
with this step is is to make a list of

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.580 
with this step is is to make a list of
all<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.280> people<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:23.700> their<00:02:23.820> lives<00:02:24.440> in<00:02:25.440> their

all the people in their lives in their
life<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.460> then<00:02:26.640> look<00:02:27.060> at<00:02:27.180> each<00:02:27.330> person

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780

hurt them and there may be some people

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.330 
hurt them and there may be some people
where<00:02:33.810> your<00:02:34.020> behavior<00:02:34.500> hasn't<00:02:34.830> even<00:02:34.890> really

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
where your behavior hasn't even really

where your behavior hasn't even really
touched<00:02:35.580> them<00:02:35.760> but<00:02:35.910> then<00:02:36.060> that's<00:02:36.420> okay

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
see this step in light of what would we

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.170 
see this step in light of what would we
want<00:03:30.960> done<00:03:31.230> for<00:03:31.530> us<00:03:31.770> not<00:03:32.280> just<00:03:32.310> what<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:32.970> the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
easy way to get out of it well this this

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.570 
easy way to get out of it well this this
is<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:36.270> beginning<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:37.580> responsibility

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
is a the beginning of responsibility

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.730 
is a the beginning of responsibility
this<00:03:38.760> is<00:03:38.820> this<00:03:39.510> is<00:03:39.690> going<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:39.960> move<00:03:40.170> us<00:03:40.380> out<00:03:40.560> of

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
this is this is going to move us out of

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.400 
this is this is going to move us out of
ourselves<00:03:40.890> now<00:03:41.490> in<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.240> relate<00:03:42.870> our

it's character-building all of these

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.690 
it's character-building all of these
steps<00:03:49.140> really<00:03:49.410> are<00:03:49.709> designed<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.400> build

steps really are designed to build

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.480 
steps really are designed to build

but I'm free mm-hmm
but<00:05:07.500> then<00:05:07.620> we're<00:05:07.800> kind<00:05:07.919> of<00:05:08.010> getting<00:05:08.160> ahead<00:05:08.370> of

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
but then we're kind of getting ahead of

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.870 
but then we're kind of getting ahead of
ourselves<00:05:08.729> on<00:05:09.510> this<00:05:09.780> step<00:05:10.130> what<00:05:11.130> was<00:05:11.280> what<00:05:11.699> was

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
ourselves on this step what was what was

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.420 
ourselves on this step what was what was
required<00:05:12.780> was<00:05:13.050> you<00:05:13.590> had<00:05:13.710> to<00:05:13.800> be<00:05:13.919> willing<00:05:14.070> to<00:05:14.310> do

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
required was you had to be willing to do

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.360 
required was you had to be willing to do
it<00:05:14.580> that's<00:05:14.699> right<00:05:14.970> and<00:05:15.210> I<00:05:15.300> had<00:05:15.479> to<00:05:15.600> write<00:05:15.930> down

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
it that's right and I had to write down

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.040 
it that's right and I had to write down
in<00:05:17.370> that<00:05:17.729> list<00:05:18.030> if<00:05:18.449> I'm<00:05:19.139> going<00:05:19.590> to<00:05:19.860> do<00:05:20.070> this

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
in that list if I'm going to do this

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.200 
in that list if I'm going to do this
here's<00:05:22.050> what<00:05:22.500> it<00:05:22.590> would<00:05:22.710> take<00:05:23.009> to<00:05:23.580> make<00:05:23.610> amends

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
here's what it would take to make amends

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.230 
here's what it would take to make amends
and<00:05:24.599> so<00:05:24.780> you<00:05:25.410> take<00:05:25.680> your<00:05:25.740> time<00:05:26.190> you<00:05:26.580> make<00:05:27.210> your

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
and so you take your time you make your

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.960 
and so you take your time you make your
list<00:05:27.720> and<00:05:28.169> you<00:05:28.919> do<00:05:29.220> it<00:05:29.400> from<00:05:29.580> the<00:05:29.699> perspective

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
list and you do it from the perspective

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.990 
list and you do it from the perspective
of<00:05:30.510> if<00:05:30.900> this<00:05:31.410> was<00:05:31.680> me<00:05:31.979> that<00:05:32.430> had<00:05:32.580> been<00:05:32.760> hurt

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
of if this was me that had been hurt

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.120 
of if this was me that had been hurt
what<00:05:33.240> would<00:05:33.419> I<00:05:33.449> want<00:05:33.780> done<00:05:34.320> for<00:05:34.620> me<00:05:34.740> and<00:05:34.949> see

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
what would I want done for me and see

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.689 
what would I want done for me and see
that's<00:05:35.370> an<00:05:35.520> important<00:05:37.130> character<00:05:38.130> issue<00:05:38.400> to

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
that's an important character issue to

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:39.920 
that's an important character issue to
be<00:05:38.820> able<00:05:38.910> to<00:05:39.060> see<00:05:39.419> it<00:05:39.539> from<00:05:39.720> the<00:05:39.900> other

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
kinds of things that are being rebuilt

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.850 
kinds of things that are being rebuilt
within<00:05:44.669> us<00:05:45.000> when<00:05:45.210> we<00:05:45.360> work<00:05:45.539> these<00:05:45.720> steps<00:05:46.020> and

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
within us when we work these steps and

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.100 
within us when we work these steps and
we<00:05:47.430> need<00:05:47.580> to<00:05:47.729> see<00:05:47.940> it<00:05:48.060> from<00:05:48.270> God's<00:05:48.630> point<00:05:48.960> of

we need to see it from God's point of

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.170 
we need to see it from God's point of
