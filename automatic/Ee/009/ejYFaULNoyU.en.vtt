that and obviously till I have an idea

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.310 
that and obviously till I have an idea
no<00:03:59.520> I'm<00:03:59.760> most<00:04:00.060> likely<00:04:00.570> what<00:04:00.750> I'm<00:04:00.870> going<00:04:01.200> to

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
no I'm most likely what I'm going to

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.040 
no I'm most likely what I'm going to
start<00:04:01.530> again<00:04:01.890> is<00:04:02.130> a<00:04:02.160> new<00:04:02.370> build<00:04:02.610> series<00:04:03.050> I

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
start again is a new build series I

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.170 
start again is a new build series I
think<00:04:04.770> as<00:04:04.920> I<00:04:05.010> said<00:04:05.040> going<00:04:05.489> back<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.030> whole

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
think as I said going back to the whole

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.820 
think as I said going back to the whole
fusion<00:04:06.600> craft<00:04:06.840> thing<00:04:07.110> and<00:04:07.320> try<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.470> make<00:04:07.620> in

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
fusion craft thing and try to make in

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.770 
fusion craft thing and try to make in
that<00:04:07.950> world<00:04:08.220> again<00:04:08.580> would<00:04:09.120> be<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.239> huge<00:04:09.480> mistake

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
that world again would be a huge mistake

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.580 
that world again would be a huge mistake
it's<00:04:10.350> gone<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.890> it<00:04:11.220> was<00:04:11.340> it's<00:04:11.670> too<00:04:11.970> old<00:04:12.209> no<00:04:12.590> the

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
it's gone I it was it's too old no the

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.590 
it's gone I it was it's too old no the
idea<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:14.040> think<00:04:14.340> bringing<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:14.850> back<00:04:15.030> no<00:04:15.270> would

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
idea I think bringing that back no would

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.630 
idea I think bringing that back no would
people<00:04:16.140> just<00:04:16.380> wouldn't<00:04:16.530> be<00:04:16.739> interested<00:04:17.100> and

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
people just wouldn't be interested and

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.449 
people just wouldn't be interested and
it<00:04:18.450> would<00:04:18.570> just<00:04:18.600> bring<00:04:19.230> my<00:04:19.410> server<00:04:19.739> or<00:04:20.130> bring

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
it would just bring my server or bring

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.670 
it would just bring my server or bring
everything<00:04:20.790> down

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
everything down

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.159 
everything down
it<00:04:21.889> wouldn't<00:04:22.100> be<00:04:22.160> a<00:04:22.190> great<00:04:22.490> thing<00:04:22.669> to<00:04:22.729> do<00:04:23.030> so<00:04:23.720> i

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
it wouldn't be a great thing to do so i

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.689 
it wouldn't be a great thing to do so i
watch<00:04:24.530> you<00:04:24.560> think<00:04:24.889> I<00:04:24.979> stink<00:04:25.310> do<00:04:25.430> you<00:04:25.520> think

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699
