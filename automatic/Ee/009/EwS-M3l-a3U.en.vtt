00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:11.060 
actually talked a little bit about the

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.000 
actually talked a little bit about the
anatomy<00:00:11.330> of<00:00:11.600> facial<00:00:12.020> aging<00:00:12.170> and<00:00:12.590> some<00:00:12.860> of<00:00:12.950> the

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
that underlying muscle layer so that we

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.160 
that underlying muscle layer so that we
can<00:01:06.680> give<00:01:06.980> you<00:01:07.220> that<00:01:07.460> 10<00:01:07.820> 12<00:01:08.270> 15<00:01:08.660> year

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
longevity down the road the difference

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.390 
longevity down the road the difference
between<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.320> two<00:01:12.500> as<00:01:12.680> I've<00:01:12.860> mentioned<00:01:12.890> before

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
between the two as I've mentioned before

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.210 
between the two as I've mentioned before
is<00:01:13.880> in<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.330> neck<00:01:14.540> let's<00:01:15.500> say<00:01:15.740> you've<00:01:15.950> got<00:01:15.980> a

is in the neck let's say you've got a
patient<00:01:16.790> that<00:01:16.910> just<00:01:17.330> has<00:01:17.600> some<00:01:17.900> mild<00:01:18.230> aging

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
patient that just has some mild aging

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.400 
patient that just has some mild aging
along<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.250> jawline<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:19.940> some<00:01:20.540> mild<00:01:20.870> aging

along the jawline and some mild aging
along<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.830> neck<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:23.000> can<00:01:23.030> kind<00:01:23.540> of<00:01:23.660> think<00:01:23.720> of

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
along the neck you can kind of think of

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.140 
along the neck you can kind of think of
that<00:01:24.230> kind<00:01:24.530> of<00:01:24.650> like<00:01:24.800> a<00:01:24.830> hammock<00:01:25.400> between<00:01:25.610> two

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
that kind of like a hammock between two

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.990 
that kind of like a hammock between two
trees<00:01:26.480> now<00:01:27.470> over<00:01:27.890> time<00:01:28.160> that<00:01:28.430> hammock<00:01:28.880> is

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
trees now over time that hammock is

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.760 
trees now over time that hammock is
going<00:01:29.270> to<00:01:29.390> sag<00:01:29.720> a<00:01:29.750> little<00:01:30.290> bit<00:01:30.410> in<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.650> middle

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
going to sag a little bit in the middle

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.520 
going to sag a little bit in the middle
if<00:01:31.100> it's<00:01:31.700> just<00:01:32.030> sagged<00:01:32.480> a<00:01:32.720> little<00:01:32.750> bit<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.380> can

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
if it's just sagged a little bit you can

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.160 
if it's just sagged a little bit you can
kind<00:01:33.830> of<00:01:33.950> undo<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.580> hammock<00:01:35.000> tighten<00:01:35.900> it<00:01:36.020> up

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
kind of undo the hammock tighten it up

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.170 
kind of undo the hammock tighten it up
amongst<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.800> two<00:01:37.070> trees<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.820> hammock

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
amongst the two trees and the hammock

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.230 
amongst the two trees and the hammock
will<00:01:38.330> be<00:01:38.450> taught<00:01:38.780> again<00:01:39.410> that's<00:01:40.340> what<00:01:40.700> an<00:01:40.790> RT

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
will be taught again that's what an RT

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.940 
will be taught again that's what an RT
mini<00:01:41.510> lift<00:01:41.750> does<00:01:42.080> we're<00:01:42.800> basically

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
mini lift does we're basically

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.850 
mini lift does we're basically
dissecting<00:01:43.910> along<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.480> edges<00:01:44.630> with<00:01:45.020> mild

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
dissecting along the edges with mild

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.340 
dissecting along the edges with mild
dissection<00:01:46.760> in<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.940> middle<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.360> tightening

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
dissection in the middle and tightening

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.880 
dissection in the middle and tightening
everything<00:01:48.500> up<00:01:49.450> however<00:01:50.450> if<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.080> hammock<00:01:51.710> in

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
everything up however if the hammock in

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.399 
everything up however if the hammock in
the<00:01:52.070> previous<00:01:52.400> analogy<00:01:52.970> actually<00:01:53.780> has<00:01:54.020> a<00:01:54.050> hole

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
the previous analogy actually has a hole

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.380 
the previous analogy actually has a hole
in<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.800> middle<00:01:54.920> of<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.159> hammock<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:56.180> can

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
in the middle of the hammock you can

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.240 
in the middle of the hammock you can
tighten<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:56.960> up<00:01:57.050> as<00:01:57.260> much<00:01:57.290> as<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:57.860> want<00:01:58.070> from

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250
