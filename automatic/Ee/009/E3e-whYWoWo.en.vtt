ones we saw last week yeah and they were
really<00:02:02.880> cool<00:02:03.300> right<00:02:04.290> not<00:02:04.650> only<00:02:04.860> were<00:02:05.280> they

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
really cool right not only were they

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.580 
really cool right not only were they
cool<00:02:05.730> but<00:02:06.450> they<00:02:06.570> also<00:02:06.720> serve<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.350> very

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
cool but they also serve a very

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.609 
cool but they also serve a very
important<00:02:08.220> purpose<00:02:08.250> or<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.030> job<00:02:09.619> Jehovah

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
important purpose or a job Jehovah

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.760 
important purpose or a job Jehovah
created<00:02:10.979> them<00:02:11.130> as<00:02:11.280> part<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.880> water<00:02:12.090> cycle

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
created them as part of the water cycle

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.890 
created them as part of the water cycle
so<00:02:13.770> they<00:02:13.920> looked<00:02:14.220> really<00:02:14.550> fluffy<00:02:14.850> but<00:02:15.660> really

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
so they looked really fluffy but really

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.050 
so they looked really fluffy but really
there<00:02:16.050> was<00:02:16.260> tons<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:17.010> water<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.580> those<00:02:17.790> clouds

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
there was tons of water in those clouds

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.020 
there was tons of water in those clouds
and<00:02:18.690> how<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.620> water<00:02:19.830> got<00:02:20.130> there<00:02:20.430> was<00:02:20.700> Miss

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
and how that water got there was Miss

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.350 
and how that water got there was Miss
FEMA<00:02:21.540> from<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.900> Seas<00:02:22.140> or<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.830> ocean<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.670> it

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
FEMA from the Seas or the ocean and it

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.420 
FEMA from the Seas or the ocean and it
formed<00:02:24.720> with<00:02:24.870> little<00:02:25.230> tiny<00:02:25.590> pieces<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.190> dust

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
formed with little tiny pieces of dust

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.300 
formed with little tiny pieces of dust
and<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.510> dust<00:02:27.750> became<00:02:28.110> our<00:02:28.350> raindrops<00:02:28.890> and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
and that dust became our raindrops and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.700 
and that dust became our raindrops and
then<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.420> came<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.960> earth<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.380> started

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
then it came to the earth and started

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.380 
then it came to the earth and started
the<00:02:31.830> cycle<00:02:32.010> all<00:02:32.400> over<00:02:32.430> again

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
the cycle all over again

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.990 
the cycle all over again
so<00:02:34.140> Alan<00:02:34.530> do<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.680> think<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.190> these<00:02:35.730> things

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
so Alan do you think that these things

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.910 
so Alan do you think that these things
with<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.360> animals<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.170> with<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.290> clouds<00:02:37.620> do

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
with the animals and with the clouds do

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.080 
with the animals and with the clouds do
you<00:02:38.010> think<00:02:38.220> they<00:02:38.340> could<00:02:38.550> have<00:02:38.640> just<00:02:38.670> happened

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
you think they could have just happened

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.940 
you think they could have just happened
on<00:02:39.420> their<00:02:39.600> own<00:02:39.780> no<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.800> don't<00:02:41.670> either

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
on their own no I don't either

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.840 
on their own no I don't either
now<00:02:44.750> it's<00:02:45.750> pretty<00:02:46.200> unreasonable<00:02:46.860> pretty

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
now it's pretty unreasonable pretty

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.550 
now it's pretty unreasonable pretty
silly<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.390> think<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.870> they<00:02:49.140> could<00:02:49.200> just

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
silly to think that they could just

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.120 
silly to think that they could just
happen<00:02:50.090> let's<00:02:51.090> say<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.959> made<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.470> picture<00:02:52.950> for

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660
