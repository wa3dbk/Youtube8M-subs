a<00:01:15.650> lot<00:01:15.740> of<00:01:15.800> different<00:01:15.860> recorders<00:01:16.430> on<00:01:16.610> if<00:01:16.730> it's

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
a lot of different recorders on if it's

connection output a hole under there put

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.580 
connection output a hole under there put
a<00:01:34.820> connection<00:01:35.360> of<00:01:35.390> this<00:01:35.540> plate<00:01:35.840> put<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.230> CDs

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
a connection of this plate put the CDs

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.130 
a connection of this plate put the CDs
on<00:01:36.910> clamp<00:01:37.910> the<00:01:38.060> plates<00:01:38.300> down<00:01:38.540> and<00:01:38.780> see<00:01:39.020> what

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
on clamp the plates down and see what

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.550 
on clamp the plates down and see what
happens<00:01:40.360> okay<00:01:41.360> if<00:01:41.660> he<00:01:41.750> was<00:01:41.900> I<00:01:41.990> could<00:01:42.140> have<00:01:42.230> tiny

okay have you eyes we're done it's a top
plate<00:02:15.810> tonight<00:02:16.810> series<00:02:17.380> under<00:02:17.620> there

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
plate tonight series under there

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.970 
plate tonight series under there
perfect<00:02:18.820> let's<00:02:19.660> NST<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.680> see<00:02:20.860> what

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
perfect let's NST it and see what

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.430 
perfect let's NST it and see what
happens

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
happens

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.750 
happens
it<00:02:23.440> might<00:02:23.620> be<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.800> little<00:02:23.920> more<00:02:24.130> talk<00:02:24.430> but<00:02:24.640> we'll

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
it might be a little more talk but we'll

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.900 
it might be a little more talk but we'll
see<00:02:24.910> how<00:02:24.940> this<00:02:25.120> works<00:02:25.330> here<00:02:25.630> okay<00:02:29.760> it's<00:02:30.760> time

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
see how this works here okay it's time

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.480 
see how this works here okay it's time
for<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.209> test<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.720> got<00:02:31.810> there<00:02:31.990> 10<00:02:32.200> kv<00:02:32.770> n<00:02:33.010> st<00:02:33.190> on

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
for a test I got there 10 kv n st on

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:51.420 
for a test I got there 10 kv n st on
this<00:02:33.640> hop<00:02:34.470> do<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.560> test<00:02:35.860> on<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.010> 10<00:02:36.250> kv<00:02:36.700> 1<00:02:50.430> it's

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
this hop do a test on a 10 kv 1 it's

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.180 
this hop do a test on a 10 kv 1 it's
working

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
working

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.970 
working
hailer<00:02:54.190> plates<00:02:54.459> are<00:02:54.640> 2<00:02:54.790> water<00:02:55.030> pot<00:02:58.980> yeah

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
hailer plates are 2 water pot yeah

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:15.810 
hailer plates are 2 water pot yeah
that's<00:03:00.310> very<00:03:01.470> small<00:03:02.470> there<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:08.200> are<00:03:08.350> in<00:03:08.590> yeah

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.290 

that's<00:03:16.820> trying<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.120> sort<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.720> 12kb<00:03:18.380> NST<00:03:19.300> plates

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
that's trying to sort a 12kb NST plates

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.080 
that's trying to sort a 12kb NST plates
are<00:03:20.450> too<00:03:20.570> far<00:03:20.780> apart<00:03:21.610> so<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:22.730> city<00:03:23.000> is

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
are too far apart so the city is

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.140 
are too far apart so the city is
probably<00:03:23.450> um<00:03:23.740> it<00:03:24.740> depends<00:03:25.580> of<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.700> size<00:03:25.760> of

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
probably um it depends of the size of

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.370 
probably um it depends of the size of
the<00:03:26.240> plates<00:03:27.580> let's<00:03:28.580> try<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.820> other<00:03:28.940> NH<00:03:29.240> t<00:03:29.450> 12

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
the plates let's try the other NH t 12

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:45.920 
the plates let's try the other NH t 12
kV<00:03:30.710> NS<00:03:31.100> t<00:03:42.370> yeah

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.059 

but<00:03:46.930> plates<00:03:47.200> not<00:03:47.440> too<00:03:47.560> far<00:03:47.920> apart<00:03:49.950> but<00:03:50.950> it

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
but plates not too far apart but it

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.280 
but plates not too far apart but it
works<00:03:51.310> nonetheless<00:03:51.760> I'll<00:03:52.569> be<00:03:52.720> honest<00:03:52.989> maybe

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
works nonetheless I'll be honest maybe

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.090 
works nonetheless I'll be honest maybe
not<00:03:53.470> paneer<00:03:53.880> thanks<00:03:54.880> a<00:03:54.970> lot
