00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
lying flat in front of you take each

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.489 
lying flat in front of you take each

gently<00:01:41.100> onto<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.969> axle<00:01:42.149> as<00:01:43.459> you<00:01:44.459> can<00:01:44.639> see<00:01:44.939> one

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
gently onto the axle as you can see one

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.559 
gently onto the axle as you can see one
person<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.799> perform<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.849> part<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
person can perform this part of the

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:54.590 
person can perform this part of the
assembly

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.719 

the<00:01:54.720> wheels<00:01:54.900> in<00:01:55.110> place<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.619> next<00:01:55.799> step<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.340> to

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the wheels in place the next step is to

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.390 
the wheels in place the next step is to
assemble<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.080> nuts<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> ends<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
assemble the nuts on the ends of the

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.080 
assemble the nuts on the ends of the
axles

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.370 

this<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.360> first<00:02:06.570> point<00:02:06.780> where<00:02:06.990> we've<00:02:07.170> used

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
this is the first point where we've used

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.120 
this is the first point where we've used
a<00:02:07.680> tool<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:09.450> adjustable<00:02:10.080> wrench<00:02:10.350> will<00:02:10.650> help

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
a tool the adjustable wrench will help

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.630 
a tool the adjustable wrench will help
get<00:02:11.460> the<00:02:11.790> nut<00:02:12.450> started<00:02:13.190> but<00:02:14.190> then<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.430> becomes

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
get the nut started but then it becomes

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.780 
get the nut started but then it becomes
a<00:02:14.820> two-person<00:02:15.480> operation<00:02:16.010> because<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.040> axle

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
a two-person operation because the axle

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.960 
a two-person operation because the axle
is<00:02:17.880> threaded<00:02:18.270> on<00:02:18.390> both<00:02:18.600> ends<00:02:19.520> you<00:02:20.520> have<00:02:20.550> to

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
is threaded on both ends you have to

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.670 
is threaded on both ends you have to
hold<00:02:21.210> one<00:02:21.600> side<00:02:21.960> nut<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.300> tighten<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.630> other

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
hold one side nut and tighten the other

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.190 
hold one side nut and tighten the other
when<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:25.800> is<00:02:25.980> done<00:02:26.250> both<00:02:26.520> nuts<00:02:27.030> will<00:02:27.720> tighten

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
when this is done both nuts will tighten

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.990 
when this is done both nuts will tighten
together<00:02:28.830> on<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.910> axle<00:02:30.300> holding<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.870> wheels

together on the axle holding the wheels

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.580 
together on the axle holding the wheels
after<00:02:33.000> you've<00:02:33.390> tightened<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.870> nuts<00:02:34.140> on<00:02:34.470> the
