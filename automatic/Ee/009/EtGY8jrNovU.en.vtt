00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.460
 at 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.270
 you hi all and the mythical bird 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.970
 tories so I have in the company of my 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.109
 small the ten rooms and here we go 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.579
 find for another little tutorial on 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.310
 destiny so we'll show you how 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.970
 find the golden chest bags so on the 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.430
 planet Mars 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.110
 him and so here we go for this 5th 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.080
 the tutorial on the planet relay boxes 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.489
 march and we'll start with the first 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.379
 safe so to find it he goes 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.269
 just have to start the mode 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.160
 exploration words of hope are all 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.050
 simply is the first khokhlova 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.530
 was so you will have to go on 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.809
 the right 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.460
 so I think the first one I did 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.170
 on the right I hope you do 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.520
 do not cheat actually I look 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.059
 to go to the right so it's rather 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.890
 good sign 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.510
 so you have a little bit pretty much 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.370
 what's it undermine a hundred 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.020
 meters for two days and you there are 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.539
 a kind of dome like that so you 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.890
 go inside and everything at the bottom left 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.420
 he sends us there on the small parts 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.280
 you see that there is a safe and that's 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.710
 a golden chest besides the passage I 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.119
 believe that this is the first the first 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.030
 good heart that we made the first 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.740
 mission so this is it's first 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.740
 immediately right ansp hollande on the 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.929
 simply map the 2nd safe 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.099
 even practice you this pony on the map 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:24.830
 and instead of going right you 

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:26.780
 go left and then left matarelle 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.310
 what's it about 100 meters 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.630
 pretty much it's really fast 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.459
 it's to show you we see the dome 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.000
 there in depth you can see it well 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.039
 character 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.390
 the dome is really at the bottom of the map to 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.099
 right and there the character goes left 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.959
 and you're going to have some sort of that done 

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:40.220
 a ladder with an underground I 'm going 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.869
 not too much how you should write better 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.540
 that we arrive in a kind of 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.310
 underground corridors 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.680
 and so the 2nd chest actually put 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.090
 in the higher foundations of this 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.220
 hallway so in the little ones here in 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.380
 the little recess authors you 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.030
 make sure you do not go wrong 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.310
 to be the first child that's going to be the one 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.990
 just behind that's not this one 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.580
 it's the one who's right behind as 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.350
 what's wrong with bungie are 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.520
 well been we hide this it is necessary to 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.080
 to go down to pass below 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.429
 the good apostle go see the second 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.840
 golden chest 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.519
 with a little in rank and consistent that 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.230
 always happy yes besides I 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.760
 wonder if more is high level 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.079
 the more stuff we find in 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.819
 pretty interesting chests I do not know 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.290
 at all 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.730
 this is the third body he is going to 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.129
 find by doing the mission that 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.870
 is called the summer palace after we see 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.069
 so you are you in front of this 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.969
 building I think a lot of people 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.170
 know it or we see it a lot 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.999
 in the missions we are on march 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.469
 in assaults you just go back 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:33.560
 in the building he goes strong when 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.459
 stairs go right 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.469
 then you go to the bottom left 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.549
 you follow the buildings well so 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.400
 every time there is an issue so 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.090
 here you continue straight ahead 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.280
 on your left 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.590
 there you will have to go down in 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.329
 down below here after the fair 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.329
 go down to the right take the stairs 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.390
 we continue to go down after that we follow 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.210
 the path 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.280
 hop in the left fist has no choice 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.080
 kind the main way a crime is 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.900
 right there you take a right or you 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.250
 switch between rff enemies to enter 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.480
 in the room on the left and it's just 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.070
 behind this little office, here you are 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.690
 can see it 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.880
 this is the third golden chest but the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.250
 asse 13th club is in the offices 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.140
 number 3 so seven floors all 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.510
 simply and I believe that for the 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.880
 you're at level 35 I know 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.110
 that there is a figure 35 described at the level 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.360
 stairs if it can help you 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.520
 you spot number 4 chest that goes 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.080
 have to do the mission the tide 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.060
 rising and when you come to 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.230
 moment of the junction of taris at the level 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.060
 of this mission you are going to have a 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.830
 sort of subway with the number 1 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.180
 so you can not go wrong 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.070
 orange here I know it's part 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.290
 of the one mission at a time 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.480
 given or must destroy destroy 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.980
 vex entry areas I do not know if that 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.560
 you speak in any case we are in this 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.180
 subway is just he'll have to 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.650
 to get to the back of the other side of the metro 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.240
 here you go bishops portal 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.130
 which I was talking to you about right now and he 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.060
 must be taken right behind the gate 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.020
 from the ex 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.310
 I had a little start I think 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.300
 external in g purple but not false 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.000
 right it was painful 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.620
 and that's where the safe is 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.080
 just behind in the small and in the 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.900
 little recess here again and here and 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.569
 I saw your servant in guibon 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.220
 better do that and the last chest 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.750
 so is in the mission the place 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.030
 from the garden or so when you do 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.410
 the assault of value store 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.700
 first of all something like that so you 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.019
 arrive in this area you can not 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.389
 the miss is a large area with them 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.430
 there are a lot of enemies here are 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.050
 centurions etc that turns you on pretty well 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.190
 So here you are, I advise you 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.510
 to eliminate all enemies otherwise you 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.760
 go a little galley finally it depends on 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.979
 your level but do not go bad galley 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.419
 yes it's better a hand of any 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.010
 way on the passage of the tunnel to do 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.840
 so there gablin of such levels better them 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.070
 eliminations so sees there you jump 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.560
 on the abutments the little pipes you 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.210
 see you feel in water is there it's 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.410
 dark enough are you using your 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.270
 double jump to jump on the 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.440
 platform that is further away we argued 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.660
 to Afghanistan it's a lot more 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.770
 easy but here is the fifth 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.639
 golden box frankly it is very 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.139
 well hidden that one 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.249
 and a little piece and pink that makes 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.599
 always pleasure to buy 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:59.849
 small arms at the black market 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:01.259
 exactly here I hope this 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.729
 little video you liked it tell you to 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.979
 very soon for another video all 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.159
 destiny options kisses kisses in your 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.159
 cottages
