00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
you're watching a team deathmatch on

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.850 
you're watching a team deathmatch on
Nuketown<00:00:08.570> this<00:00:08.780> isn't<00:00:09.110> a<00:00:09.260> ground<00:00:09.530> war<00:00:09.650> team

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
Nuketown this isn't a ground war team

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.379 
Nuketown this isn't a ground war team
deathmatch<00:00:10.219> it's<00:00:10.429> just<00:00:10.669> a<00:00:10.790> regular<00:00:11.030> team

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
deathmatch it's just a regular team

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:13.419 
deathmatch it's just a regular team
deathmatch<00:00:11.780> which<00:00:12.019> means<00:00:12.230> it's<00:00:12.830> only<00:00:13.099> up<00:00:13.219> to

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
deathmatch which means it's only up to

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.750 
deathmatch which means it's only up to
75<00:00:13.969> kills<00:00:14.330> rather<00:00:14.599> than<00:00:14.900> 100<00:00:15.860> kills<00:00:16.039> so<00:00:16.730> I

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
75 kills rather than 100 kills so I

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.070 
75 kills rather than 100 kills so I
think<00:00:17.150> I<00:00:17.240> get<00:00:17.390> a<00:00:17.420> pretty<00:00:17.660> good<00:00:17.840> score

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
think I get a pretty good score

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.480 
think I get a pretty good score
considering<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:20.240> the<00:00:21.140> limit<00:00:21.470> and<00:00:21.650> right

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
considering the the limit and right

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.740 
considering the the limit and right
there<00:00:22.670> I<00:00:22.700> start<00:00:23.210> off<00:00:23.270> the<00:00:23.390> game<00:00:23.420> pretty<00:00:23.660> well

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
there I start off the game pretty well

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.470 
there I start off the game pretty well
with<00:00:24.260> a<00:00:24.500> two-man<00:00:25.340> car<00:00:25.580> bomb<00:00:25.790> unfortunately

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
with a two-man car bomb unfortunately

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.820 
with a two-man car bomb unfortunately
somebody<00:00:26.840> ran<00:00:27.020> over<00:00:27.050> here<00:00:27.380> and<00:00:27.470> put<00:00:27.590> a<00:00:27.650> claim

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
somebody ran over here and put a claim

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.190 
somebody ran over here and put a claim
or<00:00:28.010> down<00:00:28.190> already<00:00:28.430> which<00:00:29.180> was<00:00:29.450> very<00:00:29.690> effective

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
or down already which was very effective

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.229 
or down already which was very effective
in<00:00:30.410> stopping<00:00:30.620> me<00:00:30.890> from<00:00:30.920> terrorizing<00:00:31.850> their

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
in stopping me from terrorizing their

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.779 
in stopping me from terrorizing their
spawn<00:00:32.480> but<00:00:32.840> i<00:00:33.320> don't<00:00:34.070> really<00:00:34.190> like<00:00:34.280> dying<00:00:34.609> like

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789 
spawn but i don't really like dying like

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:36.489 
spawn but i don't really like dying like
that<00:00:34.820> but<00:00:35.210> i<00:00:35.239> guess<00:00:35.539> it<00:00:35.749> was<00:00:35.780> a<00:00:35.929> pretty<00:00:36.260> smart

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:36.499 
that but i guess it was a pretty smart

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:39.340 
that but i guess it was a pretty smart
move<00:00:36.710> by<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:36.949> other<00:00:37.129> team<00:00:37.219> so<00:00:38.320> yesterday<00:00:39.320> i

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
move by the other team so yesterday i

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.130 
move by the other team so yesterday i
uploaded<00:00:40.100> a<00:00:40.249> video<00:00:40.429> and<00:00:40.789> it<00:00:41.329> was<00:00:41.629> a<00:00:41.659> 12<00:00:41.989> minute

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140

uploaded a video and it was a 12 minute
long<00:00:42.350> video<00:00:43.039> i<00:00:43.249> think<00:00:43.579> i<00:00:43.670> went<00:00:43.760> 69<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:44.510> 11<00:00:44.899> and

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
long video i think i went 69 and 11 and

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:50.829 
long video i think i went 69 and 11 and
i<00:00:46.539> took<00:00:47.539> it<00:00:47.870> down<00:00:48.109> because<00:00:48.969> basically<00:00:49.969> when

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
i took it down because basically when

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:52.689 
i took it down because basically when
you<00:00:51.050> upload<00:00:51.379> a<00:00:51.469> long<00:00:51.769> video<00:00:52.039> like<00:00:52.309> that<00:00:52.339> and

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
you upload a long video like that and

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.910 
you upload a long video like that and
you<00:00:53.149> have<00:00:53.300> an<00:00:53.510> average<00:00:53.780> internet<00:00:54.409> connection

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
you have an average internet connection

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.099 
you have an average internet connection
it<00:00:55.519> doesn't<00:00:55.850> show<00:00:56.030> up<00:00:56.059> in<00:00:56.269> the<00:00:56.420> sub<00:00:56.600> boxes<00:00:56.960> all

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
it doesn't show up in the sub boxes all

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.349 
it doesn't show up in the sub boxes all
the<00:00:57.199> time<00:00:57.379> because<00:00:57.739> for<00:00:58.699> example<00:00:58.729> if<00:00:59.179> you're

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
the time because for example if you're

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.419 
the time because for example if you're
subscribed<00:00:59.659> to<00:01:00.109> like<00:01:00.319> a<00:01:00.499> ton<00:01:00.800> of<00:01:00.829> people<00:01:01.280> and

subscribed to like a ton of people and

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.099 
subscribed to like a ton of people and
you're<00:01:01.699> getting<00:01:01.879> a<00:01:02.210> new<00:01:02.389> video<00:01:02.719> in<00:01:02.780> your<00:01:02.870> sub

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
uploading for two hours gets pushed out

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.600 
uploading for two hours gets pushed out
of<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.909> sub<00:01:11.090> box<00:01:11.329> because<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:12.619> order<00:01:13.460> that

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
of the sub box because the order that

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.560 
of the sub box because the order that
the<00:01:13.880> sub<00:01:14.450> box<00:01:14.689> puts<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.560> videos<00:01:15.860> in<00:01:16.159> is<00:01:16.570> the

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
the sub box puts the videos in is the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.880 
the sub box puts the videos in is the
most<00:01:17.750> recent<00:01:17.930> video<00:01:18.259> and<00:01:18.380> if<00:01:18.469> i've<00:01:18.680> been

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
most recent video and if i've been

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.350 
most recent video and if i've been
uploading<00:01:19.310> it<00:01:19.399> for<00:01:19.520> two<00:01:19.640> hours<00:01:19.789> it<00:01:20.060> counts

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
uploading it for two hours it counts

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.719 
uploading it for two hours it counts
that<00:01:20.479> as<00:01:20.689> a<00:01:20.979> time<00:01:21.979> that<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.280> videos<00:01:22.520> been

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
that as a time that the videos been

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.520 
that as a time that the videos been
getting<00:01:22.969> older<00:01:23.299> so<00:01:23.600> it<00:01:23.780> might<00:01:23.960> not<00:01:24.110> even<00:01:24.170> have

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
getting older so it might not even have

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.440 
getting older so it might not even have
a<00:01:24.560> chance<00:01:24.649> for<00:01:25.009> you<00:01:25.159> guys<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:25.430> see<00:01:25.610> it<00:01:25.640> so<00:01:26.420> i

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
a chance for you guys to see it so i

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.529 
a chance for you guys to see it so i
guess<00:01:26.840> i'll<00:01:27.110> have<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:28.030> try<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:29.180> upload<00:01:29.329> that

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
guess i'll have to try and upload that

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.319 
guess i'll have to try and upload that
another<00:01:29.810> time<00:01:30.020> or<00:01:30.289> something<00:01:30.680> but<00:01:31.329> i'm

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
another time or something but i'm

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:33.459 
another time or something but i'm
uploading<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:32.869> video<00:01:33.020> because<00:01:33.259> it's

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
uploading this video because it's

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:34.990 
uploading this video because it's
shorter<00:01:33.799> so<00:01:33.979> i<00:01:34.009> don't<00:01:34.219> have<00:01:34.280> to<00:01:34.399> worry<00:01:34.880> about

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
shorter so i don't have to worry about

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.660 
shorter so i don't have to worry about
that<00:01:35.299> for<00:01:35.329> now<00:01:35.950> unfortunately<00:01:36.950> i<00:01:37.280> think<00:01:37.549> i'm

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
that for now unfortunately i think i'm

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.740 
that for now unfortunately i think i'm
always<00:01:37.909> going<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.090> have<00:01:38.119> that<00:01:38.270> problem<00:01:38.509> with

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
always going to have that problem with

always going to have that problem with
uploading<00:01:39.140> longer<00:01:39.530> games<00:01:39.740> but<00:01:40.039> oh<00:01:40.420> well<00:01:41.920> so

pretty<00:01:50.479> much<00:01:50.600> what<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:50.840> always<00:01:51.109> use<00:01:51.259> if<00:01:51.409> I'm

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
pretty much what I always use if I'm

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.230 
pretty much what I always use if I'm
going<00:01:51.710> for<00:01:51.920> a<00:01:51.950> lot<00:01:52.070> of<00:01:52.159> kills<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:52.579> wouldn't

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
going for a lot of kills I wouldn't

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.419 
going for a lot of kills I wouldn't
suggest<00:01:53.450> using<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.079> ak-47<00:01:54.890> here<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:55.250> also

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
suggest using the ak-47 here and also

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.190 
suggest using the ak-47 here and also
this<00:01:55.700> pistol<00:01:56.090> i'm<00:01:56.210> using<00:01:56.539> it's<00:01:56.719> not<00:01:56.960> very<00:01:57.079> good

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
this pistol i'm using it's not very good

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.550 
this pistol i'm using it's not very good
so<00:01:57.530> i<00:01:57.920> wouldn't<00:01:58.249> suggest<00:01:58.520> using<00:01:59.299> this<00:02:00.079> ak-47

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
so i wouldn't suggest using this ak-47

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.029 
so i wouldn't suggest using this ak-47
or<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.070> pistol<00:02:01.369> because<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:02.210> ak-47<00:02:03.049> is<00:02:03.469> not

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
or the pistol because the ak-47 is not

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.099 
or the pistol because the ak-47 is not
very<00:02:04.249> well<00:02:04.399> suited<00:02:04.579> for<00:02:04.909> this<00:02:04.999> map<00:02:05.299> it<00:02:05.600> is<00:02:06.079> a

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
very well suited for this map it is a

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.889 
very well suited for this map it is a
good<00:02:06.409> gun<00:02:06.649> but<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:08.060> kind<00:02:08.210> of<00:02:08.360> engagements

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
good gun but the kind of engagements

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:09.910 
good gun but the kind of engagements
that<00:02:08.960> you're<00:02:09.140> probably<00:02:09.289> going<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.530> get<00:02:09.649> into

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
that you're probably going to get into

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.040 
that you're probably going to get into
in<00:02:10.039> this<00:02:10.220> map<00:02:10.610> aren't<00:02:11.150> you're<00:02:11.750> not<00:02:11.840> going<00:02:11.989> to

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
in this map aren't you're not going to

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.360 
in this map aren't you're not going to
benefit<00:02:12.379> from<00:02:12.440> using<00:02:12.739> an<00:02:13.010> assault<00:02:13.310> rifle

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
benefit from using an assault rifle

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.110 
benefit from using an assault rifle
which<00:02:13.760> is

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
which is

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.670 
which is
meant<00:02:14.239> for<00:02:14.299> longer<00:02:14.720> range<00:02:14.930> engagements<00:02:15.170> you

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
meant for longer range engagements you

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.149 
meant for longer range engagements you
should<00:02:15.830> probably<00:02:16.129> use<00:02:16.220> an<00:02:16.340> SMG<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:18.159> the

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 
should probably use an SMG and the

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.009 
should probably use an SMG and the
pistol<00:02:19.549> I<00:02:19.640> find<00:02:19.909> that<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.330> takes<00:02:20.659> a<00:02:20.810> lot<00:02:20.989> of

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
pistol I find that it takes a lot of

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.080 
pistol I find that it takes a lot of
shots<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.440> kill<00:02:21.560> people<00:02:21.739> i<00:02:22.040> strongly<00:02:22.970> prefer

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
shots to kill people i strongly prefer

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.390 
shots to kill people i strongly prefer

stick<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:26.000> bauxite<00:02:26.659> i<00:02:27.010> think<00:02:28.010> that<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.700> python

stick a bauxite i think that the python
with<00:02:29.420> an<00:02:29.540> acog<00:02:29.840> site<00:02:30.260> is<00:02:30.440> probably<00:02:30.799> the<00:02:30.950> most

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
with an acog site is probably the most

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.589 
with an acog site is probably the most
well-rounded<00:02:31.519> secondary<00:02:32.239> in<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.450> game

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
well-rounded secondary in the game

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.270 
well-rounded secondary in the game
because<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:33.170> can<00:02:33.379> easily<00:02:33.680> take<00:02:33.829> out<00:02:33.980> people

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
because you can easily take out people

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.309 
because you can easily take out people
at<00:02:34.370> close<00:02:34.549> range<00:02:34.849> and<00:02:35.090> if<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.810> want<00:02:36.019> you<00:02:36.170> can

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
at close range and if you want you can

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.809 
at close range and if you want you can
take<00:02:36.650> out<00:02:36.799> people<00:02:37.069> across<00:02:37.280> than<00:02:37.519> that<00:02:37.640> because

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
take out people across than that because

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.509 
take out people across than that because
the<00:02:38.269> ACOG<00:02:38.629> scope<00:02:38.750> has<00:02:39.409> no<00:02:39.680> idols<00:02:40.069> way<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.280> it

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
the ACOG scope has no idols way to it

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.759 
the ACOG scope has no idols way to it
which<00:02:41.180> means<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.840> when<00:02:42.049> you<00:02:42.140> look<00:02:42.319> down<00:02:42.470> it's

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
which means that when you look down it's

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.319 
which means that when you look down it's
not<00:02:42.950> going<00:02:43.129> to<00:02:43.250> wiggle<00:02:43.489> around<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.090> make<00:02:44.180> it

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
not going to wiggle around and make it

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.729 
not going to wiggle around and make it
hard<00:02:44.510> for<00:02:44.569> you<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.750> kill<00:02:45.110> somebody<00:02:45.319> across<00:02:45.560> the

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
hard for you to kill somebody across the

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.849 
hard for you to kill somebody across the
map<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.129> it's<00:02:46.310> kind<00:02:46.519> of<00:02:46.579> cheap<00:02:46.819> but<00:02:47.859> the

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
map so it's kind of cheap but the

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:50.229 
map so it's kind of cheap but the
secondaries<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:49.489> game<00:02:49.670> are<00:02:49.700> all<00:02:49.910> so<00:02:50.060> bad

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
secondaries in this game are all so bad

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.710 
secondaries in this game are all so bad
that<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:50.540> don't<00:02:50.900> really<00:02:51.049> mind<00:02:51.140> using<00:02:51.590> it

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
that I don't really mind using it

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.580 
that I don't really mind using it
unfortunately<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.750> wasn't<00:02:53.989> able<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.379> call<00:02:54.530> in

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
unfortunately I wasn't able to call in

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.780 
unfortunately I wasn't able to call in
my<00:02:54.739> chopper<00:02:55.099> gunner<00:02:55.280> this<00:02:55.459> whole<00:02:55.609> game

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
my chopper gunner this whole game

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.729 
my chopper gunner this whole game
because<00:02:56.209> people<00:02:56.840> keep<00:02:56.959> on<00:02:57.109> calling<00:02:57.470> in<00:02:57.560> their

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
because people keep on calling in their

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.399 
because people keep on calling in their
attack<00:02:57.950> helicopters<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.049> like<00:03:00.049> right<00:03:00.230> here

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
attack helicopters and like right here

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.710 
attack helicopters and like right here
i'm<00:03:00.560> pretty<00:03:00.980> sure<00:03:01.129> i<00:03:01.159> try<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.459> call<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.849> or<00:03:02.420> no

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
i'm pretty sure i try and call it or no

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.270 
i'm pretty sure i try and call it or no
I<00:03:02.750> get<00:03:02.989> distracted<00:03:03.109> a<00:03:03.590> bit<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:03.859> somebody<00:03:04.220> else

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
I get distracted a bit and somebody else

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.099 
I get distracted a bit and somebody else
immediately<00:03:04.819> calls<00:03:05.060> in<00:03:05.239> their<00:03:05.450> attack

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
immediately calls in their attack

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.500 
immediately calls in their attack
helicopter<00:03:06.799> that's<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.579> pretty<00:03:07.760> annoying<00:03:08.060> part

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
helicopter that's a pretty annoying part

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.589 
helicopter that's a pretty annoying part
of<00:03:08.659> this<00:03:08.810> game<00:03:09.049> that<00:03:09.799> way<00:03:10.489> there's<00:03:11.269> somebody

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
of this game that way there's somebody

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.470 
of this game that way there's somebody
just<00:03:11.750> called<00:03:11.930> in<00:03:12.049> their<00:03:12.170> helicopter<00:03:13.359> that<00:03:14.359> you

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
just called in their helicopter that you

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.149 
just called in their helicopter that you
can<00:03:14.629> only<00:03:14.750> have<00:03:14.959> one<00:03:14.989> helicopter<00:03:15.590> up<00:03:15.980> at<00:03:16.129> a

can only have one helicopter up at a

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.729 
can only have one helicopter up at a
time<00:03:16.430> it<00:03:16.879> really<00:03:17.209> sucks<00:03:17.750> when<00:03:17.930> like<00:03:18.079> I've<00:03:18.500> got

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
time it really sucks when like I've got

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.710 
time it really sucks when like I've got
a<00:03:18.769> chopper<00:03:19.130> gunner<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:19.489> then<00:03:19.639> my<00:03:20.299> teammate

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
a chopper gunner and then my teammate

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.780 
a chopper gunner and then my teammate
calls<00:03:21.380> in<00:03:21.620> his<00:03:21.650> attack<00:03:22.069> helicopter<00:03:22.639> and<00:03:22.730> I

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.849 
never get to call my chopper gunner it
happens<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.799> me<00:03:24.919> so<00:03:25.130> regularly<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:25.910> it<00:03:26.030> ruins

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
happens to me so regularly and it ruins

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.330 
happens to me so regularly and it ruins
quite<00:03:27.859> a<00:03:27.889> few<00:03:28.069> my<00:03:28.190> games<00:03:28.599> but<00:03:29.599> I<00:03:29.900> guess<00:03:30.340> it

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
quite a few my games but I guess it

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.770 
quite a few my games but I guess it
makes<00:03:31.489> it<00:03:31.669> nicer<00:03:31.970> for<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.209> other<00:03:32.329> team<00:03:32.540> so

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
makes it nicer for the other team so

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.990 
makes it nicer for the other team so
they're<00:03:32.930> not<00:03:33.079> getting<00:03:33.440> wrecked<00:03:34.129> by<00:03:34.400> multiple

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
they're not getting wrecked by multiple

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.349 
they're not getting wrecked by multiple
air<00:03:35.329> support<00:03:35.810> at<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:35.989> time<00:03:36.549> and<00:03:37.549> I<00:03:38.060> guess<00:03:38.239> it

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
air support at a time and I guess it

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.849 
air support at a time and I guess it
also<00:03:38.599> encourages<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.260> use<00:03:39.650> other

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
also encourages you to use other

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.140 
also encourages you to use other
killstreaks<00:03:40.400> rather<00:03:40.609> than<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.849> chopper

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
killstreaks rather than the chopper

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.550 
killstreaks rather than the chopper
gunner<00:03:41.329> but<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.629> get<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.870> highest<00:03:41.989> scores<00:03:42.379> i

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
gunner but to get the highest scores i

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.110 
gunner but to get the highest scores i
think<00:03:42.799> the<00:03:43.129> chopper<00:03:43.430> gunner<00:03:43.579> is<00:03:43.699> pretty<00:03:43.970> good

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
think the chopper gunner is pretty good

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.670 
think the chopper gunner is pretty good
so<00:03:44.480> anyways<00:03:45.169> that's<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.379> end<00:03:45.530> of<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.650> game

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
so anyways that's the end of the game

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.479 
so anyways that's the end of the game
guys<00:03:45.980> it's<00:03:46.639> um<00:03:47.180> what<00:03:48.019> is<00:03:48.139> it<00:03:48.260> 36<00:03:48.889> and<00:03:49.069> three<00:03:49.280> I

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510
