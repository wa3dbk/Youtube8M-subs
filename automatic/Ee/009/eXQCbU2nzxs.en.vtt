displaced from the middle I think

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.399 
displaced from the middle I think
Willian<00:01:11.220> will<00:01:11.400> tuck<00:01:11.610> over<00:01:12.080> displacing<00:01:13.080> Oscar

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
been chasing if so long and they have

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.459 
been chasing if so long and they have
let<00:01:59.700> him<00:01:59.790> slip<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.270> as<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.020> can't<00:02:01.229> wait<00:02:01.350> to

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
let him slip and as you can't wait to

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.499 
let him slip and as you can't wait to
see<00:02:01.649> when<00:02:01.829> he's<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> chosen<00:02:02.430> what<00:02:03.360> it's

probably<00:02:03.960> spells<00:02:04.380> for<00:02:05.159> Chelsea<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
probably spells for Chelsea is that the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.089 
probably spells for Chelsea is that the
end<00:02:06.180> for<00:02:07.020> Juan<00:02:07.200> cuadrado<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.740> think<00:02:07.979> that

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
end for Juan cuadrado I think that

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.040 
end for Juan cuadrado I think that
cuadrado<00:02:08.459> will<00:02:08.700> probably<00:02:09.239> have<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.690> leave<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
cuadrado will probably have to leave the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.080 
cuadrado will probably have to leave the
club<00:02:10.259> go<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.739> Ventus<00:02:11.250> hello<00:02:11.640> mate<00:02:11.849> all

carrier um yeah I was just going to tell
you<00:02:18.299> I<00:02:18.330> think<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.810> will<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:18.959> think<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.230> means<00:02:19.349> i

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
you I think it will I think it means i

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.770 
you I think it will I think it means i
think<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.680> Pedro<00:02:20.040> will<00:02:20.610> probably<00:02:21.360> his<00:02:21.599> place

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
think that Pedro will probably his place

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.789 
think that Pedro will probably his place
in<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.930> squad<00:02:22.049> would<00:02:22.200> probably<00:02:22.500> mean<00:02:22.650> that

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
in the squad would probably mean that

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.789 
in the squad would probably mean that
cuadrado<00:02:23.360> loses<00:02:24.360> out<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:25.019> I<00:02:25.290> think<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.650> you

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
cuadrado loses out and I think that you

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.500 
cuadrado loses out and I think that you
Ventus<00:02:26.190> are<00:02:26.310> sniffing<00:02:26.610> around<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:27.090> if<00:02:27.330> that

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
Ventus are sniffing around so if that

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.600 
Ventus are sniffing around so if that
one<00:02:27.780> comes<00:02:27.989> off<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.470> won't<00:02:29.069> be<00:02:29.129> too<00:02:29.220> sad<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.459> see

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
one comes off I won't be too sad to see

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.220 
one comes off I won't be too sad to see
him<00:02:29.670> go<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:30.030> certainly<00:02:30.209> wish<00:02:30.450> him<00:02:30.480> well<00:02:30.599> but

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
think what a difference of signing can

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.410 
think what a difference of signing can
make<00:02:46.349> like<00:02:46.650> I'm<00:02:46.829> one<00:02:47.099> signing<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:48.120> all<00:02:48.239> of<00:02:48.359> a

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
make like I'm one signing and all of a

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.759

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
really think this could be us pushing

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.449 
really think this could be us pushing
them<00:02:51.840> from<00:02:51.989> now<00:02:52.109> on<00:02:52.260> West<00:02:53.010> Brom<00:02:53.220> are<00:02:53.370> in
