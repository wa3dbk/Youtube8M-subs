00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.150
 reaches the fourth generation of lexus gs 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.799
 and it is accompanied by large 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.410
 expectations of achieving a quota in the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.270
 segment of the medium-high range and up 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.710
 it is possible that it finally becomes 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.410
 in a threat to others 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.400
 competitors all of them german bmw 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.400
 audi and mercedes 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.320
 to achieve its goal this sedan comes 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.270
 in two variants one gasoline and another with 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.860
 hybrid propulsion that has a price 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.860
 additional nine thousand five hundred euros 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.470
 Although the price may seem expensive, 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.460
 justifies with the fact that the gs wins 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.460
 so extra power 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.120
 until now a manufacturer and with 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.769
 exception of toyota have achieved that the 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.980
 work between the electric motor and 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.320
 combustion is so perfect 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.120
 visually the gs stands out for its 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.820
 elegance without looking like it 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.860
 boring the front is more marked 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.570
 and seen from the side you can clearly see the 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.860
 flat roof lines that give you a 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.860
 more dynamic appearance 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.580
 The 450h gs is also available in the 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.760
 variant f spot with wheels of 19 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.760
 inches 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.070
 usually 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.050
 the boot has been used even in 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.980
 the hybrid version can fit at least 480 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.980
 liters without problems 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.330
 the cabin stays true to what it is 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.520
 a lexus quality materials with 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.410
 impeccable finishes and instruments 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.770
 perfectly ordered and within reach of 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.770
 the hand 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.500
 as for the power the 250 gs comes 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.600
 with a gasoline engine 6 - liter 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.670
 209 horsepower and traction 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.110
 front the price of the basic version 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.110
 is 45,000 euros 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.230
 the hybrid version gs450h has a 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.290
 3.5- liter engine and an electric motor 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.930
 which offers a combined power of 345 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.090
 horsepower and a consumption of 5.9 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.650
 liters every 100 kilometers something 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.980
 extraordinary for a car this 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.860
 segment with a price over 54 thousand 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.420
 euros is clearly much more expensive without 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.190
 But Toyota trusts that at least 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.710
 six out of ten buyers are 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.840
 will decide for the hybrid version after 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.150
 of all European drivers have 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.980
 growing ecological awareness and its 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.310
 lower fuel consumption is also 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.260
 a good argument 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.760
 it seems that competition in the 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.360
 segment of the medium-high ranges 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.360
 begins to cheer up 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.780
 normal
