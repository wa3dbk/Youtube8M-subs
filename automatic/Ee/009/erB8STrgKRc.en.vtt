00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.299
 I have long asked him to do so 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.040
 finally came the hour let's 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.590
 order July 8, 2014 on the site best 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.260
 Focus 777 appeared deck on sale 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.510
 which was called legs in 3 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.449
 despite its minimalism this deck 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.130
 was sold out in the first two weeks she 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.140
 very popular and u want to buy everything and 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.939
 there were so many people who wanted 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.500
 who wanted this deck 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.540
 appeared again in stock 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.030
 but it was impossible because she 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.219
 was sold not only on that site 9 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.860
 Now I'm in the description I'll throw off the link 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.120
 was sold out everywhere i'm all before 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.550
 heading for 2015 with the hope that 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.129
 blue crown team will present us a deck 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.140
 which is called legs at 4 but k 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.710
 Sorry this did not happen but you do not 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.129
 hurry upset the whole team all 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.270
 blue crown company they gathered and 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:07.020
 took a pack of legs at three took patience and 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:11.670
 I made a deck you imagine it is 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.920
 deck of feet in 3 with such a name here 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.720
 that is, they did like with an iPhone they took 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.470
 standard regular version like this 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.850
 let's say iphone 4 and released iphone 4s 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.659
 but kv-3 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.369
 legs in 3s like this before comparing 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.460
 these two decks let's first 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:35.939
 We delve into the history of the feet in 2012 feet 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.280
 first saw the world this deck immediately 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.000
 gained popularity because it does not 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.250
 it was carping but not as usual 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.340
 rectangle with a white stroke to what 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.350
 find fault here for example the monarch deck 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.299
 She like someone who does not like because 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.579
 your shirt design 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.880
 the other deck is not like there not for 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.630
 cards and fill but for example this deck 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.640
 everyone likes most of it practically 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.920
 everyone buys for herself she is cool 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.330
 she looks cool in cardistry 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.910
 does tricks and everything but then it 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.310
 the deck was sold out and everyone liked 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.740
 And blue right thought and if all 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.070
 I like why you are not happy about it 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:23.460
 I have them on the very next year, we made the deck 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.190
 which is called legs in 2 here I am exactly 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.880
 I'm sure I can tell you that the deck 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.730
 legs in 2 and all subsequent don g3s 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.860
 they are speckled i mean you shirt 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.330
 can you determine the suit card well 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.140
 clear further you can already 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.000
 manipulate 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:46.290
 as if you recognize the light further that we have 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.350
 there we have the feet to the deck this summer 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.780
 She already had two decks is not to be confused on the 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.890
 KV -2 and Knox Mar absolutely two different 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.190
 versions of the cards of the feet of Samar they are shaped like 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.150
 legs in 2 only go in two colors in general 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.220
 unique so bright orange and 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.460
 bright blue very nice colors i'm all 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.680
 I wanted this deck and then we still have 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.760
 A deck was presented which 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:18.840
 called foot black is the same as 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.300
 legs in 3 but apt-2 only this is the place 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:27.360
 yellow black is very beautiful and spectacular 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:32.760
 all output on the next in 2014 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:35.010
 legs in 3 and now we already have legs in 3s i 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.770
 In the description I will throw off the link to peace on 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.620
 review here this is a deck full review 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.270
 there everything is narrated here 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.510
 here we have an inscription 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:49.230
 your card is a deuce of hearts and let's 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.150
 go to the deck of legs vtsts but you are so 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.790
 look at these two decks and say 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.890
 that there is generally no difference between 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:01.950
 they really have it colors in the deck 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:06.870
 feet in 3s colors are much brighter than 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.940
 much richer than at the feet v3i 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.980
 let's we actually see i 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.860
 forgot to say last year that 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.579
 this is a deck starting at 3 feet 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:20.430
 typed not you explain comp card 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:24.300
 they and they print now I'll show you 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.360
 here is an expert playing card company 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.120
 it is generally unknown what very 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.340
 unknown unknown company which 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.629
 started typing cards and she now 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.460
 quality is very, very competitive with 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:41.490
 bow yes here and so this loud 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.740
 said like no one knows and 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.319
 started to stamp such cool cards 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.770
 let's see what we have inside u 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:50.789
 we have the inscription your card is king 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.969
 baptize 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:55.650
 we have it for the focus, and then we 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:59.300
 the cards themselves begin 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:03.479
 these cards are much softer than but apt-3 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:06.629
 understandably to cover us there are no 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.569
 claims all the same by design 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:12.990
 office parties is the same as in the square-3 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:17.099
 only it is richer and brighter it is very 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:20.310
 nice on the eye card here we see 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:23.460
 joker and absolutely like feet 3 ace of spades 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.219
 like at the feet in 3 everything else legs in 3 in 1 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:30.599
 tich them joker we have and this 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:35.039
 very good for tricks shirt we 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:37.139
 we see purple very cool all 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:40.229
 Looks like I don't have to this deck at all 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.879
 claims she is very very cool she 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.370
 very easy to use she 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:48.210
 served like fan manipulation 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.879
 tapes different florish this scoop tricks 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.190
 everything can be done with it but also understandable 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:55.259
 another thing is this one that's very interesting to 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.310
 working card which is not like us 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:06:01.589
 accustomed to the top opens from god and 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.750
 so what else can I really say 

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:07.169
 In fact, it is even a deck now available 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:10.469
 all colors and this is a standard flower stalk 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:12.919
 5 them remember red yellow green 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:15.479
 purple and blue 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:18.900
 the first version was introduced in five 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:22.259
 colors the second version in five colors afterwards 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:25.229
 foot itself mayor two colors orange blue 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:28.979
 black only one color black and 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:30.090
 then legs in 3 in five colors and now legs 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.419
 in 3s 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:36.630
 it is provided to us also in five colors 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:40.320
 standard legs like this guys 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.550
 it was a deck with no different mind 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.419
 from legs to 3 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:49.020
 but inside differ firstly in quality 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:50.810
 in the second they will serve you as a coating 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.470
 much longer than 3 feet this 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.810
 improved coating and 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:57.449
 improved the quality of the cards they 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.370
 will last longer that is such here 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:01.620
