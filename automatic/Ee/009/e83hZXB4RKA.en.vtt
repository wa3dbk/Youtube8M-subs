this<00:00:05.940> is<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.450> Fairweather<00:00:07.049> range<00:00:07.410> in<00:00:07.589> alaska

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
this is the Fairweather range in alaska

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.200 
this is the Fairweather range in alaska
it's<00:00:09.050> 60<00:00:10.050> miles<00:00:10.230> from<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.620> closest<00:00:11.040> town<00:00:11.670> and

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
it's 60 miles from the closest town and

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.410 
it's 60 miles from the closest town and
the<00:00:12.540> only<00:00:12.660> way<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.900> ride<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:13.860> area<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.059> to

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
the only way to ride this area is to

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.550 
the only way to ride this area is to
take<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.440> plane<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.980> set<00:00:17.550> up<00:00:17.730> camp<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.439> you<00:00:19.439> have

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
take a plane in set up camp and you have

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.630 
take a plane in set up camp and you have
to<00:00:19.800> split<00:00:20.279> board<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:21.029> your<00:00:21.150> lines<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:22.640> call

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
to split board to your lines and I call

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.609 
to split board to your lines and I call
them<00:00:23.699> aboard<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.060> solution<00:00:24.600> because<00:00:25.109> without

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
them aboard the solution because without

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.810 
them aboard the solution because without
the<00:00:25.980> solution<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.849> would<00:00:27.500> never<00:00:28.519> be<00:00:29.519> able<00:00:29.640> to

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the solution I would never be able to

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.830 
the solution I would never be able to
achieve<00:00:31.640> what<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:32.669> did<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.329> trip<00:00:33.570> and

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
achieve what we did on this trip and

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.900 
achieve what we did on this trip and
ride<00:00:34.350> lines<00:00:34.680> like<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.219> it's<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.700> it's

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
ride lines like this it's just it's

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.030 
ride lines like this it's just it's
solved<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.390> problem<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.050> allowing<00:00:37.860> us<00:00:38.010> to

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
solved the problem of allowing us to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.340 
solved the problem of allowing us to
hike<00:00:38.430> way<00:00:38.730> further<00:00:39.030> than<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.390> ever<00:00:39.420> imagined

this<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.840> what<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> look<00:01:16.290> for

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.460 

so<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.040> studied<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.030> much<00:01:24.270> defiling<00:01:25.140> camera

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
so I studied it so much defiling camera

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.930 
so I studied it so much defiling camera
thing<00:01:25.710> Miami<00:01:26.130> get<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.180> incredible

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.230 

you<00:01:33.480> see<00:01:33.830> crossing<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:34.950> spine<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:36.860> you<00:01:37.860> know

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
you see crossing the spine is you know

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.790 
you see crossing the spine is you know
pretty<00:01:39.240> abrupt<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.290> harsh<00:01:40.500> transition

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
pretty abrupt and harsh transition

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.220 
pretty abrupt and harsh transition
that's<00:01:41.460> why<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.640> spent<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.210> much<00:01:42.390> time

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
that's why I spent so much time

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.890 
that's why I spent so much time
on<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:45.100> nose<00:01:45.310> of<00:01:45.610> this<00:01:45.760> board<00:01:46.030> entry<00:01:46.630> point

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
on the nose of this board entry point

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.780 
on the nose of this board entry point
when<00:01:47.140> I<00:01:47.170> have<00:01:47.440> directional<00:01:48.070> rocker<00:01:48.370> because

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
when I have directional rocker because

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.360 
when I have directional rocker because
it's<00:01:49.000> really<00:01:49.480> freed<00:01:50.050> up<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.380> tip<00:01:50.620> and<00:01:50.920> it's

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
it's really freed up the tip and it's

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.160 
it's really freed up the tip and it's
way<00:01:51.790> less<00:01:52.060> catchy<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:53.640> allows<00:01:54.900> like<00:01:55.900> no

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
way less catchy and allows like no

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.080 
way less catchy and allows like no
longer<00:01:56.470> worried<00:01:56.770> about<00:01:56.950> get<00:01:57.370> pitched<00:01:57.730> over

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
longer worried about get pitched over

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.780 
longer worried about get pitched over
bars

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.320 

you'll<00:02:04.390> see<00:02:04.690> even<00:02:05.620> in<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.770> most<00:02:06.040> ideal<00:02:06.550> best

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
you'll see even in the most ideal best

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.240 
you'll see even in the most ideal best
condition<00:02:07.780> you<00:02:07.990> ever<00:02:08.110> had<00:02:08.320> you<00:02:08.560> still<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.130> old

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
condition you ever had you still the old

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.820 
condition you ever had you still the old
ice<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.690> need<00:02:10.930> a<00:02:10.960> board<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.350> can<00:02:11.590> handle

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
ice and you need a board that can handle

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.650 
ice and you need a board that can handle
ice<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.670> because<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:13.030> never<00:02:13.150> know<00:02:13.300> when<00:02:13.540> it's

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
ice and because you never know when it's

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.890 
ice and because you never know when it's
going<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.840> come<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:15.610> board<00:02:15.970> that's<00:02:16.720> why

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
going to come and this board that's why

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.690 
going to come and this board that's why
I<00:02:16.930> have<00:02:17.230> magnatraction<00:02:17.830> that's<00:02:18.220> why<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.400> spent

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
I have magnatraction that's why I spent

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.280 
I have magnatraction that's why I spent
so<00:02:18.880> much<00:02:19.030> time

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.259
