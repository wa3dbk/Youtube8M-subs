00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
order to do this we start by breaking

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:21.889 
order to do this we start by breaking
down<00:01:21.060> some<00:01:21.210> chess<00:01:21.479> where<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.690> want<00:01:21.840> the

the internet anyhow the last step is to

detect when a player receives one of
these<00:02:29.790> buttons<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.690> we<00:02:30.810> can<00:02:30.959> check<00:02:31.200> into<00:02:31.650> a

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
these buttons so we can check into a

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.880 
these buttons so we can check into a
combination<00:02:32.250> locks<00:02:32.459> over<00:02:33.410> this<00:02:34.410> is<00:02:34.560> simple

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
combination locks over this is simple

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.680 
combination locks over this is simple
just<00:02:35.070> use<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.790> clear<00:02:36.000> command<00:02:36.329> to<00:02:36.450> only

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
just use the clear command to only

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.449 
just use the clear command to only
target<00:02:37.049> buttons<00:02:37.350> with<00:02:37.530> certain<00:02:37.859> data<00:02:38.070> values

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
target buttons with certain data values

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.690 
target buttons with certain data values
by<00:02:38.850> inputting<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.359> clear<00:02:39.720> at<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.140> 143<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.370> then

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
by inputting a clear at a 143 and then

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.240 
by inputting a clear at a 143 and then
the<00:02:41.820> data<00:02:41.940> value<00:02:42.470> after<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.859> is<00:02:43.980> easy<00:02:44.100> enough

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
the data value after that is easy enough

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.710 
the data value after that is easy enough
to<00:02:44.400> wire<00:02:44.700> up<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.940> outputs<00:02:45.450> from<00:02:45.570> the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
to wire up the outputs from the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.900 
to wire up the outputs from the
comparator<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.410> into<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.280> combination<00:02:47.790> lock

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
comparator and into the combination lock

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.390 
comparator and into the combination lock
i<00:02:48.440> recommend<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.470> designs<00:02:49.859> shown<00:02:50.160> and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
i recommend the designs shown and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.460 
i recommend the designs shown and
