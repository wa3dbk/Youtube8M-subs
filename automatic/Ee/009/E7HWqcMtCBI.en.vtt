00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820
 we have prepared another experiment to see if we can convince people to 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.810
 do something totally out of their control 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.900
 we are going to show a group of guests an information film 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.900
 public on road safety with a shocking end 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.800
 agencies we have seen but we have prepared the movie to see if 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.660
 we can manipulate his behavior the improper use of some images of prisoners 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.739
 subliminals of bananas to the movie 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:26.659
 how many of you 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:30.060
 likewise these moments 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.020
 na fernando montes ovalles struggle in which these are neglecting 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.680
 each organization 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.730
 chore 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.600
 outside 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.360
 the association of Internet users 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.940
 it's nothing of him 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.290
 Of course 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.740
 It was facilities in terms of price quality like gustavo matta fomento 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.280
 after following the movie we asked them to choose 10 results 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.280
 with banana or an apple 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.510
 Pacheta chosen for nothing because without highlighting the table while I was going 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.780
 approaching the acid and banana choose the banana the axis of the apple 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.190
 my first impulse told me to choose the apple but in the end I chose the 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.470
 banana and I have no idea why I chose the banana because I have many 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.810
 families that have less than apples 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.979
 Avatar's success when I saw that everyone else was going to appear in it only 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.119
 I wanted to be different 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.180
 efe 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.780
 chosen the banana because that has to be late knows how to choose the banana is 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.470
 say of the banana I chose the silver before vÃ©lez and the apple because I have a 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.950
 banana in my bag 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.660
 it was time for the concession 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.490
 actually fellowship seven subliminal images of bananas in 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.320
 tape 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.320
 well you'll see fantastic 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.100
 he knew there was something of his criminal in it but he did not get caught 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.189
 the majority of the group chose the plans 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.810
 therefore the use of subliminal images has influenced its 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:15.629
 behavior 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.519
 in men the 50s it was decided that images and sounds or criminals 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.389
 they were so powerful that they should not be used so they were banned but 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:25.579
 which is a subliminal image 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:31.200
 maybe in about 18 months it's such a short image that our brains do not 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:35.469
 will be able to register consciously here is again in a world made 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:36.779
 turn 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:42.299
 very well we facilitate things 3 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:51.759
 but there are legal methods of manipulating people without them perceiving their 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.419
 intentions and can be extremely effective
