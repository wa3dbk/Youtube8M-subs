bubbles such as this but you don't want

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.740 
bubbles such as this but you don't want
to<00:00:49.100> jump<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.309> then<00:00:50.910> fall<00:00:51.180> out<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.390> your<00:00:51.510> car

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
to jump and then fall out of your car

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
to jump and then fall out of your car
and<00:00:52.170> land<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.460> hot<00:00:54.199> flaming<00:00:55.199> ground

and land on the hot flaming ground
section<00:00:56.699> there<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:59.210> you<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.480> jump<00:01:00.840> over

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
section there so you can jump over

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
or jump up and land on it and then just

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.390 
or jump up and land on it and then just
keep<00:01:06.090> driving<00:01:06.689> like<00:01:06.720> right<00:01:07.080> over<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:08.310> I'm

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
keep driving like right over it so I'm

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.109 
keep driving like right over it so I'm
gonna<00:01:08.490> try<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.760> do<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:10.670> you<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:11.850> always

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
gonna try to do that you can always

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.000 
gonna try to do that you can always
start<00:01:12.360> over<00:01:12.510> if<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.170> gets<00:01:13.380> too<00:01:13.680> crazy

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.910 

okay<00:01:16.970> let's<00:01:17.930> pick<00:01:18.080> up<00:01:18.260> where<00:01:18.440> I<00:01:18.470> left<00:01:18.530> off

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
okay let's pick up where I left off

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.300 
okay let's pick up where I left off
since<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:20.330> car<00:01:20.540> was<00:01:20.870> fine<00:01:21.110> sometimes<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:22.070> car

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
since the car was fine sometimes the car

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
since the car was fine sometimes the car
gets<00:01:22.640> blown<00:01:22.850> up<00:01:23.740> Edison<00:01:24.740> is<00:01:25.010> in<00:01:25.940> this<00:01:26.150> example

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
gets blown up Edison is in this example

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.850 
gets blown up Edison is in this example
here<00:01:27.910> and<00:01:28.910> so<00:01:29.150> then<00:01:29.330> you<00:01:29.420> got<00:01:29.600> then<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:30.680> got

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
here and so then you got then you got

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.910 
here and so then you got then you got
car<00:01:31.130> remnants<00:01:31.730> to<00:01:31.910> deal<00:01:32.090> with<00:01:32.410> so<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.970> try<00:01:35.210> to

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
car remnants to deal with so you try to

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.700 
car remnants to deal with so you try to
probably<00:01:36.920> jump<00:01:37.220> onto<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:38.090> first<00:01:38.120> car<00:01:38.720> and

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
probably jump onto the first car and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.640 
probably jump onto the first car and
keep<00:01:39.920> driving<00:01:40.190> that<00:01:40.550> one<00:01:41.020> and<00:01:42.020> then<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.590> one

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
keep driving that one and then that one

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.730 
keep driving that one and then that one
I'm<00:01:43.280> going<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.520> try<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.670> jump<00:01:44.030> over<00:01:44.740> the

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
I'm going to try to jump over the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.160 
I'm going to try to jump over the
remnants<00:01:46.370> that<00:01:46.400> are<00:01:46.670> left<00:01:46.850> over<00:01:47.000> oh<00:01:49.780> whoa<00:01:51.880> whoa

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170

remnants that are left over oh whoa whoa
okay<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.890> little<00:01:55.670> back<00:01:55.820> flip<00:01:56.150> there<00:01:56.420> this<00:01:56.990> car

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
okay a little back flip there this car

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.570 
okay a little back flip there this car
is<00:01:57.440> still<00:01:57.620> in<00:01:57.680> good<00:01:57.860> shape<00:01:58.040> though<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:58.520> I'm

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
is still in good shape though so I'm

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.410 
is still in good shape though so I'm
gonna<00:01:58.670> keep<00:01:58.940> driving<00:01:59.120> it

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.540 

remnants<00:02:04.240> hold<00:02:05.240> my<00:02:05.480> business<00:02:06.070> actually<00:02:07.070> used

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
remnants hold my business actually used

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:15.910 
remnants hold my business actually used
the<00:02:09.280> jumping<00:02:10.280> mechanism<00:02:10.520> to<00:02:14.110> try<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.170> crash<00:02:15.590> it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
the jumping mechanism to try to crash it

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.820 
the jumping mechanism to try to crash it
but<00:02:16.130> it<00:02:16.250> broke<00:02:16.610> off<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:18.260> I'm<00:02:18.590> just<00:02:18.710> gonna

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
but it broke off so I'm just gonna

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.090 
but it broke off so I'm just gonna
restart<00:02:19.810> too<00:02:20.810> much<00:02:20.990> chaos<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:21.860> gives<00:02:22.010> you

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
restart too much chaos so that gives you

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.590 
restart too much chaos so that gives you
an<00:02:22.160> idea<00:02:22.280> what<00:02:22.580> kind<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.850> chaos<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.420> can

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
an idea what kind of chaos you can

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.640 
an idea what kind of chaos you can
expect<00:02:23.930> but<00:02:24.400> now

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.460 

we're<00:02:27.890> gonna<00:02:28.010> focus<00:02:28.280> on<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.730> road<00:02:29.290> which<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.319> a

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
we're gonna focus on the road which is a

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.920 
we're gonna focus on the road which is a
good<00:02:30.650> idea<00:02:30.680> whether<00:02:31.190> you're<00:02:31.370> driving<00:02:31.930> an

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
good idea whether you're driving an

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.949 
good idea whether you're driving an
animated<00:02:33.470> car<00:02:33.709> or<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.040> real<00:02:34.280> car<00:02:34.959> especially

jumped<00:06:10.590> over<00:06:10.710> a<00:06:10.920> bomb<00:06:11.190> the<00:06:12.000> bubbles<00:06:12.420> could<00:06:12.780> set

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
jumped over a bomb the bubbles could set

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.030 
jumped over a bomb the bubbles could set
off<00:06:13.080> the<00:06:13.410> bomb
