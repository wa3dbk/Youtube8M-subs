as<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.549> Joker

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
as the Joker

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.880 
as the Joker
not<00:02:16.630> sure<00:02:16.780> they<00:02:16.930> could<00:02:16.990> well<00:02:17.410> he's<00:02:17.500> much<00:02:17.740> more

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
not sure they could well he's much more

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.470 
not sure they could well he's much more
of<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.010> stolid<00:02:18.550> for<00:02:18.730> he's<00:02:18.849> a<00:02:18.880> much<00:02:19.120> more<00:02:19.300> solid

Ledger was this yeah lipper II yeah and
also<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:23.140> think<00:02:23.349> there<00:02:23.620> was<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.739> sense<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.099> the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
also I think there was a sense that the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.880 
also I think there was a sense that the
Joker<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.510> Batman<00:02:25.840> were<00:02:26.050> playing<00:02:26.590> kind

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
Bane is much more of a sumo contest a

it<00:02:54.970> occasionally<00:02:55.510> what<00:02:55.690> he<00:02:55.840> was<00:02:55.989> saying<00:02:56.230> but<00:02:56.470> I

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
it occasionally what he was saying but I

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.860 
it occasionally what he was saying but I

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870

I'll<00:02:58.959> just<00:02:59.140> expose<00:02:59.500> see<00:02:59.680> I<00:03:02.250> think<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.340> other

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
I'll just expose see I think the other

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.490 
I'll just expose see I think the other
thing<00:03:03.549> is<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:03.880> it's<00:03:04.569> not<00:03:04.780> really<00:03:05.080> I<00:03:05.260> mean<00:03:05.290> is

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
thing is that it's not really I mean is

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.710 
thing is that it's not really I mean is
it<00:03:05.799> is<00:03:06.010> performance<00:03:06.549> but<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:07.090> could<00:03:07.269> almost<00:03:07.450> be

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
it is performance but it could almost be

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.720 
it is performance but it could almost be
anyone<00:03:08.230> it<00:03:08.440> could<00:03:08.620> be<00:03:08.769> sort<00:03:09.220> of<00:03:09.370> rent<00:03:09.580> a

anyone it could be sort of rent a
wrestler<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.840> doesn't<00:03:11.140> have<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.410> be<00:03:11.440> Tom<00:03:11.680> Hardy

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
wrestler it doesn't have to be Tom Hardy

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.170 
wrestler it doesn't have to be Tom Hardy
I<00:03:11.980> mean<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.190> might<00:03:12.310> have<00:03:12.489> been<00:03:12.610> one<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.970> two

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
I mean it might have been one of you two

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.330 
I mean it might have been one of you two
I<00:03:13.209> don't<00:03:13.450> know<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:14.170> know<00:03:14.319> it's<00:03:14.650> possible<00:03:15.100> I

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
I don't know you know it's possible I

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.240 
I don't know you know it's possible I
body<00:03:15.760> told<00:03:16.030> him<00:03:16.239> probably<00:03:16.560> yeah<00:03:17.560> I<00:03:17.830> did

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
body told him probably yeah I did

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.070 
body told him probably yeah I did
suspect<00:03:18.459> but<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.209> think<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.480> whole<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:19.840> mean<00:03:19.989> I

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
suspect but I think the whole I mean I

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.900 
suspect but I think the whole I mean I
had<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.260> sort<00:03:20.769> of<00:03:20.799> basic<00:03:21.280> problem<00:03:21.670> with<00:03:21.790> this

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
had a sort of basic problem with this

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.630 
had a sort of basic problem with this
sort<00:03:22.150> of<00:03:22.239> i<00:03:22.560> know<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.709> j<00:03:23.890> who<00:03:24.070> was<00:03:24.220> talking<00:03:24.519> to

sort of i know the j who was talking to

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.009 
sort of i know the j who was talking to
my<00:03:24.820> project<00:03:25.000> take<00:03:25.209> him<00:03:25.329> terribly<00:03:25.570> seriously

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
my project take him terribly seriously

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.840 
my project take him terribly seriously
but<00:03:26.440> Lisa<00:03:26.620> did<00:03:26.890> sort<00:03:27.100> of<00:03:27.190> have<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.400> bit<00:03:27.640> of<00:03:27.670> a

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
but Lisa did sort of have a bit of a

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.099 
but Lisa did sort of have a bit of a
giggle<00:03:28.150> this<00:03:29.079> film<00:03:29.320> is<00:03:29.410> just<00:03:29.890> so<00:03:31.109> unbelievably

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109

giggle this film is just so unbelievably
serious<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:33.100> think<00:03:33.160> that<00:03:33.370> doesn't<00:03:33.790> make

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
serious and I think that doesn't make

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.490 
serious and I think that doesn't make
you<00:03:33.970> sort<00:03:34.239> of<00:03:34.329> take<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.720> less<00:03:34.870> seriously<00:03:35.320> in<00:03:35.410> a

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
you sort of take it less seriously in a

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.750 
you sort of take it less seriously in a
family<00:03:35.739> kind<00:03:35.859> of<00:03:35.980> way<00:03:36.070> so<00:03:36.340> anything<00:03:36.609> that's

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
family kind of way so anything that's

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.640 
family kind of way so anything that's
going<00:03:37.090> to<00:03:37.180> make<00:03:37.390> you<00:03:37.660> laugh<00:03:37.900> like<00:03:38.170> tom<00:03:38.410> conti

i think there's a couple of things need
to<00:04:11.739> be<00:04:11.799> said<00:04:11.859> one<00:04:12.850> is<00:04:13.000> that<00:04:13.150> your<00:04:13.780> piece<00:04:14.019> did

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
to be said one is that your piece did

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
not have any spoilers in it I mean I

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.219 
not have any spoilers in it I mean I
don't<00:04:16.359> know<00:04:16.419> whether<00:04:16.539> there's<00:04:16.720> any<00:04:16.930> point<00:04:17.079> of

me saying it anymore but it didn't and I

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.270 
me saying it anymore but it didn't and I
sometimes<00:04:20.680> worry<00:04:21.220> that<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.850> spoiler<00:04:22.600> charge

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
sometimes worry that the spoiler charge

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.010 
sometimes worry that the spoiler charge
has<00:04:24.280> morphed<00:04:24.820> in<00:04:25.030> recent<00:04:25.330> years<00:04:25.360> from<00:04:25.780> being

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
to being an all-purpose act of fanboy

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.280 
to being an all-purpose act of fanboy
aggression<00:04:34.370> which<00:04:34.940> can<00:04:35.180> be<00:04:35.300> sprayed<00:04:35.750> at<00:04:36.050> any

mention something that happens in the
movie<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:40.759> I<00:04:41.539> suspect<00:04:41.810> that<00:04:42.199> what's<00:04:42.470> being

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
movie and I suspect that what's being

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.730 
movie and I suspect that what's being
allegedly<00:04:43.580> spoiled<00:04:44.150> isn't<00:04:44.419> really<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:45.500> plot

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
allegedly spoiled isn't really the plot

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.890 
allegedly spoiled isn't really the plot
but<00:04:45.979> it's<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.280> fans<00:04:46.580> sense<00:04:47.150> of<00:04:47.270> ownership<00:04:47.479> of

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
but it's the fans sense of ownership of

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.020 
but it's the fans sense of ownership of
the<00:04:48.050> brand<00:04:48.350> because<00:04:49.070> they<00:04:49.220> they've<00:04:49.910> been

the brand because they they've been

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.550 
the brand because they they've been
looking<00:04:50.240> forward<00:04:50.449> to<00:04:50.570> it<00:04:50.660> for<00:04:51.169> such<00:04:51.440> a<00:04:51.470> long
