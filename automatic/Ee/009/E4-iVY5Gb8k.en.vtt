00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
video I'm going to show you a couple

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.650 
video I'm going to show you a couple
quick<00:00:25.920> exercises<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.820> are<00:00:26.880> very<00:00:27.060> effective

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
quick exercises that are very effective

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.640 
quick exercises that are very effective
at<00:00:27.930> targeting<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.890> upper<00:00:29.369> chest<00:00:30.230> first<00:00:31.230> my

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
at targeting that upper chest first my

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.979 
at targeting that upper chest first my
favorite<00:00:32.040> upper<00:00:32.700> chest<00:00:32.969> exercise<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.840> all

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
favorite upper chest exercise we all

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.600 
favorite upper chest exercise we all
know<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> upper<00:00:34.770> chest<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.160> slightly

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
know that the upper chest is slightly

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.250 
know that the upper chest is slightly
different<00:00:36.090> than<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.510> rest<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.840> your<00:00:36.989> chest

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
different than the rest of your chest

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.220 
different than the rest of your chest
because<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.309> helps<00:00:38.610> contribute<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.329> shoulder

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
because it helps contribute in shoulder

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.549 
because it helps contribute in shoulder
flexion<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.370> by<00:00:41.820> doing<00:00:41.879> incline<00:00:42.719> exercises

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
flexion so by doing incline exercises

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.860 
flexion so by doing incline exercises
you're<00:00:43.950> more<00:00:44.219> effectively<00:00:45.000> able<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.600> target

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
you're more effectively able to target

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.709 
you're more effectively able to target
the<00:00:46.079> upper<00:00:46.350> chest<00:00:46.800> however<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.520> find<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the upper chest however I find that the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.540 
the upper chest however I find that the
low<00:00:48.930> incline<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.590> better<00:00:49.800> than<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> normal

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
low incline is better than the normal

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.180 
low incline is better than the normal
incline<00:00:50.910> why<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.809> higher<00:00:52.079> incline<00:00:52.590> your

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
incline why on that higher incline your

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.880 
incline why on that higher incline your
anterior<00:00:53.760> deltoid<00:00:54.420> takes<00:00:55.079> over<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.739> by

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
anterior deltoid takes over so by

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.470 
anterior deltoid takes over so by
setting<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.820> lowest<00:00:57.059> possible

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
setting it on the lowest possible

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.889 
setting it on the lowest possible
incline<00:00:58.440> you'll<00:00:59.370> get<00:00:59.640> better<00:01:00.120> stimulation

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
incline you'll get better stimulation

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.590 
incline you'll get better stimulation
from<00:01:01.590> your<00:01:01.739> upper<00:01:02.070> chest<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.969> instead<00:01:03.539> of

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
from your upper chest so instead of

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.630 
from your upper chest so instead of
using<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.170> traditional<00:01:04.920> incline<00:01:05.400> bench

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
using that traditional incline bench

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.670 
using that traditional incline bench
press<00:01:05.790> they<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> gym<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.840> set<00:01:07.470> my<00:01:07.650> own

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
press they have in the gym I set my own

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.280 
press they have in the gym I set my own
up<00:01:08.130> inside<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.270> rack<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.900> lowest

up inside of a rack on the lowest

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.469 
up inside of a rack on the lowest
setting<00:01:10.500> next<00:01:11.310> up<00:01:11.490> let's<00:01:11.700> say<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.450> not

power rack in your gym well you could do

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.120 
power rack in your gym well you could do
the<00:01:17.759> low<00:01:18.060> incline<00:01:18.750> dumbbell<00:01:19.170> press<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.920> also

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the low incline dumbbell press it's also

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.429 
the low incline dumbbell press it's also
very<00:01:20.580> effective<00:01:21.270> set<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> lowest

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
very effective set it on the lowest

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.350 
very effective set it on the lowest

order to target the upper chest this is
one<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> exercises<00:01:31.860> I'll<00:01:31.950> tend<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.340> do

one of the exercises I'll tend to do

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.990 
one of the exercises I'll tend to do
these<00:01:32.790> days<00:01:33.150> at<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:34.170> end<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:35.100> hypertrophy

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.330 
these days at the end of a hypertrophy
chest<00:01:36.479> training<00:01:36.930> session<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.470> I'll<00:01:38.070> tend<00:01:38.280> to

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
chest training session and I'll tend to

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.179 
chest training session and I'll tend to
do<00:01:38.490> 12<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.090> 15<00:01:39.420> repetitions<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:40.170> course<00:01:40.799> we<00:01:40.979> got

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
do 12 to 15 repetitions of course we got

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.030 
do 12 to 15 repetitions of course we got
to<00:01:41.340> talk<00:01:41.549> about<00:01:41.579> chest<00:01:42.450> fly's<00:01:43.040> horizontal

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
to talk about chest fly's horizontal

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.550 
to talk about chest fly's horizontal
adduction<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:45.030> very<00:01:45.509> important<00:01:46.079> when<00:01:46.530> it

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
adduction is very important when it

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.870 
adduction is very important when it
comes<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.920> chest<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.369> specific
