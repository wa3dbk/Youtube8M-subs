 let's forget and we are in lenovo stand 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.240

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.470
 contact with the new range of tablets 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.200

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.339
 different sizes we have one of 10 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.859
 inches and one of 8 we are going to analyze 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.929
 right now the 8-inch we're going to 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.070
 talk about the law no good tap 2 to 8 that 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:23.650
 as its size indicates it has a screen 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.449
 8-inch speaker system is 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.830
 placed on the front and this stops 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.300
 get superior quality thanks to 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.759
 receive the direct sound to our 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.740
 ears also has technology 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.990
 dolby plus that plays every sound 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.070
 with great precision and fidelity giving 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.810
 a feeling of its range 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.710
 to the dimensions of this tablet are from 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.050
 210 x 125 x 89 millimeters with a weight of 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.650
 330 grams 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.050
 remember that there will be a version 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.850
 available with double sim cards and 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.380
 lte connectivity in addition to functions 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.390
 telephone 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.560
 the screen is composed of a panel 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.090
 ips with resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.130
 getting about 189 points per inch 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.620
 an amount that is not bad for 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.880
 this screen size the front is 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.060
 occupied by the screen in more or less 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.830
 71% of the surface the quality of 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.510
 screen is quite good and offers a 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.040
 quality more than acceptable with 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.040
 colors well represented and that 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.750
 they make a lot of the 99 dollars more or less 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.240
 that will go on sale we think 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.320
 truly a cool processor 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.140
 that has been chosen for this supposed 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.840
 basic range of tablet is a mediatek emt 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.720
 816 one of four cores cuts to 53 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.240
 running 13 and to hertz and with the 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.130
 760 dual-core suitcase that already 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.120
 we found in his older sister and 64 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.550
 bits 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.720
 the ram stays in a giga that will have to 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.290
 see how it works with the layer of 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.150
 personalization of lenovo 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.070
 the overall performance is going to be quite 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.260
 good and well above the previous 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.180
 processors determines used tec 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.370
 by the company as for example the 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.330
 first lenovo yoga or having the table 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.070
 previous 1 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.900
 the battery surprises for its contents 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.400
 hundred thousand amps that can 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.020
 get a good autonomy having 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.590
 consider the efficient processor already 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.929
 less frequently than that of tab 2 to 10 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.939
 the internal memory is 16 gigs and is 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.170
 expandable by micro sd up to 32 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.030
 gigas how many 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.880
 According to Lenovo, this tablet has to be 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.470
 launch with version 444 but we have 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.020
 could check here at the stand and 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.880
 has andres 50 so already 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.530
 we have the latest version of android in 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.940
 the tablet and it's not going to be any problem 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.100
 when waiting for later updates 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.540
 as always the blower of the company 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.490
 It is also present and as already 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.810
 we comment on contacts to 10 it's not very 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.420
 aggressive and offers applications of 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.250
 utility that are already common the camera 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.740
 5 megapixel rear and quality 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.110
 offered is not a big deal but we could 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.340
 get out of some occasional trouble for the 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.170
 front camera is not very 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.460
 interesting because it 's a 2 sensor 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.260
 megapixels that is acceptable for 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.760
 make video calls as it is already 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.410
 usual we have the most connections 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.460
 common in terms of connectivity as 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.580
 802.11 wifi n bluetooth 4.0 gps and 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.020
 connection produces type 2.0 I think in 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.600
 definitively we could have a very good 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.710
 buy for everything it offers and taking 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.330
 consider the price at which you are going to put 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.550
 in the sale that supposedly part of 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.640
 99 euros we believe that for the version 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.440
 wifi and before taxes we also have 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.410
 an lte version with double card without 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.700
 that has telephone functions or if we 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.900
 Interested in carrying a great device 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.610
 behind with connectivity at all times 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.140
