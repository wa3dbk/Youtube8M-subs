00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
- better - the purple in the blue and

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.660 
- better - the purple in the blue and
where<00:02:09.600> it<00:02:10.110> had<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.500> line<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.520> demarcation

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
where it had that line of demarcation

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.809 
where it had that line of demarcation
right<00:02:12.330> here<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:13.530> turned<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.340> was<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.459> kind<00:02:14.730> of

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
right here it turned it was a kind of

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.280 
right here it turned it was a kind of
yellowish<00:02:15.180> color<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.600> didn't<00:02:15.840> get<00:02:15.959> all<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.200> way

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
yellowish color I didn't get all the way

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.320 
yellowish color I didn't get all the way
like<00:02:16.530> platinum<00:02:16.950> blonde<00:02:17.370> because<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.209> yellow

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
like platinum blonde because the yellow

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.850 
like platinum blonde because the yellow
and<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.660> blue<00:02:18.840> make<00:02:19.140> us<00:02:19.290> agree

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
and the blue make us agree

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.710 
and the blue make us agree
