00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.980 
let's see if I can zoom in backside
chopped<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.450> zoom<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:32.780> like<00:02:32.960> this<00:02:33.140> maybe<00:02:37.990> well

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
chopped to zoom it like this maybe well

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.540 
chopped to zoom it like this maybe well
I<00:02:39.050> can't<00:02:39.260> really<00:02:39.350> zoom<00:02:39.710> in<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:39.950> very<00:02:40.160> well<00:02:40.370> on

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
I can't really zoom in it very well on

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.930 
I can't really zoom in it very well on
this<00:02:41.050> but<00:02:42.050> it's<00:02:42.170> both<00:02:42.590> ways<00:02:42.860> as<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.520> can<00:02:43.670> see

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
this but it's both ways as you can see

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.840 
this but it's both ways as you can see
and<00:02:44.120> it<00:02:44.240> will<00:02:44.360> plug<00:02:44.570> in<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.810> bottom<00:02:45.520> all<00:02:46.520> right

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
and it will plug in the bottom all right

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.210 
and it will plug in the bottom all right
there<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:49.370> then<00:02:49.490> comes<00:02:50.060> with<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.690> case

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
there and then comes with the case

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.260 
there and then comes with the case
actually<00:02:52.220> comes<00:02:52.400> in<00:02:52.520> a<00:02:52.580> case<00:02:52.790> with<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.150> new

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.110 
actually comes in a case with the new
headphones<00:02:53.660> so<00:02:54.430> that's<00:02:55.430> kind<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:55.670> neat<00:02:55.880> I
