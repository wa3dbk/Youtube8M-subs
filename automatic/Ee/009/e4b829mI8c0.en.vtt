ceiling<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:52.770> actually<00:02:53.099> quite<00:02:53.580> big<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.880> me<00:02:53.970> it's

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
ceiling is actually quite big of me it's

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.390 
ceiling is actually quite big of me it's
quite<00:02:54.209> wide<00:02:54.630> but<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.470> difficulty<00:02:56.130> with<00:02:56.280> this

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
quite wide but the difficulty with this

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.090 
quite wide but the difficulty with this
car<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:56.850> that<00:02:56.880> it's<00:02:57.360> fairly<00:02:57.750> shallow<00:02:58.200> so

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
car is that it's fairly shallow so

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.290 
car is that it's fairly shallow so
that's<00:02:59.280> going<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.459> cause<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.819> problem<00:02:59.970> putting

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
that's going to cause a problem putting

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.940 
that's going to cause a problem putting
your<00:03:00.480> tank<00:03:00.720> in<00:03:00.900> there<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.290> mean<00:03:01.530> if<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.709> put<00:03:01.860> it

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
your tank in there I mean if you put it

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.350 
your tank in there I mean if you put it
there<00:03:02.160> it's<00:03:02.520> going<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.730> take<00:03:02.940> up<00:03:03.060> all<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.239> room

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
there it's going to take up all the room

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.840 
there it's going to take up all the room
it's<00:03:03.630> not<00:03:03.750> going<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.930> work<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.160> think<00:03:05.370> the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
it's not going to work so I think the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.540 
it's not going to work so I think the
thing<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.060> do<00:03:06.330> is<00:03:06.569> to<00:03:07.290> look<00:03:07.410> in<00:03:07.590> here<00:03:07.920> where<00:03:08.400> the

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
thing to do is to look in here where the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.030 
thing to do is to look in here where the
spare<00:03:08.819> wheel<00:03:09.120> is<00:03:09.390> get<00:03:09.959> rid<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.440> put<00:03:10.920> the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
spare wheel is get rid of that put the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.160 
spare wheel is get rid of that put the
doughnut<00:03:11.489> tank<00:03:11.760> in<00:03:11.940> there<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.989> will

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
doughnut tank in there and that will

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.030 
doughnut tank in there and that will
