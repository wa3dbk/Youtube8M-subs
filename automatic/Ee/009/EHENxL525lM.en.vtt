00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
this is the free motion quilting

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.579 
this is the free motion quilting
tutorial<00:00:02.310> for<00:00:02.460> Aztec<00:00:02.939> path<00:00:03.259> this<00:00:04.259> design<00:00:04.529> is

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
tutorial for Aztec path this design is

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.230 
tutorial for Aztec path this design is
stitched<00:00:04.920> by<00:00:05.100> first<00:00:05.370> stitching<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:05.940> straight

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
stitched by first stitching a straight

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.210 
stitched by first stitching a straight
line<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.839> then<00:00:07.290> off<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.919> straight<00:00:08.189> line

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
line and then off that straight line

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.060 
line and then off that straight line
you're<00:00:08.580> going<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.970> stitch<00:00:09.240> these<00:00:10.070> cross

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
you're going to stitch these cross

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.879 
you're going to stitch these cross
shapes<00:00:11.429> are<00:00:11.610> plus<00:00:11.849> sign<00:00:12.120> shapes<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.960> so<00:00:13.860> I

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
shapes are plus sign shapes and so I

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.709 
shapes are plus sign shapes and so I
mean<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.130> stitch<00:00:14.340> one<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.759> one<00:00:14.910> direction<00:00:15.089> and

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
mean a stitch one in one direction and

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.590 
mean a stitch one in one direction and
then<00:00:15.990> go<00:00:16.260> back<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.529> my<00:00:16.859> straight<00:00:17.220> line<00:00:17.600> head

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
then go back to my straight line head

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.650 
then go back to my straight line head
down<00:00:18.900> just<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.350> bit<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.920> stitch<00:00:20.850> off<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
down just a bit and stitch off in the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.429 
down just a bit and stitch off in the
opposite<00:00:22.170> direction<00:00:23.720> when<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> was<00:00:24.990> quilting

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
opposite direction when I was quilting

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.810 
opposite direction when I was quilting
this<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.769> was<00:00:25.890> thinking<00:00:26.250> about<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.789> other

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
this I was thinking about the other

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.359 
this I was thinking about the other
design<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:28.080> I've<00:00:28.289> created<00:00:28.500> called<00:00:29.010> echo

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
design that I've created called echo

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.959 
design that I've created called echo
crosses<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.740> crosses<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.070> plus<00:00:32.340> sign<00:00:32.610> shapes

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
crosses and crosses and plus sign shapes

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.130 
crosses and crosses and plus sign shapes
are<00:00:33.210> really<00:00:33.570> something<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.930> haven't

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
are really something that I haven't

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.110 
are really something that I haven't
played<00:00:34.410> with<00:00:34.559> very<00:00:34.920> much<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> project<00:00:35.910> I

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
played with very much on the project I

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.090 
played with very much on the project I
was<00:00:36.360> wanting<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.719> experiment<00:00:37.290> with<00:00:37.559> this

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
was wanting to experiment with this

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.760 
was wanting to experiment with this
design<00:00:38.520> type<00:00:38.790> because<00:00:39.149> straight<00:00:40.140> line<00:00:40.379> and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
design type because straight line and

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.910 
design type because straight line and
sharp<00:00:41.219> angle<00:00:41.670> designs<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.690> one<00:00:42.930> are

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
sharp angle designs like this one are

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.490 
sharp angle designs like this one are
very<00:00:44.250> interesting<00:00:44.820> they<00:00:45.170> attract<00:00:46.170> your<00:00:46.320> own

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
very interesting they attract your own

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.830 
very interesting they attract your own
in<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.829> very<00:00:47.039> interesting<00:00:47.340> way<00:00:47.610> because<00:00:48.450> so

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
in a very interesting way because so

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.139 
in a very interesting way because so
many<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> lines<00:00:49.410> are<00:00:49.680> straight<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
many of the lines are straight and the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.110 
many of the lines are straight and the
angles<00:00:51.539> are<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:51.899> sharp<00:00:52.399> they<00:00:53.399> do<00:00:53.460> recede<00:00:54.090> a

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
angles are so sharp they do recede a

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.410 
angles are so sharp they do recede a
little<00:00:54.629> bit<00:00:54.750> more<00:00:54.960> into<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> background<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
little bit more into the background and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.939 
little bit more into the background and
flatten<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> quilt<00:00:57.870> out<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.320> bit<00:00:58.559> more<00:00:58.590> it

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
flatten the quilt out a bit more it

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.520 
flatten the quilt out a bit more it
seems<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.719> they<00:01:00.719> attract<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.199> lot<00:01:01.379> less

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
seems and they attract a lot less

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.009 
seems and they attract a lot less
attention<00:01:01.920> than<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.789> flowing<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.600> curving

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
attention than the flowing and curving

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.410 
attention than the flowing and curving
shapes<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:05.070> they<00:01:05.280> do<00:01:05.339> hold<00:01:05.729> their<00:01:05.909> own<00:01:05.939> and

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
shapes but they do hold their own and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.120 
shapes but they do hold their own and
they're<00:01:06.540> very<00:01:06.570> interesting<00:01:07.530> addition<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
they're very interesting addition to a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.859 
they're very interesting addition to a
quilt<00:01:08.430> particularly<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.479> put<00:01:09.689> them

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
quilt particularly if you put them

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.429 
quilt particularly if you put them
around<00:01:10.010> some<00:01:11.010> very<00:01:11.189> curving<00:01:11.670> shapes<00:01:12.320> so<00:01:13.320> now

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
around some very curving shapes so now

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.109 
around some very curving shapes so now
the<00:01:13.500> next<00:01:13.650> step<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.310> design<00:01:14.670> once<00:01:14.939> you

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
the next step of this design once you

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.249 
the next step of this design once you
finish<00:01:15.479> your<00:01:16.229> line<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:17.540> crosses<00:01:18.540> more<00:01:19.049> or<00:01:19.140> less

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
finish your line of crosses more or less

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.649 
finish your line of crosses more or less
then<00:01:20.040> you're<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.520> travel<00:01:21.000> stitch<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
then you're going to travel stitch and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.560 
then you're going to travel stitch and
echo<00:01:22.439> around<00:01:22.860> them<00:01:23.159> I'm<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.580> echo<00:01:24.060> stitching

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
echo around them I'm just echo stitching

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.770 
echo around them I'm just echo stitching
all<00:01:24.780> around<00:01:25.290> them<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:25.950> side<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:27.630> can

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
all around them on one side and you can

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.210 
all around them on one side and you can
see<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.500> kind<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.799> building

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
see that this is just kind of building

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.760 
see that this is just kind of building
out<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.820> texture<00:01:30.450> whatever<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.350> set<00:01:31.590> up

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
out that texture whatever you set up

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.490 
out that texture whatever you set up
with<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.400> line<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.990> expand

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
with that line it's just going to expand

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.120 
with that line it's just going to expand
it<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.890> help<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.579> fill<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.860> show<00:01:37.860> off<00:01:38.100> that

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
it and help it to fill and show off that

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.420 
it and help it to fill and show off that
much<00:01:38.670> more<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.299> called<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.409> design<00:01:40.799> Aztec

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
much more I called this design Aztec

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.870 
much more I called this design Aztec
path<00:01:41.759> because<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:43.079> really<00:01:43.710> reminded<00:01:44.490> me<00:01:44.520> of

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
path because it really reminded me of

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.510 
path because it really reminded me of
some<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> Aztec<00:01:46.320> designs<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.310> see

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
some of the Aztec designs that you see

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.330 
some of the Aztec designs that you see
in<00:01:47.700> South<00:01:47.939> America<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.960> are<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.979> know<00:01:50.070> quite

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
in South America that are you know quite

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.950 
in South America that are you know quite
they<00:01:50.939> start<00:01:51.180> with<00:01:51.299> something<00:01:51.450> very<00:01:51.689> very

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
they start with something very very

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.859 
they start with something very very
simple<00:01:52.200> very<00:01:52.320> simple<00:01:52.740> set<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.130> lines<00:01:53.659> but<00:01:54.659> then

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
simple very simple set of lines but then

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.959 
simple very simple set of lines but then
they<00:01:55.049> echo<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:56.159> know<00:01:56.250> almost<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.759> them

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
they echo it you know almost like them

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.569 
they echo it you know almost like them
the<00:01:57.299> molas<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.140> see<00:01:58.530> from<00:01:58.860> South<00:01:59.219> America

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
the molas that I see from South America

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.969 
the molas that I see from South America
very<00:02:00.030> very<00:02:00.180> interesting<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.960> whenever<00:02:01.770> I

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
very very interesting and whenever I

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.800 
very very interesting and whenever I
finished<00:02:02.460> quilting<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.149> design<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.659> that's

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
finished quilting this design and that's

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.410 
finished quilting this design and that's
what<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.049> saw<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.790> really<00:02:05.790> think<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.270> a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
what I saw I really think that this is a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.900 
what I saw I really think that this is a
good<00:02:06.780> design<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:07.320> put<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.039> sashing<00:02:08.729> of

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
good design just put in the sashing of

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.540 
good design just put in the sashing of
your<00:02:09.119> quilt<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:10.590> slashing<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.220> kind<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.489> a

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
your quilt and slashing is kind of a

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.590 
your quilt and slashing is kind of a
narrow<00:02:11.819> area

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
narrow area

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.420 
narrow area
and<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:13.110> lot<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.440> cultures<00:02:13.860> will<00:02:14.010> leave<00:02:14.190> that

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
and a lot of cultures will leave that

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.660 
and a lot of cultures will leave that
area<00:02:14.460> Boing<00:02:15.090> but<00:02:15.870> i<00:02:16.170> think<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:16.950> design<00:02:17.400> would

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
area Boing but i think this design would

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.610 
area Boing but i think this design would
fit<00:02:17.940> wonderfully<00:02:18.510> down<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.200> middle<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.530> a

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
fit wonderfully down the middle of a

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.880 
fit wonderfully down the middle of a
sashing<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:20.640> would<00:02:20.820> add<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> nice<00:02:21.450> bit<00:02:21.810> of

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
sashing it would add a nice bit of

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.070 
sashing it would add a nice bit of
rather<00:02:22.890> flat<00:02:23.250> texture<00:02:23.880> but<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.960> would<00:02:25.050> also

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
rather flat texture but it would also

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.230 
rather flat texture but it would also
add<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.010> little<00:02:26.220> bit<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.430> interest<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:26.970> an<00:02:27.060> area

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
add a little bit of interest in an area

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.870 
add a little bit of interest in an area
that<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.480> lot<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.750> people<00:02:27.960> leave<00:02:28.290> blank<00:02:28.880> here

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
that a lot of people leave blank here

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.610 
that a lot of people leave blank here
you<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.150> see<00:02:30.330> I've<00:02:30.480> kind<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.780> cut<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.380> very

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
you can see I've kind of cut to the very

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.030 
you can see I've kind of cut to the very
end<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.250> I've<00:02:32.520> simply<00:02:33.450> echo<00:02:33.690> quilted<00:02:34.350> that

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
end and I've simply echo quilted that

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.100 
end and I've simply echo quilted that
line<00:02:35.310> back<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.090> forth<00:02:36.330> over<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.870> over<00:02:36.960> and

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
line back and forth over and over and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.200 
line back and forth over and over and
over<00:02:37.200> again<00:02:37.410> until<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.890> fill<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.250> entire<00:02:38.400> block

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
over again until I fill the entire block

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.420 
over again until I fill the entire block
with<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:40.350> did<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:40.740> on<00:02:40.920> one<00:02:41.130> side<00:02:41.400> and

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
with it and I did that on one side and

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.700 
with it and I did that on one side and
then<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.850> travel<00:02:42.720> switched<00:02:42.930> over<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.440> do<00:02:43.560> that

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
then I travel switched over and do that

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.080 
then I travel switched over and do that
to<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.950> other<00:02:43.980> side<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.580> that's<00:02:44.820> basically

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
to the other side and that's basically

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.930 
to the other side and that's basically
how<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.780> design<00:02:46.140> works<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.920> here's<00:02:47.700> what<00:02:47.820> it

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
how this design works and here's what it

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.060 
how this design works and here's what it
looks<00:02:48.120> like<00:02:48.330> whenever<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.960> finish<00:02:49.140> Aztec

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070
