 Hello everyone who watches this video in this 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.660
 video I want to show my new work 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.429
 which I finished doing yesterday alone 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.130
 a familiar person turned to me 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.699
 he is recently engaged in combat 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.609
 arts and asked if I could for 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.420
 him make a knife ndk 17 only 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.340
 a smaller version well, naturally he 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.609
 I showed the drawings of this knife I 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.000
 looked well there was nothing complicated 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.670
 special special and said that this knife 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.879
 I can do well, naturally I started 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.540
 do and did this knife somewhere two 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.329
 weeks and that's what happened 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:49.110
 as i said yesterday i finished it 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.910
 do here in these necessary this knife 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.899
 such a smaller version 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.899
 knife ndk 17 here's how you see 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:08.330
 so well, let's first size knives 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.030
 the blade of this knife is nine s 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.210
 half a centimeter little knife grip 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.580
 more than eight centimeters blade thickness 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.750
 Well, a little more than three and a half 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:25.540
 millimeters as you see in this knife 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:29.540
 one-way downhill well this is such a knife 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:33.140
 model knife of such ndk 17 only this 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.080
 smaller version so well from what 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.150
 materials in general the knife is made blade 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.940
 this knife 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.250
 made de table 110 stainless 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.920
 fully hardened heat treated 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.950
 honestly I want to say enough 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.380
 strong piece of iron I think sharpening will 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.240
 keep fine 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.770
 lining and this knife is made of 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:03.710
 ebonite and bolts as you see torx 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.990
 also stainless here such a knife when 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.050
 I first saw this drawing of a knife well, 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.860
 Well, said such a knife is not very comfortable 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.900
 will hold hands well the owner of the future 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.420
 the owner of the knife said that he had a hand 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.700
 small and everything will be fine it 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.630
 honestly, I have this knife in my hand 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.480
 I hold and really everything is comfortable but 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.260
 keeps up pretty well as you see on this 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.450
 the knife has a lanyard hole 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.519
 but the lanyard I did not do I think 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.100
 the future owner himself something here 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:43.519
 brought to your taste but such a knife 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:47.269
 polishing his perfect all done 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.850
 very very high quality true sharpening 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.220
 on this, I have not done it is necessary to 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.510
 owner ask do liza. if he 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.110
 say do sharpening 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.920
 unnaturally for. everything will be done 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:04.840
 polished polished that's how you 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.840
 see here so one-sided ways 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.120
 so now let's help well I was 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.260
 I thought what you need to do for this 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.550
 knife and decided to make these need 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.720
 need made from vegetable skin 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.280
 tanning very good quality and here 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.920
 so all is made but naturally 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.720
 painted and these are needed turned out 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:42.100
 need enough comfort for this 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.830
 the knife holds a knife very well 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:51.520
 falls out exactly the right size this 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:55.720
 knife and very easy to take out in general here 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:04:00.310
 this is my new job I say again 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:03.090
 that the knife went to order and I did it 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.160
 somewhere two weeks slowly and 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.700
