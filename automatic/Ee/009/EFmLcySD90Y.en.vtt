copper 580 lens and then the tortoise

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.480 
copper 580 lens and then the tortoise
frame<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:21.350> like<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> rimless<00:01:22.710> frame<00:01:22.920> it's

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
frame I like the rimless frame it's

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.160

really<00:01:23.850> snug<00:01:24.180> around<00:01:24.330> my<00:01:24.600> face<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.110> it

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
really snug around my face and it

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.300 
really snug around my face and it
doesn't<00:01:25.200> feel<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:25.890> going<00:01:26.130> anywhere

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
doesn't feel like it's going anywhere

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.330 
doesn't feel like it's going anywhere
and<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.820> think<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.299> another<00:01:28.049> tribute<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.220> that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
and I think that another tribute to that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.120 
and I think that another tribute to that
is<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.060> no-slip<00:01:30.659> material<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.680> nose<00:01:31.890> pads

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
is the no-slip material on the nose pads

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.460 
is the no-slip material on the nose pads
you<00:01:33.030> know<00:01:33.180> they're<00:01:33.509> great<00:01:33.659> for<00:01:33.900> fishing<00:01:34.110> but

these<00:01:55.880> sunglasses<00:01:56.510> I<00:01:56.660> can<00:01:56.870> see<00:01:57.140> something

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
these sunglasses I can see something

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.380 
these sunglasses I can see something
right<00:01:57.800> here<00:01:58.070> on<00:01:58.220> in<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.670> frame<00:01:58.940> while<00:01:59.240> I'm

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
right here on in the frame while I'm

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.510 
right here on in the frame while I'm
wearing<00:01:59.540> these<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.320> I'm<00:02:00.800> not<00:02:00.980> exactly<00:02:01.310> sure

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
wearing these and I'm not exactly sure

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.790 
wearing these and I'm not exactly sure
which<00:02:02.330> part<00:02:02.690> of<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.840> sunglass<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.380> is<00:02:03.500> that<00:02:03.770> I

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
which part of the sunglass it is that I

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.740 
which part of the sunglass it is that I
can<00:02:04.010> see<00:02:04.460> it's<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.730> little<00:02:04.850> distracting<00:02:05.270> but

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
can see it's a little distracting but

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.139 
can see it's a little distracting but
it's<00:02:05.900> not<00:02:06.110> a<00:02:06.140> very<00:02:06.230> big<00:02:06.440> deal<00:02:06.800> they<00:02:07.790> come<00:02:08.000> too

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
it's not a very big deal they come too

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.600 
it's not a very big deal they come too
large<00:02:08.470> they<00:02:09.470> fit<00:02:09.649> my<00:02:09.830> narrow<00:02:10.070> face<00:02:10.369> pretty

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
large they fit my narrow face pretty

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.130 
large they fit my narrow face pretty
well<00:02:10.850> so<00:02:11.120> it's<00:02:11.270> safe<00:02:11.450> you've<00:02:11.630> got<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.870> wider

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
well so it's safe you've got a wider

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.080 
well so it's safe you've got a wider
face<00:02:12.440> be<00:02:12.680> sure<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:12.980> try<00:02:13.190> them<00:02:13.310> on<00:02:13.430> beforehand

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
face be sure to try them on beforehand

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.130

they<00:02:15.050> run<00:02:15.320> at<00:02:15.820> 169<00:02:16.820> which<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.360> little<00:02:17.690> bit<00:02:17.840> of

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
they run at 169 which is a little bit of

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.350 
they run at 169 which is a little bit of
a<00:02:18.290> higher<00:02:18.470> end<00:02:18.770> for<00:02:19.010> sunglasses<00:02:19.220> but<00:02:19.940> I'd<00:02:20.060> say

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
a higher end for sunglasses but I'd say

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.320 
a higher end for sunglasses but I'd say
that<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.660> 580<00:02:21.110> fluorides<00:02:21.740> win<00:02:22.330> definitely

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
that the 580 fluorides win definitely

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.110 
that the 580 fluorides win definitely
makes<00:02:23.870> these<00:02:24.050> sunglasses<00:02:24.260> worth<00:02:24.740> it<00:02:25.120> the
