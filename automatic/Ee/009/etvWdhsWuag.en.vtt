artillery level 13

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.200 
artillery level 13
I<00:00:52.949> don't<00:00:53.430> think<00:00:53.520> we're<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.969> be<00:00:54.030> using

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
I don't think we're going to be using

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.150 
I don't think we're going to be using
that<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:55.140> we<00:00:55.289> are<00:00:55.320> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.800> be<00:00:55.890> using

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
that one but we are going to be using

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.090 
that one but we are going to be using
the<00:00:56.250> brush<00:00:56.520> at<00:00:56.699> level<00:00:56.940> 7<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.870> also<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.649> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the brush at level 7 we also have a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.520 
the brush at level 7 we also have a
smoke<00:01:00.000> which<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.660> are<00:01:00.809> going<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.170> utilizing

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
smoke which we are going to be utilizing

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.429 
smoke which we are going to be utilizing
as<00:01:01.739> well<00:01:01.949> level<00:01:02.250> 1<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:03.239> got<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.570> flare<00:01:03.870> level<00:01:04.170> 5

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
as well level 1 we got a flare level 5

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.649 
as well level 1 we got a flare level 5
which<00:01:04.710> takes<00:01:05.369> 20<00:01:05.760> seconds<00:01:06.119> before<00:01:06.420> it

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
which takes 20 seconds before it

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.000 
which takes 20 seconds before it
actually<00:01:06.780> goes<00:01:07.580> Matt<00:01:08.580> get<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.939> level<00:01:09.150> 13<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.869> a

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
actually goes Matt get on level 13 and a

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.700 
actually goes Matt get on level 13 and a
shock<00:01:11.010> bomb<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.369> level<00:01:11.640> 4<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.510> yeah<00:01:13.140> pretty

boat level 16 you see my landing crash

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.980 
boat level 16 you see my landing crash
level<00:01:20.520> 13<00:01:20.939> two<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.270> them<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> rest<00:01:21.780> are

all level 12 right now so that's

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.270 
all level 12 right now so that's
something<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.750> consider<00:01:24.840> as<00:01:25.140> well<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.530> boosted

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
something to consider as well I boosted

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.910 
something to consider as well I boosted
up<00:01:26.430> my<00:01:26.610> power<00:01:26.939> stone<00:01:27.360> chance<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.500> no

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
up my power stone chance and I have no

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.950 
up my power stone chance and I have no
idea<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.610> that's<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.180> helpful<00:01:30.750> or

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
idea if that's going to be helpful or

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.960 
idea if that's going to be helpful or
not<00:01:31.200> but<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.009> was<00:01:32.159> taking<00:01:32.490> down<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.640> couple<00:01:32.880> of

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
not but I was taking down a couple of

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.789 
not but I was taking down a couple of
phases<00:01:33.150> anyway<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.020> yeah<00:01:34.350> that's<00:01:34.590> why<00:01:34.770> I

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
phases anyway and yeah that's why I

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.310 
phases anyway and yeah that's why I
decided<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.340> actually<00:01:35.850> boost<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.270> up<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:37.110> a

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
decided to actually boost it up I have a

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.310 
decided to actually boost it up I have a
50%<00:01:38.130> gun<00:01:38.520> boat<00:01:38.700> energy<00:01:38.850> Guardian<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:40.110> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
50% gun boat energy Guardian and have a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.789 
50% gun boat energy Guardian and have a
41%<00:01:41.189> gun<00:01:41.670> boat<00:01:41.909> energy<00:01:42.090> masterpiece<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.350> of

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
41% gun boat energy masterpiece and of

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.270 
41% gun boat energy masterpiece and of
course<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.340> 28%<00:01:45.329> troop<00:01:45.930> damage<00:01:46.380> masterpiece<00:01:47.070> as

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
course a 28% troop damage masterpiece as

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.060 
course a 28% troop damage masterpiece as
well<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.990> breaks<00:01:49.170> my<00:01:49.320> total<00:01:49.680> energy<00:01:49.710> up

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
well so that breaks my total energy up

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.420 
well so that breaks my total energy up
to<00:01:50.180> 66<00:01:51.180> which<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.780> should<00:01:52.560> be<00:01:52.680> significant<00:01:53.280> in

these<00:02:43.349> mines<00:02:43.650> because<00:02:44.099> these<00:02:44.310> mines<00:02:44.549> are

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
these mines because these mines are

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.370 
these mines because these mines are

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
going to be going from the right side

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.839 
going to be going from the right side
because<00:02:52.440> from<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.829> left<00:02:53.010> side<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.310> see<00:02:53.370> over

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
because from the left side you see over

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.220 
because from the left side you see over

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
they make it a little bit harder because

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.009 
they make it a little bit harder because
of<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.549> rats<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.910> actually<00:03:03.269> got<00:03:03.390> machine<00:03:03.780> gun

thing<00:03:37.889> we're<00:03:38.040> going<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.190> be<00:03:38.250> doing<00:03:38.489> right<00:03:38.819> off

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
thing we're going to be doing right off

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.490 
thing we're going to be doing right off
the<00:03:39.150> bat<00:03:39.299> hopefully<00:03:39.690> taking<00:03:39.989> out<00:03:40.109> that<00:03:40.230> white

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
the bat hopefully taking out that white

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.890 
the bat hopefully taking out that white
one<00:03:40.739> as<00:03:40.859> well<00:03:41.099> which<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.180> did<00:03:42.389> that<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:42.690> really

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
one as well which it did that is really

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.509 
one as well which it did that is really
awesome<00:03:43.019> actually<00:03:43.530> will<00:03:43.650> be<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:43.950> using<00:03:44.370> one

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
awesome actually will be to using one

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.099 
awesome actually will be to using one
artillery<00:03:45.030> shell<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.450> actually<00:03:45.720> take<00:03:45.900> that

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
artillery shell to actually take that

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.599 
artillery shell to actually take that
one<00:03:46.260> out<00:03:46.410> as<00:03:46.560> well<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:47.010> there<00:03:47.130> we<00:03:47.250> go

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
one out as well so there we go

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.550 
one out as well so there we go
perfect<00:03:48.599> now<00:03:49.010> moment<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.069> truth<00:03:50.720> d<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:52.169> range

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
perfect now moment of truth d the range

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.199 
perfect now moment of truth d the range
of<00:03:52.829> course<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.430> rocket<00:03:53.760> launcher<00:03:54.090> is

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
of course of this rocket launcher is

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.940 
of course of this rocket launcher is
reaching<00:03:54.630> all<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.780> way<00:03:54.900> up<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.290> think<00:03:55.440> dis

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
reaching all the way up to I think dis

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.860 
reaching all the way up to I think dis
little<00:03:56.160> tree<00:03:56.489> down<00:03:56.700> in<00:03:56.819> the<00:03:56.880> middle<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.209> pair

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
little tree down in the middle the pair

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.539 
little tree down in the middle the pair
of<00:03:57.959> trees<00:03:58.200> there<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:58.919> is<00:03:59.069> moving<00:03:59.370> right<00:03:59.489> now

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
of trees there that is moving right now

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.789 
of trees there that is moving right now
so<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.150> think<00:04:00.419> that<00:04:00.780> is<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.349> moment<00:04:01.709> it

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
so I think that is the moment it

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.009 
so I think that is the moment it
actually<00:04:02.069> starts<00:04:02.430> moving<00:04:02.849> to<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.389> us<00:04:03.569> it<00:04:03.810> when

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
actually starts moving to to us it when

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.780 
actually starts moving to to us it when
it<00:04:04.139> starts<00:04:04.349> to<00:04:04.470> lock-on<00:04:04.919> on<00:04:05.040> us<00:04:05.160> I'm<00:04:05.430> just

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
it starts to lock-on on us I'm just

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.190 
it starts to lock-on on us I'm just
dropping<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.239> shot<00:04:06.480> bomb<00:04:06.660> in<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.930> evening

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
dropping the shot bomb in the evening

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.129 
dropping the shot bomb in the evening
okay<00:04:07.230> so<00:04:08.010> dropping<00:04:08.489> all<00:04:08.819> of<00:04:08.849> the<00:04:09.419> Democrats

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
okay so dropping all of the Democrats

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.409 
okay so dropping all of the Democrats
right<00:04:10.319> now<00:04:10.590> dropping<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.519> first<00:04:11.760> flare<00:04:12.120> over

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
right now dropping the first flare over

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.659 
right now dropping the first flare over
at<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.230> back<00:04:13.440> over<00:04:13.829> here<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.040> think<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.489> should

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
at the back over here I think it should

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:15.050 
at the back over here I think it should
be<00:04:14.700> good

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
be good

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.610 
be good
the<00:04:15.510> workers<00:04:15.840> have<00:04:16.019> plenty<00:04:16.260> of<00:04:16.410> time<00:04:16.560> to

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
the workers have plenty of time to

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.629 
the workers have plenty of time to
actually<00:04:16.859> make<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.190> up<00:04:17.430> there<00:04:18.919> then<00:04:19.919> dropping

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
actually make it up there then dropping

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.159 
actually make it up there then dropping
another<00:04:20.910> one<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.269> redirect<00:04:21.719> them<00:04:21.930> at<00:04:22.049> the

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
another one to redirect them at the

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.260 
another one to redirect them at the
right<00:04:22.320> side<00:04:22.650> then<00:04:23.310> dropping<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.789> second<00:04:24.180> one

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
right side then dropping the second one

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.760 
right side then dropping the second one
to<00:04:24.450> go<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.870> back<00:04:25.169> right<00:04:25.409> now<00:04:25.440> because

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
to go to the back right now because

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.590 
to go to the back right now because
right<00:04:26.039> now<00:04:26.159> they're<00:04:26.340> relatively<00:04:26.940> nice

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
right now they're relatively nice

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.090 
right now they're relatively nice
and<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:28.080> think<00:04:28.320> I<00:04:28.380> want<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.560> be<00:04:28.680> dropping<00:04:29.010> the

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
and I think I want to be dropping the

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.280 
and I think I want to be dropping the
shock<00:04:29.340> for<00:04:29.520> right<00:04:29.760> now<00:04:29.790> just<00:04:30.480> in<00:04:30.630> time<00:04:30.810> perfect

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
shock for right now just in time perfect

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.500 
shock for right now just in time perfect
timing<00:04:31.500> right<00:04:31.770> there<00:04:32.040> now<00:04:32.940> comes<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.330> tricky

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
timing right there now comes the tricky

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.120 
timing right there now comes the tricky
part<00:04:33.720> because<00:04:34.020> we<00:04:34.440> got<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.710> keep<00:04:34.830> two<00:04:35.100> things

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
part because we got to keep two things

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.580 
part because we got to keep two things
in<00:04:35.520> mind<00:04:35.580> a<00:04:35.910> walking<00:04:36.600> path<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.230> shock<00:04:37.410> box

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
in mind a walking path and the shock box

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.170 
in mind a walking path and the shock box
dropping<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.160> shuffling<00:04:38.490> just<00:04:38.730> to<00:04:38.820> be<00:04:38.910> sure

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
dropping the shuffling just to be sure

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.450 
dropping the shuffling just to be sure
and<00:04:40.050> right<00:04:40.230> now<00:04:40.380> dropping<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:40.860> flare<00:04:41.100> as<00:04:41.220> well

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
and right now dropping the flare as well

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.160 
and right now dropping the flare as well
and<00:04:41.730> as<00:04:41.820> you<00:04:41.850> guys<00:04:42.030> can<00:04:42.240> see<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.780> rocket

and as you guys can see the rocket

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.050 
and as you guys can see the rocket
launches<00:04:43.470> are<00:04:43.620> under<00:04:43.950> fire<00:04:44.190> actually<00:04:44.700> want<00:04:45.030> to

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
launches are under fire actually want to

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.140 
launches are under fire actually want to
be<00:04:45.180> getting<00:04:45.420> close<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:46.820> -<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:47.940> rocket

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
be getting close to the - the rocket

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.000 
be getting close to the - the rocket
launches<00:04:48.570> right<00:04:48.720> now<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.170> dropping<00:04:49.440> a<00:04:49.650> medkit

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
launches right now and dropping a medkit

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.950 
launches right now and dropping a medkit
just<00:04:50.280> to<00:04:50.370> be<00:04:50.490> sure<00:04:50.520> so<00:04:51.030> right<00:04:51.240> now<00:04:51.480> we're<00:04:51.930> in

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
just to be sure so right now we're in

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.750 
just to be sure so right now we're in
position<00:04:52.350> taking<00:04:52.920> out<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.130> first<00:04:53.400> rocket

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
do that one is with warriors relatively

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.590 
do that one is with warriors relatively
easily<00:05:49.040> that<00:05:50.040> you<00:05:50.070> can<00:05:50.340> use<00:05:50.520> tanks<00:05:50.940> and<00:05:51.270> medics

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
easily that you can use tanks and medics

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.150 
easily that you can use tanks and medics
but<00:05:51.690> you<00:05:51.960> got<00:05:52.080> to<00:05:52.200> keep<00:05:52.290> the<00:05:52.500> boom<00:05:52.710> canons<00:05:53.040> in

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
rage of that so that might be tricky but

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.780 
rage of that so that might be tricky but
one<00:05:57.990> thing<00:05:58.140> for<00:05:58.290> sure<00:05:58.350> it<00:05:58.800> is<00:05:59.010> a<00:05:59.130> lot<00:05:59.250> of<00:05:59.490> fun<00:05:59.640> to
