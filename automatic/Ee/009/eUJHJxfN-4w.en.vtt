okay so here we have our microscope

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.940 
okay so here we have our microscope

setup and little glowing object there is
a<00:00:07.980> worm<00:00:08.340> egg<00:00:11.360> this<00:00:12.360> may<00:00:12.630> take<00:00:12.809> me<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> second

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
a worm egg this may take me a second

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.190 
a worm egg this may take me a second
I<00:00:13.769> don't<00:00:14.070> have<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.330> doctor

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
but if you'll see near the pointer it's

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.769 
but if you'll see near the pointer it's
flashing<00:00:24.190> because<00:00:24.400> my<00:00:24.580> camera<00:00:24.910> is<00:00:24.940> moving<00:00:25.150> not

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
flashing because my camera is moving not

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.679 
flashing because my camera is moving not
because<00:00:26.020> the<00:00:26.110> lights<00:00:26.320> moving<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:28.090> there<00:00:28.360> is

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
because the lights moving but there is

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.110 
because the lights moving but there is
the<00:00:29.380> worm<00:00:30.060> inside<00:00:31.060> the<00:00:31.689> egg<00:00:31.840> cone<00:00:33.120> moving

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
the worm inside the egg cone moving

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:42.420 
the worm inside the egg cone moving
around

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.580 

and<00:00:42.969> once<00:00:43.210> again<00:00:43.360> it's<00:00:43.600> not<00:00:43.750> flashing<00:00:44.110> because

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
and once again it's not flashing because

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.000 
and once again it's not flashing because
the<00:00:44.680> white<00:00:44.860> flashing<00:00:45.370> is<00:00:45.489> flashing<00:00:45.730> because

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the white flashing is flashing because

00:00:47.010 --> 00:01:08.340 
the white flashing is flashing because
my<00:00:48.010> hands<00:00:48.430> moving

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.520 

here's<00:01:09.100> another<00:01:09.310> egg<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:11.080> one<00:01:11.260> was<00:01:11.410> a<00:01:11.440> little

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
here's another egg this one was a little

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.490 
here's another egg this one was a little
bit<00:01:11.650> browner<00:01:12.040> you<00:01:12.490> can<00:01:12.670> see<00:01:12.880> it's<00:01:13.060> um<00:01:13.500> glowing

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
bit browner you can see it's um glowing

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.410 
bit browner you can see it's um glowing
just<00:01:14.620> because<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:14.920> light<00:01:15.100> passing<00:01:15.610> do<00:01:15.790> it<00:01:15.940> see

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
just because the light passing do it see

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.730 
just because the light passing do it see
I'm<00:01:16.540> moving<00:01:16.720> out<00:01:16.960> of<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.230> light<00:01:17.410> and<00:01:17.650> it

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
I'm moving out of the light and it

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.460 
I'm moving out of the light and it
doesn't<00:01:18.070> glow<00:01:18.390> put<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.480> back<00:01:19.690> in<00:01:19.900> there<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.380> it

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
doesn't glow put it back in there and it

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.140 
doesn't glow put it back in there and it
glows<00:01:21.090> now<00:01:22.090> this<00:01:22.390> one<00:01:23.400> seems<00:01:24.400> the<00:01:24.670> Hat<00:01:24.910> now

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
glows now this one seems the Hat now

glows now this one seems the Hat now
this<00:01:25.330> one's<00:01:25.510> brown<00:01:25.810> which<00:01:26.050> means<00:01:26.290> it's<00:01:26.470> a

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
this one's brown which means it's a

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.010 
this one's brown which means it's a
little<00:01:26.770> bit<00:01:26.860> older<00:01:29.040> see<00:01:30.040> if<00:01:30.160> I<00:01:30.280> can<00:01:30.400> get<00:01:30.520> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
little bit older see if I can get it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:41.490 
little bit older see if I can get it
this<00:01:32.020> one<00:01:32.229> has<00:01:33.240> least<00:01:34.240> two<00:01:34.540> worms<00:01:34.810> in<00:01:35.080> it<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
this one has least two worms in it the

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.870 
this one has least two worms in it the
one<00:01:41.680> on<00:01:41.800> top<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.040> one<00:01:42.340> kind<00:01:42.580> of<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.729> background

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
one on top and one kind of a background

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.760 
one on top and one kind of a background
and<00:01:43.509> I<00:01:43.570> kind<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:43.900> suspect<00:01:44.320> there's<00:01:44.500> three

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
and I kind of suspect there's three

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.920 
and I kind of suspect there's three
worms<00:01:45.009> in<00:01:45.280> there<00:01:45.430> yes<00:01:46.210> I'm<00:01:46.420> pretty<00:01:46.630> sure

worms in there yes I'm pretty sure
there's<00:01:47.170> three<00:01:47.500> worms<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:49.240> egg<00:01:49.479> became

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
there's three worms and this egg became

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.180 
there's three worms and this egg became
this<00:01:51.400> egg<00:01:51.670> khatoun<00:01:52.060> is<00:01:53.610> let's<00:01:54.610> see<00:01:54.790> here<00:01:56.190> this

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
this egg khatoun is let's see here this

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.510 
this egg khatoun is let's see here this
egg<00:01:57.460> cocoon<00:01:57.790> I<00:01:57.910> took<00:01:58.119> it<00:01:58.240> off<00:01:58.360> of<00:01:58.390> a<00:01:58.630> rack<00:01:59.520> over

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
egg cocoon I took it off of a rack over

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.780 
egg cocoon I took it off of a rack over
here<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:02.619> one<00:02:03.540> seven<00:02:04.540> ten<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:06.100> in<00:02:06.550> today's

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
here this one seven ten so in today's

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.979 
here this one seven ten so in today's
the<00:02:07.210> 18th<00:02:07.660> of<00:02:07.869> July<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:09.190> this<00:02:09.340> egg<00:02:09.580> capsule<00:02:10.380> is

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
the 18th of July so this egg capsule is

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.330 
the 18th of July so this egg capsule is
probably<00:02:13.989> only<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.290> week<00:02:14.500> or<00:02:14.680> two<00:02:14.830> old<00:02:15.100> but

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
probably only a week or two old but

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.810 
probably only a week or two old but
maybe<00:02:15.489> it<00:02:15.670> got<00:02:15.790> missed<00:02:17.100> our<00:02:18.100> separating

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
maybe it got missed our separating

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.400 
maybe it got missed our separating

machine previously now I'm looking at

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:32.470 
machine previously now I'm looking at
another<00:02:23.650> egg<00:02:23.950> here<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:28.810> one<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:30.400> can<00:02:30.610> see

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
another egg here this one you can see

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.309 
another egg here this one you can see
let's<00:02:33.440> see<00:02:33.650> here<00:02:34.720> sorry<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:35.780> don't<00:02:35.870> really<00:02:36.050> have

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
a microscope adapter it's kind of hard

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.000 
a microscope adapter it's kind of hard
to<00:02:41.569> see<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.930> worm<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:42.349> this<00:02:42.530> one<00:02:42.709> but<00:02:42.860> it's

to see the worm in this one but it's

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:53.300
