00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.230
 Now you pack freezer and ends 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.180
 went out again super refreshing 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.600
 snatch that does not need bad 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.600
 have certain 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.829
 for this delicious 1 needed only completely 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.689
 few ingredients two times strawberries 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.030
 yogurt I have Greek yogurt 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.159
 taken for milk or coconut milk or 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.960
 whatever you wanted to take and that 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.700
 and I have to agave syrup 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.130
 and then it works 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.680
 Just add all the ingredients to the mixer 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.940
 could vary how much you like what 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.349
 want to have that depending on whether he 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.120
 legally likes on board or if this 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.580
 Something will happen again and then it will 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.690
 simply mixed and then comes in 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.690
 the as a couple 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.150
 The step is optional but I'm there 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.410
 still a few slices to the side 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.120
 given that it therefore simply nicer 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.870
 looks from also often tastes 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.870
 not found 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.310
 Yes 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.180
 and if I have everything in ice hockey 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.510
 you could have done that too 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.510
 drink 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.540
 This pack is so delicious and ever 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.430
 only strawberries and yogurt I have that 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.660
 Greek correct and the only one 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.270
 what you have to do is simply the 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.970
 to dip strawberries for eurostat and 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.160
 then give it to an award or where 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.380
 always easy to replace as good 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.390
 could and then the whole thing comes into the gate 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.190
 I found it funny as long as fourfold 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.810
 So give just use half 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.400
 about an hour and a half 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.350
 that it made the yoghurt out 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.070
 The fruit in Trier is rumored 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.080
 still nice 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.080
 are fruity and delicious 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.500
 for the note but here again 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.239
 of course then smell something together 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.250
 could be anything they continue their 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.709
 for example liquid I have mine 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.599
 not taken my extract raspberries 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.459
 and some lemon juice , yes, too 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.349
 However, again the quantitative disclosures your 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.870
 taste vary and here we go 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.819
 Let's just see the milk and all 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.450
 others to share in the 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.190
 give mixer 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.190
 and if you have a good change 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.900
 with me for the whole for two portions 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.680
 In the end, it's all in one 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.600
 ate a meal 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.310
 but then I have just every one of them 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.900
 bowl another one to two spoonfuls 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.950
 to go to kazachen and the whole 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.110
 in between to keep checking back 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.240
 chosen and in a bowl two more 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.890
 it for this or fathers movie yogurt 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.560
 watched and tasted really good 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.790
 So that is recommended and done 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.260
 It looks and tastes like that 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.540
 simply super good is also very suitable 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.780
 good for breakfast in summer but also it 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.780
 was natural 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.980
 by far my favorite country 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.250
 just needs dark chocolate 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.780
 a banana and it has to be the banana 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.340
 you just cut and if you do that 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.100
 then you just give up 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.570
 a little older and works because 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.070
 the other half on it and then have 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.320
 your your sandwich and what he is with 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.820
 this tempo astana is actually too 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.880
 so logically so her pain then 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.860
 just the chocolate and yes 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.520
 then polished by your delicious banana 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.520
 sandwiches 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.420
 I did that here 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.610
 as much with a few almonds 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.860
 split and then with coconut shavings 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.870
 Of course that's up to you 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.810
 and then the whole thing just comes for 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.600
 an hour or so into the freezer compartment 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.820
 Chocolate is just so delicious 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.040
 and bananas examination of the in cocoon 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.760
 just good tastes a little bit 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.760
 like knickerbocker 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.730
 then I wanted to show 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.200
 as I again vitamins better or 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.000
 the shops postage make me many 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.010
 have asked for it just needs 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.920
 set many things right 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.450
 Taken orange lemon and learning 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.730
 easy for the colors also for the 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.290
 taste and it 's just awesome 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.060
 how does the fruit cut into small ones? 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.400
 Pieces best makes her write well 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.400
 as easy as possible with the fragmentation 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.200
 is higher and even more vitamins 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.510
 water pass over and then comes the 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.620
 Just put everything in a glass of tea 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.230
 taken next year 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.430
 you can order on the internet and then 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.020
 you can open the whole with water and 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.000
 fits the whole thing for an hour or so 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:24.100
 in the fridge and then you can 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.100
 Enjoy your talks 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.259
 Do you have it so much in the past ? 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.580
 is eaten is definitely 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:54.050
 much healthier 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.270
 you just have to get the pulp 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.949
 put a watermelon in a blender 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.020
 depending on how much you want and 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:02.479
 I'm just fine 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.069
 and if you did that then it will come 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:06.080
 just in a plastic container I 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:07.669
 Tupper can have been taken and that 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.900
 Whole then comes into the freezer until the 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:13.220
 totally totally different 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.960
 Ok, now comes some physical work 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.190
 with it and there is something on it though 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.870
 but that is so bad and have 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.699
 her same ball is kathrin lehmann 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.160
 scratch yours until now 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:26.860
 amount of gold and it is just great 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.860
 refreshingly delicious and the edge 

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.540
 that 's it with the video 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.949
 later when joining in the 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.870
