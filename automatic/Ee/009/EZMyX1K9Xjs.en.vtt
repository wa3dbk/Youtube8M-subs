00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.140 
okay and lastly we need a little bit of
oil<00:03:10.450> I<00:03:10.859> added<00:03:11.859> this<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.219> the<00:03:12.340> recipe<00:03:12.819> to<00:03:13.060> make

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
oil I added this to the recipe to make

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.539 
oil I added this to the recipe to make
it<00:03:13.329> easier<00:03:13.689> to<00:03:13.810> mix<00:03:13.959> up<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.590> it's<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.219> really<00:03:15.340> no

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
it easier to mix up so it's a really no

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:29.100 
it easier to mix up so it's a really no
measurement<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.359> don't<00:03:16.900> put<00:03:17.049> a<00:03:17.079> lot

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.809 

and<00:03:30.110> now<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:30.319> got<00:03:30.530> to<00:03:30.650> mix<00:03:30.800> up<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.280> all<00:03:31.550> the

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
and now you got to mix up to it all the

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:48.760 
and now you got to mix up to it all the
ingredients

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.170 

make<00:03:49.770> sure<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.069> don't<00:03:50.220> use<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.459> whisk<00:03:50.790> when<00:03:51.060> you

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
make sure you don't use a whisk when you

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.880 
make sure you don't use a whisk when you
mix<00:03:51.330> it<00:03:51.480> up<00:03:51.630> because<00:03:51.900> then<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.319> hit<00:03:52.470> all<00:03:52.830> of

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
mix it up because then you hit all of

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.670 
mix it up because then you hit all of
the<00:03:53.540> ingredients<00:03:54.540> just<00:03:54.569> stuck<00:03:55.200> in<00:03:55.349> it's

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
the ingredients just stuck in it's

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:05.809 
the ingredients just stuck in it's
brilliant<00:04:03.709> if<00:04:04.709> it's<00:04:04.890> not<00:04:05.040> mixing<00:04:05.430> well<00:04:05.610> enough

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
brilliant if it's not mixing well enough

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:06.979 
brilliant if it's not mixing well enough
that's<00:04:06.060> when<00:04:06.180> you<00:04:06.300> need<00:04:06.420> to<00:04:06.480> add<00:04:06.660> a<00:04:06.690> little

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
that's when you need to add a little

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.580 
that's when you need to add a little
more<00:04:07.170> oil

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.050 

he<00:04:10.590> doesn't<00:04:10.920> my<00:04:11.340> brother<00:04:11.550> doesn't<00:04:11.819> know<00:04:12.000> how

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
he doesn't my brother doesn't know how

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:36.129 
he doesn't my brother doesn't know how
to<00:04:12.150> make<00:04:12.300> these

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.170 

I<00:04:38.020> think<00:04:39.020> it's<00:04:39.169> the<00:04:39.289> video<00:04:39.729> now<00:04:40.729> that<00:04:40.759> it's<00:04:41.060> all

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
I think it's the video now that it's all

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.029 
I think it's the video now that it's all
mixed<00:04:41.389> up<00:04:41.659> it's<00:04:41.960> very<00:04:42.199> important<00:04:42.740> that<00:04:42.770> it's

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
mixed up it's very important that it's

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.939 
mixed up it's very important that it's
very<00:04:43.249> solid<00:04:43.610> and<00:04:44.090> you<00:04:44.960> will<00:04:45.110> find<00:04:45.439> out<00:04:45.590> why<00:04:45.740> in

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
very solid and you will find out why in

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:47.830 
very solid and you will find out why in
the<00:04:46.039> next<00:04:46.189> step<00:04:46.550> because<00:04:47.060> now<00:04:47.270> it's<00:04:47.479> the<00:04:47.629> fun

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
the next step because now it's the fun

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.659 
the next step because now it's the fun
part<00:04:47.870> where<00:04:48.349> we<00:04:48.469> get<00:04:48.620> to<00:04:48.770> get<00:04:49.219> them<00:04:49.340> ready<00:04:49.520> for

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
part where we get to get them ready for

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.290 
part where we get to get them ready for
the<00:04:49.819> oven<00:04:50.770> you're<00:04:51.770> going<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:52.039> need<00:04:52.189> three<00:04:52.729> big

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
the oven you're going to need three big

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.360 
the oven you're going to need three big
cookie<00:04:53.810> sheets<00:04:54.110> because<00:04:54.379> you're<00:04:55.009> going<00:04:55.159> to<00:04:55.219> be

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
cookie sheets because you're going to be

cookie sheets because you're going to be
making<00:04:55.669> a<00:04:55.759> lot<00:04:55.999> of<00:04:56.210> cookies<00:04:56.449> so<00:04:57.259> it's

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.409 
making a lot of cookies so it's

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.260 
making a lot of cookies so it's

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
important to pan them all three of them

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.809 
important to pan them all three of them
so<00:05:00.050> that<00:05:00.169> they<00:05:00.379> do<00:05:00.499> not<00:05:00.650> stick<00:05:00.979> when<00:05:01.520> they<00:05:01.610> come

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:01.819 
so that they do not stick when they come

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:20.689 
that's because it's very solid and

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:22.480 
that's because it's very solid and
that's<00:05:21.080> because<00:05:21.379> I<00:05:21.469> didn't<00:05:21.680> add<00:05:21.800> too<00:05:22.069> much<00:05:22.219> oil

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
that's because I didn't add too much oil

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 
if you add too much oil then they

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:26.649 
if you add too much oil then they
actually<00:05:24.740> stick<00:05:25.039> to<00:05:25.189> your<00:05:25.310> hands<00:05:25.699> a<00:05:25.849> way<00:05:26.599> to

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 
actually stick to your hands a way to

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.469 
actually stick to your hands a way to
fix<00:05:27.620> that<00:05:27.830> is<00:05:28.069> to<00:05:28.099> add<00:05:28.610> a<00:05:28.639> lot<00:05:28.969> of<00:05:29.000> powdered

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
fix that is to add a lot of powdered

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.779 
fix that is to add a lot of powdered
sugar<00:05:29.569> in<00:05:29.990> it<00:05:30.139> it<00:05:30.469> also<00:05:30.620> changes<00:05:31.490> the<00:05:31.610> taste

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
sugar in it it also changes the taste

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.480 
sugar in it it also changes the taste
just<00:05:32.000> a<00:05:32.150> little<00:05:32.180> bit<00:05:32.509> makes<00:05:32.839> it<00:05:32.960> better<00:05:33.249> but<00:05:34.249> as

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
just a little bit makes it better but as

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.110 
just a little bit makes it better but as
you<00:05:34.639> can<00:05:34.759> see<00:05:34.819> you<00:05:35.389> just<00:05:35.599> place<00:05:36.379> it<00:05:36.409> there<00:05:36.860> and

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
you can see you just place it there and

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:46.300 
you can see you just place it there and
just<00:05:38.120> that's<00:05:38.479> how<00:05:38.719> you<00:05:38.779> do<00:05:39.020> it

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.100

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
now that you have them in little balls

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.050 
now that you have them in little balls
on<00:05:48.470> the<00:05:48.620> trays<00:05:48.889> it's<00:05:49.220> time<00:05:49.430> to<00:05:49.550> put<00:05:49.730> them<00:05:49.850> in

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060
