00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:17.410
 So I think that here we would like to explain the method of off of soft gel nails 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.240
 First of all 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.840
 Aluminum file 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.840
 acetone 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.460
 And cut cotton 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 I 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.000
 Wood stick 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.140
 And I will use a rough file 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:48.179
 Wash the seeds first or disinfect them with alcohol such as ethanol 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.170
 next 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.170
 Grind the gel surface with this rough file 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:26.590
 At this time I will not be able to go out I found a top gel and two half chest color types of color part 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.590
 Please 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:40.970
 Please shaved until much this little by little, among which can not be 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:45.370
 Then we dampened acetone 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.370
 Put a small piece of cotton on the nails 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.320
 r 5 f 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:05.300
 And as it is , we wait for 15 to 20 minutes 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.300
 Next unravel the aluminum file 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.160
 I will gently drop it with a wood stick 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:02.610
 If this time still 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:06.690
 If you have gel attached to your nails, that you have scraped and wet acetone 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.230
 Repeat the process to make the 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.519
 Also this wood stick 8 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.519
 I will continue to turn off 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.569
 How to turn off soft gel nails with this 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.569
 I will finish
