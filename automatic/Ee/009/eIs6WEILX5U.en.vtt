00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
the course immunity was pretty hard and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.580 
the course immunity was pretty hard and
pretty<00:00:18.330> easy<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.690> run<00:00:18.779> out<00:00:18.930> not<00:00:19.080> too<00:00:19.199> sloppy<00:00:19.350> in

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
pretty easy to run out not too sloppy in

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.670 
pretty easy to run out not too sloppy in
it<00:00:19.710> turned<00:00:19.980> out<00:00:20.070> being<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:21.330> way<00:00:21.480> I

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.560 

didn't<00:00:25.680> want<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.920> start<00:00:26.220> up<00:00:26.310> start<00:00:27.060> out<00:00:27.359> too

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
didn't want to start up start out too

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.750 
didn't want to start up start out too
fast<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:28.140> prefer<00:00:28.470> going<00:00:28.800> out<00:00:28.980> pretty<00:00:29.220> even<00:00:29.519> and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
fast I prefer going out pretty even and

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.209 
fast I prefer going out pretty even and
but<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.779> wanted<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.170> keep<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.529> contact<00:00:31.679> with<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
but I wanted to keep in contact with the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.889 
but I wanted to keep in contact with the
lead<00:00:32.399> group<00:00:32.610> believe<00:00:33.210> two<00:00:33.390> people<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
lead group believe two people in the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.180 
lead group believe two people in the
front<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.410> felt<00:00:34.649> like<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.829> did<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.040> good<00:00:35.130> job

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
front and I felt like I did a good job

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.630 
front and I felt like I did a good job
of<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.870> eventually<00:00:36.950> with<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:37.980> last<00:00:38.280> two<00:00:38.489> is

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
of that eventually with the last two is

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.369 
of that eventually with the last two is
okay<00:00:38.820> they<00:00:39.090> started<00:00:39.450> coming<00:00:39.690> back<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.989> me<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
okay they started coming back to me and

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.950 
okay they started coming back to me and
I<00:00:40.739> was<00:00:40.950> able<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.550> guess<00:00:41.879> capitalize<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
I was able to I guess capitalize on the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.529 
I was able to I guess capitalize on the
fact<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.350> they<00:00:43.800> slowed<00:00:44.040> down<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.219> bit<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.730> it

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
fact it they slowed down a bit so it

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.729 
fact it they slowed down a bit so it
worked<00:00:45.809> out<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.079> my<00:00:46.200> advantage

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
worked out to my advantage

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:55.360 
worked out to my advantage
it<00:00:47.340> was<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> great<00:00:47.700> beast<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.090> was<00:00:48.210> excited<00:00:48.450> yet

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.410 

I<00:00:56.710> think<00:00:57.710> it<00:00:58.370> gave<00:00:58.550> me<00:00:58.700> a<00:00:58.730> lot<00:00:58.880> of<00:00:58.910> confidence

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
I think it gave me a lot of confidence

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.200 
I think it gave me a lot of confidence
that<00:00:59.750> I<00:01:00.050> could<00:01:00.200> uh<00:01:00.440> I<00:01:01.010> guess<00:01:01.310> lead<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:02.000> chase

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
that I could uh I guess lead the chase

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.560 
that I could uh I guess lead the chase
back<00:01:02.450> or<00:01:02.690> be<00:01:02.810> in<00:01:03.050> front<00:01:03.380> of<00:01:03.890> that<00:01:04.129> pack<00:01:04.370> and<00:01:04.670> not

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
back or be in front of that pack and not

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.210 
back or be in front of that pack and not
necessarily<00:01:06.080> run<00:01:06.380> in<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.560> back<00:01:06.710> of<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:06.950> pack

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
necessarily run in the back of the pack

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.860 
necessarily run in the back of the pack
and<00:01:07.400> wait<00:01:07.580> but<00:01:08.180> to<00:01:08.360> keep<00:01:08.479> on<00:01:08.630> pushing

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
and wait but to keep on pushing

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.260 
and wait but to keep on pushing
throughout<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:09.440> race<00:01:09.970> knowing<00:01:10.970> that<00:01:11.240> I

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
throughout the race knowing that I

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.430 
throughout the race knowing that I
believed<00:01:11.540> it<00:01:11.780> might<00:01:11.900> give<00:01:12.110> me<00:01:12.140> a<00:01:12.260> better

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
believed it might give me a better

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.190 
believed it might give me a better
opportunity<00:01:12.800> at<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.640> end<00:01:13.670> be<00:01:14.119> able<00:01:14.360> to<00:01:14.630> catch

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
opportunity at the end be able to catch

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.880 
opportunity at the end be able to catch
people<00:01:15.560> in<00:01:15.650> front<00:01:15.860> of<00:01:15.920> me<00:01:15.979> I<00:01:16.310> guess<00:01:16.850> it<00:01:17.119> made<00:01:17.450> me

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
people in front of me I guess it made me

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.620 
people in front of me I guess it made me
be<00:01:18.890> more<00:01:19.040> aggressive<00:01:19.460> in<00:01:19.520> my<00:01:19.670> racing<00:01:20.030> rather

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
be more aggressive in my racing rather

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.140 
be more aggressive in my racing rather
than<00:01:20.900> sitting<00:01:21.590> back<00:01:21.740> I<00:01:22.070> felt<00:01:22.610> more<00:01:22.790> confident

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
than sitting back I felt more confident

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.210 
than sitting back I felt more confident
that<00:01:23.300> I'd<00:01:23.479> finish<00:01:23.810> well<00:01:24.050> no<00:01:24.619> matter<00:01:24.800> if<00:01:24.950> I<00:01:25.040> push

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
that I'd finish well no matter if I push

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:36.510 
that I'd finish well no matter if I push
it<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.430> whole<00:01:25.550> time

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.539 

yeah<00:01:37.299> I<00:01:37.439> didn't<00:01:38.439> obviously<00:01:38.740> see<00:01:38.979> anywhere

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
yeah I didn't obviously see anywhere

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.609 
yeah I didn't obviously see anywhere
around<00:01:39.759> me<00:01:39.970> I've<00:01:40.149> never<00:01:40.450> far<00:01:41.140> back<00:01:41.320> they<00:01:41.470> were

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
around me I've never far back they were

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.350 
around me I've never far back they were
but<00:01:41.950> I<00:01:42.220> think<00:01:42.640> at<00:01:42.729> that<00:01:42.850> point<00:01:42.909> I<00:01:43.180> was<00:01:43.299> still

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
but I think at that point I was still

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.700 
but I think at that point I was still
really<00:01:43.659> surprised<00:01:44.049> that<00:01:44.290> was<00:01:44.470> kind<00:01:44.649> of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
really surprised that was kind of

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.649 
really surprised that was kind of
shocked<00:01:45.040> going<00:01:45.880> into<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.149> last<00:01:46.270> straight<00:01:46.509> are

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
shocked going into the last straight are

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.950 
shocked going into the last straight are
you<00:01:46.840> realizing<00:01:47.110> it<00:01:47.409> that<00:01:48.600> basically<00:01:49.600> I<00:01:49.630> won

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
you realizing it that basically I won

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.800 
you realizing it that basically I won
like<00:01:50.259> even<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:51.280> last<00:01:51.520> six<00:01:52.180> hundred<00:01:52.390> meters<00:01:52.509> I

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
like even the last six hundred meters I

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.910 
like even the last six hundred meters I
was<00:01:52.960> kind<00:01:53.170> of<00:01:53.200> shocked<00:01:53.409> that<00:01:53.439> I've<00:01:53.680> changed

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
was kind of shocked that I've changed

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.289 
was kind of shocked that I've changed
went<00:01:54.280> so<00:01:54.549> I<00:01:55.530> mean<00:01:56.530> I<00:01:56.830> saw<00:01:57.250> her<00:01:57.399> come<00:01:57.670> I<00:01:58.060> think

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
those are a little bit off at 3k between

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.200 
those are a little bit off at 3k between
three<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.020> four<00:02:02.380> carats<00:02:02.740> are<00:02:02.920> drop<00:02:03.220> off<00:02:03.399> I

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
three and four carats are drop off I

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.539 
three and four carats are drop off I
mean<00:02:04.720> there's<00:02:05.710> a<00:02:05.799> lot<00:02:05.920> of<00:02:06.070> great<00:02:06.189> people<00:02:06.340> in

mean there's a lot of great people in

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.809 
mean there's a lot of great people in
race<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:07.709> it's<00:02:08.709> just<00:02:08.920> one<00:02:09.160> less<00:02:09.280> person<00:02:09.549> that<00:02:09.789> I

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
race so it's just one less person that I

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:17.530 
race so it's just one less person that I
saw<00:02:10.000> in<00:02:10.119> front<00:02:10.269> of<00:02:10.390> me

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.960 

I<00:02:17.980> really<00:02:18.980> truly<00:02:19.129> was<00:02:19.280> trying<00:02:19.549> not<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.730> think

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
I really truly was trying not to think

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.880 
I really truly was trying not to think
about<00:02:20.110> everyone<00:02:21.110> else<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:21.409> doing<00:02:21.500> so<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:21.739> was

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
about everyone else is doing so I was

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.860 
about everyone else is doing so I was
trying<00:02:22.099> to<00:02:22.159> think<00:02:22.400> about<00:02:22.489> I<00:02:22.939> guess<00:02:23.450> keeping<00:02:23.750> it

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
trying to think about I guess keeping it

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.289 
trying to think about I guess keeping it
even<00:02:24.230> if<00:02:24.349> I<00:02:24.620> could<00:02:25.159> and<00:02:25.370> pushing<00:02:25.760> myself<00:02:25.909> as

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
even if I could and pushing myself as

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:48.920 
even if I could and pushing myself as
much<00:02:26.480> as<00:02:26.599> I<00:02:26.689> could<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.670> much

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:03:01.670 

must<00:02:49.930> be<00:02:50.200> easy

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.050 

hissing<00:03:02.680> he<00:03:02.799> say<00:03:03.069> to<00:03:03.129> yourself<00:03:03.580> beforehand

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
hissing he say to yourself beforehand

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.940 
hissing he say to yourself beforehand
like<00:03:04.239> I<00:03:04.360> know<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.569> can<00:03:04.870> do<00:03:04.959> this<00:03:04.989> but<00:03:05.680> when<00:03:05.860> it

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
like I know I can do this but when it

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.500 
like I know I can do this but when it
comes<00:03:06.159> to<00:03:06.340> fruition<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:08.500> is<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:09.640> much<00:03:09.760> starting

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
comes to fruition it is so much starting

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.910 
comes to fruition it is so much starting
to<00:03:10.599> me<00:03:10.689> I<00:03:10.720> know<00:03:10.870> I'm<00:03:11.110> in<00:03:11.230> great<00:03:11.439> shape<00:03:11.470> but<00:03:11.680> I

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
to me I know I'm in great shape but I

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.770 
to me I know I'm in great shape but I
know<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.069> was<00:03:12.370> in<00:03:12.400> great<00:03:12.700> shape<00:03:12.939> coming<00:03:13.329> into<00:03:13.569> it

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
know I was in great shape coming into it

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.899 
know I was in great shape coming into it
so<00:03:14.409> it<00:03:14.560> wasn't<00:03:14.739> that<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.280> was<00:03:15.519> doubting<00:03:15.760> myself

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
so it wasn't that I was doubting myself

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.720 
so it wasn't that I was doubting myself
