00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:29.370 

this<00:00:16.630> was<00:00:16.869> raised<00:00:17.380> from<00:00:17.619> the<00:00:20.790> second<00:00:28.380> I

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
this was raised from the second I

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.620 
this was raised from the second I
remember<00:00:29.829> to<00:00:30.009> inoculate<00:00:30.669> the<00:00:30.820> number<00:00:31.119> five<00:00:31.419> in

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
remember to inoculate the number five in

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.389 
remember to inoculate the number five in
three<00:00:32.190> nothing<00:00:33.190> better<00:00:33.660> yeah<00:00:34.660> classical

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.460 

thinking<00:00:39.399> that<00:00:39.520> possibly<00:00:39.730> also<00:00:40.210> but<00:00:40.540> not<00:00:41.290> that

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
thinking that possibly also but not that

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.940 
thinking that possibly also but not that
much<00:00:42.060> guess<00:00:43.060> I'm<00:00:43.330> my<00:00:43.570> that's<00:00:43.840> right<00:00:44.110> you<00:00:44.320> win

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
much guess I'm my that's right you win

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.760 
much guess I'm my that's right you win
the<00:00:45.100> race<00:00:45.250> today<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:46.510> think<00:00:47.140> that's<00:00:47.350> that's

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
the race today I think that's that's

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.250 
the race today I think that's that's
good<00:00:48.130> feeling<00:00:48.550> on<00:00:48.880> the<00:00:49.120> run<00:00:49.300> rested<00:00:49.720> and<00:00:49.840> a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
good feeling on the run rested and a

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.510 
good feeling on the run rested and a
good<00:00:51.090> right<00:00:52.090> away<00:00:52.300> that<00:00:52.540> 10<00:00:52.870> seconds<00:00:53.520> latonya

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
good right away that 10 seconds latonya

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.180 
good right away that 10 seconds latonya
in<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.540> skating<00:00:56.200> partner<00:00:56.500> upbringing<00:00:56.890> good

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
in the skating partner upbringing good

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.810 
in the skating partner upbringing good
ski<00:00:57.430> so<00:00:57.490> I<00:00:57.730> know<00:00:58.000> it's<00:00:58.210> if<00:00:58.750> I<00:00:58.990> could<00:00:59.710> then<00:00:59.920> be<00:01:00.790> a

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
ski so I know it's if I could then be a

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.049 
ski so I know it's if I could then be a
find<00:01:01.750> them<00:01:01.900> over<00:01:02.470> the<00:01:02.590> top<00:01:02.620> in<00:01:03.310> the<00:01:03.520> climbing<00:01:03.910> I

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
find them over the top in the climbing I

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.490 
find them over the top in the climbing I
knew<00:01:04.210> that<00:01:04.239> it<00:01:04.540> was<00:01:04.689> possible<00:01:04.869> to<00:01:05.140> win<00:01:05.350> the

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
knew that it was possible to win the

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.249 
knew that it was possible to win the
west<00:01:05.650> and<00:01:06.009> I<00:01:06.220> really<00:01:06.670> need<00:01:06.850> some<00:01:06.880> very<00:01:07.869> happy<00:01:08.229> i

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
west and I really need some very happy i

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.190 
west and I really need some very happy i
think<00:01:08.619> it's<00:01:08.770> also<00:01:08.950> important<00:01:09.610> for<00:01:09.640> me<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.200> i'm

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
think it's also important for me and i'm

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.670 
think it's also important for me and i'm
very<00:01:11.560> satisfied<00:01:11.950> as<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:14.170> has<00:01:14.380> been<00:01:14.409> on

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
very satisfied as it has been on

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.330 
very satisfied as it has been on
software<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.840> ski<00:01:17.140> but<00:01:17.170> i<00:01:17.710> think<00:01:18.159> it's

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
software to ski but i think it's

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.940 
software to ski but i think it's
important<00:01:18.880> for<00:01:19.030> us<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:19.390> show<00:01:20.140> that<00:01:20.320> we<00:01:20.560> could

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
important for us to show that we could

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.130 
important for us to show that we could
go<00:01:21.130> either<00:01:21.940> also<00:01:22.450> me<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:22.780> Vanessa<00:01:23.430> yeah<00:01:25.140> today

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
go either also me and Vanessa yeah today

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.920 
go either also me and Vanessa yeah today
we<00:01:26.350> beat<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:26.950> I<00:01:27.310> beat<00:01:27.670> once<00:01:28.090> again<00:01:28.270> I<00:01:28.570> and<00:01:28.750> she

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
we beat and I beat once again I and she

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.260 
we beat and I beat once again I and she
seemed<00:01:29.200> very<00:01:29.229> good<00:01:29.740> their<00:01:29.920> shape<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:30.270> since

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
seemed very good their shape and since

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.540 
seemed very good their shape and since
very<00:01:31.600> strong<00:01:32.170> some<00:01:32.440> way<00:01:32.800> I<00:01:32.830> felt<00:01:33.190> myself

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
very strong some way I felt myself

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
very strong some way I felt myself
sweater<00:01:34.110> yes<00:01:35.110> it's<00:01:35.790> also<00:01:36.790> second<00:01:37.299> that<00:01:37.420> I

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
sweater yes it's also second that I

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.750 
sweater yes it's also second that I
think<00:01:37.840> everything<00:01:38.260> is<00:01:38.530> possible<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:39.430> makes

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
think everything is possible and makes

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.860 
think everything is possible and makes
no<00:01:40.750> we<00:01:40.930> are<00:01:41.020> wasted<00:01:41.470> tomorrow<00:01:41.830> and<00:01:42.250> some<00:01:42.970> good

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
no we are wasted tomorrow and some good

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.200 
no we are wasted tomorrow and some good
races<00:01:44.170> in<00:01:45.010> that<00:01:45.190> don't<00:01:45.400> work<00:01:45.580> so<00:01:45.820> I<00:01:45.850> think

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
races in that don't work so I think

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.390 
races in that don't work so I think
everything<00:01:46.900> it's<00:01:47.200> possible<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:47.920> that<00:01:48.159> man

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
everything it's possible that that man

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.360 
everything it's possible that that man
yeah<00:01:48.940> I'm<00:01:49.630> very<00:01:49.690> happy<00:01:50.260> to<00:01:50.290> win<00:01:50.590> too

i'm<00:01:59.630> not<00:02:00.050> in<00:02:00.229> bad<00:02:00.830> shape<00:02:00.860> for<00:02:01.430> sure<00:02:01.610> huh<00:02:01.820> but

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
i'm not in bad shape for sure huh but

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.410 
i'm not in bad shape for sure huh but
maybe<00:02:03.080> I<00:02:03.260> was<00:02:03.619> a<00:02:04.100> bit<00:02:04.220> better<00:02:04.610> before<00:02:04.850> I<00:02:05.090> was

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
maybe I was a bit better before I was

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.880 
maybe I was a bit better before I was
seeking<00:02:06.320> in<00:02:06.950> rolla<00:02:07.430> across<00:02:08.149> but<00:02:09.110> it's<00:02:09.530> hard<00:02:09.800> to

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
seeking in rolla across but it's hard to

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.870 
seeking in rolla across but it's hard to
say<00:02:10.039> that<00:02:10.399> I'm<00:02:10.729> not<00:02:11.030> in<00:02:11.239> bad<00:02:11.780> shape<00:02:11.810> perhaps

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
say that I'm not in bad shape perhaps

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.449 
say that I'm not in bad shape perhaps
but<00:02:13.880> maybe<00:02:14.569> I<00:02:14.690> was<00:02:14.870> livid<00:02:15.380> strongly<00:02:15.770> in<00:02:16.400> the

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
but maybe I was livid strongly in the

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.989 
but maybe I was livid strongly in the
horse<00:02:17.420> listen
