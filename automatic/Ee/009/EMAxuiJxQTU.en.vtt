look like the ones they are you know
just<00:04:44.740> pretty<00:04:45.279> much<00:04:45.400> basically<00:04:45.819> in<00:04:45.969> the<00:04:46.060> game<00:04:46.210> I

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
just pretty much basically in the game I

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.969 
just pretty much basically in the game I
wish<00:04:46.539> these<00:04:46.749> guys<00:04:46.960> would<00:04:47.169> turn<00:04:47.529> around<00:04:47.800> but

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
wish these guys would turn around but

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.950 
wish these guys would turn around but
this<00:04:48.789> is<00:04:48.879> pretty<00:04:48.999> much<00:04:49.060> how<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.300> zombies<00:04:49.659> look

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
this is pretty much how the zombies look

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.450 
this is pretty much how the zombies look
I<00:04:50.110> was<00:04:50.259> kind<00:04:50.439> of<00:04:50.469> hoping<00:04:50.590> I<00:04:50.800> can<00:04:50.860> hit<00:04:51.099> that<00:04:51.279> one

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
I was kind of hoping I can hit that one

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.679 
I was kind of hoping I can hit that one
over<00:04:51.639> there<00:04:51.759> but<00:04:51.939> this<00:04:52.060> one<00:04:52.210> keeps<00:04:52.389> bumping

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:52.689 
over there but this one keeps bumping

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:53.909 
over there but this one keeps bumping
into<00:04:52.930> ball<00:04:53.139> here<00:04:53.289> we<00:04:53.349> go<00:04:53.439> here<00:04:53.590> we<00:04:53.620> go<00:04:53.680> here<00:04:53.770> we

alright I guess he's not gonna turn
around<00:04:57.939> but<00:04:58.389> necks<00:04:58.569> we're<00:04:58.659> gonna<00:04:58.750> spawn<00:04:58.960> up

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
around but necks we're gonna spawn up

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.450 
around but necks we're gonna spawn up
the<00:04:59.139> skeletons<00:04:59.680> and<00:04:59.860> as<00:04:59.949> you<00:05:00.039> can<00:05:00.159> clearly<00:05:00.370> see

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
the skeletons and as you can clearly see

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.580 
the skeletons and as you can clearly see
here<00:05:00.939> skeletons<00:05:01.810> themselves<00:05:02.259> don't<00:05:02.439> have<00:05:02.560> a

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
here skeletons themselves don't have a

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.260 
here skeletons themselves don't have a
face<00:05:02.830> but<00:05:03.069> they're<00:05:03.250> blue<00:05:03.550> I<00:05:03.759> think<00:05:04.150> they're

smooth as you can clearly see from the

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.709 
smooth as you can clearly see from the
blocks<00:05:57.699> around<00:05:57.879> looks<00:05:58.330> like<00:05:58.419> it<00:05:58.509> was<00:05:58.599> just

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
blocks around looks like it was just

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.320 
blocks around looks like it was just
traced<00:05:59.050> but<00:05:59.680> everything<00:06:00.039> else<00:06:00.219> is<00:06:00.370> spot-on<00:06:00.909> I

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330
