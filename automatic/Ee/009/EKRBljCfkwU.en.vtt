00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.020
 now I am pascasio stopped a tux 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.899
 dotcom and today I'm going to teach how 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.259
 boot from dvd live wear use of life 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.610
 to install ubuntu 13.04 as already 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.919
 you have seen in these previous videos 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.260
 I have explained first how to download 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.610
 the image after how to check that the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.270
 image that we have downloaded is correct 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.980
 and finally today I'm going to teach how 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.090
 start dice from the image that we have 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.940
 created from ubuntu 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:33.280
 if you start it and it does not start, for example 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.760
 in this case of windows live and 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.190
 makes new web start a version 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.470
 old or windows and you have installed is 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.690
 because you have the computer that first 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.040
 the hard drive comes out and after 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.710
 everything else if the son only has one 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:52.270
 operating system not to boot from 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.580
 the card reader process like what 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.370
 we make for ubuntu read first of the 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.440
 cd and then either hard drive as there 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.440
 two forms or we configure the acp in 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.780
 the bios of the computer so that 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.960
 say them first read me the CD player 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.700
 and then read my hard drive or 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.950
 directly we give a button that we 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.320
 says the computer to decide where 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.610
 want us to start the computer 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.350
 for example we say we are left first 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.330
 of cdi or starting from the pendrive 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.660
 how do you do that food 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.100
 basically we turn off we're going to attend and 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.560
 down here they put us that button we have 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.930
 what to press depends on the computer 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.510
 computer brand the bios and the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.060
 buttons that are your sf 27 12 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.070
 suppress depends on my case it's f 2 for 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.200
 God and this 12 to allocate 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.480
 boot we press efe 12 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.120
 in my case and the two thousand cases and 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.300
 we say to start directly we say 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:50.280
 that the dvd because I have a dvd 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.090
 it depends on him, the good thing is that 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.430
 it means next time 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.760
 starts even if we have a dvd tucked 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.920
 with the image a disc the image of a 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.660
 nova operating system starts from there 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.270
 but we 're going to boot the hard drive 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.880
 if we modify the bios always and first 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.590
 is the reader and then the hard drive and 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.210
 therefore it will take a little longer in 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.550
 start not much but it takes a little 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.160
 more and better is a little uncomfortable that 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.140
 let's have a pendrive with one with one 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.340
 distribution and we have to disconnect 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.380
 always because if it will not start 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.080
 first of pendrive so if we do 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.430
 this way saying the start 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.940
 directly does it the first time and already 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.920
 is 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.290
 we already say that the boot dvds but already 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.370
 from now on do what the way 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:37.390
 is set up we say lacking vd 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.870
 to give him the DVD before the hard drive and 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.730
 you will see that it is a dvd with ubuntu 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.250
 in this case 13.04 and it starts truth 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.160
 I estimate yes 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.760
 and now we have to wait for the 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.750
 dvd live and next the next pool 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.360
 I will explain how to install it and good as 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.580
 configure it to our liking but already with 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.890
 this will more or less know how to create this 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.870
 delight as it starts from live and good and 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.630
 so you can look, because today a 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.570
 3.04 so a little bit how does the 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.830
 dvd live usb live so nothing 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.730
 I waited until a little to finish 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:23.770
 the video of the extraction and we already 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.770
 we see in your dot puntocom a greeting
