00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
to get infinite powered rails so this

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.939 
to get infinite powered rails so this
saves<00:00:09.240> on<00:00:09.420> all<00:00:09.600> your<00:00:09.809> redstone<00:00:09.959> all<00:00:10.469> your<00:00:10.709> gold

all<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.490> need<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.670> do<00:00:17.790> this<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.150> make<00:00:18.390> this

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
all you need to do this is make this

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.300 
all you need to do this is make this
machine<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.290> I'll<00:00:19.380> build<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.890> second

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
machine and I'll build it in a second

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.350 
machine and I'll build it in a second
I'm<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.520> going<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.760> show<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.330> works

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
I'm just going to show you that it works

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.940 
I'm just going to show you that it works
first<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.550> if<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.670> just<00:00:23.850> put<00:00:24.030> myself<00:00:24.180> in

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
first so if I just put myself in

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.680 
first so if I just put myself in
survival<00:00:25.950> which<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.190> game<00:00:26.340> at<00:00:26.490> zero<00:00:26.700> and<00:00:26.970> we

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 
survival which is game at zero and we

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.930 
survival which is game at zero and we
flick<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.350> on<00:00:28.530> switch<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:29.640> sit<00:00:29.910> here

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
flick the on switch and we just sit here

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.380 
flick the on switch and we just sit here
and<00:00:30.330> hold<00:00:30.600> right<00:00:31.020> click<00:00:31.730> it<00:00:32.730> will<00:00:32.910> duplicate

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
and hold right click it will duplicate

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.300 
and hold right click it will duplicate
rails<00:00:33.690> by<00:00:34.050> itself<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.710> if<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:34.860> just<00:00:35.010> turn<00:00:35.220> it

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310 
rails by itself so if we just turn it

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.750 
rails by itself so if we just turn it
off<00:00:35.400> now

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
off now

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.240 
off now
we<00:00:36.270> should<00:00:36.570> see<00:00:36.810> that<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.079> had<00:00:37.560> 16<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.190> start

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
we should see that I had 16 to start

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.550 
we should see that I had 16 to start
with<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.450> now<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.350> 25<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:42.230> you're<00:00:43.230> needed

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:43.560 
with and now I have 25 so you're needed

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.050 
with and now I have 25 so you're needed
to<00:00:43.620> make<00:00:43.739> one<00:00:44.040> little<00:00:44.190> snack<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.730> need<00:00:44.940> to

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
to make one little snack so you need to

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.030 
to make one little snack so you need to
use<00:00:45.149> one<00:00:45.420> redstone<00:00:45.660> one<00:00:46.170> gold<00:00:46.470> to<00:00:46.739> make<00:00:46.860> your

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
use one redstone one gold to make your

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.350 
use one redstone one gold to make your
first<00:00:47.190> stack<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.640> then<00:00:47.730> you've<00:00:47.850> got<00:00:47.970> infinite

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
first stack and then you've got infinite

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.510 
first stack and then you've got infinite
powered<00:00:48.720> rails<00:00:48.899> forever<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.980> let<00:00:50.309> me<00:00:50.370> just

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
powered rails forever so let me just

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.819 
powered rails forever so let me just
show<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.760> again<00:00:51.000> I've<00:00:51.149> got<00:00:51.270> 25<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.140> we

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
show you that again I've got 25 and we

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.670 
show you that again I've got 25 and we
should<00:00:53.130> roughly<00:00:54.120> double<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:54.989> number<00:00:55.140> it's

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
should roughly double that number it's

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.360 
should roughly double that number it's
not<00:00:55.800> always<00:00:56.130> double<00:00:56.489> fur<00:00:57.649> it's<00:00:58.649> roundabout

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
not always double fur it's roundabout

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.040 
not always double fur it's roundabout
little<00:00:59.670> pretty<00:00:59.910> much<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:00.570> turn<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.870> off

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
little pretty much so just turn that off

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.219 
little pretty much so just turn that off
again<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.670> see<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.760> got<00:01:02.879> 24<00:01:03.420> already<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.079> then

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
again you see we got 24 already and then

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.809 
again you see we got 24 already and then
we<00:01:04.320> still<00:01:04.530> got<00:01:04.680> more<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.920> pick<00:01:05.069> up<00:01:05.249> so<00:01:05.459> we<00:01:05.609> have

00:01:05.809 --> 00:01:05.819 
we still got more to pick up so we have

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:09.770 
we still got more to pick up so we have
38<00:01:06.630> now<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.280> almost<00:01:08.280> not<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:08.880> double<00:01:09.479> you

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
38 now so almost not really double you

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.870 
38 now so almost not really double you
know<00:01:09.810> close<00:01:10.289> enough

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
know close enough

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.800 
know close enough
so<00:01:11.880> now<00:01:12.030> let's<00:01:12.689> build<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.499> thing<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.219> I<00:01:14.810> hope

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
so now let's build the thing and I hope

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.139 
so now let's build the thing and I hope
those<00:01:15.929> Pistons<00:01:16.350> didn't<00:01:16.649> deafen<00:01:17.039> you<00:01:17.069> so<00:01:17.549> I'll

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
those Pistons didn't deafen you so I'll

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.899 
those Pistons didn't deafen you so I'll
fix<00:01:18.539> that<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.200> doesn't<00:01:19.579> but<00:01:20.579> all<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.789> need

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
fix that if it doesn't but all you need

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.309 
fix that if it doesn't but all you need
to<00:01:20.969> do<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.270> grab<00:01:21.569> any<00:01:21.779> block<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.170> your<00:01:22.259> choice

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
to do is grab any block of your choice

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:23.779 
to do is grab any block of your choice
it<00:01:22.649> doesn't<00:01:22.889> really<00:01:23.039> matter<00:01:23.310> what<00:01:23.429> it<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.609> I'm

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
it doesn't really matter what it is I'm

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:25.219 
it doesn't really matter what it is I'm
using<00:01:23.909> quartz<00:01:24.389> because<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.630> looks<00:01:24.899> the<00:01:25.049> best

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
using quartz because it looks the best

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.809 
using quartz because it looks the best
and<00:01:25.529> you<00:01:26.429> just<00:01:26.549> need<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.819> get<00:01:27.829> one<00:01:28.829> block<00:01:29.069> glass

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
and you just need to get one block glass

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.209 
and you just need to get one block glass
one<00:01:30.329> block<00:01:30.569> and<00:01:31.139> then<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.590> need<00:01:31.709> to<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:31.889> three

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
one block and then we need to do three

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.669 
one block and then we need to do three
there<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.819> then<00:01:33.029> put<00:01:33.299> rails<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:34.109> top<00:01:34.349> and

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
there and then put rails on top and

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:36.050 
there and then put rails on top and
that's<00:01:34.859> easy<00:01:35.069> enough<00:01:35.189> like<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.639> and<00:01:35.849> there's

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
that's easy enough like that and there's

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.660 
that's easy enough like that and there's
that<00:01:36.149> XP<00:01:36.899> it's<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.439> slowly<00:01:37.889> creeping<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.549> me

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
that XP it's like slowly creeping on me

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.769 
that XP it's like slowly creeping on me
I<00:01:38.700> can<00:01:38.909> see<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.179> in<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.329> corner<00:01:39.569> of<00:01:39.630> my<00:01:39.749> eye

00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:39.779 
I can see it in the corner of my eye

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:44.209 
I can see it in the corner of my eye
I'll<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:40.799> grab<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.719> and<00:01:42.719> then<00:01:43.109> from<00:01:43.319> here<00:01:43.349> you

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
I'll just grab it and then from here you

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:45.679 
I'll just grab it and then from here you
just<00:01:44.249> come<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.639> the<00:01:44.729> front<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:45.179> the<00:01:45.299> rails<00:01:45.479> so

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
just come to the front of the rails so

just come to the front of the rails so
this<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.109> the<00:01:46.200> front<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.649> machine

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:46.919 
this is like the front of the machine

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:48.739 
this is like the front of the machine
right<00:01:47.099> here<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.520> put<00:01:47.729> another<00:01:48.060> block<00:01:48.209> down<00:01:48.479> and

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:48.749 
right here we put another block down and

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:57.349 
there and then we put blocks on top of
them<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.069> get<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:56.880> too<00:01:57.119> fast

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
and we just come to behind the redstone

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.900 
and we just come to behind the redstone
block<00:02:05.279> here<00:02:05.609> and<00:02:06.319> place<00:02:07.319> two<00:02:07.619> blocks<00:02:07.919> on<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
block here and place two blocks on the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.760 
block here and place two blocks on the
left<00:02:09.210> hand<00:02:09.479> when<00:02:10.259> we're<00:02:10.410> looking<00:02:10.619> at<00:02:10.710> the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
left hand when we're looking at the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.890 
left hand when we're looking at the
front<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.190> left<00:02:11.370> hand<00:02:11.580> side<00:02:11.790> right<00:02:11.820> there<00:02:12.060> and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
front the left hand side right there and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.860 
front the left hand side right there and
we<00:02:13.050> put<00:02:13.290> one<00:02:13.560> red

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
we put one red

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.990 
we put one red
there<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.409> then<00:02:14.560> we<00:02:14.650> bring<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.099> around<00:02:15.220> up<00:02:15.790> top

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
there and then we bring it around up top

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.750 
there and then we bring it around up top
like<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:17.470> we<00:02:17.739> put<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:17.980> lever<00:02:18.310> right<00:02:18.580> here

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
like that and we put a lever right here

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.270 
like that and we put a lever right here
and<00:02:19.360> this<00:02:19.510> will<00:02:19.690> toggle<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.590> on<00:02:20.709> and<00:02:20.799> off<00:02:21.040> let

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
and this will toggle it on and off let

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.500 
and this will toggle it on and off let
you<00:02:21.370> see<00:02:21.549> so<00:02:22.269> like<00:02:22.540> blinks<00:02:22.989> not<00:02:23.769> blinks<00:02:24.510> then
