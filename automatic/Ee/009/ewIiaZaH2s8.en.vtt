hassle and stuff but broad jelly beans
just<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.510> much<00:01:12.659> better<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.220> then<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> iPhone

so next let the display on these two on
these<00:01:29.579> three<00:01:29.759> devices<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> nexus<00:01:30.990> 4

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
these three devices is that the nexus 4

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.160 
these three devices is that the nexus 4
you<00:01:31.320> get<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> 4.7<00:01:32.220> inch<00:01:32.490> IPS<00:01:32.700> display<00:01:33.170> with

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
wxga 1280 by 768 pixels and which comes

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.760 
wxga 1280 by 768 pixels and which comes
out<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> about<00:01:41.790> 320<00:01:42.509> pixels<00:01:42.899> per<00:01:43.079> inch<00:01:43.110> um

out to about 320 pixels per inch um

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.109 
out to about 320 pixels per inch um
compared<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.009> galaxy<00:01:47.399> s3<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.090> a

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
compared to the galaxy s3 that is a

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.060 
compared to the galaxy s3 that is a
little<00:01:48.360> bit<00:01:48.509> better<00:01:48.689> because<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.740> screen<00:01:50.009> is

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
little bit better because the screen is

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.429 
little bit better because the screen is
point<00:01:51.000> one<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.210> an<00:01:51.360> inch<00:01:51.509> smaller<00:01:51.630> which<00:01:52.170> makes

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
point one of an inch smaller which makes

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.030 
point one of an inch smaller which makes
the<00:01:52.590> pic<00:01:52.799> pixel<00:01:53.460> density<00:01:54.320> smaller<00:01:55.320> causing

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the pic pixel density smaller causing

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.510 
the pic pixel density smaller causing
the<00:01:56.130> screen<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.579> more<00:01:56.850> vivid<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.540> more

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
the screen to be more vivid and more

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.670 
the screen to be more vivid and more
bright<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.549> guess<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.509> with<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.990> galaxy<00:02:01.350> s3

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
bright I guess and with the galaxy s3

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.889 
bright I guess and with the galaxy s3
you<00:02:01.799> get<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.100> Super<00:02:02.460> AMOLED<00:02:02.490> HD<00:02:03.060> screen<00:02:03.689> is

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
you get the Super AMOLED HD screen is

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
screen which is garbage complete garbage

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.880 
screen which is garbage complete garbage
but<00:02:17.489> it's<00:02:17.700> pixels<00:02:18.060> per<00:02:18.269> inch<00:02:18.300> are<00:02:18.599> 326<00:02:19.440> because

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
but it's pixels per inch are 326 because

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.780 
but it's pixels per inch are 326 because
it's<00:02:20.610> smaller<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.599> if<00:02:22.590> iphone<00:02:23.430> 5<00:02:23.610> was

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
it's smaller so if iphone 5 was

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.130 
it's smaller so if iphone 5 was
stretched<00:02:24.090> out<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.510> would<00:02:24.599> be<00:02:24.720> terrible

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
stretched out it would be terrible

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.089 
stretched out it would be terrible
because<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.620> has<00:02:25.769> like<00:02:25.950> 200<00:02:26.550> pixels<00:02:26.849> per<00:02:27.090> inch

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
because it has like 200 pixels per inch

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.890 
because it has like 200 pixels per inch

processor<00:02:43.920> i<00:02:44.489> believe<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:44.970> it's<00:02:45.900> clock<00:02:46.440> down

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
processor i believe and it's clock down

processor i believe and it's clock down
1.4<00:02:47.069> of<00:02:47.160> goods<00:02:47.660> but<00:02:48.660> with<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.900> US<00:02:49.140> version<00:02:49.319> get

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
1.4 of goods but with the US version get

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.559 
1.4 of goods but with the US version get
1.5<00:02:50.220> gigahertz<00:02:50.670> dual-core<00:02:51.410> which<00:02:52.970> isn't<00:02:53.970> the

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
1.5 gigahertz dual-core which isn't the

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.240 
1.5 gigahertz dual-core which isn't the
fastest<00:02:54.989> but<00:02:55.200> it's<00:02:55.349> still<00:02:55.530> pretty<00:02:55.590> fast<00:02:56.010> but

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
fastest but it's still pretty fast but

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.390 
fastest but it's still pretty fast but
with<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:56.730> iphone<00:02:57.569> 5<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:59.310> get<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.239> a6<00:03:00.870> chip

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
with the iphone 5 you get the a6 chip

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.470 
with the iphone 5 you get the a6 chip
which<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:02.579> funny<00:03:02.790> because<00:03:03.000> it's<00:03:03.239> only<00:03:03.390> a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
which is funny because it's only a

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.539 
which is funny because it's only a
dual-core<00:03:04.049> and<00:03:04.230> it's<00:03:04.380> only<00:03:04.650> like<00:03:04.799> a<00:03:04.980> gig<00:03:05.340> of

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
dual-core and it's only like a gig of

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.190 
dual-core and it's only like a gig of
ram<00:03:05.610> which<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.329> absolutely<00:03:06.930> terrible<00:03:07.200> and

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
ram which is absolutely terrible and

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.620 
ram which is absolutely terrible and
next<00:03:10.200> let's<00:03:10.410> move<00:03:10.530> on<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.609> memory<00:03:12.420> and

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
next let's move on to the memory and

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.470 
next let's move on to the memory and
that<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.650> have<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:14.370> nexus<00:03:14.640> 4<00:03:14.880> can<00:03:15.060> have<00:03:15.239> eight

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
that to have the nexus 4 can have eight

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.599 
that to have the nexus 4 can have eight
gigs<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.049> 16<00:03:16.440> gigs<00:03:16.620> with<00:03:16.859> non<00:03:17.040> expandable

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
gigs and 16 gigs with non expandable

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.090 
gigs and 16 gigs with non expandable
memory<00:03:17.640> which<00:03:18.600> means<00:03:18.870> there's<00:03:19.079> no<00:03:19.140> less<00:03:19.380> micro

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
memory which means there's no less micro

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.059 
memory which means there's no less micro
SD<00:03:21.030> card<00:03:21.269> slot<00:03:21.329> and<00:03:21.810> no<00:03:22.200> SD<00:03:22.500> card<00:03:22.889> slot

SD card slot and no SD card slot

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.759 
SD card slot and no SD card slot
obviously<00:03:23.579> so<00:03:24.239> what<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.170> buy<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.410> what<00:03:25.680> you

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
get it also comes with two gigs around

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.199 
get it also comes with two gigs around

although apple just makes the products

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.240 
although apple just makes the products
extremely<00:03:54.569> overpriced<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.290> sucks<00:03:56.480> so<00:03:57.480> uh

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
extremely overpriced and sucks so uh

center because Apple that's what they go
for<00:04:16.620> but<00:04:17.579> I<00:04:17.609> honestly<00:04:17.759> don't<00:04:18.209> care<00:04:18.359> if<00:04:18.840> it's

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
for but I honestly don't care if it's

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.060 
for but I honestly don't care if it's
one<00:04:19.199> millimeter<00:04:19.590> thicker<00:04:20.039> or<00:04:20.070> not<00:04:20.900> all<00:04:22.070> bad

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
one millimeter thicker or not all bad

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.390 
one millimeter thicker or not all bad
thing<00:04:23.280> is<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.840> nexus<00:04:24.840> 4<00:04:25.139> doesn't<00:04:25.919> come<00:04:26.160> with

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
thing is the nexus 4 doesn't come with

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.210 
thing is the nexus 4 doesn't come with
LTE<00:04:26.669> only<00:04:27.419> comes<00:04:27.630> with<00:04:27.750> hspa+<00:04:28.680> which<00:04:28.919> can<00:04:29.070> get

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
LTE only comes with hspa+ which can get

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.610

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.570 
with tmobile wind or Mobilicity I
believe<00:04:31.949> um<00:04:33.349> but<00:04:34.349> with<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.590> s3<00:04:34.949> the<00:04:35.099> atom<00:04:35.370> five

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
believe um but with the s3 the atom five

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.990 
believe um but with the s3 the atom five
you<00:04:35.729> can<00:04:35.820> get<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.270> LTE<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.970> HSPA+<00:04:39.349> um<00:04:41.000> NFC

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
you can get the LTE and HSPA+ um NFC

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.540 
you can get the LTE and HSPA+ um NFC
they're<00:04:42.539> all<00:04:42.720> they<00:04:43.229> all<00:04:43.470> have<00:04:43.650> NFC<00:04:43.979> except<00:04:44.460> the

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
they're all they all have NFC except the

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.689 
they're all they all have NFC except the
iphone<00:04:44.940> once<00:04:45.240> again<00:04:45.539> and<00:04:46.009> the<00:04:47.009> virtual<00:04:47.220> system

iphone once again and the virtual system
you<00:04:47.820> get<00:04:48.000> for<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.270> nexus<00:04:48.599> 4<00:04:48.870> is<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.590> google

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
you get for the nexus 4 is the google

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.089 
you get for the nexus 4 is the google
now<00:04:50.280> with<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.449> s3<00:04:51.870> you<00:04:52.020> get<00:04:52.199> the<00:04:52.320> S<00:04:52.440> voice<00:04:52.710> and

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
now with the s3 you get the S voice and

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.089 
now with the s3 you get the S voice and
with<00:04:53.250> iphone<00:04:53.669> 5<00:04:53.849> you<00:04:54.030> get<00:04:54.150> Siri<00:04:54.449> obviously<00:04:55.259> but

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
with iphone 5 you get Siri obviously but

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.100 
with iphone 5 you get Siri obviously but
the<00:04:56.220> best<00:04:56.400> thing<00:04:56.520> about<00:04:56.759> these<00:04:57.060> above<00:04:57.870> the

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
the best thing about these above the

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.499 
the best thing about these above the
nexus<00:04:58.470> 4<00:04:58.740> is<00:04:58.949> that<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.580> price<00:04:59.820> is<00:04:59.880> only<00:05:00.270> going

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
nexus 4 is that the price is only going

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:03.710 
nexus 4 is that the price is only going
to<00:05:00.570> start<00:05:00.810> at<00:05:00.900> 299<00:05:01.560> from<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:02.550> eight<00:05:02.729> gig<00:05:02.940> 349

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
to start at 299 from the eight gig 349

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.249 
to start at 299 from the eight gig 349
for<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.139> 16<00:05:04.620> oh<00:05:05.389> that<00:05:06.389> is<00:05:06.509> like<00:05:06.780> four<00:05:07.110> hundred

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
for the 16 oh that is like four hundred

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.890 
for the 16 oh that is like four hundred
dollars<00:05:07.440> cheaper<00:05:07.830> than<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.250> s3<00:05:09.060> and<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.360> f-15

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
dollars cheaper than the s3 and the f-15

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.060 
dollars cheaper than the s3 and the f-15
because<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:10.979> s3<00:05:11.370> is<00:05:11.750> 599<00:05:12.750> off<00:05:13.110> contract<00:05:13.740> for

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
because the s3 is 599 off contract for

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.290 
because the s3 is 599 off contract for
the<00:05:14.220> 16<00:05:14.729> gig<00:05:14.940> on<00:05:15.199> the<00:05:16.199> iphone<00:05:16.680> 5<00:05:16.889> 16<00:05:17.159> gig<00:05:17.550> is<00:05:17.669> 649

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
the 16 gig on the iphone 5 16 gig is 649

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.330 
the 16 gig on the iphone 5 16 gig is 649
so<00:05:18.930> obviously<00:05:19.289> you<00:05:19.440> can<00:05:19.590> see<00:05:19.800> that<00:05:20.009> there's<00:05:20.280> a

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
so obviously you can see that there's a

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.149 
so obviously you can see that there's a
huge<00:05:20.849> difference<00:05:21.090> in<00:05:21.509> what<00:05:22.050> you<00:05:22.169> get<00:05:23.090> but<00:05:24.090> um

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
huge difference in what you get but um

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:26.990 
huge difference in what you get but um
you're<00:05:26.159> probably<00:05:26.370> going<00:05:26.580> to<00:05:26.639> get<00:05:26.759> a<00:05:26.820> better

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
you're probably going to get a better

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.120 
you're probably going to get a better
deal<00:05:27.690> if<00:05:27.750> you<00:05:27.900> go<00:05:28.110> off<00:05:28.259> of<00:05:28.409> the<00:05:28.500> nexus<00:05:28.800> 4

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
deal if you go off of the nexus 4

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.700 
deal if you go off of the nexus 4
because<00:05:29.490> it<00:05:29.909> just<00:05:30.060> has<00:05:30.300> the<00:05:30.539> best<00:05:30.750> operating

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
because it just has the best operating

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.730 
because it just has the best operating
system<00:05:32.099> has<00:05:32.759> the<00:05:33.000> best<00:05:33.120> hardware<00:05:33.539> has<00:05:34.470> the
