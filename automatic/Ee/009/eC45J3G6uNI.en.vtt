00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.010
 as 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:35.810
 I say hello to all cup and reading away from 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.040
 Comics topic has not been reviewed for a long time 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.130
 some kind of comic 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.200
 and here the other day I came across such 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.830
 a comic called deadpool vs 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.690
 carnage or kanash against deadpool on my 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.239
 channel a lot of deadpool so deadpool 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.190
 hawala in the carnage he's my best not such at 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.340
 peaceful super hero but somebody his 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.440
 a lot on my channel but the comics are related 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.540
 with deadpool always always me personally 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.370
 think so in general let's go 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:07.190
 comic 18 + and we start and everything starts 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.440
 to store the scene does not 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.229
 noteworthy such a shop to 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.990
 those who are on the road who decides to buy or 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.229
 there to eat on the road and we see that 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.920
 this dude with a mustache is reading a newspaper where 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.320
 it is written that carnage escaped from prison and 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.280
 Apparently according to the reader not the first 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.410
 Of course this is the same carnage 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.620
 citizen he thinks he should 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.750
 kill than pour into prison but in this 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.750
 moment some person objects to them he 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.510
 thinks it is wrong and it is nobody 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.900
 sometimes the carnage who killed it 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:48.830
 poor barbel face he just bummed 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:53.000
 face 18 + by the way want to warn 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:56.450
 really there are a lot of scenes and hard but all 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.280
 so you look mean so cool carlos 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.470
 not going to stop suddenly 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.570
 there are three dudes pitching which 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.180
 think they can beat 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.340
 cripple this super scared or just 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.849
 killer cars then just tell me 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.830
 what kind of person should be stupid to 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.290
 understand that you can not mess with 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.170
 a man who shoots his face better 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.209
 I had to run there, not a hall to fight with 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.650
 them and of course carnage them just 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.860
 scatters 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.019
 he just punches the bodies with his hand and 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.659
 aim at others than not 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.879
 guilty visitors it is very 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.340
 wrong and on that note we 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.349
 jump to deadpool which looks 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.170
 telly which apparently awaits the game of thrones 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.209
 This is to the fact that the news says that 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.879
 this life happens at this store 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:48.319
 this pool is so about the game of thrones so 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:51.849
 and this is not thrones this is carnage 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.650
 A questionnaire on this as he do not care 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.349
 switches to other channels in search 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.310
 This is a mix. By the way, it is not very bad. 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:03.680
 actress so here's a grandfather to switch channels and 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.200
 breaks the jackpot he says out loud to him 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.519
 need to do and the universe gives it 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:14.030
 hint of course need to find kill 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.950
 destroy your man twin 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.739
 can say carnage 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.549
 but for this we must first find a deadpool 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:25.340
 relies only on the universe which 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:28.430
 will tell him the way nonsense what so on 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.440
 nobody recognizes him in the street 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.349
 somehow purple it's deadpool and personally 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.780
 i will be met i would even know what 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.329
 I did, but generally can not be so 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.549
 to deadpool while his photo is he noticing 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.199
 an old man whose sole is in the blood 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.629
 the sole is in his blood since he 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:46.840
 It works as a butcher does from it 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:50.239
 outraged goldfinch sweat 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.040
 teenager who seems fired and he 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.079
 goes to the store and behind them the deadpool 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.659
 the store this teenager buys water 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.120
 or juice something there buys this see 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.099
 man again a goldfish who plays 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.989
 computer but not computer is gaming 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.849
 machine and it seems he plays street 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.579
 fighter recently by the way such machines do not 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.620
 saw in general he looks no sweat 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.349
 resent sitting and looking at such 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.169
 how they will look and see the newspaper 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.280
 where is the address written to exposing of course 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:19.130
 deadpool breaks the bank 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.590
 from here we teleport to the knife 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.080
 hence the deck will now appear 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.030
 carnosine seems only awake he in 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.100
 underpants and he's very wiry by the way 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.770
 and honestly for me he lives in the game could 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.910
 he kill there know a businessman and take 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.430
 house itself more abruptly he could have killed him for 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.460
 tony stark and son in law tower of the avengers 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.340
 so while carnage show off 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.580
 the fact that he escaped can escape and 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.950
 any prison and white shoot him out 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.740
 bazookas and well done he got to the article 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:55.490
 bullseye of course it finds out that carnage 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:58.220
 how yong this is that he had a regeneration 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.310
 and goes to finish him as always between 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.810
 them divine fight fight of two 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.580
 inadequate they believe that this pool 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.460
 inadequate he is a bit nutty 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.150
 and crazy and inadequate when cranes are almost 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.880
 won wade then shoves him in here 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.000
 grenade and from that it explodes carnage 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.280
 explodes into pieces but cass explosion a 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.210
 Deadpool's trading fingers are very sorry for 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.330
 they grow up 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.400
 crucible regeneration deadpool was already close 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.380
 to what cut your head to a knife like 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.450
 what kind of person suddenly appears again 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.900
 prevents him from this man shoots him in 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.620
 face his face explodes and the same on 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.220
 carnage 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:39.680
 that's so unfair it turns out but I am so 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.320
 I think two for one by the way wife to 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.540
 exposing has super powers some 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.090
 metal i don't know exactly because 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.700
 I'm not fond of carnage not family then 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.860
 having passed now I will have to hope you 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.170
 liked the comic do not forget to put 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:58.420
 Like the video and wait for the second part with you 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.420
 to all good luck was the world 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.610
 and
