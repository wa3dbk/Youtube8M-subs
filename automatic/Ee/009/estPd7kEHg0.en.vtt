00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
fuse holder we ship them with the fuses

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.360 
fuse holder we ship them with the fuses
out<00:00:55.539> but<00:00:56.019> funnier<00:00:56.499> things<00:00:56.739> have<00:00:56.980> happened

you<00:00:59.109> connect<00:00:59.499> power<00:01:00.390> okay<00:01:01.390> we'll<00:01:01.539> go<00:01:01.659> ahead

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
you connect power okay we'll go ahead

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:11.319 
you connect power okay we'll go ahead
and<00:01:01.989> hook<00:01:02.409> up<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:02.710> battery

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.370 

again<00:01:12.329> you<00:01:12.450> want<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.659> make<00:01:12.719> sure<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.170> drop

bike<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.229> fuse<00:01:16.530> holder<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.759> right

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
bike the fuse holder so it is right

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.789 
bike the fuse holder so it is right
there<00:01:18.060> with<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.539> rest<00:01:18.719> of<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:18.990> bikes<00:01:19.229> fuses

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
there with the rest of your bikes fuses

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:28.209 
there with the rest of your bikes fuses
and<00:01:24.829> that<00:01:25.829> you<00:01:25.979> got<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.280> good<00:01:26.459> and<00:01:26.609> tight<00:01:27.140> and

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
next we'll run the ground wire you plug

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.160 
next we'll run the ground wire you plug
this<00:01:32.250> into<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.909> other<00:01:33.390> side<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.959> amp

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
this into the other side of the amp

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.109 
this into the other side of the amp
again<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.039> power<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.609> ground<00:01:41.119> that

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
again you have power and ground that

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.520 
again you have power and ground that
looks<00:01:42.329> good<00:01:44.509> you<00:01:45.509> want<00:01:45.719> to<00:01:45.780> run<00:01:45.929> the<00:01:46.049> wire<00:01:46.200> back

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
looks good you want to run the wire back

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.100 
looks good you want to run the wire back
down<00:01:47.030> because<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.569> going<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.810> ground

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
down because this is going to ground

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.899 
down because this is going to ground
right<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.739> neck<00:01:49.979> your<00:01:50.280> bike<00:01:52.700> now<00:01:53.700> that

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
