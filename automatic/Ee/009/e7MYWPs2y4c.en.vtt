the master cleanse for me and I chose
this<00:00:10.530> week<00:00:10.889> because<00:00:11.250> my<00:00:11.940> husband<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.750> away<00:00:13.080> for

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
the entire week and it would make it

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.279 
the entire week and it would make it
