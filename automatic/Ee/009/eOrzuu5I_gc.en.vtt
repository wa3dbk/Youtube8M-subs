can't get on until later in the spring
we<00:00:33.860> used<00:00:34.100> to<00:00:34.250> use<00:00:34.430> a<00:00:34.790> row<00:00:35.660> board<00:00:35.899> plows<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:36.590> a

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
we used to use a row board plows and a

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.340 
we used to use a row board plows and a
rotor<00:00:36.860> tiller<00:00:37.130> to<00:00:37.460> do<00:00:37.610> all<00:00:37.760> our<00:00:38.210> fields<00:00:38.600> very

small residue we use a planet junior

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.680 
small residue we use a planet junior
planter<00:00:41.810> so<00:00:41.990> we<00:00:42.110> had<00:00:42.380> to<00:00:42.590> use<00:00:43.250> a<00:00:43.550> system<00:00:44.420> that

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
planter so we had to use a system that

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.660 
planter so we had to use a system that
had<00:00:44.780> very<00:00:44.930> little<00:00:45.140> residue<00:00:45.230> then<00:00:46.130> as<00:00:46.250> I<00:00:46.400> change

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
had very little residue then as I change

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.420 
had very little residue then as I change
planters<00:00:47.180> we<00:00:47.420> were<00:00:47.510> able<00:00:47.630> to<00:00:47.810> go<00:00:47.990> to<00:00:48.050> a<00:00:48.560> reduced

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
a lot more weeds then we will mow it so

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.300 
a lot more weeds then we will mow it so
that<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.200> length<00:01:30.409> of<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.680> weeds<00:01:30.860> doesn't

tangle up in the chisel plow this is our
chisel<00:01:34.580> plow<00:01:34.820> we<00:01:35.690> converted<00:01:36.049> using<00:01:36.440> this

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
chisel plow we converted using this

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.590 
chisel plow we converted using this
about<00:01:36.890> 20<00:01:37.250> years<00:01:37.400> ago<00:01:37.549> before<00:01:38.240> that<00:01:38.420> we

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
about 20 years ago before that we

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.859 
about 20 years ago before that we
moldboard<00:01:39.080> plowed<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:39.970> harrowed<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.210> then

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
moldboard plowed and harrowed and then

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.840 
moldboard plowed and harrowed and then
we<00:01:41.960> moldboard<00:01:42.350> plowed<00:01:42.650> and<00:01:42.979> rototilled<00:01:43.549> as

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
we moldboard plowed and rototilled as

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.640 
we moldboard plowed and rototilled as
the<00:01:44.060> rotavator<00:01:44.450> or<00:01:44.810> rotor<00:01:45.020> tiller<00:01:45.290> became

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
the rotavator or rotor tiller became

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.730 
the rotavator or rotor tiller became
more<00:01:45.920> prevalent<00:01:46.810> this<00:01:47.810> saves<00:01:48.170> us<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.380> lot<00:01:48.500> of

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
more prevalent this saves us a lot of

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.310 
more prevalent this saves us a lot of
time<00:01:49.010> and<00:01:49.400> it<00:01:49.820> reduces<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.260> fracturing<00:01:51.260> of

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
time and it reduces the fracturing of

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.080 
time and it reduces the fracturing of
the<00:01:51.530> soil<00:01:51.799> or<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.070> beating<00:01:52.549> up<00:01:52.640> with<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:52.880> soil

the soil or the beating up with the soil

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.250 
the soil or the beating up with the soil
I<00:01:53.240> guess<00:01:53.360> is<00:01:53.479> what<00:01:53.600> most<00:01:53.750> people<00:01:53.840> think<00:01:54.170> of

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
I guess is what most people think of

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.000 
I guess is what most people think of

chisels that go in the ground about a
foot<00:02:01.689> you'll<00:02:02.689> make<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:02.869> furrow<00:02:03.200> that<00:02:03.320> kills<00:02:03.799> the

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:03.699 
prep the soil this is the next step in

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.449 
prep the soil this is the next step in
doing<00:04:03.879> that<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:05.260> concept<00:04:05.829> is<00:04:06.069> it<00:04:06.310> has

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
doing that the concept is it has

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.229 
doing that the concept is it has
fertilizer<00:04:06.879> hoppers<00:04:07.949> seed<00:04:08.949> hoppers<00:04:09.400> which

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.119 
fertilizer hoppers seed hoppers which
are<00:04:10.419> the<00:04:10.510> same<00:04:10.720> as<00:04:10.870> any<00:04:10.989> other<00:04:11.079> planter<00:04:11.650> and

are the same as any other planter and
then<00:04:12.459> when<00:04:12.579> we<00:04:12.669> get<00:04:12.790> down<00:04:13.000> to<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.299> working

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
then when we get down to the working

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.439 
then when we get down to the working
unit<00:04:13.989> there's<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.769> shovel<00:04:15.669> that<00:04:16.000> clears<00:04:16.299> the

unit there's a shovel that clears the

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.659 
unit there's a shovel that clears the
trash<00:04:16.690> out<00:04:16.900> of<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.019> way<00:04:17.169> I<00:04:17.349> set<00:04:18.070> a<00:04:18.099> disc<00:04:18.370> and

trash out of the way I set a disc and

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.210 
trash out of the way I set a disc and
opens<00:04:19.329> the<00:04:19.479> trench<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:20.019> then<00:04:20.680> another<00:04:20.859> set<00:04:21.130> of

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
opens the trench and then another set of

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.250 
opens the trench and then another set of
discs<00:04:21.459> that<00:04:21.729> presses<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.300> trench<00:04:22.960> closed

with<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.949> seed<00:04:24.190> in<00:04:24.340> it<00:04:24.460> so<00:04:24.970> it<00:04:25.180> really<00:04:25.210> moves

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
with the seed in it so it really moves

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.180
