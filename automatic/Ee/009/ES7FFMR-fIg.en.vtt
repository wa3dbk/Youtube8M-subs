00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.809

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:34.010
 that we have is in our 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.840
 universe here on June 10 is then 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.000
 We're going to sell the assembly pieces .

 and here in this channel you will learn a 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.320
 how you are going to use these 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.780
 assembly parts already then girls 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.470
 many of you ask me my day to 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.630
 I'm here as a shopkeeper and as a 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.840
 You also ask me, consultant. 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.820
 gabi but it's a trend and this is 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.460
 I did it and I decided to make a video 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.470
 explaining more to you about yourself 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.520
 follows the trend or you follow your 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.100
 style 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.930
 are two very different things and when 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.360
 I thought about doing this life. 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.590
 Actually, I did not have an exact answer. 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.050
 at the time I thought I said my god 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.729
 and now we follow the trend is the 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.260
 people follow our own style 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.110
 Actually, I think both things. 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.360
 okay, or they may not give 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.190
 depending on your universe in the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.740
 Your universe is true that it will 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.420
 say you follow the trend or you 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.790
 follow your own style I have a 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.360
 case of some clients here who are 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:38.420
 well, we do not mean rigid but it's also 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.520
 of r 10 and maybe it would be the word but 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.920
 so they follow much that line that 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.570
 he own style and I have others who 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.510
 are the customers who do the things of 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.909
 modinha the two are right indeed 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.490
 but I think this depends on it 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.799
 the wedding you want with the 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.799
 Your audience wants me to name two 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.080
 examples of two things that is 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.119
 appeared in the trend I followed and 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.920
 appeared in the trend and I did not follow 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.909
 It would be an example of two things to 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.560
 you 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.390
 first we'll talk about two 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.310
 things that are very current that is the 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.620
 tassel pending which are France 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.069
 had this tendency is a tendency that 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.170
 really came strong and there and he does not have 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.480
 Who does not dream to dream these girls? 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.580
 tassel has no one who 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.550
 deny that this was a trend that 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.050
 really came and who caught the wave of 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.940
 took time and took too is okay 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.319
 In this case, for example, I think 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.200
 it was worth following the trend 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.819
 because it's worth following the trend 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.530
 because it's something you're using is 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.560
 one thing the market is asking you 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.330
 ie the market asks you Algarve 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.890
 Have a fringe then you have to give 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.760
 time is a demand of the 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.580
 Marketplace 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.920
 It's something that I identified myself 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.489
 so I liked it so when I think of 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.430
 me as a producer adib I would have already been 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.560
 so I think that if I just go 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.750
 follow the trend if I see that you have a 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.250
 market demand so I will not go 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.019
 give yourself a shot in the dark 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.000
 I'll follow the trend if I see that 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.709
 have demand and have other trends 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.010
 that appear that I have no interest 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.720
 to follow and I 'm a little boring with 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.340
 That's how I saw people. I have some 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.470
 girls too that I know you think a 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.510
 little like me but I'm a little annoying 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.310
 in this connection for example another 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.230
 tendency that I did not follow that I did not 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.750
 I identified that I did not like it and had 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.650
 even requests but I resisted a little was 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.829
 pandora 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.410
 I think the pandora is she has 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.480
 very expensive for jewelry it actually came 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.910
 it is derived in this advice from 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.519
 jewelry are derived from same jewelry 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.130
 is a jewel that is already circulating there in 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.139
 Europe for many years we had 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.480
 pandora running in brazil year 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:50.480
 past for this year 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.970
 and if you are doing a search for 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.709
 market if you go to see old photos of 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.500
 Blog something like this you will see 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.260
 that in 2010 we already had pandora there 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.420
 in Europe so it was not new 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.139
 something totally new and I did not want to 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.420
 to follow then this is very much to do with 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:10.670
 What is your child doing? 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.190
 Are you following or not going to follow the 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.269
 trend and the other side of the coin is yours. 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.389
 own style 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.500
 the style itself i think he is 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.420
 very cool because he has you have 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.280
 on the personality issue of your 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.530
 work then so you are that 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.940
 girl is that accessories design that 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.010
 works with line 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.660
 then you will be known in your environment 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.960
 with that person who works with the line 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.900
 The line that I say is embroidered, let's say 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.550
 so you're the one the designer 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.200
 accessories that work with leather there 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.810
 You go there and everyone else identifies. 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.270
 because you know you work the body 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.150
 I see a good side and one to sleep it 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.770
 I gave birth to this life, I did it alone. 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.600
 so I can show you a little of the 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.460
 that I think about it because in 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.590
 true I think both things are worth 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.570
 It's worth both you and original and follow the 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.490
 your line as long as you follow a 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.560
 trend and I think who will dictate 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.930
 this is your market is your consumer 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.000
 It is your client who is asking you to 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.630
 You're consulting what you've seen in the 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.890
 novela there novel even a theme 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.310
 classic right 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.270
 for example I remember the time of the 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.800
 dinosaur of the soap opera that had 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.120
 dinosaur I remember what was the 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.570
 name of the novel that I do not watch either 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.640
 much the novel bites the soap opera 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.310
 bites and blows asking a dinosaur 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.530
 that the character of adriana esteves 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.140
 used to be an archaeologist in this 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.960
 so she wore a dinosaur zinho 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.400
 so and it was at that time had there in the center 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.500
 here in the center of salvador na carlos 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.900
 gomes and was a dinosaur infestation 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.910
 to all over the place where you saw 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.280
 a girl with a no-go pendant 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.860
 and email dinosaur with the paw of a 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.430
 side and the head of the people I told myself 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.220
 I want 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.160
 I do not want because I can offer this 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.760
 Anything else my customer p 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.460
 sun that will pass six months from now 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.950
 I said 'I do not want to, I'd rather work 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.419
 with timeless parts that in three 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.930
 I'm going to use that piece, I'll say 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.970
 It's original, it's just fashionable. 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.610
 because it is a universal thing and 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.100
 it 's not that very specific thing 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.990
 so this is it and I have clients 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.330
 really that's how it is 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.790
 is so much with a craft work mind 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.200
 the parts they are completely 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.830
 crafts that works at the box office 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.930
 with fimo mass in people who have 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.810
 feature even then in fact I 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.810
 no, no 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.940
 I answered the question that I proposed 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:37.300
 if you follow the trend if you follow 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.940
 your own style and I just put it here 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.950
 some personal opinions and you going 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.680
 decide and on the other side if you must 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:47.050
 follow the trend or your own style 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.760
 consult your market the answer is 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.860
 in your consumer market is good 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.040
