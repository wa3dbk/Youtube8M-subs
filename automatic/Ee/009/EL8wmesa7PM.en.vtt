way up against it because that's pretty
much<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.989> perfect<00:00:43.829> way<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.219> do<00:00:44.430> then<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.420> want

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
much the perfect way to do then you want

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.970 
much the perfect way to do then you want
to<00:00:45.690> look<00:00:45.870> all<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.350> way<00:00:46.440> into<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> bottom

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
to look all the way into the bottom

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.160 
to look all the way into the bottom
left-hand<00:00:47.460> corner<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:48.480> can<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
left-hand corner you can do it in the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.260 
left-hand corner you can do it in the
right-hand<00:00:49.649> corner<00:00:49.829> -<00:00:50.129> but<00:00:50.430> for<00:00:50.700> me<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.120> was

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
right-hand corner - but for me it was

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.729 
right-hand corner - but for me it was
more<00:00:51.449> difficult<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:52.260> do<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
more difficult to do it in the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.510 
more difficult to do it in the
right-hand<00:00:53.129> corner

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
right-hand corner

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.080 
right-hand corner
so<00:00:54.350> if<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.829> little<00:00:56.219> bit<00:00:56.309> new<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.489> elevators

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
so if it's a little bit new to elevators

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.119 
so if it's a little bit new to elevators
like<00:00:57.270> me<00:00:57.420> cuz<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.750> didn't<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.109> any<00:00:58.320> uncalled<00:00:58.649> for

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
like me cuz I didn't do any uncalled for

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.910 
like me cuz I didn't do any uncalled for
on<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.789> bottom<00:00:59.940> left<00:01:00.500> then<00:01:01.500> switch<00:01:01.890> your

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
on the bottom left then switch your

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.530 
on the bottom left then switch your
tentacle<00:01:02.789> layout<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.680> legacy<00:01:04.680> southpaw<00:01:05.129> and

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
tentacle layout to legacy southpaw and

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.870 
tentacle layout to legacy southpaw and
then<00:01:06.540> keep<00:01:07.140> slowly<00:01:07.560> moving<00:01:07.920> right<00:01:08.220> until<00:01:08.760> you

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
then keep slowly moving right until you

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.660 
then keep slowly moving right until you
find<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.450> part<00:01:09.780> where<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.650> can<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.369> can't

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
find the part where you can and can't

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.450 
find the part where you can and can't
stand<00:01:12.000> up<00:01:12.270> because<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.500> elevator<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.220> where

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
stand up because the elevator is where

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.789 
stand up because the elevator is where
in<00:01:14.880> between<00:01:15.540> where<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.290> can't<00:01:16.500> stand

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
in between where you can and can't stand

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.399 
in between where you can and can't stand
up<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.580> find<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.030> spot<00:01:18.299> where<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.630> stand

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.380 
up so find the spot where you can stand
up<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.799> where<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.070> can't<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.610> then<00:01:20.970> slightly

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
up and where you can't and then slightly

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.420 
up and where you can't and then slightly
move<00:01:21.810> back<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.259> forth<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.710> between<00:01:23.159> there

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
move back and forth in between there

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.570 
move back and forth in between there
until<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.360> finally<00:01:24.630> find<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.200> spot<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.740> you

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
until you finally find the spot and you

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.719 
until you finally find the spot and you
will<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.909> all<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.390> way<00:01:27.479> lift<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.930> up<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.610> as<00:01:29.610> I

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
get it somewhat tongue soon and so you

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.359 
get it somewhat tongue soon and so you
just<00:01:51.479> want<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.750> keep<00:01:51.899> moving<00:01:52.159> slightly<00:01:53.159> back

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
one game so once you get to the edge you

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.320 
one game so once you get to the edge you
want<00:03:02.489> to<00:03:03.590> just<00:03:04.590> fall<00:03:04.800> off<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.400> at<00:03:05.880> this<00:03:06.060> point

want to just fall off and at this point

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.690 
want to just fall off and at this point

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
if you just hold the running button down

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.630 
if you just hold the running button down
that<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.330> click<00:03:09.630> down<00:03:09.870> then<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:11.190> just<00:03:11.459> like

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
that you click down then it just like

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.330 
that you click down then it just like
really<00:03:12.000> racks<00:03:12.690> up<00:03:12.959> your<00:03:13.140> sprinting<00:03:13.709> your

really racks up your sprinting your

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.990 
really racks up your sprinting your
miles<00:03:14.550> really<00:03:14.970> quickly<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:16.700> that's<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.910> way

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
miles really quickly so that's the way

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.660
