00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.540
 ah 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.020
 hello everyone I'm alexis and I invite you to 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.379
 which is a return with me to the tribute of 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.379
 Mudejar 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.779
 look 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.540
 well now we are coming out of the pit 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.879
 lane that we were direct to curve 2 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.769
 a curve 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.140
 pretty fast that is done 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.089
 practically in depth and it's important 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.399
 get out of that curve quickly because after 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:59.540
 you're going to give the next curve that 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.860
 also in that way practically and is 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.140
 in your life not so you have to go out 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.600
 fast then this curve comes from 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.090
 left that is a bit slow 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.900
 good thing she is very important to do 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.869
 good good traced and we're going to give this 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.210
 that are slower and we want I'm not 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.299
 of the first second depends depends on 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.299
 the marches you do and nothing 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.090
 this is the corkscrew what they call it 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.070
 is a downhill curve very very 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.770
 complicated line very important 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.710
 also the plot to leave 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.080
 fast and make fast this curve that 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.420
 is next that is practically 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.299
 want to put salts is not nothing 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.490
 which is complicated to subtitle in general 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:49.630
 quite complicated but things are 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.310
 very peculiar and nothing after is the 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.350
 line of this is very important if doing 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.920
 change make a quick change 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:01.299
 address because it's that powder then 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.770
 here I was born nothing strong and well is a 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:08.679
 very little girl that gives way to the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.660
 Straight more give your twitter where it is 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.080
 very important product for coupling 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.810
 you're good so that it does not happen to you and 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.920
 the moto3 for me categories is a bit 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.920
 little long feeling 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.040
 here we get to about 240 and this 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.349
 curve is very important to have it done 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.569
 quick not to pay much to the bike because 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.790
 is a decisive cross here you win or you 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.220
 they lose races yes yes you know fast no 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.060
 they happen to you and if you go slow it happens to you not 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.060
 before making you goal
