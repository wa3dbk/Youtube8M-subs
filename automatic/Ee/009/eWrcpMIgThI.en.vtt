00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.590
 very good brands three we are again 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.250
 very clear to bring you a new 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.920
 economic 1.64 called time stopper and 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.510
 Well, it really consists of this 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.910
 kind of watch that I have here in the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.920
 hand and hear that black is the sky not 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.980
 good is a small ship we are not going to 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.140
 look right now and nothing the thing is that 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.300
 this way because it is that when you 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.850
 we right click to this clock all are 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.309
 It is going to stop until it of those who 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.070
 we are floating here in the air because no 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.470
 is broken is not going to break anything is going to 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.550
 take a very short time to break and that 's what 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.309
 only that I do not like it seems 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.430
 study plastic but good the thing that 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.409
 is very good especially with the scripts 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.540
 especially with the slides that are 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.659
 You can see the air and even when 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.640
 we put and is very cool especially with 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:03.019
 the bats because you notice this 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.309
 it seems a time stop is a pass 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.010
 he was very cool he is very small he is very 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.690
 currado and good because it has a small 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.900
 crafter has to stay or what would be 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.990
 this and then it would be a clock a clock 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.990
 gold with four close ton powder and by 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.430
 the rest we can 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.590
 do this for example let's put 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.930
 many in lines to see how it is worth 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.579
 I need to be in good in a 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.229
 difficulty that is not peaceful we do not go 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.030
 to make it difficult for example and we're going to 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.070
 put the line that has already left some 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.799
 great that I like and we're going to give it 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.450
 when we are there we are for example to 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.090
 I just had it in the air 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.860
 that this one and see what happened guys 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.280
 there are still modes in the air not even 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.110
 they come down or nothing and then the same 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.729
 would also happen with mom's cube that 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.090
 I've also been testing it although I have not 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.159
 It's too interesting and good 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.039
 with the clipper with the sender man 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.229
 also that they will not come out in the fixos 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.020
 as good as these two I left 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.539
 frozen and well then I can give you a 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.509
 lots of blows before the clock 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.459
 break and take the damage and it's good 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.500
 because with the slides is exactly what 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.880
 same I'm going to give him a lot of punches and 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.400
 when the clock is broken 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.830
 Now I think that you are going to see 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.620
 as the slide dies and releases the others 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.900
 two a little smaller so nothing 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.850
 this is the mode has nothing else like that 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.810
 I hope you liked it and 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.980
 click like it favorites 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.640
 in the next video 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.640
