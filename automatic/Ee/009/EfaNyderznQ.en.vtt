looks the way free radicals do their
damage<00:01:04.440> is<00:01:04.680> by<00:01:04.830> carrying<00:01:05.339> around<00:01:05.430> one<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.030> more

unpaired electrons which makes them very

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
makes them a free radical so then that

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.040 
makes them a free radical so then that
