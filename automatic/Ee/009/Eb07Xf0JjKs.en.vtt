hard time hitting perfect if you're an

hard time hitting perfect if you're an
audio<00:02:05.729> player<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.540> doesn't<00:02:06.930> like<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.290> try

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
audio player and it doesn't like you try

audio player and it doesn't like you try
turning<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:08.009> sound<00:02:08.369> effects<00:02:08.789> but<00:02:09.720> i<00:02:09.750> would

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
turning on sound effects but i would

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.390 
turning on sound effects but i would
recommend<00:02:10.440> highly<00:02:10.770> recommend<00:02:11.220> playing

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
recommend highly recommend playing

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.340 
recommend highly recommend playing
without<00:02:11.580> sound

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
without sound

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.290 
without sound
you<00:02:13.220> want<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.460> make<00:02:13.550> sure<00:02:13.580> your<00:02:13.820> sound<00:02:14.030> effects

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
you want to make sure your sound effects

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.060 
you want to make sure your sound effects
are<00:02:14.480> turned<00:02:14.840> off<00:02:14.960> because<00:02:15.200> then<00:02:15.920> the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
are turned off because then the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.340 
are turned off because then the
animations<00:02:16.610> are<00:02:16.760> smoother<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:18.110> get<00:02:18.320> a

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
animations are smoother and you get a

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.920 
animations are smoother and you get a
more<00:02:18.680> regular<00:02:18.890> timing<00:02:19.660> if<00:02:20.660> you<00:02:20.750> don't<00:02:20.870> know

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
more regular timing if you don't know

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.210 
more regular timing if you don't know
how<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.110> turn<00:02:21.200> off<00:02:21.290> sound<00:02:21.500> effects<00:02:21.920> then<00:02:22.070> go<00:02:22.160> to

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
how to turn off sound effects then go to

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.040 
how to turn off sound effects then go to
options<00:02:22.640> here<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.090> this<00:02:23.570> one<00:02:23.750> right<00:02:23.870> here<00:02:23.930> is

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
options here and this one right here is

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.980 
options here and this one right here is
sound<00:02:24.470> effects<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:25.040> with<00:02:25.940> that<00:02:26.090> off<00:02:26.330> I<00:02:26.540> always

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
sound effects and with that off I always

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.210 
sound effects and with that off I always
play<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.260> sound<00:02:27.470> effects<00:02:27.680> off<00:02:27.860> because<00:02:28.190> it

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
play the sound effects off because it

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.580 
play the sound effects off because it
makes<00:02:28.580> my<00:02:28.930> attacks<00:02:29.930> on<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.260> more<00:02:30.560> regular

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
makes my attacks on a more regular

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.060 
makes my attacks on a more regular
timing<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.810> this<00:02:32.960> is<00:02:32.990> a<00:02:33.140> seated<00:02:33.470> stage<00:02:33.680> where

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
timing so this is a seated stage where

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.460 
timing so this is a seated stage where
Absalon<00:02:34.640> wanted<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.180> go<00:02:35.300> HD<00:02:35.540> mini<00:02:36.020> boss<00:02:36.200> stage

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
Absalon wanted to go HD mini boss stage

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.300 
Absalon wanted to go HD mini boss stage
where<00:02:36.710> Absalom<00:02:38.170> blinds<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.290> for<00:02:39.500> 999<00:02:40.100> turns

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
where Absalom blinds you for 999 turns

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.590 
where Absalom blinds you for 999 turns
so<00:02:40.550> you're<00:02:40.700> not<00:02:40.880> going<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.150> stall<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.420> out

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
so you're not going to stall this out

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.140 
so you're not going to stall this out
the<00:02:42.050> zombie<00:02:42.440> hits<00:02:42.650> toward<00:02:43.010> when<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.850> zombies

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
the zombie hits toward when the zombies

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.850 
the zombie hits toward when the zombies
under<00:02:44.480> twenty<00:02:44.780> percent<00:02:45.050> he'll<00:02:45.410> heal<00:02:45.680> himself

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
under twenty percent he'll heal himself

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.940 
under twenty percent he'll heal himself
up<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.310> boost<00:02:46.630> stats<00:02:47.630> but<00:02:47.990> you'll<00:02:48.560> see<00:02:48.800> like

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
up and boost stats but you'll see like

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.560 
up and boost stats but you'll see like
everyone<00:02:49.310> here<00:02:49.400> it's<00:02:49.550> really<00:02:50.030> low<00:02:50.180> health

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
everyone here it's really low health

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.670 
everyone here it's really low health
this<00:02:51.230> is<00:02:51.410> that's<00:02:51.710> basically<00:02:52.130> a<00:02:53.350> new<00:02:54.350> slop

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
this is that's basically a new slop

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.400 
this is that's basically a new slop
without<00:02:55.040> any<00:02:55.280> with<00:02:56.150> only<00:02:56.330> a<00:02:56.450> boost<00:02:56.750> from<00:02:56.900> Marco

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.080 

and<00:03:00.410> he<00:03:00.530> still<00:03:00.800> hits<00:03:00.980> that<00:03:01.160> hard<00:03:01.310> nothing<00:03:01.880> hits

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
and he still hits that hard nothing hits

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.780 
and he still hits that hard nothing hits
hard<00:03:02.330> just<00:03:02.630> a<00:03:02.690> couple<00:03:02.900> thousand<00:03:03.440> at<00:03:03.530> a<00:03:03.560> time

hard just a couple thousand at a time

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.120 
hard just a couple thousand at a time
but<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:04.970> can't<00:03:05.300> see<00:03:05.510> your<00:03:05.690> stuff<00:03:06.070> so<00:03:07.070> you

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.940 
well since you want to just attack four
times<00:04:24.700> right<00:04:24.940> away<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.530> then<00:04:26.530> you<00:04:26.650> only<00:04:26.770> need

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
times right away and then you only need

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.680 
times right away and then you only need
to<00:04:26.979> hit<00:04:27.130> a<00:04:27.160> couple<00:04:27.340> perfect<00:04:27.820> so<00:04:28.240> killer<00:04:28.540> is

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
to hit a couple perfect so killer is

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.210 
to hit a couple perfect so killer is
always<00:04:28.900> good<00:04:29.050> and<00:04:29.080> killa<00:04:29.380> is<00:04:29.590> quick<00:04:29.919> so<00:04:30.100> that

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
always good and killa is quick so that

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.010 
always good and killa is quick so that

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
makes it nice for this island there's me

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.110

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
intervals between his attack will go

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.640 
intervals between his attack will go
from<00:04:51.520> two<00:04:51.910> turns<00:04:52.180> 21<00:04:52.539> turn<00:04:53.169> between<00:04:53.320> attacks

normally<00:04:54.010> he<00:04:54.100> attacks<00:04:54.400> every<00:04:54.580> two<00:04:55.000> turns

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
normally he attacks every two turns

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.570 
normally he attacks every two turns
after<00:04:56.680> it<00:04:56.770> turned<00:04:56.979> three<00:04:57.220> he<00:04:57.340> attacks

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
after it turned three he attacks

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:06.499 
after it turned three he attacks
everyone<00:04:58.090> turn<00:05:00.419> then<00:05:01.860> oops

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.109 

but<00:05:07.509> even<00:05:07.599> then<00:05:07.809> he<00:05:08.020> will<00:05:08.229> after<00:05:09.159> basically

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:10.119 
but even then he will after basically

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:12.689 
but even then he will after basically
after<00:05:10.270> he<00:05:10.629> does<00:05:10.839> this<00:05:11.139> and<00:05:11.409> boost<00:05:12.249> his<00:05:12.400> attack
