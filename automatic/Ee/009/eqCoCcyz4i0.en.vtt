00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:15.389
 hello today we are going to do some earrings and 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.640
 a pendant with gummy bears if 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.260
 known with this kind of bears 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.710
 jelly beans that are tiny 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.230
 we will need these bears some rather 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.010
 small so it does not get too big in 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.800
 ear 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.460
 and we will also need some support 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.879
 pending 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.760
 in the case of the pendant it is 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:42.829
 kind of ye recited that they sell it 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.829
 also in Chinese bazaars 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.300
 and we will need this product 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.970
 of the bow tie 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.940
 is 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.350
 good gives a kind of finishes a 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.130
 varnish that gives a kind of finish 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.710
 like glass and at the same time hardens a 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.280
 bit 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.610
 so good these bears first 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.119
 we'll have to have them out for a while 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.369
 I where I learned how to do them 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.250
 have them in the air is the dig 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:20.630
 they were hard, I had two 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.540
 months out and hard does not get put 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.500
 slightly 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.510
 well a little harder loses 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.580
 that sticky they usually have 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.080
 but we go hard hard do not stay all 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.680
 I believe that with a week that is 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.800
 are left out more than anything so that 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.150
 lose touch that sticky that has 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.340
 until then in the case of the pendant 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:50.030
 What I have done has been a bear 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:54.400
 catch this rite that is a taught before 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.390
 and nail it right here in the middle 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.560
 down then it has been 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.220
 A) Yes 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.850
 As you can see here is the pendant 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.160
 where will he go then hooked to him 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.380
 the cord 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.830
 and with that then I have let it dry 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.650
 Once dry good 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.620
 let's apply the product of the 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.620
 bow tie I call it a crystal glitter 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.670
 and for that we will prepare it as they put 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.460
 the instructions that comes in handy 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.280
 explained then we will put with a 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.890
 pin in the back we click 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.650
 a little bit that does not go through more 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.330
 that nothing to be able to stand it and so 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.330
 we can paint 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.230
 and also and without the need to use 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.599
 fingers 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.740
 then here I already have the product 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.910
 prepared 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.910
 and with a pincelito 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.150
 and we will not give a capita 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.030
 on all sides all 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.030
 corner 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.270
 and then also from behind 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.260
 we are fine 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.439
 and when we have it 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.250
 This filler what I have done has been 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:37.519
 use a cork and nail it for the part 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.519
 from behind 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.230
 and then when we painted and 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.840
 this has a three day drying 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.450
 then we have to have it at least 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.210
 three days drying in a place that does not 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.550
 you fall dust 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.780
 and then it will look better and then 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.780
 we will wait three days 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.500
 once the three days have passed 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.720
 we will remove them from the pin with much 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.520
 Be careful not to bend 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.910
 let's try not to double what is the 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.470
 Gummy candy because if not the coat 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.440
 enamel that we have made you 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.900
 on top of glass jump and the then 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.060
 we have to remove it very carefully 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.100
 once we have removed it as you see 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.639
 they are very bright very nice 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.749
 and now it would only be 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.550
 in the back the support for the 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:40.370
 pending 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.590
 you had to hit the back right where 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.600
 we had put the needle so that it 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.600
 and so it would be covered 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.979
 a little bit of glue 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.310
 what will we put here 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:04.520
 and once we have put the droplet of 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:04.520
 glue because it's just 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.040
 then we will leave it drying 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.510
 well upside down 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.510
 a place where we are not going to move 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.969
 in the case of success for pendant in the 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.909
 that I put him 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:32.659
 and recited we will just have to put 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.659
 a washer 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.830
 we will put the washer 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.259
 the pendant would already be made 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:52.789
 and with this then with a cord that 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.789
 let's have a chain 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.300
 we could no longer use 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:04.139
 then we would have the earrings 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:07.490
 a set with the pendant 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:10.310
 we could also make a ring 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.580
 simply putting a little bit of 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.139
 glue down and masters support for 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.650
 ring and we would have the set of 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.650
 three little things 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:25.850
 good when the glue is dry 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.850
 it's already finished here as you see 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.070
 pending this is already finished with your 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.560
 pram 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.330
 with this he gave me a ring and although 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.210
 nice are left 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:40.470
 so that it goes together with him 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.480
 with the earrings 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.880
 and with the necklace 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.110
 you have the pendant 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.640
 but we can make a nice 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:52.370
 set of earrings ring and necklace 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:56.210
 with gummy bears 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:58.600
 then we are finished and I hope that 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.600
 you liked it
