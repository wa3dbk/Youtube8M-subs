 hello hello welcome to this new video 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.020
 tutorial here on the cyber games channel 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.700
 My name is Fernando and in this video 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.910
 tutorial I'll explain about 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.579
 how to set up your pre listen 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.279
 hearing aids of your virtual dj 7 or the 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.610
 new version that is audio well for what 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.040
 first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.720
 and see these images in which 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.530
 explain why 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.600
 and the crickets happened to install you 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.580
 pre-listening is because first 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.070
 We need to buy a card 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.590
 audio that is 4 or 5 channels that is 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.300
 highly recommended your card can do 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.730
 of any brand that you use the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.820
 what do you like 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.790
 usually on our computers 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:59.059
 come cards or come three adapted 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.010
 channels that is the line entry or 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.280
 auxiliary the front that is for 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.130
 speakers or the microphone what is going to 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.350
 have a 4 or 5 channel card in my 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.900
 case comes 100 is who I am being this 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.420
 I have this one 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.340
 write 5 channels so we can see you 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.590
 more closely that has this channel that is 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.440
 black on which we will 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.270
 place our hearing aids in this 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.770
 channel we will place what comes 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.900
 being the speakers where they are going to 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.450
 listen to our mix and here the 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.520
 mic if you like these channels the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.340
 blue and yellow are more used 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.630
 for games or for other options that 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.280
 you can do on your computer 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.690
 so we can also know one of 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.510
 four channels where we can see what 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.650
 what has been the entry for the 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.270
 hearing that is being this 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.130
 This is going to be the entrance for the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.860
 speakers the mic where the headphones 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.900
 this is going to be the entrance an entrance 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.740
 optional that is to play games or as 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.690
 I mentioned them once before 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.140
 list this explanation what are we going to 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.500
 proceed 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.740
 and install our microphones as they 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.670
 I mentioned they are going to place in the in the 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.440
 black out the card after 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.970
 have placed our micro when 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.830
 what we are going to do is go to the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.340
 configuration of our card to 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.820
 audio in this case I have it here 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:31.450
 my folder is the audio ps3 this is the 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.940
 configuration in the system input 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.410
 usually the configurations of 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.590
 the audio cards are not almost 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.569
 same, what has been the same is what 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.700
 that comes without entering the system and mode 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.010
 exit state usually must 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.130
 have a card holder at the entrance of the 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.590
 system where we are going to choose the 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.230
 channels are going to put 4 channels to 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.099
 that we can use what is being the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.870
 speakers and hearing aids on output 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:04.349
 analog we're going to put 4 speakers 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.000
 with which we are here we are going to 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.519
 listen to what has been our 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.690
 hearing aids and more here we are going to 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.019
 listen to what is being the 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.480
 speakers we will accept and open 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.129
 the virtual villa in this case I'm going to 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.159
 explain them in both ways with the 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.920
 virtual 17 and the 8 first we're going to 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.959
 see with 8 once there was when this 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.360
 virtual day and 8 what we are going to do is 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.620
 go to configuration we have it towards 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.739
 up later we're going to audio 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.930
 We collect speaker and headphones cards 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.629
 of sound available and this we leave it 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.870
 such as the loans are taught in 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:44.209
 shows let's choose the first one we're going to 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.110
 put master the audio card here the 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:51.049
 let's look in this case is this as 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.500
 I mentioned 36 audio from vis in 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:56.560
 channel let's put 1 and 2 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.380
 but let's leave as is, we're going to 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.000
 open another one and let's put the code that 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.220
 are our listening the one that we are going to put 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.400
 the same card and we're going to put in 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.200
 sanders 3 and 4 we are going to apply and 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.570
 we are going to have what is being 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.500
 our pre-listening activated in virtual 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.850
 18 now let's see with version 7 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.950
 for this version what we are going to do 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.140
 is to go to configuration in 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.750
 sound configuration we're going to put in 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.560
 in this first box we are going to put the 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:29.190
 card we will put as is this 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.680
 main two point first card 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.360
 hearing aids second card below 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.950
 let's leave you a primary controller 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.330
 or we are going to put the driver that 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.400
 we are using here is very 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.620
 important with in Canada we are going to 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.340
 put the name 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.040
 we're going to leave it like that without what 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.040
 has doctrine being a controller or 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.460
 micro you're usually going to put it there 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.620
 if you are going to use them, you have unheard of here 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.479
 we are going to put alfonsin in the exits 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.199
 100 sound cards 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:05.860
 let's leave it in what has been 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:08.139
 Two forgiveness taxis 4.1 card 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.680
 Once this is done we will apply it and 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.199
 we give you the 7th 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.500
 and we're going to have it growing up on 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:17.150
 press kutxa in our virtual 16 7 and 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.220
 well that has been all about how 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.380
 configure our prescribed remember 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.410
 I recommend what you do to me

 buy a card from 4 onwards what 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.410
 growing the channels you install and there 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:32.600
