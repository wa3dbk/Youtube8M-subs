to send it to me on Twitter just makes
it<00:01:26.400> hard<00:01:26.640> because<00:01:26.790> with<00:01:27.030> all<00:01:27.090> my<00:01:27.240> mentions<00:01:27.750> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
it hard because with all my mentions and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.390 
it hard because with all my mentions and
everything<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.290> get<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.280> know

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
everything that I get and you know

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.890 
everything that I get and you know
normally<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.939> check<00:01:30.180> Twitter<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.689> all

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
normally I check Twitter like all

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.420 
normally I check Twitter like all
throughout<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.439> day<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.619> my<00:01:31.829> phone<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.070> stuff

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
throughout the day on my phone and stuff

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.730 
throughout the day on my phone and stuff
like<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.970> if<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.780> see<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> video<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.380> might

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
like that so if I see a video I might

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.440 
like that so if I see a video I might
not<00:01:34.950> click<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.369> right<00:01:35.400> then<00:01:35.759> like<00:01:35.970> depending

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
not click it right then like depending

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.060 
not click it right then like depending
on<00:01:36.479> where<00:01:36.840> i<00:01:36.869> am<00:01:37.110> like<00:01:37.290> I'm<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.590> class<00:01:37.740> or

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
on where i am like I'm in class or

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.890 
on where i am like I'm in class or
something<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.939> won't<00:01:39.450> be<00:01:39.600> able<00:01:39.750> to

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
something like that I won't be able to

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.569 
something like that I won't be able to
check<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.290> video<00:01:40.500> right<00:01:40.860> then<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.369> might

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
check that video right then and it might

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.760 
check that video right then and it might
get<00:01:41.759> pushed<00:01:42.090> down<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.570> my<00:01:42.689> news<00:01:42.960> feed<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.560> i

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
get pushed down in my news feed so i

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.310 
get pushed down in my news feed so i
recommend<00:01:44.340> not<00:01:44.729> sending<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.600> twitter<00:01:46.110> now

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
recommend not sending it on twitter now

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.920 
recommend not sending it on twitter now
you<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.920> do<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.540> say<00:01:48.689> there's<00:01:48.869> a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
you can do that but like I say there's a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.780 
you can do that but like I say there's a
better<00:01:49.140> chance<00:01:49.259> if<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.549> different

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
better chance if you do it a different

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.460 
better chance if you do it a different
way<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.360> way<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.810> would<00:01:51.899> recommend<00:01:52.229> to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
way so the way that I would recommend to

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.060 
way so the way that I would recommend to
do<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.890> send<00:01:53.729> me<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.180> YouTube<00:01:54.899> message<00:01:55.890> or

do it is send me a YouTube message or
