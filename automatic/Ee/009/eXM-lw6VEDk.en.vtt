years that he spent living in New York I

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.600 
years that he spent living in New York I
feel<00:02:19.230> like<00:02:19.380> maybe<00:02:19.770> when<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.130> first<00:02:20.430> started

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
feel like maybe when I first started

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.190 
feel like maybe when I first started
playing<00:02:20.730> playing<00:02:21.420> with<00:02:21.570> them<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.900> heard

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
more of this maybe more of his French
