00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 Hi guys, plus a little video of one 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.330
 order from aliexpress.com which took 45 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.500
 days 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.830
 so there are some things that take time 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.100
 quite a few other things that are a 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.550
 bit faster but it's late and 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.949
 I think it's not quite what I am. 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.400
 imagining is according to what was 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.609
 was a sanding device. 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.480
 nail these things poliron wins but me 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:37.070
 I thought I'd come in a box and 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.070
 groping did not come 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.260
 so here it is in a bag according to 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.450
 with what showed on the seller's 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.550
 apparently came in a box and at 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.230
 The way it's here really is in the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:59.899
 box right're a bag have the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:08.150
 instructions bulletin instructions 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:08.150
 with that, believe in the box a little bag 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:31.130
 it's probably the sink will be q aki and tato 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.130
 dirty truck 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:40.810
 I do not know how to pull 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.810
 inside 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.240
 I think it's right here. 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:06.660
 then close here and access nails to sanding 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.660
 to polish 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.700
 so I think that had're not 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:24.709
 Sakineh in the box have not only not 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:28.160
 have the polishing sticks not 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:33.140
 I know exactly what it is to what it takes 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:37.390
 until researching the peta that should be this 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.569
 The time you release it is docked. 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.569
 it is not 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.610
 I do not think it does not have it it does not come 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.160
 he entered not latch that must be just 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.200
 to even turn it on 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.720
 and looks that I did not have to come here to 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.440
 see working 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.840
 Well, that's what I ordered. 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.160
 It's cute that came in a little bag. 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:11.590
 It's so cute, I wish I could have come in the box, right? 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.590
 so this is until the next
