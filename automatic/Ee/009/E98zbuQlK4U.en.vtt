a high-standard Victor but it's still
very<00:04:29.220> good<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:30.380> it<00:04:31.380> is<00:04:31.560> just<00:04:31.860> this<00:04:32.400> one<00:04:32.460> is

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
very good and it is just this one is

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.110 
very good and it is just this one is
just<00:04:32.940> in<00:04:33.169> almost<00:04:34.169> perfect<00:04:34.320> condition<00:04:35.120> it's

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
just in almost perfect condition it's

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.210 
just in almost perfect condition it's
got<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.300> couple<00:04:36.960> little<00:04:37.260> marks<00:04:37.680> here<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:37.890> there

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
got a couple little marks here and there

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.969 
got a couple little marks here and there
but<00:04:38.460> nothing<00:04:39.210> serious<00:04:39.450> it's<00:04:40.289> been<00:04:40.530> well<00:04:40.740> taken

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
but nothing serious it's been well taken

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.540 
but nothing serious it's been well taken
care<00:04:41.220> of<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:42.440> these<00:04:43.440> are<00:04:43.650> just<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:44.039> lot<00:04:44.220> of<00:04:44.370> fun

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
care of and these are just a lot of fun

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.350 
care of and these are just a lot of fun
to<00:04:44.669> shoot<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:47.250> grip<00:04:47.460> angle<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:47.970> everything

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
to shoot the grip angle and everything

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
to shoot the grip angle and everything
is<00:04:48.539> just<00:04:48.570> like<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.320> standard<00:04:49.970> woodsman<00:04:51.380> but

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
is just like the standard woodsman but

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.170 
is just like the standard woodsman but
it<00:04:52.530> does<00:04:52.680> have<00:04:52.919> a<00:04:52.950> more<00:04:53.220> rigid<00:04:53.460> barrel

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
it does have a more rigid barrel

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.439 
it does have a more rigid barrel
and<00:04:54.620> of<00:04:55.620> course<00:04:55.889> the<00:04:56.220> under<00:04:56.910> lug<00:04:57.150> on<00:04:57.330> the

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
and of course the under lug on the

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.530 
and of course the under lug on the
barrel<00:04:57.720> adds<00:04:57.930> weight<00:04:58.199> to<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:59.210> makes<00:05:00.210> it<00:05:00.360> better

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
barrel adds weight to it makes it better

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.540 
barrel adds weight to it makes it better
for<00:05:00.780> target<00:05:01.199> shooting<00:05:01.500> easier<00:05:01.889> to<00:05:02.070> hold<00:05:02.280> on

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
for target shooting easier to hold on

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.210 
for target shooting easier to hold on
target<00:05:03.120> does<00:05:04.110> make<00:05:04.350> it<00:05:04.530> quite<00:05:04.800> a<00:05:04.830> bit<00:05:04.889> heavier

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
target does make it quite a bit heavier

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.670 
target does make it quite a bit heavier
than<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:05.820> standard<00:05:06.240> woodsman<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:09.470> the<00:05:10.470> match

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
than the standard woodsman and the match

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.030 
than the standard woodsman and the match
target<00:05:11.280> was<00:05:11.430> also<00:05:11.880> made<00:05:12.500> with<00:05:13.500> a<00:05:13.560> four<00:05:13.889> and<00:05:14.010> a

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
target was also made with a four and a

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.420 
target was also made with a four and a
half<00:05:14.070> inch<00:05:14.490> barrel<00:05:15.830> and<00:05:16.830> I<00:05:17.040> always<00:05:17.190> thought

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
half inch barrel and I always thought

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.830 
half inch barrel and I always thought
I'd<00:05:17.550> like<00:05:17.699> to<00:05:17.729> get<00:05:17.940> one<00:05:18.060> of<00:05:18.090> them<00:05:18.270> and<00:05:18.510> complete

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
I'd like to get one of them and complete

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.340 
I'd like to get one of them and complete
my<00:05:19.020> set<00:05:19.260> that<00:05:19.919> way<00:05:20.070> I<00:05:20.100> would<00:05:20.340> have<00:05:20.430> had<00:05:21.350> the

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
my set that way I would have had the

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.600 
my set that way I would have had the
four<00:05:23.130> and<00:05:23.250> a<00:05:23.280> half<00:05:23.310> and<00:05:23.699> six<00:05:23.910> inch<00:05:24.240> of<00:05:24.600> both<00:05:25.610> the

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
four and a half and six inch of both the

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.900 
four and a half and six inch of both the
standard<00:05:27.800> woodsman<00:05:28.800> and<00:05:28.979> the<00:05:29.190> match<00:05:29.370> target

standard woodsman and the match target

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.210 
standard woodsman and the match target
