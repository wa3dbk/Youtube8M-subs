00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.299
 hi guys on the same screen and thus the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.580
 douro girls' sheets 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.920
 we will learn to do broad and 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.030
 silver or gold for us 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:21.330
 write with a spout then 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:30.660
 this here is super healthy inside 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:40.320
 a duckling this has as you see here 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:42.300
 two sieves put the silver powder 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.629
 Who is not from the area that we have 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.629
 available 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:01:00.329
 It's getting closer here it's for you. 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:04.799
 what are we going to put here 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.439
 choosing the back is important because 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.229
 this frosting gets very thin 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:15.240
 they were in a balloon so it is done 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.700
 a line is a little bit gives a force to it 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:31.950
 do a study found that it has a 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:34.439
 point against the next one after it 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.650
 Fall you have to count to 6 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.060
 He has stopped moving in here. 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.939
 I can see that he is standing still. 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.600
 move 15 then you missed a bit of 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.100
 cachaÃ§a you see a little he has to 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.100
 stop moving 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:58.530
 numbers and it can not be eight 12 years and 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.979
 this is the point where you will get 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:26.930
 make a near one line and it will not 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:26.930
 Flag Inappropriate Content 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:02.409
 I will not show that each pot 2 34 570 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.780
 that part I played not 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.579
 joined with that she stopped moving 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:12.629
 or this is the point where we go 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:12.629
 get to work and do not know how to cook 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.760
 I can not do that new collar 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.379
 to do so starting 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:05.880
 to do I'm doing on the table will 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.250
 rise 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.850
 There is no shock, thank you, people are 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.850
 next
