 January had North Korea on how to do that 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.210
 Nevertheless, the player must be in the role of the young hero mapping 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.480
 open up to explore this gloomy world 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.520
 and find out what's up with the enigmatic black creatures 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.030
 Has 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.030

 with their psychic abilities actually the next level of the 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.800
 evolution 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.490
 At around 20 33, a liberal parcel plays with a thrilling 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:06.570
 staged hand 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.570

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.370
 Haas 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.530
 The player is on the safe future sections who are on the go 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.909
 entertains other people and weapons ammunition and other equipment comes 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.910
 these and other questions 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.020
 the African champion 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.020
 the duration of the collective agreements 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.020
 the world is not worked out enough and looks very coherent 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.720
 even the good action unfolds after a short time and nothing 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.440
 want to know what's behind the mysterious events Bund 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.780
 which destiny saved the pirate in the end 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.799
 it is real 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.799
 this 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.749
 The player must receive the help with about 20 33 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:17.599
 but again and again sometimes dramatically staged for meaningful 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.039
 Gradually I had to calculate in better equipment 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:25.039
 He gets this among other things at dealers 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:30.049

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.999

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:35.999
 Red 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:41.969
 Technically Metro 20 33 is just right for well equipped 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.809
 pc player during david mini, the user can left with Alfons the tessellation 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:49.809
 and enable extended depth of field 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:56.329
 Overall, the game makes but with all Doric x version a good figure 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.419
 Tessellation once again made rounder facial features 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.730
 and also in the following example is good to see that the enclosed x11 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.319
 Night vision device has a few rounds more than under dx9 and 10 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:26.379
 At weddix 11, the object-related Moshen is also intensifying 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.279
 Bluray fencing 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:31.279
 this is active from his kicks 10 upwards 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:40.049
 the set level of detail also has little effect on the 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.609
 is great look of the title 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.449
 only in the field of illumination and the shadow gradients are differences 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.449
 clearly recognizable 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.689
 Ehring ego-shooters especially the plot market and on the 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.090
 multiplayer mode anyway mostly omitted 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.709
 for the Metro 20 33 is almost a small revelation 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:19.669
 the storyline 8 from the first moment is curious to know more about the scenario 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.719
 unused and dialogues and cutscenes 5 first class 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:28.559
 even the thrilling and varied fights they do not care for a long time 

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:31.559
 known adrenaline shoots 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:37.120
 the only real shortcoming 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.590
 with 4 20 33 is pretty short even who will spend a lot of time with the IMF 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.220
 lets donors be through about ten hours and can the program 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:48.069
 also put in the corner again
