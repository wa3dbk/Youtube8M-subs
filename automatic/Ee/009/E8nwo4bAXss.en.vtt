00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
and the type of Giza but as you can see

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.080 
and the type of Giza but as you can see
here<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:28.710> tank<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.189> about<00:00:29.429> two<00:00:29.640> years<00:00:29.670> old

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
here this tank is about two years old

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.350 
here this tank is about two years old
with<00:00:30.960> time<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:32.009> polyurethane<00:00:32.340> layer<00:00:33.090> and

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
with time the polyurethane layer and

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.959 
with time the polyurethane layer and
with<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> heat<00:00:33.860> starts<00:00:34.860> deteriorating<00:00:35.040> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
with the heat starts deteriorating and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.970 
with the heat starts deteriorating and
although<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.690> Giza<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.170> very<00:00:37.350> effective<00:00:37.680> when

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
although the Giza is very effective when

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.369 
although the Giza is very effective when
it's<00:00:38.129> new<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:39.180> insulation<00:00:39.570> starts<00:00:40.170> losing

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
it's new the insulation starts losing

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.979 
it's new the insulation starts losing
its<00:00:40.649> properties<00:00:41.250> what<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.540> with<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.750> Giza

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989

its properties what we do with the Giza
blanket<00:00:43.620> we're<00:00:43.890> taking<00:00:44.280> an<00:00:44.430> additional

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
blanket we're taking an additional

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.690 
blanket we're taking an additional
insulation<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.770> putting<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.280> at<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.520> top

insulation and putting that at the top
of<00:00:47.850> your<00:00:47.940> Giza<00:00:48.590> so<00:00:49.590> now<00:00:49.829> what<00:00:50.100> we're<00:00:50.280> doing<00:00:50.309> is

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
of your Giza so now what we're doing is

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.090 
of your Giza so now what we're doing is

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
switching on and off so many times

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.690 
switching on and off so many times
during<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.270> day<00:01:27.450> by<00:01:28.380> insulating<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.280> properly

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
during the day by insulating it properly

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.510 
during the day by insulating it properly
it<00:01:30.030> now<00:01:30.659> only<00:01:30.869> switches<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.680> once<00:01:32.100> or<00:01:32.310> twice

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
it now only switches on once or twice

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.690 
it now only switches on once or twice
and<00:01:32.850> by<00:01:33.689> also<00:01:34.110> effectively<00:01:34.650> timing<00:01:35.280> your<00:01:35.400> Giza

so that during the day it doesn't switch
on<00:01:38.070> unnecessarily<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.630> additional

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
on unnecessarily you have additional

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.080 
on unnecessarily you have additional
energy<00:01:40.259> savings<00:01:40.920> because<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.369> blankets<00:01:41.880> will

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
energy savings because the blankets will

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.149 
energy savings because the blankets will
keep<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.479> hot<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.020> make<00:01:43.649> sure<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.009> it

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
keep it hot and make sure that it

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.789 
keep it hot and make sure that it
doesn't<00:01:44.310> lose<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.840> heat<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.680> the

afternoon when we should sit on it

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.630 
afternoon when we should sit on it
actually<00:01:48.960> heats<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.710> lot<00:01:49.860> faster<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.460> well

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
actually heats up a lot faster as well

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.690 
actually heats up a lot faster as well
because<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.689> effectively<00:01:52.290> insulated<00:01:53.009> so

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
because it's so effectively insulated so

and that's that's when you're actually
showering<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.350> birthing<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.040> that's<00:02:41.580> when

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
its job in the summer months as well so

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.130 
its job in the summer months as well so
you<00:02:46.860> will<00:02:47.070> never<00:02:47.430> have<00:02:47.610> an<00:02:48.300> outside

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
you will never have an outside

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.770 
you will never have an outside
temperature<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.920> 60<00:02:50.370> degrees<00:02:50.730> with<00:02:51.390> your<00:02:51.540> Giza

temperature of 60 degrees with your Giza

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.590 
temperature of 60 degrees with your Giza
and<00:02:52.140> that's<00:02:52.830> why<00:02:53.010> it's<00:02:53.220> important<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.240> have<00:02:54.480> a

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
and that's why it's important to have a

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.650 
and that's why it's important to have a
Giza<00:02:54.930> blanket<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.530> place<00:02:55.770> summer<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.910> winter
