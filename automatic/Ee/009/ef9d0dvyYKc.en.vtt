00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 and we are not afraid of any embargo 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.599
 we will live without cowards and parmesan of 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:16.260
 if we have acorns 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:19.199
 grass grain is worth the end 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.840
 September is the time to collect such 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.050
 the product has come and acorns are very many 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.680
 can cook delicious meals and 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:32.399
 drinks from them and some rollers with 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.600
 on this subject I urge everyone to gather and 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.600
 wives come in handy 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.539
 teeth do not give a harvest 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.280
 Here is the richest respect was 2010 to me then 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:59.359
 collected her acorns so it is just a broom 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:03.180
 then shoveled two years the harvest has not been 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:08.190
 2013 was a good harvest and this year I 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.470
 also a very decent double 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.450
 Different are respectively acorns too 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.510
 collect that such oblong 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.790
 they are a little easier 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:25.560
 even more round ones group 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.290
 very fat obviously an example here is very 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.820
 You can clearly see that this way I live is kept 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.220
 there will be no sidorova 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.970
 it's soft live see and this one 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:43.170
 cracked will soon germinate here 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.110
 have sprouted about it but it still happens here 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:52.350
 here you can see that 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:55.430
 an acorn we will pass the king to insects inside it 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.430
 most likely black 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.910
 but he is not spoiled and 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.009
 important note acorns in no case 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.350
 do not eat raw need them specially 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.590

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.110

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.790
 spoiled anyway they will pop up 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.239
 they need to throw 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.730

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:34.920

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:39.090
 put an even layer in 12 acorns 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.250

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.680
