00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 heil hi to all these people know this hoc 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.140
 I hope you are good family 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.790
 business friends loves loves 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.810
 health me it's going nickel good I confess you 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.580
 I'm a little tired 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.320
 to have played a lot a lot originally 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.190
 we still have not discovered the secret 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.750
 but something tells me that we are not 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.150
 really not far i 'm going to qg his big 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.440
 echo is everywhere so we already see I 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.490
 thank you but here I propose 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.590
 you usually know I make you 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.210
 little spams with very videos 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.769
 short is really they go right 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.730
 to the goal and there I preferred to change a 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.380
 little bit of formats you make 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.060
 videos a little bit more worked which 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.880
 take over the main ideas this gold 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.810
 episode 1 will resume the basics so 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.279
 those who already have the brand will see 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.170
 maybe this useless episode but those 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.940
 who do not have it will be very happy to 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.770
 This video so then promised 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.510
 we have the current then the current 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.829
 there are not really as in 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.410
 other maps where you have to activate a 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.090
 leverage tied to each and every one you will have 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.289
 a kind of generators that will have to 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.090
 activate at that moment you will have 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.730
 zombies a little bit a little bit 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.770
 specials that come charging 115 and 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.980
 you will have tanks to fill and to 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.660
 after about ten seconds 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 everything is loaded you see there 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.670
 by the way we just unlocked the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.619
 live cricri so it's true it's 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.600
 less practical than a lever actively 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.860
 it's a peculiarity of the maple 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.320
 then we have a new bonus 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.580
 these calls without us we live then you 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.480
 already see when you activate the first 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.610
 generator you have 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.500
 in reward if we can say then of the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.450
 blow you look like a zombie 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.130
 this does not detect you so you 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.080
 can easily make points you 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.220
 can resuscitate your friends for sure 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.660
 take shots it's really very 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.910
 useful you base a little bit in the 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.620
 mass good you see a little bit a 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.870
 little bit blurry as you see years a 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.700
 little bit a little bit special and 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.110
 enough will last this long too and 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.570
 by the way I put you in third 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.710
 no one here is my friend who took 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.000
 the senses told us yes but a 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.580
 appearance made me a little tired of it 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.910
 bichon simply is good but he 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.080
 is downright lousy at cccc just 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.510
 in detail but here you go 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.940
 then as a result then the shovels 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.340
 then there will be two spawn a meadow 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.660
 time in the church and one in a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.960
 in one of the caves then in fact the 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.090
 shovels 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.480
 it's very simple, you're going to 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.430
 harvest and on the map at different 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.630
 places there will be kinds of small 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.120
 heap or that you can dig then 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.990
 you can dig up some money for 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.280
 dig up a ballista of a dislam 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.670
 jolicoeur has already managed to have a tsr 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.760
 money I dedicate them bonuses that 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.250
 this is ammo max tx 2 etc and 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.120
 especially if it snows you can dig up 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.520
 some pieces to build the stick 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.310
 of ice then Coc surprise 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.190
 which is also called the do theirs 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.300
 needs their son 6 it seems to me well 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.580
 so in fact it's a bit like 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.430
 the magic box actually you have some 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.050
 Random assets if you pay 1500 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.239
 so you can fall on it me 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.670
 seems finally good that I'm sure it's 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.810
 that dear darling like this by short 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.680
 since there is in man of the jews and 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.250
 when you reload was done 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.920
 electricity 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.560
 then you can fall on ps 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.360
 developers three weapons 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.430
 also it seems to us double shot 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.980
 precise pupa message that I can take 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.260
 on and rillettes are then the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.880
 Soldier Panzer The Soldier Soldier It's a 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.320
 little bit a defect boss there will be 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.790
 even two who arrive while traveling web 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.510
 done if you want there we were not in 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.190
 forgetfulness 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.900
 it was just that we were on 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.950
 the tank and that was your first part 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.250
 there was not yet this 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.260
 day 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.150
 so when we are on the time that he 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.380
 simply buggy that we could 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.670
 beat pretty easily so that was 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.260
 handy to show you a little 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.670
 little what it looked like but otherwise 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.220
 now it seems to me that it works 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.810
 more fossil what really it was not 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.040
 a glee shot in the summer we were not at 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.450
 current is a very first part 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.130
 always is it that their soldiers 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.290
 headmaster will have a flamethrower and a 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.459
 hook to catch you from a distance 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.450
 is still pretty strong but once 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.070
 we have the sticks the boxes have 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.330
 improved we realize is fast 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.000
 settled once it happens to me 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.320
 offers a room for the baton he's me 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.560
 also seems the fire stick yes that's it 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.420
 that's it then the charles time 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.160
 show that the mobile platform the 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.230
 mark iv after call them that as you 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.720
 actually want it's at the church 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.550
 or in the basement you will have to pay 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.750
 500 to get it started so he goes 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.770
 do a little tour around the map 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.470
 will allow you to go over 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.989
 trenches and he especially goes to us 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.590
 allow dab to achieve 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.250
 inaccessible places while yvon who 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.210
 will 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.610
 allow you to simply 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.380
 to fetch pieces for the 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.270
 stick the stick then violate a wine 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.930
 powerful it's the lightning stick 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.640
 yes here is the staff of the lightning and at 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.410
 after a while so he will stop for 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.940
 that these engines cool so 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.200
 it's a high level of connected lagos 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.500
 when there was the soldier by deezer 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.630
 just good so that's it 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.750
 finished with with this chariot it will just have 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.960
 repay 500 for to leave again 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.150
 pretty 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.220
 I have you in the end a little 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.560
 passage one of the three passages where we can 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.390
 access thanks to the thanks to the tanks for 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.890
 go get the violin stick piece 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.210
 so that's it then I hope this 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.530
 episode you have more it's a little bit 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.300
 particular it is a little longer 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.160
 than usual but it takes up ideas 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.110
 main I changed shape indicates 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.390
 month in comments if that you 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.010
 okay I think do that so that's it 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.380
 the level 1 we'll say a little bit 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.120
 the basics really not hungry those who have 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.950
 the map say that it is useless but 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.980
 good those who are present on ps3 down 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.590
 evening will surely serve and then what 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.630
 is for the trick a little bit more 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.830
 complicated little tutorial here I 'm going 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.120
 resume you will see enormously the 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.590
 harris videos just because we're in 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.490
 full search for secrets or sure I 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.080
 assure you that we spend a lot 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.760
 a lot of time so here's anyway 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.710
 I leave you where too the cdc 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.570
 with I advise you to go see 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.010
 two videos that are suggested precisely 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.280
 in this accoutrement I tell you to be 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.320
 very quickly austere vox of peace 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.820
 this video you have more then laughs of 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.160
 that of our other partners with 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.420
 official facts that their 59 tons 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.520
 which their 85 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.680
 they're just now everyone like 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.150
 that's the zombie factory we represent 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.950
 the these files the community of 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.660
 strings and we only have one word 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.660
 of order respects on line
