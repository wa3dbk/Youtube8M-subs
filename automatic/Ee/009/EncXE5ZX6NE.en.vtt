to be needs to be tight needs to be

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.259 
to be needs to be tight needs to be
taught<00:02:30.629> but<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:31.260> doesn't<00:02:32.030> have<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.120> have<00:02:33.239> a

talks<00:02:48.359> about<00:02:48.659> vacuuming<00:02:49.319> which<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.859> which<00:02:50.189> is

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
talks about vacuuming which is which is

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.920 
talks about vacuuming which is which is
really<00:02:50.700> good<00:02:50.879> in<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.060> latest<00:02:51.359> stages<00:02:51.599> which

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
really good in the latest stages which

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.289 
really good in the latest stages which
will<00:02:52.019> help<00:02:52.139> really<00:02:53.010> tighten<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.489> up<00:02:53.609> and<00:02:53.909> also

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
will help really tighten it up and also

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.349 
will help really tighten it up and also
helps<00:02:55.079> generally<00:02:55.709> work<00:02:56.280> on<00:02:56.609> how<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.849> activate

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
helps generally work on how to activate

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.960 
helps generally work on how to activate
those<00:02:57.689> muscles<00:02:59.959> for<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:00.989> basic<00:03:01.470> program<00:03:02.280> you

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
those muscles for a basic program you

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.059 
those muscles for a basic program you
want<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.269> be<00:03:03.389> looking<00:03:04.049> at<00:03:04.230> first<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.769> all<00:03:04.859> just

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
want to be looking at first of all just

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.599 
want to be looking at first of all just
that<00:03:05.239> general<00:03:06.239> activation<00:03:07.169> okay<00:03:08.040> initially

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
that general activation okay initially

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.379 
that general activation okay initially
just<00:03:08.819> activating<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.169> maintaining<00:03:11.159> that

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
just activating it and maintaining that

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.020 
just activating it and maintaining that
for<00:03:12.389> extended<00:03:12.780> periods<00:03:13.049> of<00:03:13.079> time<00:03:13.169> or<00:03:13.879> and<00:03:14.879> then

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
for extended periods of time or and then

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.449 
for extended periods of time or and then
building<00:03:15.569> that<00:03:15.810> into<00:03:16.340> repetitions<00:03:17.340> because

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
building that into repetitions because

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.720 
building that into repetitions because
you<00:03:17.639> need<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:18.079> develop<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.769> ability<00:03:19.859> to<00:03:20.459> hold

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
you need to develop the ability to hold

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.990 
you need to develop the ability to hold
this<00:03:21.319> core<00:03:22.319> activation<00:03:22.769> for<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.220> long<00:03:23.489> period

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
this core activation for a long period

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.119 
this core activation for a long period
of<00:03:24.060> time<00:03:24.269> at<00:03:24.629> times<00:03:25.019> which<00:03:25.290> is<00:03:25.470> that<00:03:25.650> time

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
of time at times which is that time

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.089 
of time at times which is that time
under<00:03:26.430> tension<00:03:26.659> and<00:03:27.799> then<00:03:28.799> you<00:03:28.919> need<00:03:29.069> to

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
under tension and then you need to

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.629 
under tension and then you need to
incorporate<00:03:29.729> that<00:03:29.849> into<00:03:30.090> movement<00:03:30.780> okay<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:32.190> a

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
incorporate that into movement okay so a

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.849 
incorporate that into movement okay so a
good<00:03:33.120> progression<00:03:33.269> from<00:03:33.780> just<00:03:34.079> just<00:03:34.409> a<00:03:34.470> late

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
good progression from just just a late

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.219 
good progression from just just a late
laying<00:03:35.310> down<00:03:35.659> keeping<00:03:36.659> that<00:03:36.810> pelvic<00:03:37.199> floor

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:37.229 
laying down keeping that pelvic floor

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.460 
laying down keeping that pelvic floor
nice<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:37.739> engaged<00:03:38.510> for<00:03:39.510> 30<00:03:40.019> seconds<00:03:40.349> to<00:03:40.379> a

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
nice and engaged for 30 seconds to a

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.460 
nice and engaged for 30 seconds to a
minute<00:03:40.669> at<00:03:41.669> different<00:03:42.329> intervals<00:03:42.449> then<00:03:43.349> you

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
minute at different intervals then you

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.699 
minute at different intervals then you
want<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.620> build<00:03:43.769> into<00:03:44.010> what's<00:03:44.310> known<00:03:44.579> as<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.790> 100

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
want to build into what's known as a 100

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.240 
want to build into what's known as a 100
which<00:03:46.709> again<00:03:47.359> has<00:03:48.359> certain<00:03:48.840> stages<00:03:49.250> knee

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
which again has certain stages knee

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
lifting and then the bobbing up and down

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.839 
lifting and then the bobbing up and down
on<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.340> hands<00:03:53.729> this<00:03:54.269> is<00:03:54.449> going<00:03:54.629> to<00:03:54.689> really

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
on the hands this is going to really

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.479 
on the hands this is going to really
test<00:03:56.849> this<00:03:57.810> activation<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.799> they'll<00:03:59.250> let<00:03:59.400> you

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
test this activation and they'll let you

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.319 
test this activation and they'll let you
know<00:03:59.639> where<00:03:59.849> you<00:03:59.970> are<00:04:00.000> with<00:04:00.329> that<00:04:00.359> and<00:04:02.329> then

know where you are with that and then
you<00:04:03.419> want<00:04:03.569> to<00:04:03.629> build<00:04:03.810> on<00:04:04.019> two<00:04:04.400> different<00:04:05.400> types

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
you want to build on two different types

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:11.319 
you want to build on two different types
of<00:04:05.790> bracing<00:04:06.359> plank<00:04:07.259> bracing<00:04:07.979> all<00:04:09.769> all

weaken up okay you got to make sure
everything's<00:04:33.700> working<00:04:33.760> again<00:04:34.390> in<00:04:34.420> unison

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
everything's working again in unison

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.870 
everything's working again in unison
because<00:04:35.590> that's<00:04:35.740> what<00:04:35.890> core<00:04:36.160> strength<00:04:36.640> is<00:04:36.850> a

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
because that's what core strength is a

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.060 
because that's what core strength is a
relationship<00:04:37.450> between<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:37.990> torso<00:04:38.230> and<00:04:38.800> how

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
relationship between the torso and how

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.550 
relationship between the torso and how
it<00:04:39.190> helps<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.850> limbs<00:04:40.300> move<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:41.260> being<00:04:41.470> an

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
it helps the limbs move and being an

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.560 
it helps the limbs move and being an
athlete<00:04:41.950> that's<00:04:42.220> that's<00:04:42.640> really<00:04:42.940> important

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.680 

lastly<00:04:46.570> as<00:04:46.690> well<00:04:47.400> hernias<00:04:48.400> are<00:04:48.520> a<00:04:48.580> big<00:04:48.790> big

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
lastly as well hernias are a big big

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.240 
lastly as well hernias are a big big
issue<00:04:49.870> because<00:04:50.200> of<00:04:50.770> intra-abdominal

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
issue because of intra-abdominal

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.680 
issue because of intra-abdominal
pressure<00:04:52.860> you<00:04:53.860> get<00:04:54.040> these<00:04:54.400> stupid<00:04:54.940> stupid

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
pressure you get these stupid stupid

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.840 
pressure you get these stupid stupid
people<00:04:55.840> telling<00:04:56.320> you<00:04:56.470> to<00:04:56.680> go<00:04:57.070> and<00:04:57.340> start
