00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
problems this week first of all my video

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.370 
problems this week first of all my video
card<00:01:05.150> my<00:01:06.150> video<00:01:06.299> there's<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.659> problem<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.140> video

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
card my video there's a problem I video

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.960 
card my video there's a problem I video
card<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.830> think<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> memory<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
card I think it's in the memory of the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.210 
card I think it's in the memory of the
card<00:01:09.240> from<00:01:10.020> what<00:01:10.140> I've<00:01:10.260> been<00:01:10.290> told<00:01:10.439> from<00:01:10.860> ways

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
card from what I've been told from ways

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.160 
card from what I've been told from ways
on<00:01:11.460> described<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.180> there<00:01:12.630> thinking<00:01:13.049> that

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
on described it is there thinking that

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.020 
on described it is there thinking that
the<00:01:13.290> bits<00:01:13.530> going<00:01:13.950> through<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> memory<00:01:14.610> are

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the bits going through the memory are

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.910 
the bits going through the memory are
getting<00:01:15.270> stuck<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.960> basically<00:01:16.740> what's

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
getting stuck and basically what's

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.710 
getting stuck and basically what's
happening<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.280> its<00:01:17.430> cost<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:18.240> causing<00:01:18.659> an

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
happening is its cost it's causing an

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.570 
happening is its cost it's causing an
artifact<00:01:19.140> thing<00:01:19.350> now<00:01:19.860> artifact<00:01:20.340> thing<00:01:20.490> is

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
artifact thing now artifact thing is

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.670 
artifact thing now artifact thing is
when<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.820> go<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> game<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.259> video

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
when you go in the game in the the video

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.440 
when you go in the game in the the video
kind<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.950> look<00:01:23.070> stretched<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.240> just

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
kind of look stretched out and it just

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.850 
kind of look stretched out and it just
looks<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:24.960> looks<00:01:25.110> awful<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.619> actually

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
looks it just looks awful it actually

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.039 
looks it just looks awful it actually
makes<00:01:25.950> me<00:01:26.100> sick<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.820> think<00:01:27.030> about<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.390> but

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
makes me sick just to think about it but

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.530 
makes me sick just to think about it but
you<00:01:28.950> know<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> was<00:01:29.280> having<00:01:29.520> artifacting<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.240> ran

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
you know I was having artifacting I ran

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.319 
you know I was having artifacting I ran
some<00:01:30.570> programs<00:01:31.259> my<00:01:31.710> mice<00:01:32.220> my<00:01:32.700> rig<00:01:33.000> was<00:01:33.180> not

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
some programs my mice my rig was not

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.660 
some programs my mice my rig was not
overheating<00:01:33.930> at<00:01:34.049> all<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.740> very<00:01:35.100> very<00:01:35.400> cool

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
overheating at all it's a very very cool

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.120 
overheating at all it's a very very cool
card<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.570> was<00:01:36.750> kind<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.960> surprised<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.590> got<00:01:38.100> a

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
card so I was kind of surprised I got a

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.899 
card so I was kind of surprised I got a
lifetime<00:01:38.549> warranty

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
lifetime warranty

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.520 
lifetime warranty
and<00:01:40.030> I'm<00:01:40.329> probably<00:01:40.479> going<00:01:40.719> to<00:01:40.899> have<00:01:41.109> to<00:01:41.170> end<00:01:41.439> up

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
and I'm probably going to have to end up

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.289 
and I'm probably going to have to end up
sending<00:01:41.710> it<00:01:41.890> back<00:01:42.009> basically<00:01:42.789> what<00:01:42.939> he<00:01:42.999> thinks

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
sending it back basically what he thinks

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:44.399 
sending it back basically what he thinks
is<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.420> bits<00:01:43.719> are<00:01:43.840> getting<00:01:44.020> stuck<00:01:44.289> in<00:01:44.380> the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
is the bits are getting stuck in the

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.370 
is the bits are getting stuck in the
memory<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:45.270> sometimes<00:01:46.270> they<00:01:46.659> just<00:01:46.689> go

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
memory and sometimes they just go

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.069 
memory and sometimes they just go
through<00:01:47.710> it<00:01:47.740> kind<00:01:48.189> of<00:01:48.219> fixes<00:01:48.609> itself<00:01:48.909> it<00:01:49.719> fixes

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
through it kind of fixes itself it fixes

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.660 
through it kind of fixes itself it fixes
itself<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.469> lot<00:01:50.619> when<00:01:50.740> i<00:01:50.770> change<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.219> drivers

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
itself a lot when i change the drivers

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.219 
itself a lot when i change the drivers
so<00:01:51.939> that's<00:01:52.090> what<00:01:52.210> i<00:01:52.270> do<00:01:52.329> i<00:01:52.450> change<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:52.869> drivers

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
so that's what i do i change the drivers

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.510 
so that's what i do i change the drivers
and<00:01:53.319> they're<00:01:53.409> good<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.619> go<00:01:53.649> i<00:01:53.979> really<00:01:54.459> don't

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
and they're good to go i really don't

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.770 
and they're good to go i really don't
have<00:01:54.759> to<00:01:54.819> mail<00:01:54.969> it<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.240> i'm<00:01:55.299> feeling<00:01:55.509> out<00:01:55.749> of

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
have to mail it and i'm feeling out of

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.709 
have to mail it and i'm feeling out of
computer<00:01:56.200> for<00:01:56.350> a<00:01:56.409> while<00:01:56.560> if<00:01:57.159> i<00:01:57.340> do<00:01:57.399> that<00:01:57.520> so<00:01:58.359> i'm

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
computer for a while if i do that so i'm

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.270 
computer for a while if i do that so i'm
going<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:58.899> try<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.079> avoid<00:01:59.349> that<00:01:59.560> and<00:01:59.770> we'll

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
going to try and avoid that and we'll

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.459 
going to try and avoid that and we'll
see<00:02:00.490> but<00:02:01.329> i<00:02:01.599> think<00:02:01.869> i'm<00:02:01.929> eventually<00:02:02.109> going<00:02:02.349> to

the boot the the way it boots up to the
hard<00:02:14.920> drive<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.579> wasn't<00:02:15.940> booting<00:02:16.239> it<00:02:16.780> was

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
hard drive it wasn't booting it was

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.809 
hard drive it wasn't booting it was
saying<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.470> recognized<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.250> hard<00:02:18.430> drive<00:02:18.640> was

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
saying it recognized the hard drive was

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.819 
saying it recognized the hard drive was
there<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.629> just<00:02:19.930> would<00:02:20.079> not<00:02:20.230> boot<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.799> it

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
there it just would not boot to it

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.860 
there it just would not boot to it
alright<00:02:21.819> so<00:02:22.030> i<00:02:22.060> would<00:02:22.299> have<00:02:22.329> to<00:02:22.450> set<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.720> up

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
alright so i would have to set it up

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.780 
alright so i would have to set it up
with<00:02:22.959> bios<00:02:23.349> i'd<00:02:23.890> have<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.129> go<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.310> bios<00:02:24.670> and

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
with bios i'd have to go to bios and

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.030 
with bios i'd have to go to bios and
then<00:02:25.329> escape<00:02:25.840> out<00:02:26.019> of<00:02:26.049> bios<00:02:26.410> at<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.739> point<00:02:26.980> i

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
then escape out of bios at that point i

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.440 
then escape out of bios at that point i
would<00:02:27.099> asked<00:02:27.340> me<00:02:27.430> what<00:02:27.849> I<00:02:27.879> wanted<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.269> boot
