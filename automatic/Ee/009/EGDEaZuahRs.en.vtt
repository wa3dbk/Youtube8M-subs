 be indulgent since no, but I 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.350

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.110
 swag he is I did not play this game 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.750
 since I have 30 k 1 ie 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.310

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.560
 missing a little bit of you by the 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.670
 cameras 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.820

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.460
 about to about nil 1 1 and we 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.080

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.350
 complicate the task one because we like 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.170
