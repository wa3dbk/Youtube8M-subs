00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
definitely consider getting the number

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.549

full<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.309> maybe<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.850> different<00:01:03.180> print<00:01:03.559> but

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
full but maybe in a different print but

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.880 
full but maybe in a different print but
this<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.309> perfect<00:01:05.700> for<00:01:05.880> summer

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
tote and i think it they call it the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.850 
tote and i think it they call it the
vanilla<00:01:16.369> so<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.790> has<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:19.460> Michael<00:01:20.460> Kors<00:01:21.860> logo
