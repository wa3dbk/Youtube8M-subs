of<00:01:04.049> people<00:01:04.350> make<00:01:04.500> when<00:01:04.650> they<00:01:04.769> take<00:01:04.979> notes<00:01:05.309> is

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
of people make when they take notes is

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.609 
of people make when they take notes is
they<00:01:05.760> write<00:01:06.000> everything<00:01:06.479> down<00:01:06.689> word<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.439> word

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
they write everything down word for word

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.789 
they write everything down word for word
that<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.760> teacher<00:01:09.030> says<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.659> find<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.560> this

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
that the teacher says I find that this

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.350 
that the teacher says I find that this
can<00:01:11.130> be<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:11.490> redundant<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.150> then<00:01:12.270> it

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
can be a little redundant and then it

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.969 
can be a little redundant and then it
can<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.570> overwhelming<00:01:12.900> when<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.470> go<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.650> study

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
can be overwhelming when you go to study

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.300 
can be overwhelming when you go to study
and<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.369> 60<00:01:15.150> pages<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.750> notes<00:01:15.930> versus<00:01:16.710> 20

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
and you have 60 pages of notes versus 20

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.719 
and you have 60 pages of notes versus 20
of<00:01:18.140> every<00:01:19.140> word<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.619> your<00:01:19.740> professor<00:01:20.580> or

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
of every word that your professor or

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.789 
of every word that your professor or
teacher<00:01:20.880> has<00:01:21.210> said

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.249 

so<00:01:28.399> personally<00:01:28.939> when<00:01:29.299> I<00:01:29.329> take<00:01:29.630> notes<00:01:29.869> I<00:01:30.049> like

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
so personally when I take notes I like

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.770 
so personally when I take notes I like
to<00:01:30.350> be<00:01:30.439> short<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:30.979> simple<00:01:31.250> I<00:01:31.579> abbreviate<00:01:32.119> I

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
to be short and simple I abbreviate I

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.870 
to be short and simple I abbreviate I
only<00:01:33.350> put<00:01:33.649> down<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:33.920> important<00:01:34.310> things<00:01:34.490> if<00:01:34.700> a

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
only put down the important things if a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.029 
only put down the important things if a
teacher<00:01:35.149> says<00:01:35.600> oh<00:01:35.869> you<00:01:36.469> won't<00:01:36.619> need<00:01:36.770> to<00:01:37.009> know

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
teacher says oh you won't need to know

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:38.800 
teacher says oh you won't need to know
this<00:01:37.340> then<00:01:37.820> I<00:01:38.030> usually<00:01:38.179> don't<00:01:38.420> write<00:01:38.630> it<00:01:38.750> down

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
this then I usually don't write it down

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.779 
this then I usually don't write it down
now<00:01:39.289> sometimes<00:01:40.130> they'll<00:01:40.310> say<00:01:40.460> oh<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:40.670> don't

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
now sometimes they'll say oh you don't

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.130 
now sometimes they'll say oh you don't
need<00:01:40.939> to<00:01:41.060> know<00:01:41.149> this<00:01:41.270> for<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.509> test<00:01:41.780> but<00:01:41.990> you

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
need to know this for the test but you

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.599 
need to know this for the test but you
will<00:01:42.289> need<00:01:42.649> to<00:01:42.710> know<00:01:42.829> this<00:01:42.950> for<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.399> real
