00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.670
 suddenly and welcome to 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:14.459
 pine the modern architecture of today 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.059
 is characterized by lightness and 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.490
 light-flooded rooms 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.910
 exactly at this point puts negative 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.180
 darklings xl 2020 their accents 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.070
 the unique narrow profile view 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.630
 just fit in optimally 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.180
 modern architecture 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.930
 in addition to the conventional plastic 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.190
 Aluminum windows are also new 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.590
 Plastic aluminum described here 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.540
 doors in xl technology that is 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:45.790
 even more light through slim profiles 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.670
 In addition, the sliding door with 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.840
 obstacles swell g 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.290
 handicapped accessible and invisible 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.050
 drained another advantage is the 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.390
 Glazing from the outside which larger 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.690
 glasses allow and a replacement at 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.489
 Glass break enormously relieved with the xl 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.899
 technology is the possibility 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.930
 glasses to 52 mm thick installed so 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.950
 We can do it with the best heat protection 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.979
 In addition, the highest sound insulation and 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.710
 security offer in comparison to 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.619
 conventional sliding doors, the 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.369
 xl construction an absolutely filigree 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:27.130
 in the middle partie also have the narrow ones 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.740
 medium papers on an optimal 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.330
 statik which wing heights to two 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.670
 meter eighty 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.070
 the lever sliding doors have the highest 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.220
 building physics values normally 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.810
 only the finest are enough 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.439
 obstacle-free threshold of modern 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.900
 materials like wood plastic composites 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.140
 this particularly robust shape resistant and 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.670
 provides high thermal insulation due 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.310
 the threshold and a high-attenuation 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.490
 five kramer profile construction offers 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.460
 The yeast sliding door xl 2020 best 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.649
 Heat insulation values â€‹â€‹with a total of up to 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.240
 06 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.479
 These are absolutely outstanding 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.030
 Thermal insulation is the top thermal insulation one 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.630
 Sliding door is only one side of the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.390
 energy efficiency 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.940
 through the maximum incidence of light can 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.610
 additionally more passive mobile 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.490
 which in turn are won by everyone 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.910
 efficiency increases all of these 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.670
 advantages is the sliding door xl 20 20 so 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.080
 good that even from nobody's eyes 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.110
 absolutely excellent 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.350
 energy efficiency and more quality of life 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.390
 We will also be busy in the future 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.960
 Thanks a lot for your interest and up 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.960
 meet again
