number in seven 96.5 4 it's a nine let's

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.020 
number in seven 96.5 4 it's a nine let's
compare<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.740> nine<00:02:22.100> with<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.640> second<00:02:23.000> number

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
compare that nine with the second number

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.890 
compare that nine with the second number
on<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.420> guide<00:02:23.600> label<00:02:23.960> it's<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.560> four<00:02:25.660> nine<00:02:26.660> come

after<00:02:27.170> four<00:02:27.760> yes<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:28.940> does<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:29.540> we<00:02:29.720> should<00:02:29.930> look

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
after four yes it does so we should look

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.990 
after four yes it does so we should look
at<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.410> next<00:02:30.680> show<00:02:30.800> what<00:02:31.160> does<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.430> guy<00:02:31.610> label
