00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.089
 Secretary of State Weekers promised everything 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.429
 put everything on it to get the money back 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.780
 get the bulgarian allowance fraud 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.429
 we are there for half a year 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.370
 further and has from the images 5 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.400
 fines imposed there 55 already know it collect 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.350
 of the more than 800 fines 805 fines and we 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.390
 the how much gravel 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.019
 there are very few 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.510
 8085 and yes that was around 20 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.670
 yes 55 it turned out that those questions I asked 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.130
 55 yes it is still somewhere 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.030
 I thought the scoring was really bad 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.899
 a 10% score much less than 10% 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.670
 Secretary of State Week is that bare one 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.530
 more than half a year ago I'm going through that 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.510
 yarn women that I am going to get back and 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.300
 I will take measures and then read them 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.579
 today that of the 805 fines that gym 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.710
 must be there are only 55 in that 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.910
 thing well then do not go completely tasty 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.039
 now he has to face when 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.149
 that parents from the beat are complicated 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.610
 he became a terrible old greece 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.430
 is a big cash machine the bulgars 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.559
 suggest millions of surcharges 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.090
 they fill bags and they just come 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.890
 along that way in it zero yes hear that 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.750
 we will not get everything back 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.360
 a large part is collected again 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.619
 the counter is or 55 from the dyke graph 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.390
 and we are dissatisfied with that 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.640
 find through to more that yes yes yes 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.950
 absolutely 55 fines have none then 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.290
 We can state that Mr. Weekers 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.900
 has failed 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.240
 well this system has failed and 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.110
 weekers is of course 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.460
 responsible for that system 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.900
 big question is whether it is the fault of the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.490
 Secretary of State and we will 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.430
 get sharp tomorrow 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.990
 my impression is that here also beer europe 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.520
 and so gets in the way but it's much worse 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.869
 is that it turns out that we are the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.909
 housing allowance and that is the largest 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.020
 part of the allowances not at all 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.430
 back there for that may be because there 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.360
 have no agreement from bulgaria 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.159
 and that will be lost to us for a moment 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.229
 so most of them are allowed 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.850
 just keeping is 300 fines there says 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.729
 citizens all the help we disagree 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.399
 with which we try to do the maximum 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.009
 and effort is again maximum because 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.990
 I believe that we are in the Netherlands 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.860
 have very good facilities there too 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.790
 have to do everything to make it 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.049
 ensure that those facilities 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.880
 end up with the people on the right again 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.509
 on and never with the people who 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.040
 not entitled to 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.960
 You immediately asked here with 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.340
 how many other eu member states and turkey 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.170
 because that is also where people come from 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.540
 we also have no agreements they lie 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.310
 do n't go a step further 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.989
 therefore also it is important that 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.790
 you make agreements at European level 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.189
 also yes then there is europe map again he 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.870
 the state secretary he must resolve 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.359
 so simple holes that you are not from 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.859
 I'll be there, my solution 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:26.930
 solution is a tough approach 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:28.790
 Of course those women he need a lot 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.920
 the pvda goes much harder at the back 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.299
 group thinks he should do everything to 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.430
 as much as possible to retrieve it 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.620
 you go more because he ever does that 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.269
 he does his best you are more concerned with that 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.980
 then that is the final result 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.439
 I want him to do his best and that 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.849
 it is difficult to achieve those results 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.620
 if you also see that for example 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.730
 appeals have been submitted that are 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.170
 all awarded 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.090
 well I don't think that is a tough approach 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.799
 by engraving 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.989
 sharp in my straight leg 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.000
 sir weekers yes but that is about is over 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.620
 not just about the Bulgarian father 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.629
 but that goes more is it is veneering it 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.939
 general indeed because there is quite a bit more 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.650
 Mass will certainly insist on them 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.970
 that that money is coming back and that he 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.049
 just much better to do its best 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.120
 get that money back 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.709
 because otherwise the dust is state secretary 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.060
 fraud and doing nothing instead of 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.060
 the State Secretary for Finance
