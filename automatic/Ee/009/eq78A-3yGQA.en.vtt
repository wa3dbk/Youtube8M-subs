00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.540 
on my MOC and I'll show you the result
okay<00:00:58.050> well<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:58.500> finished<00:00:58.949> doing<00:00:59.070> them<00:00:59.340> and

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
okay well I just finished doing them and

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.380 
okay well I just finished doing them and
I<00:01:00.270> ended<00:01:00.510> up<00:01:00.629> having<00:01:00.780> like<00:01:01.190> 30<00:01:02.190> extra<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.120> I

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
I ended up having like 30 extra so I

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.399 
I ended up having like 30 extra so I
don't<00:01:03.570> know<00:01:03.660> if<00:01:03.719> that's<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.960> good<00:01:04.080> thing<00:01:04.229> or<00:01:04.290> bad

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
don't know if that's a good thing or bad

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.039 
don't know if that's a good thing or bad
thing<00:01:04.470> because<00:01:04.979> those<00:01:05.330> these<00:01:06.330> were<00:01:06.479> like<00:01:06.630> 20

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
thing because those these were like 20

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.140 
thing because those these were like 20
cents<00:01:07.380> each<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.310> guess<00:01:08.700> I'll<00:01:08.850> probably<00:01:09.030> use

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
cents each so I guess I'll probably use

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.190 
cents each so I guess I'll probably use
them<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:09.510> something<00:01:09.840> because<00:01:10.020> they<00:01:10.080> are

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
them for something because they are

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.179 
them for something because they are
really<00:01:10.740> cool<00:01:10.920> pieces<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.909> mean<00:01:12.900> come<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:14.100> no

really cool pieces I mean come on and no
one's<00:01:14.340> else<00:01:14.520> really<00:01:14.820> no<00:01:14.970> one<00:01:15.090> else<00:01:15.150> has<00:01:15.450> really

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479

done<00:01:15.900> anything<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.380> them<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.070> did<00:01:17.670> build

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909

what<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> wanted<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.600> build<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.350> came<00:01:19.530> out

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
what I wanted to build and it came out

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.219 
what I wanted to build and it came out
totally<00:01:20.280> sick<00:01:21.170> at<00:01:22.170> least<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.500> think<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.860> did

right here this is kind of like a wall

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.249 
right here this is kind of like a wall
going<00:01:37.470> around<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> base<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:39.020> along<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.229> top

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
going around the base and along the top

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.179 
going around the base and along the top
there's<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.220> some<00:01:41.460> terrain<00:01:42.049> with<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:44.040> like

cool because they've got this uh it's
three<00:02:46.989> separate<00:02:47.349> colors<00:02:47.530> it's<00:02:48.280> got<00:02:48.459> dark<00:02:48.670> gray

in the middle and then this trans red

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.460 
in the middle and then this trans red
line<00:02:51.340> that's<00:02:51.849> the<00:02:52.090> same<00:02:52.329> diameter<00:02:53.049> all<00:02:53.379> the

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
line that's the same diameter all the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.470 
line that's the same diameter all the
way<00:02:53.560> around<00:02:53.829> and<00:02:54.040> then<00:02:54.609> light<00:02:54.909> gray<00:02:55.150> same

diameter<00:02:55.930> all<00:02:56.079> the<00:02:56.200> way<00:02:56.290> around<00:02:56.560> which<00:02:56.769> is<00:02:56.950> a

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
diameter all the way around which is a

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.869 
diameter all the way around which is a
little<00:02:58.150> bit<00:02:58.269> more<00:02:58.359> difficult<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.959> achieve

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
little bit more difficult to achieve

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.550 
little bit more difficult to achieve
then<00:03:00.879> like<00:03:01.060> regular<00:03:01.480> snot<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.049> then<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.290> little

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
then like regular snot and then a little

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.759 
then like regular snot and then a little
trapdoor<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.489> leads<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:04.000> some<00:03:04.150> stairs<00:03:04.590> oops

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
trapdoor that leads to some stairs oops

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.640 
trapdoor that leads to some stairs oops
and<00:03:06.040> I<00:03:06.310> also<00:03:06.430> rebuilt<00:03:06.939> these<00:03:07.060> two<00:03:07.239> v<00:03:07.419> wings<00:03:07.650> you
