00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.419 
so there's pressure from there as well
so<00:00:46.559> yeah<00:00:47.159> as<00:00:47.339> a<00:00:47.659> importantly<00:00:48.659> I<00:00:49.399> believe<00:00:50.399> that

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
so yeah as a importantly I believe that

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:54.079 
so yeah as a importantly I believe that
we'd<00:00:50.760> run<00:00:50.999> the<00:00:51.210> race<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:51.899> I'd<00:00:52.079> tried<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.429> not

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
we'd run the race but I'd tried to not

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.239 
we'd run the race but I'd tried to not
not<00:00:54.569> overthink<00:00:55.109> it<00:00:55.229> and<00:00:55.319> not<00:00:55.499> work<00:00:55.709> it<00:00:55.920> up<00:00:56.039> and

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:56.249 
not overthink it and not work it up and

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:58.459 
not overthink it and not work it up and
think<00:00:56.459> oh<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:56.729> the<00:00:56.940> Olympic<00:00:57.299> final<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.319> that

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
think oh it's the Olympic final so that

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.590 
think oh it's the Olympic final so that
I<00:00:58.499> would<00:00:58.709> get<00:00:58.889> nervous<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.459> tense<00:00:59.699> up<00:00:59.999> so<00:01:00.269> I

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
I would get nervous and tense up so I

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.359 
I would get nervous and tense up so I
just<00:01:01.079> thought<00:01:01.229> it<00:01:01.379> was<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.619> a<00:01:01.799> normal<00:01:02.010> race

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:02.369 
just thought it was just a normal race

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:03.949 
just thought it was just a normal race
and<00:01:02.699> then<00:01:02.789> when<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.089> did<00:01:03.359> cross<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.659> line<00:01:03.809> I

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:03.959 
and then when we did cross the line I

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:06.260 
and then when we did cross the line I
just<00:01:04.379> let<00:01:04.559> myself<00:01:04.710> think<00:01:05.190> of<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.909> was<00:01:06.120> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270
