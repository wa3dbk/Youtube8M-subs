the<00:01:10.229> cool<00:01:10.409> thing<00:01:10.439> about<00:01:10.619> this<00:01:10.890> chord

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the cool thing about this chord

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.980 
the cool thing about this chord
progression<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.640> really<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.299> power<00:01:12.479> chords

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
progression it really the power chords

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.690 
progression it really the power chords
anything<00:01:13.619> about<00:01:13.770> power<00:01:14.010> chord<00:01:14.250> there's<00:01:14.580> no

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
anything about power chord there's no

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.490 
anything about power chord there's no
third<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.360> can't<00:01:15.509> tell<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.810> minor<00:01:16.140> or

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
third so you can't tell this minor or

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.499 
third so you can't tell this minor or
major<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.130> because<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> third<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.479> chord

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
major and because the third of the chord

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.679 
major and because the third of the chord
tells<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:19.380> your<00:01:19.530> major<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.860> minor<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.630> you

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
tells you if your major a minor so you

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.030 
tells you if your major a minor so you
really<00:01:21.990> don't<00:01:22.049> know<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.380> major<00:01:22.619> or<00:01:22.860> minor

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
really don't know if your major or minor

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.290 
really don't know if your major or minor
you<00:01:23.430> have<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.270> heard

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.700 

of<00:01:31.300> course<00:01:31.510> events<00:01:31.750> and<00:01:31.900> distortion<00:01:32.320> going<00:01:32.590> on

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
of course events and distortion going on

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.050 
of course events and distortion going on
and<00:01:32.860> you<00:01:32.920> can<00:01:33.040> hear<00:01:33.160> some<00:01:33.250> overtones<00:01:33.730> and

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
and you can hear some overtones and

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and you can hear some overtones and
whatnot<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:35.470> basically<00:01:36.220> you<00:01:36.610> can<00:01:36.730> start<00:01:37.080> if

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
whatnot so basically you can start if

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.680 
whatnot so basically you can start if
you<00:01:38.200> don't<00:01:38.230> use<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.620> 1<00:01:38.770> 4<00:01:38.980> &amp;<00:01:39.130> 5<00:01:39.250> and<00:01:40.060> punk<00:01:40.330> music

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
you don't use the 1 4 &amp; 5 and punk music

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.440 
you don't use the 1 4 &amp; 5 and punk music
you<00:01:41.470> can<00:01:41.920> use<00:01:42.070> with<00:01:42.190> a<00:01:42.310> lot<00:01:42.640> of<00:01:43.030> other<00:01:43.240> punk

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
you can use with a lot of other punk

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.150 
you can use with a lot of other punk
songs<00:01:43.660> are<00:01:43.810> what<00:01:43.900> they<00:01:43.960> call<00:01:43.990> ostinatos<00:01:44.890> and

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
songs are what they call ostinatos and

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.620 
songs are what they call ostinatos and
now<00:01:45.310> so<00:01:45.490> not<00:01:45.610> only<00:01:45.730> in<00:01:45.850> classical<00:01:46.150> music<00:01:46.480> means

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
now so not only in classical music means

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.420 
now so not only in classical music means
a<00:01:46.690> repeated<00:01:47.050> bassline<00:01:47.500> in<00:01:47.770> this<00:01:48.040> case<00:01:48.190> to<00:01:48.310> be

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
a repeated bassline in this case to be

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.220 
a repeated bassline in this case to be
more<00:01:48.640> like<00:01:48.760> a<00:01:48.790> repeated<00:01:49.240> figure<00:01:49.810> over<00:01:50.140> and

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
more like a repeated figure over and

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.480 
more like a repeated figure over and
over<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.470> over<00:01:50.500> again

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
over and over again

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:02.370 
over and over again
with<00:01:52.240> maybe<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.810> there<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.869> could<00:02:01.990> be<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.110> punk

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
with maybe so there that could be a punk

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.350 
with maybe so there that could be a punk
song<00:02:02.770> in<00:02:02.920> astana<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.520> repeats<00:02:04.030> over<00:02:04.150> and<00:02:04.270> over

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
song in astana the repeats over and over

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.969 
song in astana the repeats over and over
again<00:02:04.540> about<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.869> whole<00:02:04.930> song<00:02:05.229> at<00:02:05.680> least<00:02:05.740> the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
again about the whole song at least the

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.440 
again about the whole song at least the
