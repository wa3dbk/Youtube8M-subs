00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:08.210 

I'm<00:00:06.749> concerned<00:00:07.049> about<00:00:07.169> the<00:00:07.410> safety<00:00:07.950> in<00:00:08.100> the

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
I'm concerned about the safety in the

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.740 
I'm concerned about the safety in the
cities<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.150> safe

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
cities is it safe

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.350 
cities is it safe
very<00:00:11.750> must<00:00:12.750> conclude<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.460> American<00:00:14.460> cities

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
very must conclude that American cities

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.620 
very must conclude that American cities
are<00:00:15.769> indeed<00:00:16.769> in<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.130> crosshairs<00:00:17.550> what's<00:00:18.509> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
are indeed in the crosshairs what's the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.560 
are indeed in the crosshairs what's the
probability<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:20.359> high-density<00:00:21.359> urban

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
probability that a high-density urban

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.130 
probability that a high-density urban
metropolitan<00:00:22.380> area<00:00:22.740> could<00:00:23.359> be<00:00:24.359> subjected<00:00:24.599> to

metropolitan area could be subjected to

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.749 
metropolitan area could be subjected to
a<00:00:25.609> catastrophic<00:00:26.609> event<00:00:28.460> probability<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.550> high

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
a catastrophic event probability is high

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.579 
a catastrophic event probability is high
I<00:00:30.119> think<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.839> have<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.289> know<00:00:31.409> live

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:31.589 
I think you have to you know live

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:32.389 
I think you have to you know live
without<00:00:31.739> fear

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
without fear

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.119 
without fear
what's<00:00:32.609> historic<00:00:33.059> about<00:00:33.300> today<00:00:33.629> is<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.739> now

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
what's historic about today is that now

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.750 
what's historic about today is that now
we<00:00:35.190> stand<00:00:35.550> ready<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.800> support<00:00:37.800> America<00:00:38.340> at

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
we stand ready to support America at

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.119 
we stand ready to support America at
home<00:00:39.059> we<00:00:39.390> saw<00:00:39.629> what<00:00:39.930> Katrina<00:00:40.350> could<00:00:40.680> do<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.949> us

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
home we saw what Katrina could do to us

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.400 
home we saw what Katrina could do to us
which<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.210> course<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.570> cakewalk<00:00:42.960> compared

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
which is of course a cakewalk compared

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.410 
which is of course a cakewalk compared
to<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:43.710> we're<00:00:43.859> talking<00:00:44.010> about<00:00:44.309> where<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
to what we're talking about where is the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.569 
to what we're talking about where is the
biggest<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.019> most<00:00:46.050> effective<00:00:46.800> target<00:00:47.190> cities

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
biggest and most effective target cities

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.509 
biggest and most effective target cities
I<00:00:47.789> think<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.210> feeds<00:00:48.510> into<00:00:48.690> our<00:00:48.870> deepest

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
I think it feeds into our deepest

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.029 
I think it feeds into our deepest
psychological<00:00:50.519> fears<00:00:50.850> part<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.570> our<00:00:51.690> training

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
psychological fears part of our training

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.770 
psychological fears part of our training
for<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.219> mission<00:00:53.670> was<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.000> work<00:00:54.510> directly

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
for this mission was to work directly

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.950 
for this mission was to work directly
with<00:00:55.109> elements<00:00:55.920> loved<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.429> FEMA

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960

with elements loved the FEMA
FBI<00:00:58.699> state<00:01:00.410> agencies<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.679> don't<00:01:02.039> think<00:01:02.429> we<00:01:02.609> are

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
FBI state agencies I don't think we are

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.810 
FBI state agencies I don't think we are
in<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> right<00:01:03.210> universe<00:01:03.809> yet<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:05.220> our<00:01:05.339> ability

in the right universe yet in our ability

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.719 
in the right universe yet in our ability
to<00:01:05.850> handle<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> consequences<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.799> think<00:01:07.920> we're

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
to handle the consequences I think we're

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.370 
to handle the consequences I think we're
much<00:01:08.880> less<00:01:08.939> prepared<00:01:09.509> now<00:01:09.750> than<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.049> were<00:01:10.170> five

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
much less prepared now than we were five

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.770 
much less prepared now than we were five
years<00:01:10.619> ago<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:11.100> more<00:01:11.400> densely<00:01:11.790> populated<00:01:12.060> area

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
years ago a more densely populated area

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.810 
years ago a more densely populated area
is<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> greater<00:01:13.350> risk<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.890> therefore<00:01:14.670> have

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
is a greater risk and therefore have

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.819 
is a greater risk and therefore have
greater<00:01:15.030> consequences<00:01:15.840> we're<00:01:16.079> greatly

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
greater consequences we're greatly

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:18.800 
greater consequences we're greatly
challenged<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.000> understand<00:01:18.450> if<00:01:18.659> we

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
challenged we have to understand if we

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.770 
challenged we have to understand if we
get<00:01:19.049> beyond<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:20.310> metropolitan<00:01:21.060> area<00:01:21.390> hit

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
get beyond a one metropolitan area hit

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.139 
get beyond a one metropolitan area hit
we<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.770> exhausted<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.490> resources<00:01:23.610> that

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
we have exhausted the resources that

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.389 
we have exhausted the resources that
we've<00:01:24.299> built<00:01:24.509> up<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.170> probability<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.950> high<00:01:26.130> I

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
we've built up so probability is high I

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.480 
we've built up so probability is high I
think<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.649> probability<00:01:28.649> of<00:01:28.680> martial

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
think that the probability of martial

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.940 
think that the probability of martial
law<00:01:29.520> would<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:30.030> very<00:01:30.570> real<00:01:30.990> if<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.619> can<00:01:31.770> take

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
law would be very real if you can take

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.800 
law would be very real if you can take
care<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.219> your<00:01:32.340> family<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.210> potential

care of your family you have a potential

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
of helping your neighbor short of that

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.569 
of helping your neighbor short of that
you<00:01:36.509> become<00:01:36.930> part<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.469> problem<00:01:37.829> if<00:01:38.219> I<00:01:38.369> woke

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
you become part of the problem if I woke

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.490 
you become part of the problem if I woke
up<00:01:38.759> tomorrow<00:01:38.969> and<00:01:39.299> none<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.110> these<00:01:40.290> things
