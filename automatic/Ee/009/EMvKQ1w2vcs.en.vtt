 there are such monster trucks here 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.220
 two game modes championship and single 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.759
 events let's look at single 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.660
 events have a drag racing section here 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.850
 on the need to drive a small circle and 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.040
 do it faster than our engineers 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.230
 here you must go on the road 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.600
 there are checkpoints these all 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.629
 checkpoints need to drive to 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.940
 mandatory and in the prescribed 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.789
 alright i'm here so here i am 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.600
 drove and it seems chose to his 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.510
 rival 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.930
 next we go you see such 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.000
 here is the standings already passes with us 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.330
 quarter finals and so here it is necessary 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.610
 drive several identical circles 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.920
 naturally here as part of the championship 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.200
 there are other game modes other tracks and 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.390
 I think the game is bored me too 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.560
 by the way is absolutely free available in 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.780
 google play market 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.030
 I advise everyone to play this game 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.100
 liked to have good graphics in 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.380
 principle good physics but to 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.479
 management will have to get used a little 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.030
 who loves racing who loves big jeeps 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.210
 and who likes hard music this game 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.240
 just created for you 2 game no less 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.790
 male is called a i i wanna be kirov in 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.820
 This game you will experience all 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.119
 your nerves and check break in whether you 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.820
 tablet or your phone by that moment 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.950
 When will you play this game or not? Why? 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.149
 Now you all will know the management 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.450
 here is done using two 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.909
 buttons left right and two buttons jump 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.259
 and shooting to persist 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.360
 there are some special ones here 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.159
 notepads with save and us 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.500
 you need to jump all all all all 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.570
 the obstacles that will be waiting for us 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.700
 if we get weary we start with 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.020
 places where the last time preserved about 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.910
 save trust me here not on 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.180
 each location they are about 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.640
 happen through one location in principle 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.220
 At the beginning, then the game is easy, I'm just into it 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.400
 played yesterday passed far enough in 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.260
 the end of each level is waiting for you the boss and 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.540
 and to beat every boss you 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.580
 will also have to adapt very well 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.470
 I love these toys 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.390
 waste your nerves and by the way 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.020
 saving let's save and play 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.630
 a little bit more 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.810
 graphics though here and usually nothing 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.150
 remarkable but believe me guys not 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.600
 the graphics make the game interesting and her 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.720
 I'll tell you if you are weak 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.290
 nerves then you should not download this game 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.210
 but if you are a patient boy and you 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.850
 tighten here are such crazy 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.250
 the platformer is a must and 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.440
 and download play never pass 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.770
 don't rush especially in those moments when 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.930
 you leave one location and get to 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.720
 another because you can there 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.840
 set fire set on fire wait here such 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.340
 here are the thorns that will kill you 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.860
 insert with heroes and help it 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.920
 little karapuz too become a hero and 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.340
 pass all all messi 3 game is called 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.530
 the slices here you have to click on 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.930
 button and at the same time do not let you cut off 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.940
 finger and cut off the finger straight 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.280
 sense of the word let's start a new game and 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.590
 go through a couple of missions at the beginning is necessary 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.630
 just push the button no knives 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.250
 you do not expect here but further 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.800
 something more interesting begins 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.250
 here we need to have time to click on 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.340
 button until some sort of summer cleaver 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.080
 shut down more accurately and not chopped off 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.510
 you need a finger in the second mission 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.209
 the same ax lift up in order 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.910
 to open the way of the button and so 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.650
 the next mission is waiting for us a knife that we are with 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.110
 we can do it we can like this 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.170
 fold and thereby push the buttons 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.300
 next will be these knives a whole bunch i don't 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.930
 I know how much you have to do there 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.180
 tangencies but in principle this is all possible 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.950
 do with two hands don't know how 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.049
 it will look like on the phone but on 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.060
 the tablet is by the way actually 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.330
 convenient enough let's try here 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.170
 so here do and pass this mission than 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.480
 more touches support your 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.770
 the crane the easier it will pass you all 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.630
 here these missions also see 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.580
 polished her finger and the whole tablet 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.400
 was covered with blood in general 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.340
 probably puzzles and maybe a little bit 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.070
 arcade to and maybe play a little bit on 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.160
 development of your reaction but she is cruel 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.260
 as you all love probably all men 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.180
 love tanks and so the next game 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.120
 will we have about tanks let's click 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.040
 Start choose the first mission and play in 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.590
 she's basically playing enough 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.600
 primitive but chopped into her 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.060
 principle we can have four buttons 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.390
 like a joystick forward back left 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.340
 right here and so he turns 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:10.610
 the nose is exactly the trunk of our tank to move 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.940
 can't eat two kinds of weapon machine guns and 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.250
 also there is like this main gun 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.760
 with which we can shoot at our 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.190
 enemies but the main gun has this 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.200
 the property is that it needs to be charged 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.120
 there is constantly you have no shoot 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.150
 you will have to wait for a certain 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:33.260
 moment until it is charged and you are not 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:35.360
 be able to shoot again basically in 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.420
 You can play the game but I do not know how much 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.680
 it will delay you because after all in 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:45.040
 in terms of physics, the game I did a little bit no 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.040
 really and 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.170
 so here is such a comment to you 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.760
 leave the last screen today 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.580
 called and big trouble 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.160
 it is a runner but fairly standard with 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.690
 enough non-standard graphics so 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.610
 let's get to it in what and 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.340
 is the game we play with some 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.590
 boy mitten and must run and 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.140
 rob people the more people we rob 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.930
 the more the crowd is following us 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.480
 they catch us by the way wounds 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.970
 need to change our position for 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.830
 so that they will not catch us they will 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.890
 jump on us if we don't make it in time 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:24.190
 Now change the lane then they are on 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:27.460
 serve if we had time to roll something 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:30.760
 it would not have happened here 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:33.640
 dudes that we robbed would just 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.710
 hit face on the ground 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.650
 Here is such an interesting runner 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:41.830
 here to buy various upgrades to take 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.290
 great skates and so on here are many 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.930
 bonuses many different chips that you 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.480
 can use to get away from 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.430
 an angry mob is naturally unnecessary 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.030
 here and so take an example from the main 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.280
 the hero 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.580
 better take an example from these guys 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:00.100
 who trampled the intruder just 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.800
 you waltz in Qatar, thank you very much 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.570
 for your attention with you was the gameplay and 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.730
 subscribe to the channel put your fingers 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.730
 top and never steal from others
