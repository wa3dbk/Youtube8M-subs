this frequencies that travels down and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.530 
this frequencies that travels down and
you<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.809> still<00:01:04.080> hear<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.350> bass<00:01:04.500> all<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.280> time

but in order to filter out all the base

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.340 
but in order to filter out all the base
you<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.740> change<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.010> bottom<00:01:11.549> side<00:01:11.760> of

you have to change the bottom side of
the<00:01:13.670> screen<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.259> maximum<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.439> think<00:01:16.710> they're

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
okay now changing the bottom of the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.170 
okay now changing the bottom of the
screen<00:02:21.950> allowing<00:02:22.950> louder<00:02:23.700> volume<00:02:26.180> smaller

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
screen allowing louder volume smaller

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:36.640 
screen allowing louder volume smaller
fault<00:02:27.750> lower<00:02:28.050> volume<00:02:30.800> in<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.950> middle<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.430> the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.950 

see<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:38.040> don't<00:02:38.190> hear<00:02:38.430> any<00:02:38.640> beats<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:42.780> hear

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
see you don't hear any beats you hear

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.390 
see you don't hear any beats you hear
that<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:46.860> hear<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.130> beats<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:48.000> gone<00:02:48.210> now

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
that you hear the beats it's gone now

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.460 
that you hear the beats it's gone now
hear<00:02:50.400> this<00:02:50.430> one<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:50.970> get<00:02:51.150> feeds<00:02:51.420> man

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.380 

so<00:02:57.470> now<00:02:57.650> that's<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.250> demonstration<00:02:59.090> now

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
so now that's the demonstration now

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.000 
so now that's the demonstration now
let's<00:03:00.080> listen<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:01.190> what<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.700> have<00:03:02.120> done<00:03:03.050> okay

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
let's listen to what I have done okay

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.360 
let's listen to what I have done okay
let<00:03:04.250> me<00:03:04.400> try<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.730> edit<00:03:04.970> some<00:03:05.480> synthesizer<00:03:06.370> ok

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
let me try to edit some synthesizer ok

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.440 
let me try to edit some synthesizer ok
now<00:03:07.880> I'm<00:03:08.030> going<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.300> play<00:03:08.480> this<00:03:08.660> then<00:03:09.320> there

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
now I'm going to play this then there

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.490 
now I'm going to play this then there
there<00:03:11.450> are<00:03:11.480> nine<00:03:11.780> squares<00:03:12.710> for<00:03:13.100> each

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
there are nine squares for each

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.200 
there are nine squares for each
instruments<00:03:15.500> synthesizer<00:03:16.400> bass<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:16.970> drums

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
instruments synthesizer bass and drums

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.980 
instruments synthesizer bass and drums
and<00:03:17.450> these<00:03:18.140> nine<00:03:18.920> squares<00:03:19.790> on<00:03:20.120> here<00:03:20.480> are

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
and these nine squares on here are

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.350 
and these nine squares on here are
presets<00:03:21.620> ok<00:03:22.130> basically<00:03:23.090> that's<00:03:23.210> an

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
presets ok basically that's an

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.060 
presets ok basically that's an
instruction<00:03:23.930> teaches<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.380> how<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.620> do<00:03:24.830> it<00:03:24.860> but

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
instruction teaches you how to do it but

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.060 
instruction teaches you how to do it but
uh<00:03:25.130> in<00:03:25.700> in<00:03:26.240> depth<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.290> have<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.860> play

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
uh in in depth that you have to play

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.420 
uh in in depth that you have to play
around<00:03:28.250> with<00:03:28.550> this<00:03:29.020> apps<00:03:30.020> to<00:03:30.530> get<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.100> know<00:03:31.250> it

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
around with this apps to get to know it

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.400 
around with this apps to get to know it
all<00:03:31.610> right<00:03:32.060> so<00:03:32.720> basically<00:03:33.050> you<00:03:33.230> have<00:03:33.350> a

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
all right so basically you have a

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.290 
all right so basically you have a
different<00:03:33.800> kind<00:03:34.010> of<00:03:34.100> squares<00:03:34.790> around<00:03:35.000> the

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
different kind of squares around the

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.010 
different kind of squares around the
regions<00:03:35.810> on<00:03:35.960> the<00:03:35.990> screen<00:03:37.000> ok<00:03:38.000> pressing<00:03:38.780> maybe

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
regions on the screen ok pressing maybe

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.790 
regions on the screen ok pressing maybe
the<00:03:39.260> bottom<00:03:39.950> laughs<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:41.510> know<00:03:41.660> bottom<00:03:42.110> left

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
the bottom laughs you know bottom left

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.350 
the bottom laughs you know bottom left
but<00:03:43.190> I<00:03:43.220> would<00:03:43.490> just<00:03:43.640> say<00:03:43.670> on<00:03:43.880> an<00:03:44.000> honest

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
but I would just say on an honest

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.110 
but I would just say on an honest
greatest<00:03:44.630> top<00:03:44.870> right<00:03:45.080> now<00:03:45.230> okay<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:46.220> if<00:03:47.000> you

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
greatest top right now okay and if you

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.540 
greatest top right now okay and if you
drag<00:03:47.420> it<00:03:47.450> over<00:03:47.600> here<00:03:47.900> it's<00:03:48.020> different

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.310 

so<00:03:53.390> it<00:03:53.480> acts<00:03:53.720> more<00:03:53.900> tones<00:03:55.960> so<00:03:56.960> maybe<00:03:57.140> it<00:03:57.260> is

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
so it acts more tones so maybe it is

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.750 
so it acts more tones so maybe it is
just<00:03:57.440> a<00:03:57.620> foundation<00:03:58.190> of<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:59.150> synthesizer

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.330 

a<00:04:01.879> little<00:04:02.540> bit<00:04:02.629> more<00:04:02.840> complex

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:16.629 

you

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.099 

now<00:04:17.639> remember<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:18.269> screen<00:04:18.600> cover<00:04:18.870> my

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
now remember this screen cover my

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.790 
now remember this screen cover my
treated<00:04:19.500> as<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.650> 9<00:04:20.389> square<00:04:21.389> grid<00:04:21.720> matrix<00:04:22.650> that's

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
treated as a 9 square grid matrix that's

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.040 
treated as a 9 square grid matrix that's
called<00:04:23.100> matrix<00:04:23.639> okay<00:04:24.680> three<00:04:25.680> by<00:04:25.919> three<00:04:26.250> matrix

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
called matrix okay three by three matrix

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:40.570 
called matrix okay three by three matrix
music<00:04:28.250> playing<00:04:29.780> yeah

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.920 

so<00:04:41.960> music<00:04:42.960> you<00:04:43.289> see<00:04:43.469> this<00:04:43.939> sector<00:04:44.939> this<00:04:45.180> box

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
so music you see this sector this box

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.209 
so music you see this sector this box
over<00:04:46.229> here<00:04:46.259> okay<00:04:47.389> basically<00:04:48.389> it's<00:04:49.099> should<00:04:50.099> be

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:50.219 
over here okay basically it's should be

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:59.029 
over here okay basically it's should be
this<00:04:50.550> box<00:04:50.939> down<00:04:51.270> here<00:04:56.240> okay<00:04:57.240> so<00:04:57.689> you<00:04:58.229> can<00:04:58.409> kind

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
this box down here okay so you can kind

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.649 
this box down here okay so you can kind
of<00:04:59.099> look<00:04:59.249> at<00:04:59.460> this<00:04:59.610> as<00:04:59.909> like<00:05:00.300> um<00:05:01.490> put<00:05:02.490> it<00:05:02.659> upside

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
of look at this as like um put it upside

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:05.769 
of look at this as like um put it upside
down<00:05:03.719> put<00:05:04.110> your<00:05:04.139> phone<00:05:04.349> upside<00:05:04.499> down<00:05:04.830> so<00:05:05.159> this

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:05.779 
down put your phone upside down so this

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:10.100 
down put your phone upside down so this
square<00:05:06.779> right<00:05:06.960> now<00:05:07.139> okay<00:05:07.949> it's<00:05:09.110> representing

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
square right now okay it's representing

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.869 
square right now okay it's representing
the<00:05:10.229> screen<00:05:10.620> when<00:05:11.189> you<00:05:11.279> are<00:05:11.430> putting<00:05:11.610> or

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:11.879 
the screen when you are putting or

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.420 
the screen when you are putting or
sonalee<00:05:12.509> represent<00:05:13.469> this<00:05:13.560> square<00:05:13.889> over<00:05:14.189> here

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
sonalee represent this square over here

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.399 
sonalee represent this square over here
so<00:05:15.180> I<00:05:15.210> don't<00:05:15.270> know<00:05:15.509> if<00:05:15.539> I've<00:05:15.719> explained<00:05:16.259> myself

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
so I don't know if I've explained myself

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.249 
so I don't know if I've explained myself
on<00:05:16.969> clearly<00:05:17.969> but<00:05:18.120> you<00:05:18.270> have<00:05:18.419> to<00:05:18.629> really<00:05:18.960> play

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
on clearly but you have to really play

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.709 
on clearly but you have to really play
around<00:05:19.289> with<00:05:19.650> this<00:05:19.770> app<00:05:20.009> to<00:05:20.249> make<00:05:20.849> fun<00:05:21.089> have

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:21.719 
around with this app to make fun have

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:37.740 
around with this app to make fun have
fun

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.650 

you<00:05:38.750> see<00:05:38.930> that<00:05:39.080> i'm<00:05:39.560> using<00:05:39.620> five<00:05:40.070> fingers

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
you see that i'm using five fingers

00:05:40.660 --> 00:06:03.750 
you see that i'm using five fingers
changing<00:05:41.660> everything

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.170 

now<00:06:04.420> you<00:06:04.480> see<00:06:05.200> that<00:06:05.250> the<00:06:06.250> program<00:06:06.670> has<00:06:06.700> kind<00:06:07.120> of

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
now you see that the program has kind of

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.150 
now you see that the program has kind of
problem<00:06:07.810> it's<00:06:08.050> actually<00:06:08.260> multi-touch<00:06:08.890> screen

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
problem it's actually multi-touch screen

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.880 
problem it's actually multi-touch screen
that<00:06:09.790> when<00:06:09.940> two<00:06:10.120> blobs<00:06:10.390> are<00:06:11.320> too<00:06:11.530> close<00:06:11.740> to
