00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.149 
piece so it snaps closed it holds the
paper<00:02:02.579> into<00:02:02.909> place<00:02:03.240> really<00:02:03.659> well<00:02:03.890> this<00:02:04.890> can

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
paper into place really well this can

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.190 
paper into place really well this can
get<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> little<00:02:05.460> tricky<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.270> what<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.990> is

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
get a little tricky this is what this is

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.779 
get a little tricky this is what this is
what<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.380> do

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
what I do

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.309 
what I do
place<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.000> paper<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.810> straightedge

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
place the paper in the straightedge

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.990 
place the paper in the straightedge
along<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:11.129> edge

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
along this edge

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.640 
along this edge
and<00:02:12.090> then<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.430> fit<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:15.420> cartridge<00:02:16.080> holder<00:02:16.410> into

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
and then I fit the cartridge holder into

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.010 
and then I fit the cartridge holder into
this<00:02:17.540> last<00:02:18.540> set<00:02:19.200> here<00:02:20.210> so<00:02:21.210> fit<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.540> paper<00:02:21.750> in

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
this last set here so fit the paper in

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.000 
this last set here so fit the paper in
and<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.070> make<00:02:23.250> sure<00:02:23.460> that<00:02:23.810> it's<00:02:24.810> straight<00:02:25.410> along

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
and I make sure that it's straight along

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.530 
and I make sure that it's straight along
this<00:02:26.340> line<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.230> flush<00:02:28.230> against<00:02:28.740> this<00:02:28.890> line

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
this line and flush against this line

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.960 
this line and flush against this line
put<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.780> down<00:02:31.020> so<00:02:31.800> see<00:02:32.130> it's<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.370> nice<00:02:32.550> flush

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
put that down so see it's a nice flush

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.540 
put that down so see it's a nice flush
90<00:02:33.360> degree<00:02:33.690> angle<00:02:33.960> and<00:02:34.650> then<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:35.010> just<00:02:35.220> start

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
90 degree angle and then I just start

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.760 
90 degree angle and then I just start
punching<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:37.440> what<00:02:37.860> you're<00:02:38.070> going<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.220> do<00:02:38.430> is

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
punching and what you're going to do is

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.520 
punching and what you're going to do is
you<00:02:40.770> slide<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:41.730> until<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.510> fits<00:02:42.780> into<00:02:43.200> place

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
you slide this until it fits into place

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:52.340 
you slide this until it fits into place
in<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.430> next<00:02:44.760> set<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.030> divots<00:02:51.080> till<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.200> get

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
in the next set of divots till you get

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.140 
in the next set of divots till you get
to<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.680> end<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:55.550> voila<00:02:57.050> you<00:02:58.050> have<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.260> nice

to the end and voila you have a nice

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.199 
to the end and voila you have a nice
seamless<00:03:00.150> edge<00:03:01.340> so<00:03:02.340> pretty<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:02.730> love<00:03:03.060> this

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
seamless edge so pretty I love this

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.730 
seamless edge so pretty I love this
border<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.650> can<00:03:04.830> do<00:03:05.630> number<00:03:06.630> of<00:03:07.200> borders

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
border and you can do number of borders
