00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.109
 People are going to come in with the butter. 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.570

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.570
 if you put me looks pretty 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.000
 It was the best chocolate bomb 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.219

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.230

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.800
 will melt and separate the clear 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.920
 gems of six games started them started 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.489
 with this tool I noel cake 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.379
 wrong separated us talk like look 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.610
 everything always seems to have gone the way 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.859
 it should have 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.960
 I was researching what respect I 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.239
 I was going to do to pay homage to this cake. 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.240
 chocolate are incredibly excruciating 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.060
 there in my searches on the internet this 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.180
 vast place I discovered that the guy who 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.670
 wrote the matilda book inscribed 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.850
 also a book combining all the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.740
 recipes from all his books 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.020
 solved the problem basically because 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.670
 This is the recipe that the guy said that 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.290
 brusque mine that can not stay very long 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.360
 better than that in my 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.000
 little my end of alan wedge 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.119
 Now, only we have to do is 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.090
 He was given a little hit and then those eggs 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.450
 We'll join you later with 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.630
 chocolate and put the sugar and flour 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.460
 and beat the egg whites with a goal without 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.549
 wounds 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.380
 so we'll put it pretty clear 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.930
 in snow on him that will be what will give 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.280
 structure for the cake is well on the team and 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.280
 Just the same in the movie. 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.250
 remembering that the quantities were correct and 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.110
 complete list the ingredients are 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.000

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.060
 now I'll put the flour can 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:16.680
 only four tablespoons of flour 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.680
 or 1/4 cup 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.640
 I have to be 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.010
 good our clear in snow has already hit and 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.920
 now what we will do is put 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.350
 half of it in the mix we already 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.530
 here's a chocolate mix 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.090
 usually after the other half 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.090
 putting enough air in 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:53.459
 without fear because we want only 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:55.290

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.180

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.290
 minutes 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.019
 It will come out looking like it is not 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.959
 ready but do not get scared because it will 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:26.610
