any pressure on the surface because this

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.280

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
to cause a scratch it look just like

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.920 
to cause a scratch it look just like
sitting<00:01:29.759> right<00:01:29.880> there<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.420> already<00:01:30.630> begin

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
sitting right there it's already begin

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.810 
sitting right there it's already begin
to<00:01:30.960> blend<00:01:31.409> right<00:01:32.070> into<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.460> paint

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
to blend right into the paint

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.880 
to blend right into the paint
now<00:01:33.060> hybrid<00:01:33.420> v7<00:01:33.600> actually<00:01:34.229> uses<00:01:34.560> something

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
now hybrid v7 actually uses something

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.670 
now hybrid v7 actually uses something
called<00:01:35.310> transparent<00:01:36.150> blend<00:01:36.420> technology<00:01:36.720> what

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
called transparent blend technology what

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.920 
called transparent blend technology what
that<00:01:37.829> does<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.670> blends<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.390> amazing

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
that does is that blends the amazing

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.280 
that does is that blends the amazing
sealant<00:01:40.500> inside<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:42.090> product<00:01:42.659> into<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
sealant inside of the product into the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.469 
sealant inside of the product into the
paintwork<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.009> actually<00:01:44.130> fades<00:01:44.700> right

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
paintwork so it actually fades right

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.089 
Chrome so why a lot of people actually
find<00:04:18.299> their<00:04:18.539> chrome<00:04:19.019> wheels<00:04:19.320> are<00:04:19.590> not<00:04:19.739> easily

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.409 
cleaned after a little while actually
difficult<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:23.070> maintain<00:04:23.669> so<00:04:24.210> I'm<00:04:24.300> actually

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
difficult to maintain so I'm actually

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.570
