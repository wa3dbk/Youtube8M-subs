00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
since I do hunger games on my channel I

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.550 
since I do hunger games on my channel I
might<00:00:06.000> as<00:00:06.089> well<00:00:06.150> do<00:00:06.390> with<00:00:06.540> top<00:00:06.750> three<00:00:07.109> hunger

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
might as well do with top three hunger

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.690 
might as well do with top three hunger
games<00:00:07.830> for<00:00:08.730> minecraft<00:00:09.210> 1.5.2<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:10.700> probably

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
games for minecraft 1.5.2 and probably

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.470 
games for minecraft 1.5.2 and probably
through<00:00:11.969> 1.6<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.080> beyond<00:00:13.910> but<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.210> reason

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
through 1.6 and beyond but the reason

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.790 
through 1.6 and beyond but the reason
I'm<00:00:15.599> doing<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.020> because<00:00:16.170> I've<00:00:16.590> seen<00:00:16.740> a

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
I'm doing this is because I've seen a

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.680 
I'm doing this is because I've seen a
lot<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.010> top<00:00:17.250> threes<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.789> not<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.330> be<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> dick

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
lot of top threes and not to be a dick

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.240 
lot of top threes and not to be a dick
but<00:00:18.930> they're<00:00:19.109> just<00:00:19.260> totally<00:00:19.650> wrong<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:19.890> I'm

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
but they're just totally wrong and I'm

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.710 
but they're just totally wrong and I'm
not<00:00:20.279> saying<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.820> know<00:00:20.880> everything<00:00:20.970> about

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
not saying I know everything about

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.689 
not saying I know everything about
Hunger<00:00:22.380> Game<00:00:22.529> Servers<00:00:23.010> but<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.220> feel<00:00:23.519> like

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
Hunger Game Servers but I feel like

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.120 
Hunger Game Servers but I feel like
because<00:00:24.689> my<00:00:24.810> channel<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.230> based<00:00:25.470> off<00:00:25.710> Hunger

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
because my channel is based off Hunger

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.710 
because my channel is based off Hunger
Games<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.519> know<00:00:26.609> I've<00:00:26.760> been<00:00:26.939> through<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.269> lot

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
Games you know I've been through a lot

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.150 
Games you know I've been through a lot
of<00:00:27.779> Hunger<00:00:28.109> Games<00:00:28.289> servers<00:00:28.650> trying<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.980> find

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
of Hunger Games servers trying to find

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.220 
of Hunger Games servers trying to find
the<00:00:29.250> best<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.670> these<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.990> what<00:00:31.140> I've

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the best and these this is what I've

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.799 
the best and these this is what I've
come<00:00:31.439> up<00:00:31.619> with<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.550> coming<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.450> at<00:00:33.570> number

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
come up with so coming in at number

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.840 
come up with so coming in at number
three<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.469> not<00:00:34.620> even<00:00:34.829> close<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.340> two<00:00:35.670> or

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
three and it's not even close to two or

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.180 
three and it's not even close to two or
one<00:00:36.030> but<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:37.260> would<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.649> be<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.920> uber

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
one but it would have to be the uber

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.549 
one but it would have to be the uber
craft<00:00:38.460> servers<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.780> reason<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.140> say<00:00:40.320> this

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
craft servers and the reason I say this

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.729 
craft servers and the reason I say this
is<00:00:40.770> because<00:00:41.390> uber<00:00:42.390> craft<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.410> so

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
is because uber craft it's so it's so

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.889 
is because uber craft it's so it's so
big<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.280> game<00:00:44.489> size<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.940> gonna<00:00:45.090> be<00:00:45.270> 200<00:00:45.719> people

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
big the game size is gonna be 200 people

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.350 
big the game size is gonna be 200 people
you<00:00:46.649> know<00:00:46.800> or<00:00:47.070> not<00:00:47.190> not<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> game<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
you know or not not in the game but the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.690 
you know or not not in the game but the

are playing on it and it just makes the
gameplay<00:01:00.899> kind<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.410> crappy<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.039> there's<00:01:02.670> no

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
crafting involved and it's just kind of

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.320 
crafting involved and it's just kind of
all<00:01:05.070> over<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.309> place<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:05.820> also<00:01:05.970> super

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
all over the place and it's also super

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.560 
all over the place and it's also super
laggy<00:01:06.750> but<00:01:07.710> if<00:01:08.040> one<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.549> two<00:01:08.729> are<00:01:08.880> down<00:01:09.119> then<00:01:09.479> I

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
laggy but if one and two are down then I

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.359 
laggy but if one and two are down then I
would<00:01:09.750> come<00:01:09.990> play<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.350> one<00:01:10.590> now<00:01:10.860> coming<00:01:11.280> in

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
would come play this one now coming in

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.719 
would come play this one now coming in
at<00:01:11.460> number<00:01:11.549> two<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.090> his<00:01:12.780> head<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.470> heels

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
at number two and his head and heels

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.320 
at number two and his head and heels
way<00:01:15.210> better<00:01:15.450> than<00:01:15.810> minecraft<00:01:16.380> HG<00:01:17.210> which<00:01:18.210> is

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
way better than minecraft HG which is

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.460 
way better than minecraft HG which is
the<00:01:18.450> server<00:01:18.689> IP<00:01:18.900> which<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:20.180> uber<00:01:21.180> craft<00:01:21.470> would

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the server IP which is uber craft would

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.740 
the server IP which is uber craft would
be<00:01:22.710> Beijing<00:01:23.369> Canadiens<00:01:23.790> new<00:01:24.000> fridge<00:01:24.299> servers

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
be Beijing Canadiens new fridge servers

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.630 
be Beijing Canadiens new fridge servers
now<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.020> fridge<00:01:25.439> servers<00:01:25.890> were<00:01:26.070> modeled<00:01:26.460> off

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
now the fridge servers were modeled off

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.359 
now the fridge servers were modeled off
what<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> think<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.020> number<00:01:28.290> one<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.950> I'm<00:01:29.189> sure

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
what I think is number one and I'm sure

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.620 
what I think is number one and I'm sure
a<00:01:29.400> lot<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.610> people<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:29.970> my<00:01:30.030> channel<00:01:30.329> know<00:01:30.479> what

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
a lot of people on my channel know what

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.819 
a lot of people on my channel know what
number<00:01:31.020> one<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:32.960> III<00:01:33.960> think<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.590> fridge

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
number one is but III think the fridge

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.210 
number one is but III think the fridge
servers<00:01:35.250> are<00:01:35.430> pretty<00:01:35.729> cool<00:01:36.170> it<00:01:37.170> there<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:38.070> adds

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
servers are pretty cool it there it adds

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.640 
servers are pretty cool it there it adds
a<00:01:38.430> whole<00:01:38.640> different<00:01:39.119> aspect<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.750> because

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
a whole different aspect to it because

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.350 
a whole different aspect to it because
instead<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.220> finding<00:01:41.640> an<00:01:41.729> iron<00:01:41.939> sword<00:01:42.119> like

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360

you're looking to play some new map

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.540 
you're looking to play some new map
I<00:02:12.780> would<00:02:13.470> definitely<00:02:14.010> go<00:02:14.160> in<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.370> fridge

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
I would definitely go in the fridge

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.340 
I would definitely go in the fridge
servers<00:02:14.970> getting<00:02:15.300> into<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.570> game<00:02:15.840> might<00:02:16.110> be<00:02:16.260> an

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
servers getting into a game might be an

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.850 
servers getting into a game might be an
issue<00:02:16.500> but<00:02:17.250> because<00:02:17.880> they're<00:02:18.090> early<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:19.350> there

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
issue but because they're early in there

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.380 
issue but because they're early in there
I<00:02:20.130> guess

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
I guess

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.660 
I guess
being<00:02:21.930> around<00:02:22.290> as<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> server<00:02:22.980> then<00:02:23.640> you

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
being around as a server then you

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.280 
being around as a server then you
shouldn't<00:02:24.210> have<00:02:24.420> too<00:02:24.690> much<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.930> an<00:02:25.170> issue

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
shouldn't have too much of an issue

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.930 
shouldn't have too much of an issue
considering<00:02:25.800> they<00:02:26.100> have<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.250> lot<00:02:26.460> of<00:02:26.490> servers

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
considering they have a lot of servers

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.230 
considering they have a lot of servers
now<00:02:27.870> coming<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.350> at<00:02:28.440> number<00:02:28.530> one<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:29.240> it's

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
now coming in at number one and it's

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.640 
now coming in at number one and it's
very<00:02:30.510> similar<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.140> fridge<00:02:31.350> in<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.500> lot<00:02:31.620> of

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
very similar to the fridge in a lot of

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.800 
very similar to the fridge in a lot of
ways<00:02:31.830> would<00:02:32.010> be<00:02:32.070> mcsg<00:02:32.700> servers<00:02:33.300> also<00:02:33.510> known<00:02:33.720> as

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
ways would be mcsg servers also known as

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.930 
ways would be mcsg servers also known as
minecraft<00:02:34.260> survival<00:02:34.710> games<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.610> these<00:02:35.790> I

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
minecraft survival games and these I

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.540 
minecraft survival games and these I
play<00:02:36.450> both<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.810> fridge<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.320> mcsg<00:02:37.800> on<00:02:38.250> my

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
play both the fridge and mcsg on my

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.780 
play both the fridge and mcsg on my
channel<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.720> just<00:02:39.930> think<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.380> mcsg<00:02:41.130> is<00:02:41.460> by

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
channel and I just think that mcsg is by

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.430 
channel and I just think that mcsg is by
far<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.060> best<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.630> mean<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.960> fridge<00:02:43.170> comes

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
far the best I mean the fridge comes

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.210 
far the best I mean the fridge comes
close<00:02:43.770> but<00:02:45.440> it's<00:02:46.440> definitely<00:02:46.920> gonna<00:02:47.040> be

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
close but it's definitely gonna be

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.980 
close but it's definitely gonna be
better<00:02:47.400> than<00:02:47.730> any<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.120> those<00:02:48.420> hunger<00:02:48.780> games

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
better than any of those hunger games

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.780 
better than any of those hunger games
that<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.230> find<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.590> mini<00:02:49.830> games<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.250> lot<00:02:50.370> mini

that you find in mini games a lot mini
