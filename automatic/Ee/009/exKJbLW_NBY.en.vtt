 hello everyone I am standard we are in 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.700
 flavored nutrition where we are going to 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:13.330
 Learn to eat healthy and delicious today 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.420
 let's talk about fiber fiber is 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.500
 a type of non-digestible carbohydrate and 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.180
 lignin eliminates the we can find in 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.699
 some plant compounds or plants 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.710
 this helps us feel full or 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.720
 feel full and improve our 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.759
 system or improve our function 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.120
 intestinal some of the best 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.610
 fiber sources are the legumes 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.450
 These include beans aza 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.820
 black white red lentils 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.310
 beans and peas 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.829
 other good sources of fiber are the 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.840
 fruits the vegetables the whole grains and 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.140
 the nuts you have to be very careful 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.329
 in fiber consumption because most of 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.210
 we consume a little less 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.519
 fiber of the recommended series 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.640
 we have breakfast that usually come 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:06.550
 towards high source of fiber then good if 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.040
 they have a lot of fiber however with 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.110
 that fiber we can not meet all 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.820
 the requirements that in the day 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.450
 We need as I had mentioned 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.130
 previously in addition to helping us 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.710
 feel full 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.350
 to feel satiety and improve our 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.050
 digestive system the fiber helps us 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.369
 also to reduce the risk of 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.620
 Obesity of diseases 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.750
 cardiovascular and diabetes 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.110
 the amount of fiber recommended by 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.080
 experts is roughly 25 grams at 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.180
 day for women and 38 grams a day for 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.460
 men although most of the 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.200
 general population more or less 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.630
 consumed an average of 15 grams 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.330
 Now that we know what the 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.590
 fiber recommendations per day 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.990
 you have to look well in the labels 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.270
 nutritional fiber grams that 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.220
 contains each food so that it can 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.710
 compare between foods and make a 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.950
 election that has high content of 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.870
 fiber last is not proven that 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.640
 the fiber added to the food you 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.950
 provide the same benefits as 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.899
 natural fiber good many thanks 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.880
