00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.540
 in order to make the chest we take 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:28.160
 a piece of synthetic padding thin this is the basis 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:31.770
 burying synthetic winterizer into small pieces 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.020
 Picked up pieces of padding polyester and invest in 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.960
 the basis of which we have prepared 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.230
 you can remember that we have breasts 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.110
 must be proportional to mine 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.540
 that is, we stuff with padding polyester so much 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.910
 how much would do it on the ass 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.090
 my ass is ready that is it 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.920
 will be the sample what size will be needed 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:00.350
 strive to insert sintepon 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.350
 golf put reconciled 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:26.340
 Although the girl is destined to delay with 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.340
 the other side 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.920
 and 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:43.440
 excess pantyhose and regula well now 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.979
 proceed directly to 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.680
 formation in order to give 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.260
 more rounded i and align 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.490
 a little bit 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:02:02.400
 I'm usually on the back side 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.930
 slightly when I collect if you succeed 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:11.880
 immaculately round 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:16.260
 in general, you can not do this just 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.930
 this thread can be pulled off more and you need 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.780
 be sure to share well and now 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.060
 directly doing the chest line for 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.940
 this I determine where I will be the top 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.709
 game is better for me 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.489
 part that is, she is such here 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:35.040
 semicircular looks more beautiful than here 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.470
 below this part will be closed 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.299
 cloth and so I will do the bottom and 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.580
 there will be a chest top 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.190
 the principle is the same as in puppy that is, we 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.650
 we will have to lay a thread but if 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.340
 mines we lay it like this u through 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:55.970
 the whole piece that we did something like 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.970
 we pierce through without reaching the top 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:09.690
 and pierce through and tighten well 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.190
 tighten and finger a little 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.520
 correcting it is clear that something already 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:20.280
 tightened the more interesting line turned out 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.870
 chest and fasten from the back 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.330
 a little bit correct needle if 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:31.330
 something not like everything billet leo 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:34.330
 breasts are ready to make bodice dresses 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.210
 you need to make a fabric blank 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.320
 as this will be above the bath 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:47.650
 above bath when going around the goal 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:49.840
 a billet measuring 20 centimeters by 8 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.990
 centimeters is already in finished form then 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.780
 there is cut out ostan of course more 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:59.200

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:02.170
 20 by 9 centimeters and the top edge i 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.480
 podgibayu I type on 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.580
 centered elements which will be 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.930
 to symbolize our embroidery 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:14.360
 as this embroidery we do the assembly by 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:19.380

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:25.250
 Now we make our little roses 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:29.479
 pin fitting pins place 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:35.010
 where we will have music 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:37.160

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.210
 heat gun make a droplet 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:01.320

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:05.220

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.860
 thermogun I'm fixing for now 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.930
 reliability, I still make pictures 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.270

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.550
 a blouse and q for this just with butterflies 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.240
 let's first adjust slightly 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.240
 what promise 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.819
 MUSIC and sticking where I

 for some reason already accustomed to cutting them off 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:42.900
 then when I attach 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.620
 so when we collect the lower edge of the music 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.050
 it is clear that the smaller the folds than 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.229
 smaller at assembly 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.509
 the more beautiful any wrinkles and collected 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:58.289
 folds 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:06:04.940
 distributed them secured down when 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:08.729
 collecting it after excess 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:12.180
