00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.240
 in the stats we must when we have to 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.490
 to fool a little but no matter 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.910
 not a positional constraint which 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.910
 is interesting 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.210
 no what was really interesting 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.490
 is that ancelotti actually had 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.380
 announced that a lot of things 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.420
 were heating it up and who 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.770
 that he was going to toughen the management he 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.300
 had said a first time it had not 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.560
 not followed immediately by the facts 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.950
 are proud that he has well and 17 points 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.410
 14 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.880
 that means he was he was in 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.390
 changing things 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.730
 he repeated it a second time and we 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.800
 saw the result is first port is 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.109
 evian it's valenciennes today it 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.269
 there are two more games to play 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:47.070
 lacan paris plays like that yes we are 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.570
 obliged to return to the impressions that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.159
 had in August to know that the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.920
 championship would depend on their good 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.300
 want if the front four if the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.010
 players on the field want to do 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.719
 all the efforts in the same direction as 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.579
 the collective starts up I said you 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.710
 will stop saying that ancelotti is 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.809
 maybe not good that pastore maybe 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.060
 not a good player that these than this 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.130
 we're not going to stop all that, we just had 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.510
 instead there is instead instead of stopping at 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.100
 to stop we are not obliged 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.690
 to stop because you advise us 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.640
 even if we listen carefully 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.310
 you just explained something and 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.260
 142 accounts you were telling us 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.060
 to say if the front four is working well 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.230
 it's been three matches that paris saint 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.690
 germain plays with four players 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.230
 offensive we can also think of 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.140
 progress of zlatan lead had said so and 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.030
 pastore which we can also think of 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.280
 progress of paris saint germain and 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.380
 progress of all including progress 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.850
 if V 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.740
 there are three sure there is a trick on 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.240
 ancelotti too and it can count 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.320
 now listen I repeat it often 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.450
 I totally agree and 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.290
 coach this theory a coach who can 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.360
 also have moments of our 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.950
 economy maybe is that anchorotti on 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.180
 three and four matches bah it was he 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.290
 lost the pedals he made the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.000
 coaching did not have to do but 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.720
 until then not found a little there 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.040
 the reason I'm going to tell you that the 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.430
 getting started is not the one you 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.320
 believe 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.290
 I think getting it back into her and 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.610
 she is internal know in the speech 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.900
 because as I have often said 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.390
 since the beginning of the season it has not been 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.150
 used to handle this kind of equipped the aea 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.450
 to be in the building 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.989
 so enormously 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.470
 on the contrary to listen to there is to the players 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.900
 in the locker room 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.790
 lara for me the most important is this 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.430
 which was done off land more than on 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.370
 the ground because the choices that have 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.360
 been made to know bomb of 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.709
 to formalize that the hinge was 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.599
 well the one we knew 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.430
 thiago silva alex and it's bullshit 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:39.010
 it's already a huge 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.519
 alex but it's thiago silva alex 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.950
 there is no hurt could we read it's 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.330
 a yes but in a group when you 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.540
 never seem the money it takes 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.680
 you said no, do not leave the same thing 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.340
 in a group like Paris 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.440
 Saint Germain you must have at least 3 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.390
 defenders obviously on the best 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.280
 defender of the world this is not going to the 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.980
 do not go do it but 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.750
 then when you have sakho and alex it's 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.090
 where one or the other they have to 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.549
 particular about sales but while 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.630
 that in the mind of a pilot you do 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.049
 play a fourth match in 12 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.780
 days 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.220
 while he had to play sakho is beautiful 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.569
 alexis got hurt what are you 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.459
 want me to tell you besides it will be 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.350
 normally not there when no against these 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.709
 contracts that eat a match against lyon 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.620
 this is against Lyon is more than likely 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.670
 against Lyon so I continue to 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.920
 think even if roland does not agree 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.620
 that strong choices have been made and that 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.970
 in addition to good there was the timely return 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.280
 of thiago motta who is a player 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.889
 absolutely essential in what he does 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.540
 in the middle of the field and after they 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:46.109
 be to three that they are executives 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.160
 before at 5 to 6 at 3 to 10 miles 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.600
 the important thing was that once 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.980
 for all the dudes understands he 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.680
 they had to play together 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.079
 there have been things even though for lens to 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.050
 may seem nothing at all but some 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.930
 had 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.820
 we were a little were punished there was 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.590
 handovers on some who 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.100
 had had a small pass 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.020
 trifles but everything has been tightened and 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.540
 the efforts and involvement of everyone 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.250
 is seen on the ground it shows in 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.590
 the right way guys have to get 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.910
 move they can be 10 or 5 or 4 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.650
 if there is no movement around 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.230
 carrier who will not know who gives the 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.940
 embarrassment we go there it's clear daniel and 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.050
 we see it in the game the quality she 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.050
 is there anyway we go to
