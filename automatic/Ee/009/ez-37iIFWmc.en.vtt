00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.800 

you<00:01:10.130> can<00:01:10.340> also<00:01:10.610> go<00:01:10.820> ahead<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.300> just<00:01:11.420> take<00:01:11.600> a

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
you can also go ahead and just take a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.900 
you can also go ahead and just take a
nothing<00:01:12.290> color<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:12.830> something<00:01:13.370> very<00:01:13.610> similar

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
nothing color so something very similar

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.180 
nothing color so something very similar
to<00:01:13.970> your<00:01:14.120> skin<00:01:14.360> tone<00:01:14.600> or<00:01:14.900> even<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.620> translucent

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.130 
to your skin tone or even a translucent
powder<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:16.729> then<00:01:17.090> just<00:01:17.390> take<00:01:17.540> this<00:01:17.720> over<00:01:17.960> the

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
powder and then just take this over the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.109 
powder and then just take this over the
edges<00:01:18.410> as<00:01:18.590> well<00:01:18.830> because<00:01:19.729> then<00:01:19.910> you're<00:01:20.030> gonna

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
edges as well because then you're gonna

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.359 
edges as well because then you're gonna
have<00:01:20.360> a<00:01:20.570> really<00:01:20.780> seamless<00:01:21.110> look<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:21.800> so<00:01:22.220> what

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
have a really seamless look and so what

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.530 
have a really seamless look and so what
if<00:01:22.430> you<00:01:22.490> have<00:01:22.610> actually<00:01:22.880> said<00:01:23.060> you<00:01:23.180> started

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
if you have actually said you started

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.900 
if you have actually said you started
using<00:01:23.660> this<00:01:23.869> technique<00:01:24.290> and<00:01:24.530> it<00:01:24.920> really<00:01:25.460> helps

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
using this technique and it really helps

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.190 
using this technique and it really helps
so<00:01:26.210> that's<00:01:26.780> cool

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
so that's cool

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.020 
so that's cool
now<00:01:27.650> you<00:01:27.710> could<00:01:27.979> stop<00:01:28.220> here<00:01:28.250> if<00:01:28.640> you're<00:01:28.790> happy

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
now you could stop here if you're happy

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.880 
now you could stop here if you're happy
with<00:01:29.060> this<00:01:29.300> level<00:01:29.570> of<00:01:29.720> depth<00:01:29.990> but<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.530> decided

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
with this level of depth but I decided

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.590 
with this level of depth but I decided
to<00:01:31.070> do<00:01:31.160> just<00:01:31.400> tap<00:01:31.610> my<00:01:31.760> blending<00:01:32.090> brush<00:01:32.119> in<00:01:32.479> the

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
to do just tap my blending brush in the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.570 
to do just tap my blending brush in the
shade<00:01:32.810> mousse<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:33.440> just<00:01:33.950> add<00:01:34.160> this<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.369> the

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
shade mousse and just add this to the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.249 
shade mousse and just add this to the
outer<00:01:34.700> V<00:01:34.880> as<00:01:35.000> well<00:01:37.270> then<00:01:38.270> go<00:01:38.450> ahead<00:01:38.479> and<00:01:38.750> apply

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
outer V as well then go ahead and apply

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.080 
outer V as well then go ahead and apply
an<00:01:39.560> inner<00:01:39.770> corner<00:01:40.040> highlight<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:40.759> you<00:01:40.850> have

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
an inner corner highlight so you have

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.940 
an inner corner highlight so you have
that<00:01:41.210> nice<00:01:41.390> transition<00:01:41.960> from<00:01:41.990> light<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.740> dark

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
that nice transition from light to dark

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.609

the makeup on there which kinda sounds

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.650 
the makeup on there which kinda sounds
like<00:03:56.930> a<00:03:56.960> no-brainer<00:03:57.230> but<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.940> playing<00:03:59.300> primer

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.570 
like a no-brainer but the playing primer
under<00:03:59.990> there<00:04:00.140> is<00:04:00.290> just<00:04:00.500> not<00:04:00.740> something<00:04:01.070> I've

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
under there is just not something I've

under there is just not something I've
ever<00:04:01.910> thought<00:04:02.150> of<00:04:02.330> doing<00:04:02.480> for<00:04:02.990> some<00:04:03.170> reason<00:04:03.590> so

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
ever thought of doing for some reason so

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.630 
ever thought of doing for some reason so
yeah<00:04:04.820> it<00:04:05.090> really<00:04:05.600> does<00:04:05.750> make<00:04:05.900> a<00:04:05.930> difference

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640

liner I apply in the waterline in a

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.330 
liner I apply in the waterline in a
second<00:04:14.420> to<00:04:14.840> make<00:04:14.930> my<00:04:15.080> eyes<00:04:15.290> look<00:04:15.500> more<00:04:16.160> open

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
second to make my eyes look more open

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.580 
second to make my eyes look more open
and<00:04:16.820> awake<00:04:17.060> and<00:04:17.330> here<00:04:17.930> I'm<00:04:18.200> just<00:04:18.230> doing

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
and awake and here I'm just doing

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.380 
and awake and here I'm just doing
exactly<00:04:18.680> there<00:04:19.220> I'm<00:04:19.460> using<00:04:19.670> the<00:04:20.000> NYX<00:04:20.210> jumbo

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
exactly there I'm using the NYX jumbo

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.020 
exactly there I'm using the NYX jumbo
pencil<00:04:20.630> in<00:04:21.049> milk<00:04:21.230> and<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:22.280> Watts<00:04:22.490> Lane<00:04:22.730> brush

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
pencil in milk and the Watts Lane brush

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.900 
pencil in milk and the Watts Lane brush
so<00:04:23.420> it's<00:04:23.720> not<00:04:23.900> quite<00:04:24.710> an<00:04:24.830> intense<00:04:25.190> application

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
so it's not quite an intense application

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.480 
so it's not quite an intense application
it<00:04:26.060> looks<00:04:26.300> quite<00:04:26.540> natural<00:04:26.720> still

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.010 

finish<00:04:30.490> off<00:04:30.640> the<00:04:30.670> eyes<00:04:30.880> with<00:04:31.390> some<00:04:31.630> mascara

finish off the eyes with some mascara

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.290 
finish off the eyes with some mascara
and<00:04:32.410> then<00:04:32.830> we<00:04:32.950> can<00:04:33.100> move<00:04:33.190> on<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.580> lips<00:04:36.300> the

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
and then we can move on to the lips the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.450 
and then we can move on to the lips the
lipstick<00:04:37.750> is<00:04:37.960> kind<00:04:38.260> of<00:04:38.320> sexy<00:04:38.560> by<00:04:38.860> Mac<00:04:39.100> which

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.580 
lipstick is kind of sexy by Mac which
doesn't<00:04:39.910> usually<00:04:40.060> look<00:04:40.420> this<00:04:40.570> peachy<00:04:41.050> but<00:04:41.320> it

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
doesn't usually look this peachy but it

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.780 
doesn't usually look this peachy but it
does<00:04:41.800> might<00:04:41.980> spread<00:04:42.250> with<00:04:42.460> this<00:04:42.610> eyeshadow

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
does might spread with this eyeshadow

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.270 
does might spread with this eyeshadow
they<00:04:43.660> complement<00:04:44.170> each<00:04:44.230> other<00:04:44.560> just<00:04:44.920> so

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
they complement each other just so

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.030 
they complement each other just so
nicely<00:04:45.820> this<00:04:46.510> is<00:04:46.660> a<00:04:46.690> matte<00:04:46.960> shade<00:04:47.290> but<00:04:47.950> it

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
nicely this is a matte shade but it

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.620 
nicely this is a matte shade but it
would<00:04:48.190> also<00:04:48.400> look<00:04:48.640> really<00:04:48.820> good<00:04:49.240> with<00:04:49.570> a
