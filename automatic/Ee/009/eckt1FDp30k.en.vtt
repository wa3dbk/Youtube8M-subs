your<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.980> brain<00:00:47.309> waves<00:00:47.579> let<00:00:47.940> me<00:00:48.000> speak<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:52.260> here

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
your a brain waves let me speak and here

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.680 
your a brain waves let me speak and here
we<00:00:52.500> go

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.110 

I'm<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:56.149> run<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.329> calibration<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:59.120> my

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
I'm going to run the calibration and my

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.490 
I'm going to run the calibration and my
goal<00:01:00.360> here<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.960> focus<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.820> gyroscope

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
goal here is to focus on the gyroscope

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.469 
goal here is to focus on the gyroscope
and<00:01:04.500> keep<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.309> yellow<00:01:05.670> bar<00:01:05.940> beneath<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
and keep the yellow bar beneath the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.350 
and keep the yellow bar beneath the
green<00:01:06.720> dotted<00:01:07.320> line<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.040> here<00:01:08.970> i<00:01:09.000> am<00:01:09.090> is

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
green dotted line and here i am is

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.139 
green dotted line and here i am is
successful<00:01:09.900> which<00:01:10.500> means<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.000> it<00:01:12.000> will

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
successful which means that it will

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.859 
successful which means that it will
accurately<00:01:12.450> pick<00:01:12.930> up<00:01:13.110> my<00:01:13.290> brain<00:01:13.860> waves<00:01:14.869> so

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
accurately pick up my brain waves so

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.280 
accurately pick up my brain waves so
let's<00:01:16.200> go<00:01:16.440> practice<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.490> show<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:19.200> item

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
let's go practice and show you the item

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.590 
let's go practice and show you the item
in<00:01:19.530> action<00:01:21.229> with<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.259> game<00:01:22.470> upon<00:01:23.270> ok<00:01:24.270> let's

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600

play it on easy and ok I missed that one

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:41.800 
play it on easy and ok I missed that one
let<00:01:31.500> me<00:01:31.819> get<00:01:32.819> to<00:01:32.850> my<00:01:34.220> NY<00:01:35.220> state
