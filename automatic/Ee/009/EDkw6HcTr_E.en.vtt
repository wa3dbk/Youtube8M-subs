00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.930 
the meantime we'll get our snapper ready
since<00:02:07.510> we're<00:02:07.690> steaming<00:02:08.140> up<00:02:08.369> simply<00:02:09.369> run<00:02:09.670> your

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
since we're steaming up simply run your

since we're steaming up simply run your
knife<00:02:10.119> just<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.260> make<00:02:11.470> sure<00:02:11.500> scales<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:13.270> don't

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
knife just to make sure scales you don't

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.950 
knife just to make sure scales you don't
want<00:02:13.600> any<00:02:13.750> leftover<00:02:14.260> score<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.490> fish<00:02:15.960> right

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
want any leftover score the fish right

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.560 
want any leftover score the fish right
behind<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.740> head<00:02:17.950> all<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.850> way<00:02:18.880> down<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.420> the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
behind the head all the way down to the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.780 
behind the head all the way down to the
bottom<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.080> this<00:02:20.709> will<00:02:20.920> enable<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.400> steam<00:02:21.610> to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
bottom and this will enable the steam to

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.620 
bottom and this will enable the steam to
really<00:02:22.060> penetrate<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.750> fish<00:02:23.050> so<00:02:23.860> all<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.370> way

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
really penetrate the fish so all the way

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.380 
really penetrate the fish so all the way
this<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:25.780> about<00:02:26.020> 800<00:02:26.560> grams<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:28.090> we'll<00:02:28.240> just

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
this is about 800 grams so we'll just

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.280 
this is about 800 grams so we'll just
come<00:02:28.870> back<00:02:29.490> along<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.760> snapper<00:02:31.150> we<00:02:31.959> call<00:02:32.140> this

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290

a<00:02:32.350> pineapple<00:02:32.739> skull<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.610> then<00:02:34.450> we'll<00:02:34.660> just

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
a pineapple skull and then we'll just

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.170 
a pineapple skull and then we'll just
repeat<00:02:35.170> on<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.440> other<00:02:35.470> side<00:02:35.890> as<00:02:36.130> well<00:02:36.180> it's

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180
