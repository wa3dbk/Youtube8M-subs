00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.050 

so<00:03:54.500> let's<00:03:54.650> go<00:03:54.739> ahead<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:54.890> look<00:03:55.010> at<00:03:55.099> the<00:03:55.189> engine

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:06.080 

quiet<00:03:58.900> very<00:03:59.230> quiet

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.180 

and<00:04:06.330> you<00:04:06.510> can't<00:04:06.720> even<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:07.230> get<00:04:08.010> some

and you can't even I get some
interference<00:04:08.610> with<00:04:09.000> this<00:04:09.180> camera<00:04:09.560> but<00:04:10.560> other

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
interference with this camera but other

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.580 
interference with this camera but other
than<00:04:10.830> that<00:04:11.010> it's<00:04:11.519> absolutely<00:04:12.590> perfectly

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
than that it's absolutely perfectly

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.800 
than that it's absolutely perfectly
quiet<00:04:14.870> life<00:04:15.870> is<00:04:16.109> smooth

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
no valve boys or anything it runs just

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.300 
no valve boys or anything it runs just
like<00:04:21.090> it<00:04:21.299> should<00:04:21.650> it's<00:04:22.650> got<00:04:22.830> a<00:04:22.860> really<00:04:23.070> nice

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
like it should it's got a really nice

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.140 
like it should it's got a really nice
gold<00:04:23.790> diehard<00:04:24.540> battery<00:04:24.990> in<00:04:25.139> it<00:04:26.150> and

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
gold diehard battery in it and

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.159 
gold diehard battery in it and
everything<00:04:27.630> is<00:04:28.020> just<00:04:28.080> very<00:04:28.530> clean

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.300 

you<00:04:32.860> look<00:04:33.009> at<00:04:33.099> the<00:04:33.159> trunk<00:04:34.770> it's<00:04:35.770> got<00:04:35.949> a<00:04:35.979> mat

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
you look at the trunk it's got a mat

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.790 
you look at the trunk it's got a mat
actually<00:04:37.090> a<00:04:37.360> factory<00:04:37.930> mat<00:04:38.169> in<00:04:38.409> the<00:04:38.499> trunk

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
actually a factory mat in the trunk

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.730 
actually a factory mat in the trunk
first<00:04:39.249> one<00:04:39.460> of<00:04:39.550> those<00:04:39.669> I've<00:04:39.879> seen<00:04:40.740> usually

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
first one of those I've seen usually

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.029 
first one of those I've seen usually
don't<00:04:41.919> get<00:04:42.099> those<00:04:42.870> but<00:04:43.870> somebody<00:04:44.259> wanted

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
don't get those but somebody wanted

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.980 
don't get those but somebody wanted
their<00:04:45.159> trunk<00:04:45.550> to<00:04:45.669> be<00:04:45.789> really<00:04:46.029> clean

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.790 

so<00:04:49.500> there<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:49.680> can<00:04:49.920> see<00:04:49.950> the

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
so there you can see the

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.180 
so there you can see the
camry<00:04:52.639> factory<00:04:53.330> mat<00:04:53.539> and<00:04:53.919> then<00:04:54.919> underneath

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
camry factory mat and then underneath

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.360 
camry factory mat and then underneath
it's<00:04:56.030> just<00:04:56.240> like<00:04:56.300> brand<00:04:56.629> new<00:04:56.780> and<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:58.009> mat<00:04:58.190> is

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
it's just like brand new and the mat is

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.950 
it's just like brand new and the mat is
too<00:04:58.610> so<00:04:58.879> i<00:04:58.909> don't<00:04:59.120> think<00:04:59.300> they<00:04:59.360> really<00:04:59.509> used<00:04:59.810> it

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
too so i don't think they really used it

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.460 
too so i don't think they really used it
for<00:05:00.139> much<00:05:00.289> and<00:05:00.770> it's<00:05:00.919> got<00:05:01.069> the<00:05:01.190> cargo<00:05:01.580> net<00:05:01.610> and

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
for much and it's got the cargo net and

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:08.080 
for much and it's got the cargo net and
that<00:05:03.470> is<00:05:03.650> also<00:05:04.000> toyota<00:05:05.000> product<00:05:07.090> so

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
that is also toyota product so

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.920 
that is also toyota product so
everything's<00:05:08.419> factory<00:05:10.930> everything's

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
everything's factory everything's

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.360 
everything's factory everything's
factory<00:05:12.409> and<00:05:12.560> it's<00:05:12.710> in<00:05:12.860> beautiful<00:05:13.009> condition

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
factory and it's in beautiful condition

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.290 
factory and it's in beautiful condition
I<00:05:14.710> can't<00:05:15.710> really<00:05:15.919> think<00:05:16.069> of<00:05:16.190> anything<00:05:16.400> else<00:05:16.669> to

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
I can't really think of anything else to

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.350 
I can't really think of anything else to
tell<00:05:17.750> you<00:05:17.930> about<00:05:18.020> it<00:05:18.729> except<00:05:19.729> come<00:05:19.940> and<00:05:20.090> see<00:05:20.240> it

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
tell you about it except come and see it

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.220 
tell you about it except come and see it
drive<00:05:20.930> it<00:05:20.960> and<00:05:21.440> I<00:05:21.560> think<00:05:21.800> you'll<00:05:21.949> like<00:05:22.159> it
