quarter<00:00:16.890> at<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.039> last<00:00:17.250> mile<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.150> don't<00:00:18.539> know

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
quarter at the last mile so I don't know

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.300 
quarter at the last mile so I don't know
what<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.869> time<00:00:19.080> was<00:00:19.109> for<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.619> but<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.920> ran<00:00:20.130> as

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
what the time was for that but I ran as

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.250 
what the time was for that but I ran as
hard<00:00:20.550> as<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.789> could<00:00:20.850> did<00:00:21.359> what<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.600> what<00:00:21.960> my<00:00:22.080> coach

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
hard as I could did what I what my coach

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.840 
hard as I could did what I what my coach
told<00:00:22.470> me<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:22.920> we<00:00:23.010> decided<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.490> do<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.789> think

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
told me to what we decided to do I think

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.700 
told me to what we decided to do I think
that<00:00:24.150> was<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.449> right<00:00:24.960> move<00:00:24.990> because<00:00:25.380> when

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
that was the right move because when

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.080 
that was the right move because when
something<00:00:26.099> spot<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.519> all<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.699> other<00:00:26.939> girls

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
something spot and all the other girls

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.670 
something spot and all the other girls
in<00:00:27.330> there<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.660> feel<00:00:27.869> like<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.230> really<00:00:28.500> had<00:00:28.650> to

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
in there I feel like I really had to

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.589 
in there I feel like I really had to
kick<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:28.980> into<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.250> world<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:30.000> then<00:00:30.300> just<00:00:30.480> try

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
kick it into the world and then just try

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.540 
kick it into the world and then just try
to<00:00:30.660> hold<00:00:30.900> on<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.439> I've<00:00:31.769> never<00:00:31.920> done<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.219> kind

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
to hold on and I've never done that kind

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.580 
to hold on and I've never done that kind
of<00:00:32.610> race<00:00:32.730> tactic<00:00:33.120> before<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.870> think<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.380> kind

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
of race tactic before so I think it kind

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.290 
of race tactic before so I think it kind
of<00:00:34.620> wore<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:34.980> me<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.579> wasn't<00:00:36.000> quite<00:00:36.120> ready

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
of wore on me and I wasn't quite ready

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.030 
of wore on me and I wasn't quite ready
for<00:00:36.450> for<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.140> know<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.410> fast<00:00:37.620> pace<00:00:37.890> so

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
for for that you know that fast pace so

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.340 
for for that you know that fast pace so
I<00:00:38.100> tried<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> recover<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.480> backstretch<00:00:40.050> on

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.440 
then I I knew that it was going to be
something<00:01:27.980> really<00:01:28.250> hard<00:01:28.550> that<00:01:28.760> I<00:01:28.880> kind<00:01:29.390> of

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
something really hard that I kind of

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.480 
something really hard that I kind of
doubted<00:01:29.630> myself<00:01:29.870> a<00:01:30.200> little<00:01:30.410> bit<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:30.740> I<00:01:30.860> think

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
doubted myself a little bit and I think

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.070 
doubted myself a little bit and I think
that's<00:01:31.610> why<00:01:31.730> I<00:01:31.760> recommend<00:01:31.940> my<00:01:32.690> coach<00:01:32.840> is<00:01:32.990> like

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
that's why I recommend my coach is like

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.510 
that's why I recommend my coach is like
you<00:01:33.230> have<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:33.440> have<00:01:33.680> no<00:01:33.830> fear<00:01:33.860> you've<00:01:34.250> got<00:01:34.430> to

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
you have to have no fear you've got to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.620 
you have to have no fear you've got to
believe<00:01:34.640> in<00:01:34.790> yourself

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
believe in yourself

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:47.530 
believe in yourself
