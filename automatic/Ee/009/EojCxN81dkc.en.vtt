00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.910 
are your thoughts but i think it's a
super<00:02:04.180> functional<00:02:04.479> piece<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:04.930> equipment<00:02:05.380> i

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
super functional piece of equipment i

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.889 
super functional piece of equipment i
think<00:02:06.430> it<00:02:06.490> has<00:02:06.610> more<00:02:06.850> protection<00:02:07.479> than<00:02:07.509> if<00:02:07.810> you

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
think it has more protection than if you

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.779 
think it has more protection than if you
just<00:02:07.930> submission<00:02:08.590> pad<00:02:08.829> into<00:02:09.009> your<00:02:09.220> sock<00:02:09.399> right

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
just submission pad into your sock right

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.640 
just submission pad into your sock right
i<00:02:10.060> think<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.720> looks<00:02:10.899> pretty<00:02:10.989> cool<00:02:11.230> i<00:02:11.440> mean<00:02:11.560> you

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
i think it looks pretty cool i mean you

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.199 
i think it looks pretty cool i mean you
can<00:02:11.769> get<00:02:11.890> away<00:02:11.980> with<00:02:12.489> wearing<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:12.940> without

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
can get away with wearing it without

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.930 
can get away with wearing it without
socks<00:02:13.540> on<00:02:13.750> top<00:02:13.989> and<00:02:14.709> most<00:02:14.950> importantly<00:02:15.430> i<00:02:15.519> love

soccer companies making innovative

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.949 
soccer companies making innovative
products<00:02:18.579> outside<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:19.120> box<00:02:19.269> man<00:02:19.510> yeah<00:02:19.780> we
