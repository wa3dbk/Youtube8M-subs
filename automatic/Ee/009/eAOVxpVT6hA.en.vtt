00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
the game yet cotton alley is just the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.160 
the game yet cotton alley is just the
final<00:00:13.830> series<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.460> levels<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:15.389> which<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:15.929> play

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
final series of levels in which you play

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.279 
final series of levels in which you play
as<00:00:16.410> bandage<00:00:17.220> girl<00:00:17.430> instead<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.850> meat<00:00:18.000> boy

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
as bandage girl instead of meat boy

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.929 
as bandage girl instead of meat boy
there<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.470> no<00:00:19.800> ability<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.550> select<00:00:20.820> other

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
there is no ability to select other

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.370 
there is no ability to select other
characters<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.600> you're<00:00:21.750> stuck<00:00:21.960> with<00:00:22.050> bandage

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
characters so you're stuck with bandage

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.900 
characters so you're stuck with bandage
girl<00:00:22.470> for<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.800> whole<00:00:22.949> thing<00:00:23.189> but<00:00:23.760> that's

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
girl for the whole thing but that's

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.400 
girl for the whole thing but that's
alright<00:00:24.180> because<00:00:24.240> she<00:00:24.480> controls<00:00:24.900> pretty<00:00:25.199> much

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
alright because she controls pretty much

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.929 
alright because she controls pretty much
the<00:00:25.529> same<00:00:25.680> as<00:00:25.859> Meat<00:00:26.010> Boy<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.310> fact<00:00:26.519> my

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
the same as Meat Boy in fact my

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.519 
the same as Meat Boy in fact my
expectation<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:27.960> just<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.199> palette

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
expectation is that it's just a palette

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.749 
expectation is that it's just a palette
swap<00:00:29.150> the<00:00:30.150> levels<00:00:30.510> themselves<00:00:30.660> are

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
swap the levels themselves are

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.060 
swap the levels themselves are
beautifully<00:00:32.759> designed<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.630> also<00:00:34.070> horribly

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
beautifully designed but also horribly

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.340 
beautifully designed but also horribly
horribly<00:00:35.489> difficult<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.270> one<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
horribly difficult and one of the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.660 
horribly difficult and one of the
reasons<00:00:37.649> I'm<00:00:37.770> going<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.950> break<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.340> up<00:00:38.399> into

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
reasons I'm going to break this up into

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.100 
reasons I'm going to break this up into
two<00:00:38.969> parts<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.510> because<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:39.960> gonna

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
two parts is just because it's gonna

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.740 
two parts is just because it's gonna
make<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> lot<00:00:40.770> easier<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.460> me<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:42.390> only<00:00:42.540> have

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
make it a lot easier on me to only have

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.000 
make it a lot easier on me to only have
to<00:00:42.840> play<00:00:43.020> through<00:00:43.200> half<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.410> levels<00:00:43.829> at<00:00:43.950> a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
to play through half the levels at a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.930 
to play through half the levels at a
time<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:44.489> opposed<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.680> all<00:00:46.680> 20<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.309> them

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
time as opposed to all 20 of them

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.090 
time as opposed to all 20 of them
the<00:00:48.270> other<00:00:48.719> thing<00:00:49.020> worth<00:00:49.350> mentioning<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.890> that

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the other thing worth mentioning is that

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.000 
the other thing worth mentioning is that
I<00:00:50.360> will<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.570> dying<00:00:51.840> most<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.469> time<00:00:52.710> here

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
could say to to breaking it up into two

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.790

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
of these levels the trick is actually go

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.819 
of these levels the trick is actually go
slow<00:01:30.180> which<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.750> something<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.530> like<00:01:31.770> about

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829

them that the same thing I mentioned
liking<00:01:33.689> about<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> end<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.560> saying<00:01:34.979> these

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270

liking about the end is it saying these
these<00:01:36.270> levels<00:01:36.600> require<00:01:36.840> patience<00:01:37.439> rather

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
these levels require patience rather

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.069 
these levels require patience rather
than<00:01:37.920> urgency<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:38.700> as<00:01:39.360> far<00:01:39.570> as<00:01:39.600> I'm<00:01:39.780> concerned

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
than urgency but as far as I'm concerned

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.310 
than urgency but as far as I'm concerned
the<00:01:40.140> difficulty<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:40.759> these<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:42.090> about<00:01:42.299> as<00:01:42.840> high

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the difficulty on these is about as high

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.690 
the difficulty on these is about as high
as<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.649> gets<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.070> light<00:01:44.280> world<00:01:44.490> which

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
as it gets in the light world which

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.160 
as it gets in the light world which
makes<00:01:44.880> sense<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.390> I'm<00:01:45.450> including<00:01:45.689> all<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
makes sense and I'm including all the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.859 
makes sense and I'm including all the
all<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.460> warps<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.030> glitch<00:01:48.180> zones<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.689> there

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
all the warps and glitch zones in there

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.889 
all the warps and glitch zones in there
as<00:01:48.960> well<00:01:49.110> or<00:01:49.380> warp<00:01:49.770> zones<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.189> glitch<00:01:50.340> worlds

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
as well or warp zones and glitch worlds

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.120 
as well or warp zones and glitch worlds
so<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.229> light<00:01:52.380> world<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.860> about<00:01:53.009> as

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
so in the light world this is about as

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.249 
so in the light world this is about as
bad<00:01:53.280> as<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.460> gets<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:54.479> level<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:54.990> particular

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
bad as it gets this level in particular

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.069 
bad as it gets this level in particular
I<00:01:55.920> want<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.460> slap<00:01:56.700> whoever<00:01:57.030> created<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.570> square

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
I want to slap whoever created it square

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.600 
I want to slap whoever created it square
in<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.290> mouth<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.680> hopefully<00:01:59.189> knock<00:01:59.369> some

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
in the mouth and hopefully knock some

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.980 
in the mouth and hopefully knock some
teeth<00:01:59.790> out<00:01:59.969> because<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.329> spend<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:00.810> much<00:02:00.930> time

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
teeth out because I spend so much time

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.389 
teeth out because I spend so much time
the<00:02:01.380> first<00:02:01.619> time<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.829> played<00:02:02.100> through<00:02:02.310> this

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
the first time I played through this

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.680 
the first time I played through this
level<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.790> trying<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.090> make<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.390> work

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.320 

here<00:02:06.690> we<00:02:06.810> go<00:02:06.960> oh<00:02:07.200> my<00:02:07.710> god

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
here we go oh my god

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.420 
here we go oh my god
there's<00:02:09.330> really<00:02:09.660> only<00:02:09.810> like<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> few<00:02:10.920> pixel

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
there's really only like a few pixel

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.200 
there's really only like a few pixel
spaces<00:02:12.090> where<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.510> can<00:02:12.720> stand<00:02:13.500> safely<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.460> of

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
spaces where you can stand safely and of

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.000 
spaces where you can stand safely and of
course<00:02:15.420> there's<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.780> another<00:02:16.440> part<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
course there's a another part of the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.380 
course there's a another part of the
level<00:02:17.310> right<00:02:17.550> above<00:02:17.730> us<00:02:17.880> where<00:02:18.120> you've<00:02:18.210> got<00:02:18.360> a

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
level right above us where you've got a

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.210 
level right above us where you've got a
Dodge<00:02:18.750> saws<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.350> are<00:02:19.470> coming<00:02:19.740> at<00:02:19.860> you

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
Dodge saws that are coming at you

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.250 
Dodge saws that are coming at you
well<00:02:20.790> dodging<00:02:21.270> saws<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.690> are<00:02:21.810> going<00:02:21.990> up<00:02:22.140> and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
well dodging saws that are going up and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.080 
well dodging saws that are going up and
down<00:02:22.460> but<00:02:23.460> on<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.640> whole<00:02:23.730> scheme<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:23.940> things

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
down but on the whole scheme of things

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.280 
down but on the whole scheme of things
that's<00:02:24.330> actually<00:02:24.690> not<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.080> difficult

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
that's actually not that difficult

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.190 
that's actually not that difficult
compared<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.890> what<00:02:26.070> we're<00:02:26.220> about<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.580> face

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
compared to what we're about to face

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.020 
compared to what we're about to face
these<00:02:28.200> call<00:02:28.440> Denali<00:02:28.680> world's<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.550> really<00:02:29.880> like

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
these call Denali world's I really like

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.310 
these call Denali world's I really like
them<00:02:30.210> I've<00:02:30.300> got<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.540> say<00:02:30.660> despite<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.050> fact

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
them I've got to say despite the fact

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.560 
them I've got to say despite the fact
that<00:02:31.350> they're<00:02:31.530> super<00:02:31.890> hard<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.310> level<00:02:33.270> design

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
that they're super hard the level design

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.740 
that they're super hard the level design
I<00:02:33.840> really<00:02:34.650> enjoy<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:34.980> think<00:02:35.370> but<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:36.540> can't

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
I really enjoy I think but I can't

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.110 
I really enjoy I think but I can't
imagine<00:02:37.080> how<00:02:37.140> much<00:02:37.260> work<00:02:37.530> went<00:02:37.680> into<00:02:37.770> this

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
imagine how much work went into this

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.640 
imagine how much work went into this
like<00:02:39.120> think<00:02:39.540> about<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.810> for<00:02:40.140> me<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.350> might<00:02:40.470> take

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
like think about it for me it might take

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.810 
like think about it for me it might take
10<00:02:40.860> minutes<00:02:41.040> for<00:02:41.250> me<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.370> figure<00:02:41.640> out<00:02:41.730> how<00:02:41.790> to

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
10 minutes for me to figure out how to

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.880 
10 minutes for me to figure out how to
beat<00:02:42.030> one<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.180> these<00:02:42.360> levels<00:02:42.590> must<00:02:43.590> have<00:02:43.770> taken

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
beat one of these levels must have taken

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.800 
beat one of these levels must have taken
hours<00:02:44.550> for<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.850> designers<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.360> figure<00:02:45.690> out

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
hours for the designers to figure out

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.660 
hours for the designers to figure out
how<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.440> make<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.830> level<00:02:47.100> just<00:02:47.130> difficult

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
how to make the level just difficult

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.270 
how to make the level just difficult
enough<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.230> was<00:02:49.320> still<00:02:49.590> beatable<00:02:50.070> but

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
enough that it was still beatable but

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.100 
enough that it was still beatable but
only<00:02:50.520> barely<00:02:51.000> beatable<00:02:51.570> you<00:02:51.690> had<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.900> do<00:02:51.990> it

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
only barely beatable you had to do it

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.080 
only barely beatable you had to do it
basically<00:02:52.350> perfectly<00:02:53.130> which<00:02:53.730> is<00:02:53.850> what<00:02:54.000> you

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
basically perfectly which is what you

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.460 
basically perfectly which is what you
have<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.300> do<00:02:54.420> for<00:02:54.630> pretty<00:02:54.840> much<00:02:54.930> all<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.320> these

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
have to do for pretty much all of these

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.880 
have to do for pretty much all of these
levels<00:02:55.680> there's<00:02:56.040> almost<00:02:56.370> no<00:02:56.880> room<00:02:57.120> for<00:02:57.150> error

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
levels there's almost no room for error

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.750 
levels there's almost no room for error
errors<00:02:58.890> like<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.310> in<00:02:59.490> particular<00:03:01.760> this

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
errors like that in particular this

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.840 
errors like that in particular this
level<00:03:03.060> again<00:03:03.150> is<00:03:03.570> all<00:03:03.870> about<00:03:04.110> patience

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
level again is all about patience

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.840 
level again is all about patience
although<00:03:05.850> kind<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.660> my<00:03:06.750> strategy<00:03:07.140> for<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.380> is

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
although kind of my strategy for it is

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.890 
although kind of my strategy for it is
basically<00:03:08.850> take<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.390> first<00:03:09.630> available

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
basically take the first available

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.900 
basically take the first available
opportunity<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.920> jump<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.400> then<00:03:11.520> just<00:03:11.700> dodge

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
opportunity to jump and then just dodge

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:12.890 
opportunity to jump and then just dodge
the<00:03:12.150> things<00:03:12.360> whenever<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.690> get<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.840> chance

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
the things whenever you get a chance

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.960 
the things whenever you get a chance
that<00:03:13.860> leaves<00:03:14.040> me<00:03:14.160> in<00:03:14.190> situations<00:03:14.400> like<00:03:14.910> that

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
that leaves me in situations like that

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.370 
that leaves me in situations like that
where<00:03:15.239> I<00:03:15.300> have<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.510> thread<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.930> needle<00:03:15.989> in

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
where I have to thread that needle in

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.380 
where I have to thread that needle in
order<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.680> make<00:03:16.800> it<00:03:16.920> work

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
order to make it work

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.030 
order to make it work
but<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.480> did<00:03:18.630> work<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.959> looks<00:03:19.080> like<00:03:19.350> so<00:03:19.650> that's

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
but it did work it looks like so that's

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.930 
but it did work it looks like so that's
not<00:03:20.220> too<00:03:20.370> bad<00:03:22.160> hard<00:03:23.160> times<00:03:23.430> on<00:03:23.640> these<00:03:23.760> are

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
not too bad hard times on these are

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.759 
not too bad hard times on these are
actually<00:03:24.209> relatively<00:03:24.600> easy<00:03:25.940> this<00:03:26.940> one<00:03:27.330> is<00:03:27.480> a

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
actually relatively easy this one is a

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.380 
actually relatively easy this one is a
another<00:03:28.769> one<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.250> doesn't<00:03:29.459> really<00:03:29.730> fit<00:03:30.030> with

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
another one that doesn't really fit with

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.880 
another one that doesn't really fit with
me<00:03:30.570> cognitively<00:03:32.269> so<00:03:33.269> close<00:03:33.620> so<00:03:34.620> yeah<00:03:34.739> my

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
me cognitively so close so yeah my

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.949 
me cognitively so close so yeah my
strategy<00:03:35.310> for<00:03:35.400> this<00:03:35.489> one<00:03:35.700> run<00:03:36.390> really<00:03:36.750> fast

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
strategy for this one run really fast

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.600 
strategy for this one run really fast
and<00:03:37.230> try<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.350> jump<00:03:37.650> through<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.950> saws<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.430> think

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
and try to jump through the saws I think

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.520 
and try to jump through the saws I think
that's<00:03:38.760> basically<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.930> best<00:03:40.110> way<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.320> win

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
that's basically the the best way to win

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.810 
that's basically the the best way to win
this<00:03:40.709> one<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:42.690> honestly<00:03:43.590> uh<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:44.100> kind<00:03:44.790> of

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
this one and honestly uh I kind of

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.800 
this one and honestly uh I kind of
complained<00:03:45.150> about<00:03:45.239> there<00:03:45.450> not<00:03:45.540> being<00:03:45.600> a

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
complained about there not being a

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.210 
complained about there not being a
character<00:03:46.170> select<00:03:46.500> screen<00:03:46.560> I'm<00:03:46.830> not<00:03:46.950> sure<00:03:47.130> it

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
character select screen I'm not sure it

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.930 
character select screen I'm not sure it
would<00:03:47.310> have<00:03:47.430> done<00:03:47.670> much<00:03:47.910> good<00:03:48.320> because<00:03:49.940> it's

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
would have done much good because it's

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.820 
would have done much good because it's
really<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.330> bandage<00:03:51.959> girl<00:03:51.989> is<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.440> only<00:03:52.470> I

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
really a bandage girl is the only I

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.229 
really a bandage girl is the only I
guess<00:03:53.250> meat<00:03:53.430> boy<00:03:53.580> is<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.820> only<00:03:53.850> character

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
guess meat boy is the only character

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.729 
guess meat boy is the only character
fast<00:03:54.630> enough<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.110> make<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.500> through<00:03:55.709> that

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
fast enough to make it through that

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.970 
fast enough to make it through that
level<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.370> believe<00:03:57.440> this<00:03:58.440> is<00:03:58.530> a<00:03:58.560> level<00:03:58.769> that

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
level I believe this is a level that

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.610 
level I believe this is a level that
really<00:03:59.269> is<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.330> pain<00:04:00.660> in<00:04:00.690> my<00:04:00.810> ass<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.320> say<00:04:01.470> the

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
really is a pain in my ass to say the

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.140 
really is a pain in my ass to say the

by this point of the game they should be
I<00:04:41.650> mean<00:04:41.890> you've<00:04:42.010> done<00:04:42.190> a<00:04:43.090> lot<00:04:43.570> worse<00:04:43.780> than<00:04:43.810> this

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140

I mean you've done a lot worse than this
let's<00:04:44.380> put<00:04:44.500> it<00:04:44.590> that<00:04:44.620> way<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:46.810> only<00:04:46.930> thing

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
let's put it that way the only thing

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.200 
let's put it that way the only thing
that<00:04:47.560> you<00:04:48.010> might<00:04:48.340> need<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.580> know<00:04:48.700> for<00:04:48.820> strategy

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
that you might need to know for strategy

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.910 
that you might need to know for strategy
for<00:04:49.360> this<00:04:49.510> one<00:04:49.660> is<00:04:49.810> when<00:04:49.960> you're<00:04:50.080> on<00:04:50.410> that<00:04:50.440> last

for this one is when you're on that last
or<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.550> next<00:04:51.760> platform<00:04:52.000> I<00:04:52.300> should<00:04:52.480> say<00:04:52.690> don't

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
or the next platform I should say don't

or the next platform I should say don't
try<00:04:53.500> to<00:04:53.590> jump<00:04:53.860> through<00:04:54.010> the<00:04:54.130> sauce<00:04:54.340> just<00:04:54.370> run

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
try to jump through the sauce just run

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.330 
try to jump through the sauce just run
in<00:04:55.450> between<00:04:55.840> them<00:04:56.020> then<00:04:56.770> you<00:04:56.890> jump<00:04:57.160> you'll<00:04:57.280> hit

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
in between them then you jump you'll hit

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.130 
in between them then you jump you'll hit
the<00:04:57.400> sauce<00:04:57.670> every<00:04:58.000> time<00:05:00.630> this<00:05:01.630> level<00:05:01.990> is

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
the sauce every time this level is

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.630 
the sauce every time this level is
particularly<00:05:03.840> nightmarish<00:05:04.840> in<00:05:04.990> its<00:05:05.140> design

particularly nightmarish in its design

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.880 
particularly nightmarish in its design
any<00:05:06.640> time<00:05:06.940> you<00:05:07.270> you<00:05:07.840> have<00:05:07.960> conveyor<00:05:08.350> belts<00:05:08.740> and

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
any time you you have conveyor belts and

saws I am NOT a big fan of it and this

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
saws I am NOT a big fan of it and this
just<00:05:11.650> makes<00:05:11.770> it<00:05:11.920> worse<00:05:11.980> because<00:05:12.190> you<00:05:12.370> can

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
just makes it worse because you can

five<00:05:29.440> meat<00:05:29.710> boys<00:05:29.890> that's<00:05:30.190> not<00:05:30.250> too<00:05:30.550> bad<00:05:30.730> but

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
five meat boys that's not too bad but

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.210 
five meat boys that's not too bad but
considering<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:31.900> level<00:05:32.169> is<00:05:32.320> so

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
considering the level is so

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.860 
considering the level is so
straightforward<00:05:33.550> it's<00:05:34.090> an<00:05:34.210> in<00:05:34.360> its<00:05:34.510> approach

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
straightforward it's an in its approach

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.570 
straightforward it's an in its approach
you<00:05:35.440> can<00:05:35.530> definitely<00:05:35.830> see<00:05:35.950> how<00:05:35.980> difficult<00:05:36.250> it

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
you can definitely see how difficult it

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.710 
you can definitely see how difficult it
is<00:05:36.610> that<00:05:36.820> it<00:05:36.910> still<00:05:37.090> took<00:05:37.210> me<00:05:37.270> multiple<00:05:37.750> tries

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
is that it still took me multiple tries

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:47.370 
is that it still took me multiple tries
only<00:05:40.720> two<00:05:40.960> remain<00:05:43.530> okay<00:05:44.850> so<00:05:45.850> move<00:05:46.060> on<00:05:46.210> to<00:05:46.570> seven

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
only two remain okay so move on to seven

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.310 
only two remain okay so move on to seven
nine<00:05:47.710> now<00:05:48.070> or<00:05:48.340> seven<00:05:48.640> ten<00:05:48.850> bullet<00:05:49.270> Bob<00:05:49.450> uh-huh

this level whoever made it could just

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.380 
this level whoever made it could just

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
strategy for beating this level because

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.200 
strategy for beating this level because
I<00:05:56.950> really<00:05:57.190> think<00:05:57.340> it's<00:05:57.520> something<00:05:57.669> that<00:05:57.880> needs

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
I really think it's something that needs

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.970 
I really think it's something that needs
to<00:05:58.480> be<00:05:58.510> out<00:05:58.840> there<00:05:59.250> just<00:06:00.250> because<00:06:01.380> just

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980 
to be out there just because just

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.040 
to be out there just because just

platform<00:06:23.370> it's<00:06:23.820> basically<00:06:24.120> the<00:06:24.330> strategy<00:06:26.060> but

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
platform it's basically the strategy but

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.000 
platform it's basically the strategy but
also<00:06:27.270> alternate<00:06:28.080> sides<00:06:28.410> and<00:06:28.680> do<00:06:28.770> them<00:06:28.920> as

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
also alternate sides and do them as

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
also alternate sides and do them as
quickly<00:06:29.190> as<00:06:29.400> possible<00:06:31.670> you've<00:06:32.670> got<00:06:32.790> to<00:06:32.880> be<00:06:32.940> in

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
quickly as possible you've got to be in

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.640 
quickly as possible you've got to be in
the<00:06:33.120> exact<00:06:33.930> center<00:06:34.260> of<00:06:34.380> the<00:06:34.440> platform

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
the exact center of the platform

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.450 
the exact center of the platform
otherwise<00:06:35.190> they<00:06:35.340> can<00:06:35.460> still<00:06:35.670> tag<00:06:35.880> you<00:06:37.460> all

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
otherwise they can still tag you all

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.360 
otherwise they can still tag you all
right<00:06:38.640> and<00:06:38.850> there<00:06:39.330> we<00:06:39.510> go<00:06:39.660> with<00:06:39.810> that<00:06:39.990> one

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
right and there we go with that one

and I'm not sure what they could have

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.320 
and I'm not sure what they could have
done<00:06:46.590> about<00:06:46.920> it<00:06:46.980> is<00:06:47.340> on<00:06:47.760> levels<00:06:48.060> like<00:06:48.210> this

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
done about it is on levels like this

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.890 
done about it is on levels like this
with<00:06:48.510> dissolving<00:06:48.990> blocks<00:06:49.290> or<00:06:49.680> missiles<00:06:50.280> or

anything<00:06:51.900> at<00:06:52.020> homes<00:06:52.290> basically<00:06:53.030> you<00:06:54.030> can't

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
anything at homes basically you can't

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.510 
anything at homes basically you can't
show<00:06:54.570> a<00:06:54.600> good<00:06:54.840> replay<00:06:55.320> because<00:06:55.740> your<00:06:56.340> guys

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
show a good replay because your guys

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.130 
show a good replay because your guys
they<00:06:57.210> can't<00:06:57.420> show<00:06:57.540> all<00:06:57.600> the<00:06:57.720> missiles<00:06:58.020> let's

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:58.140 
they can't show all the missiles let's

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.540 
they can't show all the missiles let's
put<00:06:58.260> it<00:06:58.350> that<00:06:58.380> way<00:06:58.620> so<00:06:58.680> your<00:06:58.920> guys<00:06:59.070> just<00:06:59.340> end<00:06:59.460> up

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
put it that way so your guys just end up

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.090 
put it that way so your guys just end up
spontaneously<00:07:00.240> combusting<00:07:00.810> on<00:07:00.930> screen<00:07:01.260> for

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
the most part the replay feature is

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.850 
the most part the replay feature is
really<00:07:03.480> good<00:07:03.660> but<00:07:03.870> just<00:07:03.990> a<00:07:04.260> really<00:07:04.560> minor

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 
really good but just a really minor
