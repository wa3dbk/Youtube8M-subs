00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.000
 I wanted to do nothing 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.460

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.430
 smoker 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.390
 the stretch there I met a colleague 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.390
 I was working 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.770
 food education in fact that the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.610
 people learn to eat this is the truth 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.690
 in the meantime it is known 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:07.190
 Enough I quit smoking and 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.190
 I learned as an example 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.440
 The man I started feeding me 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.390
 right 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.380
 but she knows 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.640
 filling of salgadinho of superfluous things 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.710
 that does not get people anywhere 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.050
 when I realized that I was 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.450
 an obese person that I did not have to 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.729
 to take care that I had to do some 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.560
 thing for me I started to learn that 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.479
 life is very important that people 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.080
 You have to take care of us, you have to give yourself. 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.060
 value 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.640
 I like to walk again in the 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.619
 Mirror thing I did not do 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.680

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.290

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.649

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.960

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.119
 clothes and I'm feeling very well 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.009
 doing gym three times a week and 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.680
 It is also helping the coexistence 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.930

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.640
