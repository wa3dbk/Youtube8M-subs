00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.449
 Hello everyone 

00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:05.200
 in parallel so have not hurt she's hardly were they armed themselves 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.890
 hold 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:07.760
 the adapei 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.760
 kNYSNA 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.689
 he 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.999
 a visit the intervention day after day on the streets and some holders the 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.939
 mushrooms are often synonymous with disease 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.780
 not a more positive role and in the forest ecosystem 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.509
 oh yes I think mushrooms remember spirits because we see 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.800
 mushrooms that destroy the mushroom plants that to toxic that 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.510
 legs 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.430
 but I think the mushroom is quite something else 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.380
 first you must know that mushrooms is not a plant like any other 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.830
 sectors shutdown apart from it's called the reign of fungicides 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.920
 because they have a very special development that we do not find 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.740
 and in other living organisms then we are distinguished in the 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.180
 mushrooms three major categories 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.620
 there is first all 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.580
 which according to them a nurse of dead matter is called it is and that 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.370
 benefits 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.300
 and in fact they have a role in the environment and in the ecosystem 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.220
 very important by this are actually the gravediggers 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.390
 drownings are the second player in the forest you have a second 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.500
 category 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.090
 that's why yesterday 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.090
 attacked the living matter 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.800
 we call it parasites so everyone knows the libraries 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.420
 negative to a bad agreement asia it adds in the negative yes and no 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.570
 for this group 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.750
 the parasite intervenes where weaknesses 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.240
 % for mycosis a little primed the human the villepin by chance it's 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.230
 clear it fascinates the flexibility of the body that makes fungal infections 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.310
 can grow even in nature it's the same thing a wounded tree 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.960
 for this is by% a storm we saw a lot of injuries but these trees 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.020
 they are no longer necessary because they can no longer produce 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.330
 properly and therefore related to these organisms the parasite that go into them 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.900
 sports one has fixed in the wound that the one developed inside 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.880
 of the tree to destroy it completely and make it fall 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.640
 so equally a role of two sculptors of weakness it is necessary that for 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.640
 that a forest is soiled must trees 60 not support trees 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.280
 hurt all over 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.770
 and then we went the vast majority what people know most about 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.340
 burn lesley then to all the mushrooms there lille that will finish 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.969
 usually in pots also another function 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.969
 sector they live in symbiosis with the tree 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.079
 the presence associated land will have $ 10 million to make nutritious exchanges 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.039
 so not a mushroom 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.229
 without tears could not want in these cases and the tree without mushrooms 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:33.619
 can not be that it takes symbiotic association called the 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:34.479
 mycorrhizae 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:37.089
 and that's really the beneficial effect for one for the other 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:38.729
 of the win-win 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:42.629
 would you have some tips to give us for a respectful picking 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:43.490
 of the environment 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.110
 so she is respectful it's already folded paper what we do not know 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.909
 not 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.870
 to punish the mushrooms properly so that's his knife to get it 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.699
 extract the ball from the foot they did not shoot what are we destroying the 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:58.089
 mycelium so the underground part which can harm the proliferation 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:59.559
 species 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:02.590
 as well as read only copies of copies during a role 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:05.589
 central to produce water sports that will serve for the reproduction of 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:06.519
 species 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.209
 and then pick up only what we know 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.739
 of course to avoid any risk of intoxication point barre jean-pierre 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.479
 massines thank you for me I can not wait to hand brand new initiative salehi
