00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.930
 Hello, this is Rubén Master and I 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.299
 I will tell you something that most players 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.960
 you know but the new voters and 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.360
 This is called foot goal mess with 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.500
 when de sant colleague and greet them 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.689
 you usually do it with a squeeze of 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.090
 hands like when you see a friend 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.369
 helps garments on the cheek this 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.589
 it is clear now what would happen if one day 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.960
 you will arrive with your colleague, give him a kiss 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:36.610
 on the cheek he surely lived for 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.440
 what are you doing and we would receive 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.570
 approval because you do not wear the 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.270
 protocol or common custom of the 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.129
 greetings then in Medellín is a norm in 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.990
 the custom imposed by a group of 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.420
 people in this case 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.150
 the players the people who do not follow 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.129
 this protocol at best 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.950
 they call them trolleys 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.290
 and now you know what metal is but in 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.080
 what it consists can also be very 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.970
 extensive but basically the main thing is 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.400
 the order of the roles in each law of the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.340
 map next to a champion of the physical year or 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.440
 of good resistance in me no one votes a 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.190
 stand one the rain and a champion for 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.740
 June 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.380
 that's the gay goal they also apply 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.570
 for tweets and ways to play by 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.909
 example if you go with there instead of a 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.800
 they love buying a very sapphire 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.780
 surely someone will be upset with you 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.880
 like if you're human and you take the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.490
 spell if mike to be fuller os 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.130
 you will grab and make paper 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.409
 all those examples are violations to 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.689
 meta game and surely they will create 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.110
 problems with your playmates and 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:46.450
 illness that friends of mine is the goal 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.729
 which is important for all those 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.890
 that start in the hate world now 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.560
 where it is and does not always have to be 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.960
 unquestionable in fact on high the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.759
 so gay constantly goal 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.909
 new training or strategies 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.610
 advanced in conclusion the interim are 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.159
 patterns mark the passage of time but 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.649
 It is always advisable to continue as 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.360
 always yield a positive result and 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.180
 It will also depend on your ability and 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.069

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.069
