 Let's look back on today's game 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.019
 It was advance pitcher Ishikawa 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.360
 Suddenly rain and second place 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:17.500
 It was taken to light sand 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.500
 Harp 1 point open 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.630
 Back of 3 times 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.620
 First of all, starting from Barrington 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.850
 Let go 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:39.110
 Noauto it then made a second base cherry but whether Naza 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.110
 Double play at the restaurant 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.270
 I will kill the chance here 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.290
 Deke 6 is another three times table 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.550
 Then huh 1 Naoto runner second base Chi d day 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.470
 l bread 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.890
 It is 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.890

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:13.350

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:13.350
 I'm left Mishima Chori in Aichi 2 out Here against Dosari 's second proposed 0 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.950
 October 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.820
 An unusual case that Nishi-Kasai has passed 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.350
 I think I'm a little flow was not good 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.759
 I agree 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:30.080
 Hey, since I was a little a lot better of that bis 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.530
 The horror roots of four times in 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.340
 Even if it is 2 out Ichijo Ichikawa Ishikawa gives up and is good here 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.320
 jam 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.620
 It's the Mashi Dashiteki 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.620
 that 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.960
 I did not capitalize the opportunity quite three times and I'd had a net chance to 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.920
 so 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.850
 It has been planted as soon as possible by saying Well wonder if such opportunity is not it is not now on 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.090
 It was 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.560
 At 2 to 1 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.580
 Back of 5 times

 An example from the front with no cone 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:04.159
 Willingly 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:08.429
 And then there is one kind of sound , and some grand grandfather run in the corner 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.350
 I will reverse this with 4 or 2 together 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.640
 further 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.640
 It is the back of six times 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.480
 Many people second base day 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.820
 And pitcher is changed to black 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.820

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:42.100
 With a 3-point difference by I saw the kana was a game somewhat Nee 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.730

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.400
 The last is brought about, of course 3 of mediation 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.950
