stronger and fast

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.220 
stronger and fast
but<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:05.760> like<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.120> way<00:04:06.239> dollars<00:04:06.629> played<00:04:06.870> they

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
but I like the way dollars played they

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.660 
but I like the way dollars played they
didn't<00:04:07.560> they<00:04:07.830> just<00:04:07.860> didn't<00:04:08.250> have<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.489> big

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
didn't they just didn't have the big

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.850 
didn't they just didn't have the big
three<00:04:09.000> they<00:04:09.720> had<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:09.900> complete<00:04:10.319> team<00:04:10.590> that

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
three they had a complete team that

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.229 
three they had a complete team that
really<00:04:11.099> helped<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.580> I<00:04:11.670> think<00:04:11.909> that's<00:04:12.090> what

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
really helped and I think that's what

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.789 
really helped and I think that's what
made<00:04:12.420> it<00:04:12.450> easy<00:04:13.019> for<00:04:13.230> them<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.560> win<00:04:13.680> the

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
made it easy for them to win the

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:14.390 
made it easy for them to win the
championship
