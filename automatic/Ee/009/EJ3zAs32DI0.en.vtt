hi<00:00:07.870> guys<00:00:08.139> in<00:00:08.440> this<00:00:08.950> tutorial<00:00:09.190> I'm<00:00:09.700> gonna<00:00:09.850> be

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
hi guys in this tutorial I'm gonna be

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.980 
hi guys in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing<00:00:10.360> you<00:00:11.040> what<00:00:12.040> a<00:00:12.280> gauge<00:00:12.940> means<00:00:13.389> when<00:00:13.900> you

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
showing you what a gauge means when you

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.529 
showing you what a gauge means when you
see<00:00:14.199> it<00:00:14.289> on<00:00:14.350> a<00:00:14.410> pattern<00:00:15.270> typically<00:00:16.270> most

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
see it on a pattern typically most

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.109 
see it on a pattern typically most
gauges<00:00:17.080> will<00:00:17.320> be<00:00:17.470> one<00:00:17.800> inch<00:00:17.980> by<00:00:18.220> one<00:00:18.250> inch<00:00:18.550> and

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
gauges will be one inch by one inch and

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.900 
gauges will be one inch by one inch and
if<00:00:20.080> you're<00:00:20.230> working<00:00:20.529> with<00:00:20.650> centimeters<00:00:21.190> one

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
if you're working with centimeters one

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.350 
if you're working with centimeters one
inch<00:00:22.210> is<00:00:23.010> 2.54<00:00:24.010> centimeters<00:00:24.400> so<00:00:24.940> it's<00:00:25.180> about

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
inch is 2.54 centimeters so it's about

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.779 
inch is 2.54 centimeters so it's about
two<00:00:25.570> and<00:00:25.660> a<00:00:25.720> half<00:00:26.190> centimeters<00:00:27.190> per<00:00:27.400> 1<00:00:27.580> inch

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
two and a half centimeters per 1 inch

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.560 
two and a half centimeters per 1 inch
and<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:30.160> make<00:00:30.310> it<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.520> most<00:00:30.700> simplest<00:00:31.150> most

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
and to make it the most simplest most

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.970 
and to make it the most simplest most
people<00:00:31.900> just<00:00:31.990> do<00:00:32.169> one<00:00:32.349> inch<00:00:32.529> by<00:00:32.770> one<00:00:32.950> inch

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
people just do one inch by one inch

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.389 
people just do one inch by one inch
which<00:00:33.430> is<00:00:33.640> exactly<00:00:34.030> what<00:00:34.329> these<00:00:34.480> squares<00:00:34.870> are

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
which is exactly what these squares are

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.600 
which is exactly what these squares are
and<00:00:36.399> it's<00:00:36.550> got<00:00:36.699> a<00:00:36.730> ruler<00:00:37.000> and<00:00:38.010> mine<00:00:39.010> is<00:00:39.310> in

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
and it's got a ruler and mine is in

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.520 
and it's got a ruler and mine is in
centimeters<00:00:40.270> so<00:00:41.970> mine<00:00:42.970> is<00:00:43.000> about<00:00:43.989> two<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.440> a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
centimeters so mine is about two and a

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.520 
centimeters so mine is about two and a
half<00:00:45.090> no<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:46.270> best<00:00:46.420> thing<00:00:46.630> about<00:00:46.660> a<00:00:46.870> gauge<00:00:47.170> is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
half no the best thing about a gauge is

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.680 
half no the best thing about a gauge is
not<00:00:48.010> only<00:00:48.399> does<00:00:48.579> it<00:00:48.730> tell<00:00:48.910> you<00:00:49.090> if<00:00:49.300> your<00:00:49.480> hats

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
not only does it tell you if your hats

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.950 
not only does it tell you if your hats
coming<00:00:49.989> out<00:00:50.230> too<00:00:50.500> big<00:00:50.710> or<00:00:50.890> too<00:00:51.040> small<00:00:51.660> but<00:00:52.660> you

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
coming out too big or too small but you

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.410 
coming out too big or too small but you
can<00:00:53.200> see<00:00:53.680> if<00:00:54.040> your<00:00:54.489> hats<00:00:54.700> going<00:00:54.970> to<00:00:55.090> come<00:00:55.270> out

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
can see if your hats going to come out

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.940 
can see if your hats going to come out
too<00:00:55.630> big<00:00:55.809> or<00:00:55.930> too<00:00:55.960> small<00:00:56.079> before<00:00:56.680> you<00:00:56.770> ever

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
too big or too small before you ever

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.690 
too big or too small before you ever
make<00:00:57.190> it<00:00:57.399> by<00:00:57.610> making<00:00:57.790> a<00:00:58.120> little<00:00:58.780> sample<00:00:59.410> so<00:01:00.280> say

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
make it by making a little sample so say

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.459 
make it by making a little sample so say
if<00:01:00.969> they're<00:01:01.120> giving<00:01:01.420> you<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:02.230> four

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
if they're giving you the the four

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.590 
if they're giving you the the four
stitches<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:03.850> you<00:01:03.969> do<00:01:04.119> is<00:01:04.269> you<00:01:04.390> want<00:01:04.540> to

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
stitches what you do is you want to

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.280 
stitches what you do is you want to
chain<00:01:04.809> four<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.439> then<00:01:06.130> I<00:01:06.159> usually<00:01:06.430> want<00:01:06.939> to<00:01:06.969> do

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
chain four and then I usually want to do

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.940 
chain four and then I usually want to do
five<00:01:08.670> six<00:01:09.719> so<00:01:10.719> I'm<00:01:11.259> going<00:01:11.469> to<00:01:11.530> be<00:01:11.619> measuring

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
five six so I'm going to be measuring

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.039 
five six so I'm going to be measuring
four<00:01:12.459> but<00:01:13.270> I'm<00:01:13.359> going<00:01:13.509> to<00:01:13.539> make<00:01:13.689> it<00:01:13.840> a<00:01:13.899> little

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
four but I'm going to make it a little

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.620 
four but I'm going to make it a little
bigger<00:01:14.319> just<00:01:14.679> so<00:01:14.770> I<00:01:14.829> have<00:01:14.979> a<00:01:15.009> better<00:01:15.280> feel<00:01:15.639> so

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
bigger just so I have a better feel so

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.779 
bigger just so I have a better feel so
I'm<00:01:16.899> going<00:01:17.079> to<00:01:17.139> go<00:01:17.200> ahead<00:01:17.259> and<00:01:17.409> do<00:01:17.499> six<00:01:17.829> and<00:01:18.219> for

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
I'm going to go ahead and do six and for

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:20.669 
I'm going to go ahead and do six and for
the<00:01:18.880> step-up<00:01:19.329> I'm<00:01:19.600> going<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:19.840> do<00:01:19.929> seven<00:01:20.380> so

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
the step-up I'm going to do seven so

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.639 
the step-up I'm going to do seven so
I've<00:01:20.829> got<00:01:20.979> seven<00:01:21.429> chains<00:01:22.179> I'm<00:01:23.079> going<00:01:23.229> to<00:01:23.289> go<00:01:23.439> in

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
I've got seven chains I'm going to go in

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.399 
I've got seven chains I'm going to go in
my<00:01:23.770> second<00:01:24.189> chain<00:01:24.399> from<00:01:24.429> the<00:01:24.639> hook<00:01:25.079> using<00:01:26.079> the

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
my second chain from the hook using the

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.649 
my second chain from the hook using the
stitch<00:01:26.649> that<00:01:26.679> the<00:01:27.159> Hat<00:01:27.700> calls<00:01:27.999> for<00:01:28.299> which<00:01:28.509> is

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
stitch that the Hat calls for which is

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.590 
stitch that the Hat calls for which is
single<00:01:28.840> crocheting<00:01:29.579> for<00:01:30.579> this<00:01:30.729> hat<00:01:30.969> so<00:01:31.389> I'm

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
single crocheting for this hat so I'm

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.339 
single crocheting for this hat so I'm
going<00:01:31.899> to<00:01:31.959> do<00:01:32.139> single<00:01:32.350> crochets<00:01:33.899> so<00:01:34.899> what<00:01:35.229> you

00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:35.349 
going to do single crochets so what you

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:37.980 
going to do single crochets so what you
want<00:01:35.529> to<00:01:35.619> do<00:01:35.799> if<00:01:36.130> it's<00:01:36.310> saying<00:01:36.579> an<00:01:37.209> inch<00:01:37.539> and

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
want to do if it's saying an inch and

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.739 
want to do if it's saying an inch and
you<00:01:38.159> know<00:01:39.159> you're<00:01:39.340> supposed<00:01:39.639> to<00:01:39.759> have<00:01:39.849> at

you know you're supposed to have at
least<00:01:40.840> four<00:01:41.289> stitches<00:01:41.590> in<00:01:41.859> an<00:01:41.950> inch<00:01:42.130> I'm<00:01:42.490> going

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
least four stitches in an inch I'm going

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.550 
least four stitches in an inch I'm going
to<00:01:43.359> do<00:01:43.539> at<00:01:43.869> least<00:01:43.899> four<00:01:44.740> rows<00:01:45.069> of<00:01:46.200> my<00:01:47.200> little

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
to do at least four rows of my little

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.190 
to do at least four rows of my little
sample<00:01:47.859> gauge<00:01:48.249> here<00:01:49.859> so<00:01:50.859> you<00:01:50.950> don't<00:01:51.189> have<00:01:51.429> to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
sample gauge here so you don't have to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.629 
sample gauge here so you don't have to
you<00:01:53.200> don't<00:01:53.289> have<00:01:53.409> to<00:01:53.560> wait<00:01:53.799> to<00:01:54.009> do<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.219> hat<00:01:54.429> to

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:54.639 
you don't have to wait to do the hat to

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:57.749 
you don't have to wait to do the hat to
find<00:01:54.880> out<00:01:55.060> if<00:01:55.209> you're<00:01:55.359> doing<00:01:55.630> too<00:01:56.399> big<00:01:57.399> or<00:01:57.579> too

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
find out if you're doing too big or too

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.529 
find out if you're doing too big or too
small<00:01:59.490> and<00:02:00.490> that's<00:02:00.669> one<00:02:00.909> of<00:02:00.939> the<00:02:01.060> best<00:02:01.299> things

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
small and that's one of the best things

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.649 
small and that's one of the best things
about<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.989> gauge<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.880> can<00:02:04.060> find<00:02:04.299> out<00:02:04.479> right

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
about the gauge you can find out right

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.620 
about the gauge you can find out right
off<00:02:04.779> the<00:02:04.929> bat<00:02:05.079> if<00:02:05.259> you're<00:02:05.409> making<00:02:05.529> it<00:02:05.799> too<00:02:06.009> big

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
off the bat if you're making it too big

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.109 
off the bat if you're making it too big
then<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.989> need<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.289> reduce<00:02:08.739> one<00:02:09.580> hook<00:02:09.849> size

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
then you need to reduce one hook size

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.720 
then you need to reduce one hook size
and<00:02:10.630> then<00:02:11.230> make<00:02:11.590> another<00:02:11.709> gauge<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.489> see<00:02:12.520> if

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
and then make another gauge and see if

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.610 
and then make another gauge and see if
you're<00:02:12.940> getting<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.300> right<00:02:13.510> size<00:02:13.900> then<00:02:14.350> and

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
you're getting the right size then and

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.130 
you're getting the right size then and
if<00:02:15.340> it's<00:02:15.490> coming<00:02:15.850> out<00:02:15.970> too<00:02:16.150> small<00:02:16.540> then<00:02:16.900> I

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
if it's coming out too small then I

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.050 
if it's coming out too small then I
would<00:02:17.320> increase

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
would increase

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.420 
would increase
a<00:02:19.120> hook<00:02:19.810> side<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:20.410> if<00:02:20.470> you're<00:02:20.590> using<00:02:20.770> five<00:02:21.099> I'd

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
a hook side so if you're using five I'd

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.570 
a hook side so if you're using five I'd
go<00:02:21.580> up<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.700> six<00:02:22.090> millimeters<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:24.280> on<00:02:24.459> and

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
go up to six millimeters and so on and

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.140 
go up to six millimeters and so on and
so<00:02:24.700> forth<00:02:25.739> so<00:02:26.739> I'm<00:02:26.800> coming<00:02:27.130> up<00:02:27.340> here<00:02:27.400> on<00:02:27.880> my

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
so forth so I'm coming up here on my

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:39.360 
so forth so I'm coming up here on my
fourth<00:02:29.220> row<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:36.959> there<00:02:37.959> we<00:02:38.050> go<00:02:38.230> now<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.069> would

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
fourth row and there we go now I would

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.920 
fourth row and there we go now I would
just<00:02:39.489> simply<00:02:39.970> get<00:02:40.750> my<00:02:40.980> my<00:02:41.980> my<00:02:42.819> ruler<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.450> I

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
just simply get my my my ruler and I

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.490 
just simply get my my my ruler and I
would<00:02:44.080> see<00:02:44.349> if<00:02:44.620> it's<00:02:44.800> coming<00:02:45.069> out<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.640> same

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
would see if it's coming out the same

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.850 
would see if it's coming out the same
length<00:02:47.500> or<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:47.980> same<00:02:48.780> width<00:02:49.780> as<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.680> Hat

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
length or the same width as the the Hat

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.440 
length or the same width as the the Hat
if<00:02:51.069> I'm<00:02:51.190> getting<00:02:51.370> four<00:02:51.670> stitches<00:02:52.000> per<00:02:52.420> inch

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450
