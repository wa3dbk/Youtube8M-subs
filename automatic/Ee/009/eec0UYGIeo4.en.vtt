hi Alex here what is sustainability you

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.059 
hi Alex here what is sustainability you
must<00:00:04.080> have<00:00:04.200> heard<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.470> lot<00:00:04.620> about

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
must have heard a lot about

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.530 
must have heard a lot about
sustainability<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:06.089> sustainable

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
sustainability and sustainable

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.360 
sustainability and sustainable
development<00:00:06.750> over<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.529> last<00:00:07.560> few<00:00:07.890> years<00:00:07.950> I

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
development over the last few years I

development over the last few years I
know<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.820> did<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.469> maybe<00:00:10.469> just<00:00:10.920> maybe

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
know I did and maybe just maybe

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.700 
know I did and maybe just maybe
sometimes<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:12.450> were<00:00:12.719> not<00:00:12.900> totally<00:00:13.230> clear<00:00:13.530> as

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
sometimes you were not totally clear as

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.369 
sometimes you were not totally clear as
to<00:00:13.769> what<00:00:14.070> people<00:00:14.400> really<00:00:14.580> meant<00:00:14.960> so<00:00:15.960> here<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.350> a

common sustainable development is

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.820 
common sustainable development is
development<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.480> meets<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.019> needs<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.380> the

tell<00:00:36.180> us<00:00:36.300> what<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.600> do<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.809> Monday<00:00:37.110> morning

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
tell us what to do on Monday morning

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.530 
tell us what to do on Monday morning
it's<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.129> very<00:00:38.340> easy<00:00:38.520> definition<00:00:39.090> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
it's a very easy definition to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.260 
it's a very easy definition to
understand<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.500> communicate<00:00:41.270> there's

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
understand and to communicate there's

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.299 
understand and to communicate there's
another<00:00:42.570> one<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.170> was<00:00:43.320> created<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.100> late

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
another one that was created in the late

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.420 
another one that was created in the late
1980s<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.410> is<00:00:46.410> more<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> scientific

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
1980s that is more of a scientific

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.750 
1980s that is more of a scientific
definition<00:00:48.410> it<00:00:49.410> was<00:00:49.620> created<00:00:50.129> by<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> Swedish

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
definition it was created by a Swedish

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.819 
definition it was created by a Swedish
doctor<00:00:51.120> who<00:00:51.780> found<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.199> there<00:00:52.469> was<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.649> lack

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
doctor who found that there was a lack

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.510 
doctor who found that there was a lack
of<00:00:52.890> common<00:00:53.370> language<00:00:53.550> around<00:00:54.140> sustainability

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
of common language around sustainability

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.340 
of common language around sustainability
so<00:00:56.520> he<00:00:56.610> thought<00:00:56.820> what<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:57.660> managed<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.050> get

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
so he thought what if we managed to get

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.920 
so he thought what if we managed to get
a<00:00:58.379> group<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.739> scientists<00:00:59.340> together<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:00.059> to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
a group of scientists together and to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.229 
a group of scientists together and to
agree<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:01.590> sustainability<00:01:02.070> means<00:01:02.309> based

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
agree on what sustainability means based

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.929 
agree on what sustainability means based
on<00:01:03.449> science<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.019> thermodynamics<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.100> maybe

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
on science and thermodynamics and maybe

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.910 
on science and thermodynamics and maybe
that<00:01:06.450> will<00:01:06.570> lead<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.840> understanding<00:01:07.619> what<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
that will lead to understanding what the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.789 
that will lead to understanding what the
root<00:01:08.100> causes<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.760> unsustainability<00:01:08.939> are<00:01:09.810> so

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
root causes of unsustainability are so

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.440 
root causes of unsustainability are so
that's<00:01:10.979> what<00:01:11.100> he<00:01:11.189> did<00:01:11.220> he<00:01:11.580> put<00:01:12.030> together<00:01:12.180> a

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
that's what he did he put together a

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.620 
that's what he did he put together a
group<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.869> 50<00:01:13.170> scientists<00:01:13.770> mathematicians

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
second and it works well

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.719 
second and it works well
then<00:02:01.049> they<00:02:01.290> agreed<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> fact<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.399> this

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
then they agreed on the fact that this

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.210 
then they agreed on the fact that this
system<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.360> biosphere<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:04.200> open<00:02:04.979> with

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
system the biosphere is open with

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.429 
system the biosphere is open with
respect<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.759> energy

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
respect to energy

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.839 
respect to energy
this<00:02:07.439> means<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.829> energy<00:02:08.130> from<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.640> Sun

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
this means that energy from the Sun

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.710 
this means that energy from the Sun
comes<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.739> radiations<00:02:10.739> come<00:02:11.069> out<00:02:11.569> this<00:02:12.569> is

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
comes in and radiations come out this is

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.360 
comes in and radiations come out this is
also<00:02:12.900> known<00:02:13.200> as<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.709> first<00:02:13.980> law<00:02:14.190> of

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
also known as the first law of

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.420 
also known as the first law of
thermodynamics<00:02:15.410> they<00:02:16.410> also<00:02:16.530> agreed<00:02:17.010> on<00:02:17.220> the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
thermodynamics they also agreed on the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.490 
thermodynamics they also agreed on the
fact<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:17.910> system<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.510> closed<00:02:19.050> with

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
fact that this system is closed with

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.160 
fact that this system is closed with
respect<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.980> matter<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:20.780> maybe<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:22.019> remember

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
respect to matter so maybe you remember

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.470 
respect to matter so maybe you remember
this<00:02:22.470> very<00:02:22.800> famous<00:02:23.099> price<00:02:23.550> from<00:02:23.849> Lavoisier

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
this very famous price from Lavoisier

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.320 
this very famous price from Lavoisier
that<00:02:25.050> says<00:02:25.410> nothing<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.099> created<00:02:26.330> nothing

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
that says nothing is created nothing

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.970 
that says nothing is created nothing
disappears<00:02:27.900> everything<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.830> only

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980

earth four billion years ago is still
here<00:02:41.910> today<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:43.290> has<00:02:43.500> changed<00:02:43.530> form<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.519> the

here today it has changed form and the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.910 
here today it has changed form and the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
but it is still the same matter the

other thing that comes with this is that

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.900 
other thing that comes with this is that
everything<00:02:52.440> has<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:52.920> tendency<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.549> disperse

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
a million years it's very likely that

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
you will get a pile of dust take a pile

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
of dust and wait for a million years you

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.590 
of dust and wait for a million years you
will<00:03:04.530> never<00:03:04.799> get<00:03:05.280> an<00:03:05.400> iPhone<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.970> works<00:03:06.420> only

in one direction this is also known as
the<00:03:09.420> second<00:03:09.750> law<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.870> thermodynamics<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.980> law

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
all the time how is it possible that we

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.210 
all the time how is it possible that we
live<00:03:17.790> here<00:03:18.299> in<00:03:18.510> such<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.750> beautiful<00:03:19.230> world<00:03:19.470> with

the<00:04:02.459> biosphere<00:04:02.760> through<00:04:03.569> things<00:04:03.930> like

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
the biosphere through things like

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.150 
the biosphere through things like
volcano<00:04:05.250> eruptions<00:04:05.850> and<00:04:06.180> weathering<00:04:06.810> and

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
volcano eruptions and weathering and

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.530 
volcano eruptions and weathering and
just<00:04:08.160> about<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.760> same<00:04:08.940> amount<00:04:09.239> of<00:04:09.329> matter

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
just about the same amount of matter

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.750 
just about the same amount of matter
goes<00:04:10.169> back<00:04:10.410> from<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:10.949> biosphere<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.699> the

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
goes back from the biosphere to the

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.110 
goes back from the biosphere to the
Earth's<00:04:11.970> crust<00:04:12.150> the

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
Earth's crust the

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.000 
Earth's crust the
things<00:04:13.299> like<00:04:13.629> mineralization<00:04:14.560> and

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
things like mineralization and

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.030 
things like mineralization and
sedimentation<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:16.410> all<00:04:17.410> this<00:04:17.560> is<00:04:17.709> very<00:04:17.739> well

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
sedimentation and all this is very well

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.340 
sedimentation and all this is very well
balanced<00:04:18.519> this<00:04:19.209> cycles<00:04:19.660> take<00:04:19.870> millions<00:04:20.109> of

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
balanced this cycles take millions of

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.350 
balanced this cycles take millions of
years<00:04:20.590> they<00:04:20.949> are<00:04:21.100> very<00:04:21.370> slow<00:04:21.669> and<00:04:22.000> like<00:04:22.240> the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
years they are very slow and like the

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.430 
years they are very slow and like the
previous<00:04:22.720> ones<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.199> they<00:04:24.100> also<00:04:24.250> work<00:04:24.520> well<00:04:25.440> so

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
previous ones and they also work well so

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.080 
previous ones and they also work well so
this<00:04:26.620> is<00:04:26.770> what<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.040> scientific<00:04:27.460> community

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
this is what the scientific community

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.200 
this is what the scientific community
agreed<00:04:28.449> upon<00:04:28.540> this<00:04:29.320> is<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.620> world<00:04:29.830> we<00:04:29.979> live<00:04:30.130> in

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
agreed upon this is the world we live in

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.600 
agreed upon this is the world we live in
so<00:04:31.210> what<00:04:31.660> is<00:04:31.810> sustainability<00:04:32.320> well<00:04:33.280> it's

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
so what is sustainability well it's

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.490 
so what is sustainability well it's
actually<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:34.150> capacity<00:04:34.720> of<00:04:34.750> our<00:04:35.139> human

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
actually the capacity of our human

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.740 
actually the capacity of our human
society<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:36.250> continue<00:04:36.370> indefinitely<00:04:37.060> within

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
society to continue indefinitely within

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.200 
society to continue indefinitely within
these<00:04:37.930> natural<00:04:38.260> cycles<00:04:38.650> and<00:04:39.210> sustainable

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
these natural cycles and sustainable

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.060 
these natural cycles and sustainable
development<00:04:40.389> would<00:04:41.380> be<00:04:41.560> a<00:04:41.590> development

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
development would be a development

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.570 
development would be a development
towards<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:43.030> state<00:04:43.270> of<00:04:43.479> sustainability<00:04:44.580> so

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
towards the state of sustainability so

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.969 
towards the state of sustainability so
you<00:04:45.639> may<00:04:45.850> be<00:04:45.910> thinking<00:04:46.360> well<00:04:46.660> this<00:04:47.440> does<00:04:47.800> not

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
you may be thinking well this does not

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.469 
you may be thinking well this does not
exactly<00:04:48.280> tell<00:04:48.610> us<00:04:48.760> what<00:04:48.940> to<00:04:49.090> do<00:04:49.180> on<00:04:49.330> Monday

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
exactly tell us what to do on Monday

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.500 
exactly tell us what to do on Monday
morning<00:04:49.900> either<00:04:50.110> that's<00:04:50.949> right<00:04:51.190> but<00:04:52.030> it<00:04:52.330> made

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
morning either that's right but it made

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.719 
morning either that's right but it made
it<00:04:52.539> possible<00:04:52.690> for<00:04:53.169> our<00:04:53.680> group<00:04:54.070> of<00:04:54.250> scientists

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
it possible for our group of scientists

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.670 
it possible for our group of scientists
to<00:04:55.120> look<00:04:55.240> at<00:04:55.419> the<00:04:55.570> things<00:04:55.780> that<00:04:55.990> we<00:04:56.139> do<00:04:56.350> to

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
to look at the things that we do to

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.580 
to look at the things that we do to
interfere<00:04:57.220> with<00:04:57.400> these<00:04:57.490> natural<00:04:57.880> cycles<00:04:58.270> and

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
interfere with these natural cycles and

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.110 
interfere with these natural cycles and
they<00:04:59.590> found<00:04:59.770> four<00:05:00.190> root<00:05:00.430> causes<00:05:00.699> of

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
they found four root causes of

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.659 
they found four root causes of
unsustainability<00:05:01.570> and<00:05:02.560> these<00:05:03.100> are<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:03.370> four

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
unsustainability and these are the four

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.090 
unsustainability and these are the four
things<00:05:03.910> that<00:05:04.510> we<00:05:04.930> need<00:05:05.080> to<00:05:05.229> stop<00:05:05.410> doing<00:05:05.440> to<00:05:05.949> be

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
things that we need to stop doing to be

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.400 
things that we need to stop doing to be
sustainable<00:05:06.720> they<00:05:07.720> are<00:05:07.780> all<00:05:07.990> equally

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
sustainable they are all equally

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.170 
sustainable they are all equally
important<00:05:08.919> they're<00:05:09.310> all<00:05:09.430> necessary<00:05:09.970> and

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
important they're all necessary and

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.740 
important they're all necessary and
sufficient<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:12.250> first<00:05:12.490> one<00:05:12.699> is<00:05:12.910> that<00:05:12.970> we

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
sufficient the first one is that we

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.860 
sufficient the first one is that we
extract<00:05:14.169> large<00:05:14.740> flows<00:05:15.160> of<00:05:15.490> materials<00:05:15.870> from

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
third one is that we physically inhibit

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.779 
third one is that we physically inhibit
nature's<00:05:59.380> ability<00:05:59.889> to<00:06:00.099> run<00:06:00.220> the<00:06:00.280> natural

nature's ability to run the natural
cycle<00:06:01.180> how<00:06:01.960> do<00:06:02.020> we<00:06:02.199> do<00:06:02.349> that<00:06:02.560> well<00:06:03.370> for<00:06:03.669> example

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
cycle how do we do that well for example

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:06.330 
cycle how do we do that well for example
by<00:06:04.330> chopping<00:06:04.720> trees<00:06:04.900> at<00:06:05.349> a<00:06:05.530> faster<00:06:05.889> rate<00:06:06.039> that

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
by chopping trees at a faster rate that
