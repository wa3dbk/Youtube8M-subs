00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
out I'm kind of happy with it Niner up

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.910 
out I'm kind of happy with it Niner up
thanks<00:01:34.980> good<00:01:35.160> enough<00:01:36.590> seems<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> work<00:01:37.830> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
thanks good enough seems to work a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:47.990 
thanks good enough seems to work a
little<00:01:38.010> bit<00:01:38.190> better<00:01:38.370> too<00:01:46.700> I'm<00:01:47.700> slowly

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
little bit better too I'm slowly

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.530 
little bit better too I'm slowly
tightening<00:01:48.480> down<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:49.140> blades<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.640> they<00:01:51.360> are

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
tightening down the blades so they are

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.000 
tightening down the blades so they are
slowly<00:01:51.780> grinding<00:01:52.290> them<00:01:52.440> smoother<00:01:52.860> and

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
slowly grinding them smoother and

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.580 
slowly grinding them smoother and
smoother<00:01:53.370> I<00:01:53.550> think<00:01:54.270> after<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.570> couple<00:01:54.750> times<00:01:55.080> of

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
smoother I think after a couple times of

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.470 
smoother I think after a couple times of
mowing<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.160> yard<00:01:56.190> they're<00:01:56.970> probably<00:01:57.150> a<00:01:57.330> lot

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
mowing the yard they're probably a lot

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.950 
mowing the yard they're probably a lot
better

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
better

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.750 
better
they'll<00:01:58.350> probably<00:01:58.470> catch<00:01:58.980> a<00:01:59.160> lot<00:01:59.310> more<00:01:59.550> of<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
they'll probably catch a lot more of the

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.850 
they'll probably catch a lot more of the
grass<00:02:00.000> cousins<00:02:00.960> right<00:02:01.110> now<00:02:01.290> when<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.530> go<00:02:01.680> over

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
grass cousins right now when I go over

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.350 
grass cousins right now when I go over
the<00:02:01.950> grass<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.160> only<00:02:02.520> catches<00:02:02.970> like<00:02:03.150> maybe

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the grass that only catches like maybe

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.490 
the grass that only catches like maybe
40<00:02:03.840> or<00:02:03.930> 50<00:02:04.170> 40<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.010> 60%<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.540> blades<00:02:07.320> of

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
40 or 50 40 to 60% of the blades of

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.600 
40 or 50 40 to 60% of the blades of
grass<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.770> are<00:02:07.890> standing<00:02:08.160> up<00:02:08.280> there's<00:02:08.520> still

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
grass that are standing up there's still

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.940 
grass that are standing up there's still
some<00:02:08.940> ones<00:02:09.170> still<00:02:10.170> kind<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.470> sticking<00:02:10.830> up<00:02:10.920> so

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
some ones still kind of sticking up so

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.830 
some ones still kind of sticking up so
out<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.220> go<00:02:11.310> over<00:02:11.490> a<00:02:11.520> second<00:02:11.820> time<00:02:12.000> but<00:02:12.570> I<00:02:12.660> think

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
out to go over a second time but I think

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.380 
out to go over a second time but I think
the<00:02:13.100> I'll<00:02:14.100> just<00:02:14.280> keep<00:02:14.430> tightening<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.360> down

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
the I'll just keep tightening it down

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.540 
the I'll just keep tightening it down
letting<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:15.930> wear<00:02:16.080> down<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.290> little<00:02:16.470> bit<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.890> it

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
letting it wear down a little bit and it

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.490 
letting it wear down a little bit and it
should<00:02:17.820> make<00:02:18.090> all<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.780> blades<00:02:18.930> even<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.410> it

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
should make all the blades even so it

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:57.990 
should make all the blades even so it
cuts<00:02:19.740> nicely

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.130 

son<00:02:59.000> conclusion<00:02:59.570> I<00:02:59.630> have<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.810> say<00:02:59.990> I'm<00:03:00.110> pretty

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
son conclusion I have to say I'm pretty

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.130 
son conclusion I have to say I'm pretty
happy<00:03:00.710> with<00:03:00.890> this<00:03:01.100> not<00:03:01.370> bad<00:03:01.580> for<00:03:01.790> $30<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:02.750> like

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
happy with this not bad for $30 and like

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.390 
happy with this not bad for $30 and like
five<00:03:03.350> dollars<00:03:03.710> in<00:03:03.860> paint<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.980> doesn't<00:03:07.280> cut

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
five dollars in paint it doesn't cut

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.700 
five dollars in paint it doesn't cut
perfectly<00:03:07.880> yet<00:03:08.060> but<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.690> think<00:03:08.930> we're<00:03:09.020> just<00:03:09.470> a

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
perfectly yet but I think we're just a

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.960 
perfectly yet but I think we're just a
little<00:03:09.740> more<00:03:10.130> tinkering<00:03:10.340> it<00:03:10.910> should<00:03:11.150> cut<00:03:11.330> fine

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
little more tinkering it should cut fine

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.280 
little more tinkering it should cut fine
already<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.480> paint's<00:03:14.750> are<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:14.930> coming<00:03:15.200> off

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
already the paint's are you coming off

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.690 
already the paint's are you coming off
the<00:03:15.440> blades<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:16.010> that<00:03:16.160> means<00:03:16.310> it's<00:03:16.460> already

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
the blades so that means it's already

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.910 
the blades so that means it's already
touched<00:03:16.940> it's<00:03:17.780> already<00:03:17.990> touching<00:03:18.500> them<00:03:18.740> so

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
touched it's already touching them so

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.360 
touched it's already touching them so
that's<00:03:18.980> good<00:03:23.710> hope<00:03:24.710> enjoy<00:03:24.920> this<00:03:25.040> video<00:03:25.280> and

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
that's good hope enjoy this video and
