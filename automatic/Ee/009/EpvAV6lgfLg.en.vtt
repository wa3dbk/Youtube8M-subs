00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
so I have the kit installed I had a

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.789 
so I have the kit installed I had a
couple<00:00:06.120> issues<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.690> just<00:00:06.870> wanted<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.259> point<00:00:07.680> out

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
couple issues I just wanted to point out

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:08.570 
couple issues I just wanted to point out
real<00:00:08.010> quick

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
real quick

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.820 
real quick
one<00:00:09.330> issue<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.690> was<00:00:10.050> kind<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.950> bummer<00:00:11.190> was

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
one issue that was kind of a bummer was

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.000 
one issue that was kind of a bummer was
well<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:13.950> doesn't<00:00:14.250> clear<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.030> grill<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:16.010> guess

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
well it doesn't clear the grill so guess

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.710 
well it doesn't clear the grill so guess
the<00:00:17.130> Raptor<00:00:17.490> must<00:00:17.670> have<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.180> grill<00:00:18.359> must<00:00:18.510> come

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
the Raptor must have the grill must come

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.970 
the Raptor must have the grill must come
out<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.869> little<00:00:19.080> bit<00:00:19.170> further<00:00:19.439> I've<00:00:19.650> had<00:00:19.859> to

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
out a little bit further I've had to

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.070 
out a little bit further I've had to
remove<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.460> grill<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.789> order<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.119> get<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.359> get

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
remove the grill in order to get it get

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.830 
remove the grill in order to get it get
the<00:00:22.199> hood<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.439> shut<00:00:23.330> so<00:00:24.330> I'll<00:00:24.480> have<00:00:24.660> to

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
the hood to shut so I'll have to

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.900 
the hood to shut so I'll have to
fabricate<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.529> somehow<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.279> don't<00:00:26.580> know<00:00:26.760> what

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
fabricate that somehow I don't know what

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.540 
fabricate that somehow I don't know what
else<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.390> do<00:00:27.570> for<00:00:28.340> for<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.630> since<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
else I can do for for that since the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.530 
else I can do for for that since the
since<00:00:32.550> there's<00:00:32.790> really<00:00:32.969> no<00:00:33.180> way<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.420> going

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
since there's really no way of going

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.380 
since there's really no way of going
behind<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.110> bracket<00:00:34.590> or<00:00:34.940> pry<00:00:35.940> just<00:00:36.149> going<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
behind the bracket or pry just going to

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.080 
behind the bracket or pry just going to
have<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:37.309> Dremel<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> grill<00:00:38.640> out<00:00:38.910> or

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
have to Dremel the grill out or

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.680 
have to Dremel the grill out or
something<00:00:39.510> see<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.320> make<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.620> fit<00:00:41.690> looks

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
something see if I can make it fit looks

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.240 
something see if I can make it fit looks
like<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:42.989> just<00:00:43.079> barely<00:00:43.410> catching<00:00:43.950> so

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
like it's just barely catching so

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.350 
like it's just barely catching so
that'll<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.270> something<00:00:45.510> I'll<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.110> do<00:00:47.360> but

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
that'll be something I'll have to do but

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.639 
that'll be something I'll have to do but
that's<00:00:48.510> not<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.870> biggest<00:00:49.050> issue<00:00:49.260> currently

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
that's not the biggest issue currently

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.139 
that's not the biggest issue currently
currently<00:00:52.649> my<00:00:52.949> biggest<00:00:53.160> issue<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.820> believe

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
currently my biggest issue is I believe

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.380 
currently my biggest issue is I believe
I<00:00:54.989> might<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.410> messed<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.920> those<00:00:56.390> coolant

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
I might have messed up on those coolant

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.939 
I might have messed up on those coolant
lines<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.750> go<00:00:57.899> behind<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.410> supercharger<00:00:59.100> I

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
lines that go behind the supercharger I

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.860 
lines that go behind the supercharger I
know<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:01.980> tighten<00:01:02.430> nipples<00:01:02.850> down<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
know I tighten nipples down on the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.780 
know I tighten nipples down on the
actual<00:01:04.260> intake<00:01:04.830> itself<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.549> now<00:01:05.700> I'm

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
actual intake itself but now I'm

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.550 
actual intake itself but now I'm
wondering<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.270> there<00:01:06.510> was<00:01:06.689> actually<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.200> joint

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
wondering if there was actually a joint

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.310 
wondering if there was actually a joint
on<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.799> hose<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.310> needed<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.729> tighten<00:01:08.970> or<00:01:09.390> if<00:01:10.260> I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
on the hose I needed to tighten or if I

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.530 
on the hose I needed to tighten or if I
need<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.560> use<00:01:10.710> teflon<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:11.490> I'm<00:01:11.909> not<00:01:12.119> sure<00:01:12.299> and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
need to use teflon or I'm not sure and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.830 
need to use teflon or I'm not sure and
it's<00:01:13.290> New<00:01:13.470> Year's<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.979> they're<00:01:14.310> closed<00:01:14.610> so

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
it's New Year's and they're closed so

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.249 
it's New Year's and they're closed so
can't<00:01:15.840> call<00:01:16.110> anyone<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.830> verify<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.150> my<00:01:18.960> next

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
can't call anyone to verify so my next

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.899 
can't call anyone to verify so my next
step<00:01:19.439> will<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.860> remove<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:21.680> supercharger

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
step will be to remove the supercharger

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.359 
step will be to remove the supercharger
then<00:01:23.909> everything<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.360> top<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.369> check

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
then everything on top of it and check

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.710 
then everything on top of it and check
those<00:01:26.490> hoses<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.060> now<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.390> everything<00:01:27.689> is

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
those hoses but now that everything is

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.950 
those hoses but now that everything is
wired<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:28.140> I'll<00:01:28.530> be<00:01:28.680> able<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.920> circulate<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
wired up I'll be able to circulate and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.590 
wired up I'll be able to circulate and
hopefully<00:01:30.960> find<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> issue<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:32.340> did<00:01:33.270> drive<00:01:33.479> it

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
hopefully find the issue I did drive it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.240 
hopefully find the issue I did drive it
down<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.720> street<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.290> moment<00:01:34.590> ago<00:01:34.770> as<00:01:35.009> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
down the street just a moment ago as you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.030 
down the street just a moment ago as you
can<00:01:35.460> see<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> trail<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.299> coolant<00:01:37.259> but<00:01:37.710> one

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
can see the trail of coolant but one

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.460 
can see the trail of coolant but one
around<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.400> block<00:01:39.110> seems<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.229> be<00:01:40.320> running

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
around the block seems to be running

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.109 
around the block seems to be running
fine<00:01:40.619> yesterday<00:01:41.549> was<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> little<00:01:42.000> rough

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
fine yesterday was a little rough

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.999 
fine yesterday was a little rough
running<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.659> think<00:01:43.259> maybe<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.680> everything

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
running I think maybe just everything

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.399 
running I think maybe just everything
calibrating<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.850> maybe<00:01:45.390> Drive<00:01:45.840> cycle<00:01:46.170> or<00:01:46.229> two

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
calibrating and maybe Drive cycle or two

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.230 
calibrating and maybe Drive cycle or two
later<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.860> probably<00:01:47.430> smooth<00:01:47.640> out<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.970> seems<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
later it probably smooth out it seems a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.120 
later it probably smooth out it seems a
lot<00:01:48.360> smoother<00:01:48.750> today<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.680> not<00:01:49.770> as<00:01:49.920> quite<00:01:50.070> as

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
lot smoother today it's not as quite as

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.060 
lot smoother today it's not as quite as
cold<00:01:50.430> today<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.200> it<00:01:52.200> didn't<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.680> choke<00:01:52.920> as

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
cold today so it didn't have to choke as

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.490 
cold today so it didn't have to choke as
much<00:01:53.280> as<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.759> did<00:01:53.880> yesterday<00:01:54.049> so<00:01:55.049> that's<00:01:55.229> where

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
much as it did yesterday so that's where

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.830 
much as it did yesterday so that's where
I'm<00:01:55.619> at<00:01:55.770> I'll<00:01:56.130> stop<00:01:56.490> here<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.000> we'll<00:01:57.659> go<00:01:57.780> to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
I'm at I'll stop here and we'll go to
