and this hole right here I drilled it

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.530 
and this hole right here I drilled it
out<00:00:49.079> makes<00:00:50.079> it<00:00:50.170> sound<00:00:50.320> better<00:00:50.589> and<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:52.120> runs<00:00:52.390> a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
caught and like pushed into the intake

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.180 
caught and like pushed into the intake
that<00:01:06.580> gives<00:01:06.790> it<00:01:06.909> a<00:01:06.970> little<00:01:07.060> bit<00:01:07.240> more<00:01:07.360> top<00:01:07.570> in

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
a little bit too it would take a little

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.350 
a little bit too it would take a little
bit<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:27.880> time<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.330> open<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:28.930> up<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:29.200> try<00:02:29.350> it<00:02:30.360> one

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
bit of time to open it up and try it one

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.910 
bit of time to open it up and try it one
of<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.510> main<00:02:31.690> things<00:02:32.320> that's<00:02:32.500> very<00:02:32.740> helpful

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
of the main things that's very helpful

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.710 
of the main things that's very helpful
with<00:02:33.160> this<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:33.580> its<00:02:33.850> kind<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.090> cold<00:02:34.270> right<00:02:34.540> now

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
with this is its kind of cold right now

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.510 
with this is its kind of cold right now
and<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:35.980> got<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:37.230> 5<00:02:38.230> lbs<00:02:38.680> battery<00:02:39.100> instead<00:02:39.400> of

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
and so I got a 5 lbs battery instead of

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.890 
and so I got a 5 lbs battery instead of
a<00:02:39.580> 4<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:41.320> starts<00:02:42.130> better<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:45.690> seems<00:02:46.690> to

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
a 4 it starts better and it seems to

00:02:46.900 --> 00:03:10.350 
a 4 it starts better and it seems to
work<00:02:47.200> so<00:02:48.240> I'm<00:02:49.240> gonna<00:02:49.420> let<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.630> hear<00:02:49.780> it

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.910 

so<00:03:11.360> as<00:03:11.599> you<00:03:11.720> can<00:03:11.840> see<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:12.170> sounds<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.590> little<00:03:12.680> bit

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
so as you can see it sounds a little bit

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.970 
so as you can see it sounds a little bit
better<00:03:13.069> than<00:03:13.340> like<00:03:13.550> an<00:03:13.700> originally

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
better than like an originally
