this up 50 of those scraps cost me just

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:14.960 
this up 50 of those scraps cost me just
over<00:02:05.520> tangled<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.149> think<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:07.970> 50<00:02:08.970> silver<00:02:13.970> 81

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
over tangled I think so 50 silver 81

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.050 
over tangled I think so 50 silver 81
gold<00:02:15.209> 30<00:02:15.599> i'll<00:02:16.140> just<00:02:16.650> round<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.280> nice<00:02:17.760> and

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
gold 30 i'll just round this nice and

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.979 
gold 30 i'll just round this nice and
