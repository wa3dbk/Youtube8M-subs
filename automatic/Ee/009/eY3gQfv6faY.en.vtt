 professionals there is when studies of 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.940
 mechanics I liked a lot when I 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.880
 I found enough capacity 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.850
 creativity that I've always liked 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.630
 Appendix and mount them is one the 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.910
 little ones 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.970
 and there is the small factory and now 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.709
 They have their moment operators and a 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.390

 most difficult of these companies not of 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.010
 create them but simply keep them 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.110
 now that it is a very competitive field of 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.040
 face an international market of each
