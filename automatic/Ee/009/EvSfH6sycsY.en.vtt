this here for a for one week and I loved

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.440 
this here for a for one week and I loved
it<00:00:34.350> initially<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:35.040> thought<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.850> has<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.360> be

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
it initially I thought it has to be

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.930 
it initially I thought it has to be
bigger<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.530> realize<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.250> could<00:00:38.430> fluff<00:00:38.760> it

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
bigger but I realize you could fluff it

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.780 
bigger but I realize you could fluff it
out<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.690> don't<00:00:40.260> usually<00:00:40.379> do<00:00:40.710> stuff<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:41.160> my<00:00:41.280> hair

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
out I don't usually do stuff to my hair

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.880 
out I don't usually do stuff to my hair
I<00:00:43.550> don't<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:44.610> doing<00:00:44.879> stuff<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:46.710> word

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
I don't like doing stuff like the word

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.950 
I don't like doing stuff like the word
here<00:00:47.340> comes<00:00:47.640> that's<00:00:47.969> how<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.210> stays<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.780> me

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
here comes that's how it stays for me

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.700 
here comes that's how it stays for me
and<00:00:49.309> Charlie<00:00:50.309> but<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.700> think<00:00:51.079> for<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.140> synthetic

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
and Charlie but I think for a synthetic

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.790 
and Charlie but I think for a synthetic
hear<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.850> experience<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.780> little<00:00:54.899> nothing<00:00:55.530> in

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
hear it experience a little nothing in

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.020 
hear it experience a little nothing in
the<00:00:55.890> back<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:57.420> can<00:00:57.719> tell<00:00:58.520> like<00:00:59.520> running<00:00:59.910> my

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the back as you can tell like running my

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.880 
the back as you can tell like running my
fingers<00:01:00.420> through<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.620> little<00:01:01.739> bit

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
fingers through it it's a little bit

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.039 
fingers through it it's a little bit
harder<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.640> when<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.000> comes<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.329> nothing

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
harder and when it comes with nothing

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.710 
harder and when it comes with nothing
you<00:01:05.010> probably<00:01:05.220> lose<00:01:05.489> some<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.000> curls<00:01:06.360> but

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
you probably lose some of the curls but

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.270 
you probably lose some of the curls but
i<00:01:06.990> think<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> hair<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.430> fine<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.299> far<00:01:10.280> there's

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
i think the hair is fine so far there's

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.690 
i think the hair is fine so far there's
the<00:01:11.520> hairline<00:01:12.060> um<00:01:12.570> i<00:01:12.990> usually<00:01:13.920> wear<00:01:14.100> mine<00:01:14.369> out

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the hairline um i usually wear mine out

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.630 
the hairline um i usually wear mine out
a<00:01:14.760> little<00:01:15.060> bit<00:01:15.270> more<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:17.189> don't<00:01:17.430> see

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
a little bit more so you don't see

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.770 
a little bit more so you don't see
really<00:01:17.880> where<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.210> starts<00:01:20.240> there's<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.450> side

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
really where it starts there's the side

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.910 
really where it starts there's the side
I<00:01:22.970> don't<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.330> don't<00:01:24.600> pace<00:01:24.930> my<00:01:25.229> wing<00:01:25.530> stone

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.670 
I don't you I don't pace my wing stone
so<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:30.240> might<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.780> little<00:01:30.990> different<00:01:31.290> for

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
so it might be a little different for

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.890 
so it might be a little different for
you<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:33.680> there's<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.799> hairline<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:36.090> think

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.470 
now this is this is okay um I haven't
partied<00:02:40.379> it<00:02:40.530> or<00:02:40.739> anything<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:42.330> know<00:02:42.360> I

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
partied it or anything you know I

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.750 
partied it or anything you know I
haven't<00:02:42.750> tried<00:02:43.140> parting<00:02:43.709> it<00:02:43.799> or<00:02:43.950> anything<00:02:44.280> um

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
haven't tried parting it or anything um

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.240 
haven't tried parting it or anything um
yet<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:48.030> that's<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:51.810> aspect<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.799> amino

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
yet but that's the the aspect the amino

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.630 
yet but that's the the aspect the amino
fire<00:02:53.640> could<00:02:53.880> get<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.180> part<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:56.400> think

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
fire could get the part and I think

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.869 
fire could get the part and I think
