00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:19.830 

do<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.550> for<00:01:11.580> these<00:01:12.000> now

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.940 

there<00:01:20.409> we<00:01:20.530> go<00:01:20.650> I<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:22.240> break<00:01:22.570> that<00:01:25.740> alright<00:01:26.740> so

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
there we go I just break that alright so

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.630 
there we go I just break that alright so
now<00:01:27.100> you<00:01:27.130> can<00:01:27.400> put<00:01:27.780> energy<00:01:28.780> collectors<00:01:29.530> on<00:01:29.890> the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
now you can put energy collectors on the

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.630 
now you can put energy collectors on the
in<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.600> creases<00:01:32.110> here<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:33.220> for<00:01:33.400> higher

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
in the creases here just for higher

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.290 
in the creases here just for higher
speeds<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:34.659> you<00:01:34.900> can<00:01:35.020> use<00:01:35.140> any<00:01:35.380> mark<00:01:36.009> of

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
speeds and you can use any mark of

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.030 
speeds and you can use any mark of
energy<00:01:37.300> collectors<00:01:37.720> it<00:01:38.200> doesn't<00:01:38.470> matter<00:01:38.680> it's

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
energy collectors it doesn't matter it's

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.100 
energy collectors it doesn't matter it's
just<00:01:39.159> the<00:01:39.880> higher<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.300> mark<00:01:40.540> of<00:01:40.750> energy

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
just the higher the mark of energy

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.139 
just the higher the mark of energy
collector<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.649> better<00:01:41.860> it'll<00:01:42.100> be<00:01:42.340> and<00:01:42.640> the

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
collector the better it'll be and the

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:44.789 
collector the better it'll be and the
faster<00:01:43.570> that<00:01:43.690> you'll<00:01:43.810> be<00:01:43.960> able<00:01:44.049> to<00:01:44.200> faster

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
faster that you'll be able to faster

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:45.690 
faster that you'll be able to faster
you'll<00:01:44.890> be<00:01:44.979> able<00:01:45.040> to<00:01:45.159> make<00:01:45.280> your<00:01:45.399> diamonds

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
you'll be able to make your diamonds

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.630 
you'll be able to make your diamonds
basically<00:01:46.440> so<00:01:47.440> what<00:01:48.250> this<00:01:48.399> is<00:01:48.490> basically

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
basically so what this is basically

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.870 
basically so what this is basically
doing<00:01:48.940> is<00:01:49.240> light<00:01:50.140> is<00:01:50.380> being<00:01:50.590> fed<00:01:50.950> into<00:01:50.979> the

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
doing is light is being fed into the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.730 
doing is light is being fed into the
energy<00:01:52.630> collectors<00:01:53.110> I'll<00:01:53.410> show<00:01:53.530> you<00:01:53.619> how<00:01:53.679> to

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
energy collectors I'll show you how to

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.160 
energy collectors I'll show you how to
set<00:01:54.399> up<00:01:54.429> the<00:01:54.580> lights<00:01:54.789> in<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.970> second<00:01:55.390> they'll<00:01:56.050> be

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
set up the lights in a second they'll be

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.020 
set up the lights in a second they'll be
fed<00:01:56.350> into<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.590> energy<00:01:56.920> collectors<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.700> then

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
fed into the energy collectors and then

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.480 
fed into the energy collectors and then
it<00:01:58.659> will<00:01:58.990> be<00:01:59.080> into<00:01:59.649> it'll<00:01:59.979> be<00:02:00.100> transferred

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
it will be into it'll be transferred

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.669 
it will be into it'll be transferred
into<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.759> antimatter<00:02:01.300> relay<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:02.200> then<00:02:02.530> at

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
into the antimatter relay and then at

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.080 
into the antimatter relay and then at
the<00:02:02.770> end<00:02:02.800> it'll<00:02:03.130> be<00:02:03.220> transferred<00:02:03.640> into<00:02:03.940> this

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
the end it'll be transferred into this

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.240 
the end it'll be transferred into this
energy<00:02:04.929> condenser<00:02:05.560> which<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:05.860> will<00:02:06.009> place

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:30.780 
now um if you can't find it just get a
diamond<00:02:23.350> so<00:02:24.250> ya<00:02:25.950> get<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:26.980> diamond<00:02:29.430> get<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.610> out

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
diamond so ya get a diamond get that out

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.110 
diamond so ya get a diamond get that out
of<00:02:30.820> there<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:32.579> place<00:02:33.579> it<00:02:33.760> in<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:33.970> little

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
of there and place it in the little

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.840 
of there and place it in the little
target<00:02:34.690> market<00:02:35.049> a<00:02:35.110> top<00:02:35.350> left<00:02:35.620> corner<00:02:35.980> and

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
target market a top left corner and

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.190 
target market a top left corner and
you'll<00:02:36.970> see<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.239> this<00:02:37.390> bar<00:02:37.690> is<00:02:37.959> already

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
you'll see that this bar is already

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.960 
you'll see that this bar is already
filling<00:02:38.709> up<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.070> it's<00:02:39.250> throwing<00:02:39.400> up<00:02:39.610> pretty

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
filling up and it's throwing up pretty

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.680 
filling up and it's throwing up pretty
fast

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
fast

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.830 
fast
that's<00:02:41.290> because<00:02:41.650> we<00:02:42.160> have<00:02:42.370> these<00:02:42.760> nice<00:02:43.239> we

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
that's because we have these nice we

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.630 
that's because we have these nice we
have<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.959> nice<00:02:44.140> setup<00:02:44.380> going<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.280> once<00:02:45.579> this

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
have a nice setup going and once this

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.400 
have a nice setup going and once this
bar<00:02:45.880> gets<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.269> end<00:02:46.450> you'll<00:02:46.930> have<00:02:47.110> one

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
bar gets to the end you'll have one

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.500 
bar gets to the end you'll have one
diamond<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.920> this<00:02:48.400> diamond<00:02:48.579> will<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.060> will

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
diamond and this diamond will the will

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.680 
diamond and this diamond will the will
remain<00:02:49.900> untouched<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:51.370> let's<00:02:52.150> continue<00:02:52.329> to

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
remain untouched so let's continue to

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.069 
remain untouched so let's continue to
make<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:53.049> final<00:02:53.859> final<00:02:54.519> um<00:02:54.780> energy<00:02:55.780> collector

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
make it final final um energy collector

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.900 
make it final final um energy collector
need<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.290> put<00:02:56.440> right<00:02:56.739> here<00:02:57.010> so<00:02:57.640> I'm<00:02:57.700> just<00:02:57.820> gonna

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
need to put right here so I'm just gonna

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.160 
need to put right here so I'm just gonna
quickly<00:02:58.840> break<00:02:59.260> these<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.810> can<00:03:01.959> do<00:03:02.049> this

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
quickly break these you can do this

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.630 
quickly break these you can do this
another<00:03:02.440> way<00:03:02.739> if<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:02.950> really<00:03:03.130> wanted<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.400> but

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
another way if you really wanted to but

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.370 
another way if you really wanted to but
you<00:03:04.209> put<00:03:04.359> an<00:03:04.450> energy<00:03:04.570> collector<00:03:04.989> on<00:03:05.109> top<00:03:07.380> this

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
you put an energy collector on top this

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.080 
you put an energy collector on top this
is<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.650> most<00:03:08.859> efficient<00:03:09.489> way<00:03:09.609> to<00:03:09.640> do<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:10.000> at

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
is the most efficient way to do it at

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:19.770 
is the most efficient way to do it at
least<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:13.320> put<00:03:14.320> one<00:03:14.500> here<00:03:17.070> alright<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:19.630> it's

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
least and put one here alright so it's

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.830 
least and put one here alright so it's
like<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:20.079> and<00:03:20.410> then<00:03:20.709> now<00:03:21.010> next<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.239> in<00:03:22.450> on<00:03:22.570> top

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
like that and then now next to in on top

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.180 
like that and then now next to in on top
of<00:03:22.870> each<00:03:23.200> energy<00:03:23.590> collector<00:03:23.950> you're<00:03:24.070> gonna

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
of each energy collector you're gonna

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:53.080 
of each energy collector you're gonna
place<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.400> piece<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.120> glowstone<00:03:26.879> like

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:02.450 

just<00:03:54.090> like<00:03:57.320> and<00:03:58.320> then<00:03:59.040> right<00:03:59.400> here<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:01.460> then

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
just like and then right here and then

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.270 
just like and then right here and then
right<00:04:02.700> here<00:04:02.730> finally<00:04:03.360> oh<00:04:03.890> sorry<00:04:04.890> we<00:04:05.070> missed

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
right here finally oh sorry we missed

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.680 
right here finally oh sorry we missed
one<00:04:07.700> alright<00:04:08.700> so<00:04:08.850> there<00:04:09.000> we<00:04:09.030> go<00:04:09.210> that's<00:04:09.540> the

one alright so there we go that's the

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.530 
one alright so there we go that's the
perfect<00:04:10.170> way<00:04:10.470> condensed<00:04:11.540> perfectly

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
perfect way condensed perfectly

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
to make a way to dig underneath

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.580 
to make a way to dig underneath
someone's<00:04:21.030> gonna<00:04:21.120> build<00:04:21.390> a<00:04:21.690> clique<00:04:22.080> staircase

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
someone's gonna build a clique staircase

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.640 
someone's gonna build a clique staircase
that<00:04:22.860> goes<00:04:23.070> down<00:04:23.430> underneath<00:04:24.000> all<00:04:24.330> of<00:04:24.450> this

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
that goes down underneath all of this

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.330 
that goes down underneath all of this
and<00:04:25.910> figure<00:04:26.910> out<00:04:26.970> where<00:04:27.360> your<00:04:28.340> energy

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
and figure out where your energy

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.420 
and figure out where your energy
condenser<00:04:30.120> is<00:04:33.560> right<00:04:34.560> there<00:04:34.800> that's<00:04:35.190> sorry

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
condenser is right there that's sorry

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.000 
condenser is right there that's sorry
that's<00:04:35.640> a<00:04:35.730> relay<00:04:36.230> energy<00:04:37.230> condenser<00:04:37.710> should

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
that's a relay energy condenser should

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.330 
that's a relay energy condenser should
be<00:04:38.160> right<00:04:38.610> there<00:04:39.620> so<00:04:40.620> let's<00:04:41.010> just<00:04:41.070> replace

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
be right there so let's just replace

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.650 
be right there so let's just replace
these<00:04:41.790> salt<00:04:42.600> blocks<00:04:42.900> I<00:04:44.180> think<00:04:45.180> a<00:04:45.240> little

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
these salt blocks I think a little

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.060 
these salt blocks I think a little
neater<00:04:46.280> there<00:04:47.280> we<00:04:47.370> go<00:04:47.490> oh<00:04:48.140> crap<00:04:49.170> how<00:04:49.650> did<00:04:49.830> I<00:04:49.890> do

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
neater there we go oh crap how did I do

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.200 
neater there we go oh crap how did I do
there<00:04:50.850> we<00:04:50.970> go<00:04:51.440> so<00:04:52.440> now<00:04:52.640> see<00:04:53.640> look<00:04:53.790> my<00:04:53.910> diamond

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
there we go so now see look my diamond

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.090 
there we go so now see look my diamond
is<00:04:54.300> already<00:04:54.600> made<00:04:54.810> so<00:04:55.290> that<00:04:55.380> was<00:04:55.470> really<00:04:55.770> fast

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
is already made so that was really fast

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.190 
is already made so that was really fast
and<00:04:56.460> just<00:04:56.820> the<00:04:57.030> length<00:04:57.180> is<00:04:57.330> video<00:04:57.600> area<00:04:57.930> of<00:04:58.020> one

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
and just the length is video area of one

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.650 
and just the length is video area of one
diamond<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:58.850> this<00:04:59.850> thing<00:05:00.000> will<00:05:00.120> continue<00:05:00.540> to

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
diamond and this thing will continue to

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.600 
diamond and this thing will continue to
make<00:05:00.810> diamonds<00:05:00.960> forever<00:05:01.620> and<00:05:01.980> ever<00:05:02.220> and<00:05:02.490> ever

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
make diamonds forever and ever and ever

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.780 
make diamonds forever and ever and ever
and<00:05:03.060> ever<00:05:03.690> you<00:05:04.590> can<00:05:04.680> do<00:05:04.800> this<00:05:04.920> inside<00:05:05.160> servers

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
and ever you can do this inside servers

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.220 
and ever you can do this inside servers
that's<00:05:06.300> actually<00:05:06.630> where<00:05:06.750> I<00:05:06.780> originally

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
that's actually where I originally

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.350 
that's actually where I originally
tested<00:05:07.410> it<00:05:07.710> units<00:05:08.520> inside<00:05:08.700> servers<00:05:09.120> you<00:05:09.240> can

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
tested it units inside servers you can

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.020 
tested it units inside servers you can
do<00:05:09.510> this<00:05:09.630> inside<00:05:09.960> your<00:05:10.380> client<00:05:11.010> all<00:05:11.670> you<00:05:11.850> need

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
do this inside your client all you need

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.880
