application just have a look at this
here<00:00:15.030> we<00:00:15.179> go<00:00:16.670> right<00:00:17.670> we're<00:00:17.789> just<00:00:17.970> recapping

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
here we go right we're just recapping

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.750 
here we go right we're just recapping
what<00:00:18.570> i<00:00:18.990> did<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.560> last<00:00:19.710> video<00:00:19.980> there's<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
what i did in the last video there's the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.220 
what i did in the last video there's the
storyboard<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:22.519> it<00:00:23.519> makes<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.330> which<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.199> a

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
storyboard and it makes this which is a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.679 
storyboard and it makes this which is a
sort<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.859> table<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.550> cells<00:00:26.820> section<00:00:27.359> cells

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
sort of a table with cells section cells

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.049 
sort of a table with cells section cells
so<00:00:28.590> that's<00:00:28.769> cherries<00:00:30.080> apples<00:00:31.850> okay<00:00:32.850> that's

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
so that's cherries apples okay that's

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.160 
so that's cherries apples okay that's
what<00:00:33.210> we<00:00:33.300> did<00:00:33.450> now<00:00:33.980> make<00:00:34.980> taking<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.520> further

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
what we did now make taking this further

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.040 
what we did now make taking this further
let's<00:00:37.170> take<00:00:37.440> all<00:00:37.710> our<00:00:37.739> hard<00:00:38.160> work<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.840> blew<00:00:39.840> it

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
let's take all our hard work and blew it

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.069 
let's take all our hard work and blew it
and<00:00:42.020> press<00:00:43.020> ctrl<00:00:43.290> command<00:00:44.100> D<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.840> makes

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
and press ctrl command D and that makes

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.130 
and press ctrl command D and that makes
a<00:00:46.230> copy<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:47.059> see<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.510> let's<00:00:48.719> we<00:00:48.989> can

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
a copy of it see that so let's we can

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.000 
a copy of it see that so let's we can
store<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.680> somewhere<00:00:50.129> else<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:51.829> let's<00:00:52.829> do

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
store that somewhere else and let's do

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.939 
store that somewhere else and let's do
another<00:00:53.100> one<00:00:53.930> what<00:00:54.930> we're<00:00:55.140> about<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.620> come<00:00:55.829> on

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
another one what we're about it come on

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.819 
another one what we're about it come on
d<00:00:57.289> and<00:00:58.289> let's<00:00:58.649> store<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.219> somewhere<00:00:59.640> else

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
d and let's store that somewhere else

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.850 
d and let's store that somewhere else
now<00:01:01.829> we<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.640> actually<00:01:03.270> connect<00:01:04.140> drill<00:01:04.500> down

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
now we can actually connect drill down

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.090 
now we can actually connect drill down
on<00:01:05.159> these<00:01:05.570> so<00:01:06.570> let's<00:01:06.750> take<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.049> lemon<00:01:07.619> away

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
on these so let's take the lemon away

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.700 
on these so let's take the lemon away
and<00:01:08.869> add<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.520> one<00:01:12.000> here<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.409> know<00:01:13.560> it's

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
and add the this one here so I know it's

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.370 
and add the this one here so I know it's
a<00:01:13.770> duplicate<00:01:14.400> but<00:01:15.090> let's<00:01:15.330> instead<00:01:16.229> of

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
a duplicate but let's instead of

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.560 
a duplicate but let's instead of
bringing<00:01:16.560> up<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.950> picture<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.310> lemon<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.970> going

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
bringing up a picture a lemon is going

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.660 
bringing up a picture a lemon is going
to<00:01:18.659> bring<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.290> another<00:01:21.470> table<00:01:22.470> cell<00:01:23.189> which

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
to bring up another table cell which

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.789 
to bring up another table cell which
will<00:01:24.090> change<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.110> let's<00:01:25.290> have<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> look<00:01:25.680> at<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
will change so let's have a look at the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.880 
will change so let's have a look at the
lemons<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.700> expanded<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.600> bit<00:01:27.890> now

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
lemons it's just expanded a bit now

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.490 
lemons it's just expanded a bit now
click<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.759> cell<00:01:30.150> whoop<00:01:30.570> sets<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.020> label

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
click on that cell whoop sets the label

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.770 
click on that cell whoop sets the label
let's<00:01:31.950> get<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> cell<00:01:32.720> should<00:01:33.720> go<00:01:33.930> blue<00:01:35.780> there

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
let's get the cell should go blue there

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.530 
let's get the cell should go blue there
it<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:36.900> Scott<00:01:37.439> blue<00:01:37.650> press<00:01:38.520> command<00:01:38.939> control

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
it is Scott blue press command control

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.999 
it is Scott blue press command control
rather<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:41.250> blue<00:01:42.150> line<00:01:42.420> anywhere<00:01:43.079> up<00:01:43.380> up<00:01:43.799> or

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
rather and a blue line anywhere up up or

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.580 
rather and a blue line anywhere up up or
down<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.520> one<00:01:44.820> here<00:01:45.270> take<00:01:46.200> your<00:01:46.259> finger

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
down in this one here take your finger

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.660 
down in this one here take your finger
off<00:01:46.619> due<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.460> push<00:01:48.710> now<00:01:49.710> let's<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> effect

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
off due to push now let's see the effect

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.340 
off due to push now let's see the effect
of<00:01:50.820> that

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.469 

brings<00:01:55.350> up<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.890> simulator<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.149> we<00:01:57.270> got<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
brings up in the simulator so we got the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.780 
brings up in the simulator so we got the
cherries<00:01:57.869> back<00:01:58.290> but<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> one<00:01:59.100> we<00:01:59.220> changed<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
cherries back but the one we changed the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.120 
cherries back but the one we changed the
lemons<00:02:00.180> now<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.320> see<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.590> goes<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:02.009> it

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
lemons now you can see it goes to it

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.249 
lemons now you can see it goes to it
looks<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> same<00:02:03.149> thing<00:02:03.570> but

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
looks like it's the same thing but

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.550 
looks like it's the same thing but
actually<00:02:04.729> it's<00:02:05.729> not<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.090> same<00:02:06.299> thing<00:02:06.560> it's

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
actually it's not the same thing it's

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.110 
actually it's not the same thing it's
the<00:02:07.829> new<00:02:08.099> one<00:02:08.340> over<00:02:08.819> here<00:02:10.099> so<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.370> think<00:02:11.730> some<00:02:12.090> of

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
the new one over here so I think some of

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.720 
the new one over here so I think some of
you<00:02:12.480> might<00:02:12.959> see<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.709> we<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:14.040> change<00:02:14.370> all

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
you might see that we can change all

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.900 
you might see that we can change all
this<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.420> have<00:02:16.019> a<00:02:16.050> really<00:02:16.530> good<00:02:16.709> drill<00:02:17.340> drill

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
this and have a really good drill drill

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.520 
this and have a really good drill drill
down<00:02:18.239> type<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.110> application<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:21.470> okay<00:02:22.470> so

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
down type of application here okay so

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.270 
down type of application here okay so
let's<00:02:23.040> take<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.819> one<00:02:23.940> step<00:02:24.000> further<00:02:24.980> now<00:02:25.980> it's

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
let's take it one step further now it's

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.309 
let's take it one step further now it's
not<00:02:26.549> going<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.880> go<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.090> lemon<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:27.750> let's<00:02:27.989> remove

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
not going to go to lemon so let's remove
