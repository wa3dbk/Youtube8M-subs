 which broke it was Hyundai and here in 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.930
 In general, the service hyundai 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.620
 they gave us a car that is not 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.920

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.990

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.790
 there was some chevrolet i'm honest 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.549
 I don’t even know which one it doesn’t matter because 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.290
 we waited they wanted them or here we are 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.990
 so did not want and we just took 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:26.689
 This car has given us this car. 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:31.250

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:34.280

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.140
 You know, the dormouse has told me so 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.509
 I like it so much 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.630
 ordinary of course yes absolutely 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.289
 ordinary car but the fact that 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.640
 very comfortable and for free of course 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.420
 very nothing 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.079
 that's how it looks inside inside 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:58.009
 Sea its own kicks because 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:00.710
 a lot of space it is of course absolutely 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.719
 basic nervous equipment look 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.460
 that they did not even build it 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:10.030
 this one here you 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:12.100
 by plug general here's such a car 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.530

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.640

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:25.319

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.319
 car basically speaking now 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.670
 I honestly do not know how much 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:36.790
 it is generally worth the time houses if you take 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.170
 so here we are for free so 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.110

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.830
