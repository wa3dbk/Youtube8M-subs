00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.240 
hi this is Michelle Mishka welcome back
we've<00:00:03.480> talked<00:00:03.840> about<00:00:03.990> DNA<00:00:04.500> that<00:00:04.650> represents<00:00:05.190> a

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
we've talked about DNA that represents a

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.460 
we've talked about DNA that represents a
gene<00:00:05.490> today<00:00:06.270> we're<00:00:06.509> going<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.690> talk<00:00:06.930> about<00:00:07.200> two

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
gene today we're going to talk about two

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.790 
gene today we're going to talk about two

we've<00:00:14.670> talked<00:00:14.969> about<00:00:15.120> both<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.480> these

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
we've talked about both of these

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.050 
we've talked about both of these
sequences<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.440> lecture<00:00:16.830> but<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.609> want<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.910> tell

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
sequences in lecture but I want to tell

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
you a little more about both today why

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.250 
you a little more about both today why

we can answer our original question take

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.209 
we can answer our original question take
a<00:00:51.809> moment<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.379> think<00:00:52.649> about<00:00:52.710> what<00:00:52.890> would

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
a moment and think about what would

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.520 
a moment and think about what would
allow<00:00:53.430> protein<00:00:53.910> binding<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> origin<00:00:55.079> but

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
allow protein binding to the origin but

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.270 
allow protein binding to the origin but
not<00:00:55.829> other<00:00:56.100> DNA<00:00:56.489> sequences<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:02.100> about

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
not other DNA sequences to think about

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.950 
not other DNA sequences to think about
this<00:01:02.489> question<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.359> need<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.539> think<00:01:03.840> about

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
this question you need to think about

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.200 
this question you need to think about
what<00:01:04.260> makes<00:01:04.470> one<00:01:04.949> region<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.369> DNA<00:01:05.760> different

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
what makes one region of DNA different

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.050 
what makes one region of DNA different
from<00:01:06.360> another<00:01:07.250> DNA<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.369> simply<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> collection

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
from another DNA is simply a collection

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.630 
from another DNA is simply a collection
of<00:01:09.360> nucleotides<00:01:09.960> a's<00:01:10.320> t's<00:01:10.799> c's<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.400> g's

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
of nucleotides a's t's c's and g's

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.780 
of nucleotides a's t's c's and g's
that's<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.960> that's<00:01:13.170> all<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.640> these

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
that's it that's all there is so these

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.300 
that's it that's all there is so these
proteins<00:01:15.150> must<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:15.869> binding<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.650> specific

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
proteins must be binding to the specific

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.749 
proteins must be binding to the specific
sequence<00:01:17.520> found<00:01:18.150> at<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> origin<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.700> how<00:01:20.700> do

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
sequence found at the origin so how do

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.539 
sequence found at the origin so how do
these<00:01:21.000> ideas<00:01:21.210> relate<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> promoter<00:01:22.549> well

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
these ideas relate to a promoter well

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.910 
these ideas relate to a promoter well
like<00:01:23.970> an<00:01:24.150> origin<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.720> promoter<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.290> specific

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
like an origin a promoter is a specific

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.980 
like an origin a promoter is a specific
double-stranded<00:01:26.520> DNA<00:01:26.670> sequence<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.479> what

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
double-stranded DNA sequence and what

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.350 
double-stranded DNA sequence and what
binds<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> promoter<00:01:29.000> you're<00:01:30.000> right

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
binds to the promoter you're right

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.120 
binds to the promoter you're right
RNA<00:01:30.689> polymerase<00:01:30.900> finds<00:01:31.320> their<00:01:31.560> promoter<00:01:31.890> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
RNA polymerase finds their promoter and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.490 
RNA polymerase finds their promoter and
initiates<00:01:33.090> transcription<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:34.049> produce<00:01:34.200> an

initiates transcription to produce an

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.940 
initiates transcription to produce an
RNA<00:01:35.270> but<00:01:36.270> why<00:01:36.509> does<00:01:36.750> RNA<00:01:37.079> polymerase<00:01:37.439> bind<00:01:37.799> to

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
RNA but why does RNA polymerase bind to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.490 
RNA but why does RNA polymerase bind to
the<00:01:38.070> promoter<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.700> not<00:01:39.119> other<00:01:39.390> DNA<00:01:39.840> sequences

found at this site now I have another
question<00:01:49.220> do<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.340> think<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.939> DNA<00:01:51.329> that

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
question do you think that the DNA that

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.569 
question do you think that the DNA that
serves<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> promoter<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.920> human<00:01:53.340> cell

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
serves as a promoter in a human cell

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.490 
serves as a promoter in a human cell
would<00:01:54.149> also<00:01:54.479> work<00:01:54.659> as<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> promoter<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:55.409> a

would also work as a promoter in a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.160 
would also work as a promoter in a

bacterial cell stop for a moment and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.679 
bacterial cell stop for a moment and
answer<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.649> question<00:01:59.180> this<00:02:00.180> was<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> hard

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
answer this question this was a hard

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.810 
answer this question this was a hard
question<00:02:00.960> but<00:02:01.710> if<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:01.979> had<00:02:02.130> told<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
question but if I had told you that the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.639 
question but if I had told you that the
two<00:02:03.000> polar<00:02:03.270> races<00:02:03.479> were<00:02:03.840> different<00:02:04.320> from<00:02:04.439> each

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
two polar races were different from each

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.530 
two polar races were different from each
other<00:02:04.920> meaning<00:02:05.610> they<00:02:05.850> had<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> different

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
other meaning they had a different

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.630 
other meaning they had a different
overall<00:02:06.899> structure<00:02:07.380> could<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.369> answer<00:02:08.489> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
overall structure could you answer the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.110 
overall structure could you answer the
question<00:02:09.440> sure<00:02:10.440> if<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.280> proteins<00:02:11.940> are

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
question sure if the proteins are

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.230 
question sure if the proteins are
different<00:02:12.540> then<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.440> would<00:02:13.560> expect<00:02:13.950> the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
different then you would expect the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.910 
different then you would expect the
ignition<00:02:14.540> sequences<00:02:15.260> would<00:02:15.410> also<00:02:15.620> be

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
ignition sequences would also be

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.670 
ignition sequences would also be
different<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.520> this<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.330> case<00:02:17.680> this

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
different and this is the case this

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.110 
different and this is the case this
information<00:02:19.250> is<00:02:19.370> important<00:02:19.790> when<00:02:19.970> we

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
information is important when we

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.290 
information is important when we
consider<00:02:20.150> vectors<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.110> cloning<00:02:22.000> now<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.030> want

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
consider vectors and cloning now I want

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.970 
consider vectors and cloning now I want
to<00:02:23.390> take<00:02:23.540> this<00:02:23.660> idea<00:02:23.870> one<00:02:24.230> step<00:02:24.470> further<00:02:24.680> and

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
to take this idea one step further and

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.640 
to take this idea one step further and
ask<00:02:25.130> you<00:02:25.340> this.what<00:02:25.900> any<00:02:26.900> given<00:02:27.230> cell<00:02:27.470> have

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
ask you this.what any given cell have

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.700 
ask you this.what any given cell have
more<00:02:27.860> than<00:02:27.950> one<00:02:28.070> promoter<00:02:28.430> if<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:29.840> does<00:02:30.080> with

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
more than one promoter if it does with

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.440 
more than one promoter if it does with
the<00:02:30.860> sequence<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.430> every<00:02:31.760> promoter<00:02:32.060> be<00:02:32.300> the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
the sequence of every promoter be the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.650 
the sequence of every promoter be the
same<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:34.670> should<00:02:34.910> know<00:02:35.060> there<00:02:35.270> would<00:02:35.390> be<00:02:35.420> more

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
same you should know there would be more

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.300 
same you should know there would be more
than<00:02:35.720> one<00:02:35.990> promoter<00:02:36.350> because<00:02:36.950> there's<00:02:37.250> a

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
than one promoter because there's a

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.680 
than one promoter because there's a
promoter<00:02:37.730> associated<00:02:38.390> with<00:02:38.510> every

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
promoter associated with every

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.290 
promoter associated with every
transcript<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:40.400> should<00:02:40.610> also<00:02:40.910> recognize

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
transcript you should also recognize

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.410 
transcript you should also recognize
that<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.470> don't<00:02:42.860> want<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.220> transcribe<00:02:43.760> all<00:02:44.000> of

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
that you don't want to transcribe all of

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.860 
that you don't want to transcribe all of
the<00:02:44.540> genes<00:02:44.840> all<00:02:45.140> of<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.590> time<00:02:46.210> so<00:02:47.210> how<00:02:47.480> can<00:02:47.540> you

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
the genes all of the time so how can you

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.910 
the genes all of the time so how can you
apply<00:02:48.140> what<00:02:48.380> you've<00:02:48.500> learned<00:02:48.590> about

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
apply what you've learned about

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.800 
apply what you've learned about
promoters<00:02:49.580> to<00:02:50.410> regulating<00:02:51.410> transcription<00:02:52.810> we

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
promoters to regulating transcription we

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.510 
promoters to regulating transcription we
can<00:02:53.990> look<00:02:54.170> at<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.320> bacterial<00:02:54.830> promoter<00:02:54.950> as<00:02:55.340> an

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
can look at a bacterial promoter as an

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.300 
can look at a bacterial promoter as an
example<00:02:55.880> in<00:02:56.180> this<00:02:57.110> case<00:02:57.380> there<00:02:57.710> is<00:02:57.740> an<00:02:57.920> ideal

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
example in this case there is an ideal

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.460 
example in this case there is an ideal
sequence<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:59.090> sequence<00:02:59.540> that<00:02:59.870> RNA<00:03:00.170> polymerase

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
sequence a sequence that RNA polymerase

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.190 
sequence a sequence that RNA polymerase
binds<00:03:00.770> to<00:03:00.980> very<00:03:01.310> well<00:03:01.550> from<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:02.630> promoter<00:03:03.020> we

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
binds to very well from this promoter we

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.280 
binds to very well from this promoter we
get<00:03:03.350> lots<00:03:03.560> of<00:03:03.770> transcription<00:03:04.400> of<00:03:04.490> this<00:03:04.640> gene

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
get lots of transcription of this gene

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.530 
get lots of transcription of this gene
if<00:03:06.290> however<00:03:06.740> we<00:03:07.070> change<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.610> sequence<00:03:07.790> just<00:03:08.330> a

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
if however we change the sequence just a

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.020 
if however we change the sequence just a
little<00:03:08.810> RNA<00:03:09.620> polymerase<00:03:10.010> is<00:03:10.220> less<00:03:10.610> likely<00:03:11.000> to

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
little RNA polymerase is less likely to

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.030 
little RNA polymerase is less likely to
bind<00:03:11.360> which<00:03:12.080> means<00:03:12.320> we<00:03:12.530> will<00:03:12.650> observe<00:03:12.860> a

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
bind which means we will observe a

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.480 
bind which means we will observe a
decrease<00:03:13.670> in<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.060> transcription<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:15.340> if<00:03:16.340> we

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
decrease in the transcription and if we

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.910 
decrease in the transcription and if we
make<00:03:16.670> many<00:03:17.030> changes<00:03:17.330> we<00:03:17.960> can<00:03:18.170> prevent<00:03:18.470> RNA

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
make many changes we can prevent RNA

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.980 
make many changes we can prevent RNA
polymerase<00:03:19.310> from<00:03:19.430> binding<00:03:19.610> all<00:03:20.180> together<00:03:20.660> and

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
polymerase from binding all together and

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.740 
polymerase from binding all together and
in<00:03:21.680> this<00:03:21.800> case<00:03:22.100> we'll<00:03:22.460> observe<00:03:22.700> little<00:03:23.300> to<00:03:23.600> no

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
in this case we'll observe little to no

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.250 
in this case we'll observe little to no
transcription<00:03:25.480> we<00:03:26.480> can<00:03:26.660> improve<00:03:27.050> the

transcription we can improve the
