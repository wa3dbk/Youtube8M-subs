that might be you supply store for $9.99
a<00:03:13.299> pack<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:13.900> it's<00:03:13.989> actually<00:03:14.530> in<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.340> three

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
a pack and it's actually in the three

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.090 
a pack and it's actually in the three
places<00:03:15.910> like<00:03:16.269> Virginia<00:03:16.450> Beach<00:03:16.989> DC<00:03:17.470> area<00:03:17.709> and

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
places like Virginia Beach DC area and

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.650 
places like Virginia Beach DC area and
here<00:03:18.250> down<00:03:18.400> in<00:03:18.549> Georgia<00:03:18.880> they've<00:03:19.090> always<00:03:19.359> been

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:49.849 
it's braided so at that point for the

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:52.209 
it's braided so at that point for the
most<00:06:50.029> part<00:06:50.389> the<00:06:50.900> hair<00:06:51.259> the<00:06:51.500> braided<00:06:51.889> hair<00:06:51.919> is

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
pretty much molded to the braid so it

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.860 
pretty much molded to the braid so it
doesn't<00:06:54.889> come<00:06:55.009> out<00:06:55.190> as<00:06:55.400> much<00:06:55.580> but<00:06:56.330> if<00:06:56.479> it<00:06:56.659> does

please excuse my parents I just finished
working<00:07:12.469> out<00:07:12.710> I<00:07:12.949> don't<00:07:13.039> know<00:07:13.250> why<00:07:13.460> I<00:07:13.490> decided

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:13.969 
working out I don't know why I decided

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:16.089 
working out I don't know why I decided
to<00:07:14.150> work<00:07:14.870> out<00:07:15.139> and<00:07:15.409> then<00:07:15.560> could<00:07:15.740> do<00:07:15.860> a<00:07:15.889> video

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:16.099 
to work out and then could do a video

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:18.159 
to work out and then could do a video
but<00:07:16.400> I<00:07:16.460> figured<00:07:16.909> while<00:07:17.389> the<00:07:17.479> motivation<00:07:18.020> hit

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:18.169 
but I figured while the motivation hit

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:20.740 
but I figured while the motivation hit
me<00:07:18.319> let<00:07:18.500> me<00:07:18.589> come<00:07:18.800> in<00:07:18.979> do<00:07:19.430> a<00:07:19.460> video<00:07:19.729> now<00:07:20.089> and<00:07:20.419> go
