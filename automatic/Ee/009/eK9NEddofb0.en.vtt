ropey one in strawberry said but then

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.900 
ropey one in strawberry said but then
D'Amigo<00:00:22.109> didn't<00:00:22.470> have<00:00:22.680> mode<00:00:22.980> 7<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.760> all

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
D'Amigo didn't have mode 7 this is all

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.590 
D'Amigo didn't have mode 7 this is all
done<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.119> software

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.830 

this<00:00:32.230> was<00:00:32.529> I<00:00:33.120> don't<00:00:34.120> know<00:00:34.240> where<00:00:34.420> I<00:00:34.450> got<00:00:34.570> this

this was I don't know where I got this
actually<00:00:35.320> i'm<00:00:35.530> not<00:00:35.560> sure<00:00:35.860> if<00:00:35.920> it<00:00:36.040> was<00:00:36.100> a<00:00:36.220> cover

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
actually i'm not sure if it was a cover

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.950 
actually i'm not sure if it was a cover

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
cracked copy I don't know

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.910 
cracked copy I don't know
it's<00:00:45.880> been<00:00:46.030> sitting<00:00:46.270> in<00:00:46.510> my<00:00:46.570> floppy<00:00:47.320> disk<00:00:47.590> draw

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
it's been sitting in my floppy disk draw

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.390 
it's been sitting in my floppy disk draw
for<00:00:50.280> years<00:00:51.280> I<00:00:52.620> don't<00:00:53.620> remember<00:00:53.770> where<00:00:54.130> it<00:00:54.220> came

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
for years I don't remember where it came

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.440 
for years I don't remember where it came
from

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.110 

this<00:01:01.110> was<00:01:01.320> one<00:01:01.470> of<00:01:01.500> those<00:01:01.710> games<00:01:02.010> towards<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
this was one of those games towards the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.860 
this was one of those games towards the
end<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.480> Omegas<00:01:03.960> life<00:01:05.480> the<00:01:06.480> the

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
end of the Omegas life the the

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.130 
end of the Omegas life the the
programmers<00:01:07.500> were<00:01:07.710> competing<00:01:08.430> with<00:01:09.240> machines

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
programmers were competing with machines

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.440 
programmers were competing with machines
that<00:01:10.290> had<00:01:10.470> better<00:01:10.740> hardware<00:01:11.340> or<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.030> some<00:01:12.240> ways

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
that had better hardware or in some ways

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.620 
that had better hardware or in some ways
better<00:01:13.040> like<00:01:14.040> there<00:01:14.250> was<00:01:14.370> no<00:01:14.580> sprite<00:01:15.390> scaling

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
better like there was no sprite scaling

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.960 
better like there was no sprite scaling
screen<00:01:16.350> rotation<00:01:16.800> or<00:01:17.070> anything<00:01:17.370> like<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.580> on

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
screen rotation or anything like that on

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.690 
screen rotation or anything like that on
the<00:01:18.330> Amiga<00:01:18.920> so<00:01:19.920> they<00:01:20.040> had<00:01:20.190> to<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.400> everything

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the Amiga so they had to do everything

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.650 
the Amiga so they had to do everything
in<00:01:20.940> software<00:01:21.300> using<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> cpu<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:24.510> do

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
in software using the cpu and they do

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:31.340 
in software using the cpu and they do
come<00:01:24.840> up<00:01:24.960> with<00:01:25.080> some<00:01:25.200> clever<00:01:25.320> stuff<00:01:25.770> oh<00:01:28.340> god

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
come up with some clever stuff oh god

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.030 

I<00:01:31.439> suppose<00:01:32.100> well<00:01:32.310> technically<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:34.040> quite

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
I suppose well technically this is quite

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.690 
I suppose well technically this is quite
a<00:01:35.070> feat

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
a feat

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.709 
a feat
but<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.180> time<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.890> gameplay<00:01:39.820> is<00:01:40.180> pretty<00:01:42.719> it's

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
but the time the gameplay is pretty it's

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:46.709 
but the time the gameplay is pretty it's
diabolical<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.500> be<00:01:44.619> honest<00:01:44.890> is<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:46.149> not<00:01:46.479> good

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
diabolical to be honest is it's not good

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.789 
diabolical to be honest is it's not good
the<00:01:47.350> controls<00:01:47.740> are<00:01:47.950> open<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:50.049> really<00:01:50.560> can't

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
the controls are open you really can't

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:57.320 
the controls are open you really can't
see<00:01:50.920> what's<00:01:51.280> going<00:01:51.579> on<00:01:51.789> here<00:01:52.090> so<00:01:52.329> junky

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:15.350 

don't<00:01:57.960> know<00:01:58.050> what<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.200> was

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.750 

whatever

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.899 

yeah<00:02:19.540> well<00:02:19.900> that's<00:02:20.110> not<00:02:20.170> surprised<00:02:20.650> I<00:02:21.010> failed

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
yeah well that's not surprised I failed

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.089 
yeah well that's not surprised I failed
