comes from OtterBox this is a new case

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.589 
comes from OtterBox this is a new case
from<00:00:07.710> OtterBox<00:00:07.919> it<00:00:08.490> is<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.639> two-piece<00:00:09.210> hard

accessories<00:00:13.500> also<00:00:13.980> just<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.340> little<00:00:14.519> bit

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
accessories also just a little bit

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.939 
accessories also just a little bit
different<00:00:14.940> design<00:00:15.330> it's<00:00:15.990> hard<00:00:16.289> plastic<00:00:16.800> and

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
different design it's hard plastic and

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.250 
different design it's hard plastic and
it<00:00:17.010> has<00:00:17.250> some<00:00:17.550> rubber<00:00:18.000> shock<00:00:18.869> absorption

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
it has some rubber shock absorption

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.200 
it has some rubber shock absorption
areas<00:00:19.680> OtterBox<00:00:20.430> says<00:00:20.609> they<00:00:20.760> designed<00:00:21.090> this

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
areas OtterBox says they designed this

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.090 
areas OtterBox says they designed this
after<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.539> crumple<00:00:21.930> zones<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.439> car<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:23.039> it

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
after the crumple zones in a car so it

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.380 
after the crumple zones in a car so it
should<00:00:23.250> give<00:00:23.369> good<00:00:23.609> shock<00:00:23.939> absorption

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
should give good shock absorption

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.150 
should give good shock absorption
without<00:00:24.840> adding<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> whole<00:00:25.260> lot<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.529> bulk<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.980> it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
when the manufacturers include that this

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.720 
when the manufacturers include that this
is<00:00:49.260> kind<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.469> an<00:00:49.559> interesting<00:00:49.739> case<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
is kind of an interesting case it is a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.760 
is kind of an interesting case it is a
hard<00:00:51.000> shell<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.300> goes<00:00:51.570> around<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:52.590> right

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
hard shell that goes around but right

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.470 
hard shell that goes around but right
here<00:00:53.070> if<00:00:53.340> they<00:00:53.489> can<00:00:53.640> see<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> light<00:00:54.239> there's

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
here if they can see the light there's

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.569 
here if they can see the light there's
this<00:00:54.539> little<00:00:54.750> off<00:00:55.050> color<00:00:55.320> right<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.430> is

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
this little off color right here this is

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.610 
this little off color right here this is
actually<00:00:56.760> rubber<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.840> will<00:00:57.989> push<00:00:58.260> right

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
actually rubber and this will push right

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.170 
actually rubber and this will push right
through<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.579> kind<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.789> see<00:00:59.850> I'm

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
through so you can kind of see I'm

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.729 
through so you can kind of see I'm
actually<00:01:00.329> pushing<00:01:00.870> through<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> little<00:01:01.320> bit<00:01:01.440> so

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
actually pushing through a little bit so

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.429 
actually pushing through a little bit so
that's<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.100> shock<00:01:03.090> absorption<00:01:03.539> area<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.350> it

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
that's that shock absorption area so it

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.570 
that's that shock absorption area so it
really<00:01:04.650> looks<00:01:04.949> like<00:01:05.040> it'll<00:01:05.250> take<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> pretty

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
really looks like it'll take a pretty

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.060 
really looks like it'll take a pretty
good<00:01:05.909> blow<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.600> not<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> bumper<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.710> guess

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
good blow it's just not a bumper I guess

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.730 
good blow it's just not a bumper I guess
on<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.880> case<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.330> actually<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.840> put<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
on the case it actually is put in with a

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.350 
on the case it actually is put in with a
plastic<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.430> pretty<00:01:11.640> interesting<00:01:12.090> design

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
plastic so pretty interesting design

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.090 
plastic so pretty interesting design
with<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.320> actually<00:01:13.439> get<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.710> phone<00:01:13.950> in

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
with that it's actually get the phone in

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.670 
with that it's actually get the phone in

and<00:01:25.920> speaker<00:01:26.280> port<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.630> bit<00:01:27.720> of

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
and speaker port this is a little bit of

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.510 
and speaker port this is a little bit of
a<00:01:27.840> smaller<00:01:28.200> cut<00:01:28.530> up<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> hard

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
a smaller cut up and this is a hard

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.370 
a smaller cut up and this is a hard
plastic<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.210> not<00:01:30.329> going<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.780> flex<00:01:31.049> too

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
plastic so it's not going to flex too

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.929 
plastic so it's not going to flex too
much<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.189> tested<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.579> with<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.759> few

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
much and I tested it with a few

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.999 
much and I tested it with a few
different<00:01:33.420> connectors<00:01:34.020> Apple's<00:01:34.650> connector

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
different connectors Apple's connector

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.560 
different connectors Apple's connector
seemed<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.280> work<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.490> fine<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.180> some<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
seemed to work just fine but some of the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.050 
seemed to work just fine but some of the
older<00:01:37.020> Apple<00:01:37.259> connectors<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:37.979> also<00:01:38.790> some<00:01:39.030> of

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
older Apple connectors and also some of

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.490 
older Apple connectors and also some of
the<00:01:39.150> third<00:01:39.390> parties<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.140> was<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.470> little

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
the third parties it was just a little

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.080 
the third parties it was just a little
too<00:01:40.740> small<00:01:41.100> i<00:01:41.159> couldn't<00:01:41.490> get<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:42.000> know

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
too small i couldn't get that you know

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.480 
too small i couldn't get that you know
nice<00:01:42.299> secure<00:01:42.780> click<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.470> over<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.280> side

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
nice secure click on it over on the side

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.429 
nice secure click on it over on the side
is<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.149> volume<00:01:45.390> up<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.659> down<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.869> then<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
is the volume up and down and then the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.100 
is the volume up and down and then the
silent<00:01:46.890> switch<00:01:47.009> over<00:01:47.399> here<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:48.750> volume<00:01:49.020> up

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
silent switch over here the volume up

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.020 
silent switch over here the volume up
and<00:01:49.259> down<00:01:49.350> works<00:01:50.040> while<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.549> little<00:01:50.790> stiff

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and down works while it's a little stiff

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.550 
and down works while it's a little stiff
so<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.299> have<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> push<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> little<00:01:51.780> little<00:01:52.290> hard

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
so you have to push a little little hard

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.080 
so you have to push a little little hard
on<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.040> get<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.250> go<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.700> little<00:01:53.939> bit

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
on it just to get to go a little bit

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.249 
on it just to get to go a little bit
harder<00:01:54.270> than<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.479> would<00:01:54.659> if<00:01:54.750> there<00:01:54.899> was<00:01:55.079> no

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
harder than you would if there was no

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.319 
harder than you would if there was no
case<00:01:55.500> there<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.549> might<00:01:56.670> loosen<00:01:56.820> up<00:01:57.060> over

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
case there but it might loosen up over

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.429 
case there but it might loosen up over
time<00:01:57.479> it's<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> little<00:01:57.930> bit<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> stiff

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
time it's just a little bit of a stiff

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.050 
time it's just a little bit of a stiff
button<00:01:58.860> up<00:01:59.100> top<00:01:59.159> pretty<00:01:59.549> much<00:01:59.670> same<00:01:59.880> thing

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
button up top pretty much same thing

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.490 
button up top pretty much same thing
with<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.329> power<00:02:00.570> button<00:02:00.840> it's<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.140> little

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
with the power button it's a little

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.620 
with the power button it's a little
stiff<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.310> then<00:02:02.369> here<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.880> headset<00:02:03.420> jack

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
stiff and then here is the headset jack

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.990 
stiff and then here is the headset jack
and<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.869> top<00:02:04.110> microphone<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:05.579> work<00:02:05.759> for

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
and the top microphone this work for

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.639 
and the top microphone this work for
most<00:02:06.240> my<00:02:06.479> headsets<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.049> again<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> little

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
most my headsets but again it's a little

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.499 
most my headsets but again it's a little
bit<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.920> small<00:02:08.190> connector<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.360> not

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
bit of a small connector and this is not

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.630 
bit of a small connector and this is not
flexing<00:02:10.080> too<00:02:10.289> much<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> couple<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.009> my<00:02:11.069> larger

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
flexing too much a couple of my larger

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.790 
flexing too much a couple of my larger
connectors<00:02:12.120> didn't<00:02:13.110> fit<00:02:13.319> in<00:02:13.470> there<00:02:13.650> so

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
connectors didn't fit in there so

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.380 
connectors didn't fit in there so
just<00:02:13.980> one<00:02:14.100> mention<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.270> back

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
just one mention that so on the back

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.030 
just one mention that so on the back
here<00:02:15.600> we<00:02:15.690> have<00:02:15.930> one<00:02:16.140> large<00:02:16.380> cutout<00:02:16.740> for<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
here we have one large cutout for the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.950 
here we have one large cutout for the
camera<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.640> also<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.000> LED<00:02:18.360> flash<00:02:18.660> no

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
camera and also the LED flash no

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.510 
camera and also the LED flash no
problems<00:02:19.320> with<00:02:19.410> any<00:02:19.560> reflection<00:02:20.130> or<00:02:20.310> washing

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
problems with any reflection or washing

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.490 
problems with any reflection or washing
out<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.150> image<00:02:21.510> worked<00:02:22.020> out<00:02:22.170> really<00:02:22.380> well

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
out of the image worked out really well

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.650 
out of the image worked out really well
there<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.490> I<00:02:23.550> mentioned<00:02:23.970> these<00:02:24.120> sort<00:02:24.600> of

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
there and I mentioned these sort of

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.060 
there and I mentioned these sort of
crumple<00:02:25.020> zones<00:02:25.230> right<00:02:25.530> here<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.740> can<00:02:25.890> see

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
crumple zones right here you can see

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.680 
crumple zones right here you can see
this<00:02:26.190> rubber<00:02:26.460> goes<00:02:26.730> around<00:02:27.030> here<00:02:27.360> this<00:02:27.570> is

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
this rubber goes around here this is

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.750 
this rubber goes around here this is
going<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.900> give<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> good<00:02:28.350> shock<00:02:28.650> for<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.520> rest

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
going to give a good shock for the rest

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.920 
going to give a good shock for the rest
of<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.940> case<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.300> if<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.450> happens<00:02:30.690> hit<00:02:30.810> the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
of the case so if it happens hit the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.300 
of the case so if it happens hit the
corner<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.680> know<00:02:31.770> you're<00:02:31.920> going<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.070> have<00:02:32.280> a

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
corner you know you're going to have a

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.850 
corner you know you're going to have a
good<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.910> good<00:02:33.360> section<00:02:33.690> here<00:02:33.960> of<00:02:34.080> rubber<00:02:34.320> too<00:02:34.590> I

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
good a good section here of rubber too I

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.950 
good a good section here of rubber too I
really<00:02:35.430> shield<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.240> case<00:02:36.420> itself<00:02:36.780> and

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
really shield the the case itself and

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.180 
really shield the the case itself and
then<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.170> course<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.470> phone<00:02:37.650> inside<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.100> the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
then of course the phone inside of the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.770 
then of course the phone inside of the
case<00:02:38.370> really<00:02:38.670> interesting<00:02:39.030> design<00:02:39.330> on<00:02:39.600> this

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
case really interesting design on this

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.900 
case really interesting design on this
on<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.470> front<00:02:40.740> it<00:02:40.890> does<00:02:41.040> have<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.250> bit<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.640> a

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
on the front it does have a bit of a

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.520 
on the front it does have a bit of a
raised<00:02:42.210> edge<00:02:42.510> on<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.140> can<00:02:43.260> see<00:02:43.380> if<00:02:43.440> you

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
raised edge on it so you can see if you

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.080 
raised edge on it so you can see if you
do<00:02:43.650> put<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.950> down<00:02:44.100> on<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.460> table<00:02:44.490> if<00:02:44.970> you

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
do put it down on the table if you

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.790 
do put it down on the table if you
happen<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.330> have<00:02:45.450> some<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:46.230> know<00:02:46.290> dust<00:02:46.620> or

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
happen to have some you know dust or

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.680 
happen to have some you know dust or
dirt<00:02:47.010> or<00:02:47.190> sand<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.210> screen<00:02:48.450> around<00:02:48.600> the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
dirt or sand on the screen around the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.330 
dirt or sand on the screen around the
table<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:49.170> move<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.380> around<00:02:49.470> by<00:02:50.040> lifting

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
table and you move it around by lifting

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.410 
table and you move it around by lifting
that<00:02:50.460> screen<00:02:50.730> up<00:02:50.880> you're<00:02:51.060> not<00:02:51.150> going<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.360> be

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
that screen up you're not going to be

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.820 
that screen up you're not going to be
scratching<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:51.900> up<00:02:52.020> against<00:02:52.440> your<00:02:52.560> glass

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
scratching it up against your glass

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.500 
scratching it up against your glass
that's<00:02:53.190> always<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.460> good<00:02:53.670> thing<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.390> on

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
that's always a good thing so just on

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.480 
that's always a good thing so just on
the<00:02:54.600> overall<00:02:54.870> here<00:02:55.200> on<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.560> case<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:56.400> looks

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
the overall here on the case it looks

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
the overall here on the case it looks
like<00:02:56.640> it's<00:02:56.850> pretty<00:02:56.940> good<00:02:57.150> drop<00:02:57.360> protection

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
like it's pretty good drop protection

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.720 
like it's pretty good drop protection
with<00:02:57.990> this<00:02:58.140> crumple<00:02:58.560> zone<00:02:58.770> thing<00:02:59.040> where<00:02:59.610> it's

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
with this crumple zone thing where it's

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.860 
with this crumple zone thing where it's
not<00:02:59.910> going<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.120> be<00:03:00.180> adding<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.480> whole<00:03:00.630> lot<00:03:00.750> of

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
not going to be adding a whole lot of

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.360 
not going to be adding a whole lot of
bulk<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.320> so<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.560> can<00:03:01.770> have<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:01.980> good

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
bulk to it so you can have a good

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.490 
bulk to it so you can have a good
protection<00:03:02.730> from<00:03:02.940> drops<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:03.540> bumps<00:03:03.570> without

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
protection from drops and bumps without

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.530 
protection from drops and bumps without
having<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.800> big<00:03:05.010> bulky<00:03:05.460> case<00:03:05.760> it's<00:03:06.420> pretty

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
having a big bulky case it's pretty

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.240 
having a big bulky case it's pretty
interesting<00:03:06.840> design<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.590> we<00:03:07.740> saw<00:03:07.890> this<00:03:08.040> may

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
interesting design and we saw this may

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.740 
interesting design and we saw this may
be<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.370> little<00:03:08.610> bit<00:03:08.820> with<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.060> candy<00:03:09.390> shell<00:03:09.540> but

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
be a little bit with the candy shell but

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.330 
be a little bit with the candy shell but
not<00:03:09.870> quite<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.410> this<00:03:10.560> extent<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.130> speck

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
not quite to this extent the speck

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.790 
not quite to this extent the speck
candyshell<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.360> interesting<00:03:12.900> idea<00:03:13.290> with<00:03:13.530> this

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
candyshell so interesting idea with this

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.350 
candyshell so interesting idea with this
so<00:03:14.010> overall<00:03:14.340> I'm<00:03:14.670> not<00:03:14.850> too<00:03:14.970> bad<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.210> case

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
so overall I'm not too bad of a case

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.580 
so overall I'm not too bad of a case
couple<00:03:15.690> issues<00:03:15.810> with<00:03:16.200> getting<00:03:16.350> some

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
couple issues with getting some

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.170 
couple issues with getting some
connectors<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.220> other<00:03:17.400> than<00:03:17.550> that<00:03:17.610> looks

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
connectors and other than that looks

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.060 
connectors and other than that looks
like<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.360> pretty<00:03:18.600> solid<00:03:18.870> offering<00:03:19.680> for<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:19.890> nice

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
like a pretty solid offering for a nice

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.860 
like a pretty solid offering for a nice
protective<00:03:20.280> case<00:03:20.760> for<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.090> iphone<00:03:21.390> 4<00:03:21.660> all

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
protective case for the iphone 4 all

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.550 
protective case for the iphone 4 all
right<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.080> it's<00:03:22.110> do<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.320> little<00:03:22.470> comparison

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
right so it's do a little comparison

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.130 
right so it's do a little comparison
here<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.370> otterbox<00:03:23.850> lineup<00:03:24.330> down<00:03:24.840> here<00:03:25.020> we

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
here of the otterbox lineup down here we

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.560 
here of the otterbox lineup down here we
have<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.500> impact<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.190> here<00:03:26.550> is<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.910> reflex<00:03:27.420> I

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
have the impact and here is the reflex I

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.240 
have the impact and here is the reflex I
just<00:03:27.780> reviewed<00:03:28.110> here's<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.500> commuter<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.040> here

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
just reviewed here's a commuter and here

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.100 
just reviewed here's a commuter and here
is<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.580> defender<00:03:30.120> if<00:03:30.600> I<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.750> put<00:03:30.930> them<00:03:31.050> in

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
is the defender if I to put them in

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.350 
is the defender if I to put them in
order<00:03:31.380> of<00:03:31.530> protection<00:03:32.220> this<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:32.940> how<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.120> would

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
order of protection this is how I would

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.380 
order of protection this is how I would
do<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.540> now<00:03:34.020> the<00:03:34.080> impact<00:03:34.980> here<00:03:35.250> is<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.430> silicone

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
do it now the impact here is a silicone

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.810 
do it now the impact here is a silicone
skin<00:03:36.570> so<00:03:36.870> this<00:03:36.989> will<00:03:37.110> go<00:03:37.230> over<00:03:37.440> your<00:03:37.920> over<00:03:38.700> your

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
skin so this will go over your over your

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.460 
skin so this will go over your over your
phone<00:03:38.970> give<00:03:39.209> good<00:03:39.420> protection<00:03:39.930> just<00:03:40.170> general

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
phone give good protection just general

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.870 
phone give good protection just general
protection<00:03:40.860> adding<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.250> whole<00:03:41.400> lot<00:03:41.580> of<00:03:41.610> bulk

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
protection adding a whole lot of bulk

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.699 
protection adding a whole lot of bulk
less<00:03:42.420> protection<00:03:42.810> though<00:03:43.050> than<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.290> think<00:03:43.530> here

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
less protection though than I think here

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.530 
less protection though than I think here
on<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:43.950> reflex<00:03:44.400> this<00:03:44.760> crumple<00:03:45.090> zone<00:03:45.270> thing

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
on the reflex this crumple zone thing

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.090 
on the reflex this crumple zone thing
and<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.810> hard<00:03:46.020> shell<00:03:46.200> in<00:03:46.440> general<00:03:46.770> I<00:03:46.860> think<00:03:46.890> is

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
and the hard shell in general I think is

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.620 
and the hard shell in general I think is
going<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.310> give<00:03:47.459> pretty<00:03:47.700> good<00:03:47.790> protection<00:03:48.300> I

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
going to give pretty good protection I

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.970 
going to give pretty good protection I
think<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.200> commuter<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:49.560> going<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.739> be<00:03:49.800> better

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
think the commuter is going to be better

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.340 
think the commuter is going to be better
basically<00:03:50.820> we<00:03:50.880> have<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:51.030> silicone<00:03:51.390> skin<00:03:51.690> you're

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
basically we have a silicone skin you're

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.990 
basically we have a silicone skin you're
covered<00:03:52.620> by<00:03:52.890> a<00:03:52.920> hard<00:03:53.220> shell<00:03:53.400> i<00:03:53.580> think<00:03:53.760> is

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
covered by a hard shell i think is

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.030 
covered by a hard shell i think is
pretty<00:03:54.150> good<00:03:54.360> protection<00:03:54.720> also<00:03:55.590> I<00:03:55.620> we<00:03:55.950> got

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
pretty good protection also I we got

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.440 
pretty good protection also I we got
some<00:03:56.190> port<00:03:56.400> protector<00:03:56.790> so<00:03:56.940> down<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.180> bottom

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
some port protector so down the bottom

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.630 
some port protector so down the bottom
we<00:03:57.570> have<00:03:57.600> one<00:03:57.930> also<00:03:58.410> up<00:03:58.560> here<00:03:58.770> on<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.160> top<00:03:59.190> so<00:03:59.610> a

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
we have one also up here on the top so a

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.340 
we have one also up here on the top so a
little<00:03:59.760> extra<00:04:00.090> protection<00:04:00.180> around<00:04:00.570> and<00:04:01.260> then

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
little extra protection around and then

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.050
