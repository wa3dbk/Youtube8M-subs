for<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.770> floor<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.340> took<00:01:02.399> my<00:01:02.789> plywood<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.600> I

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
for the floor I took my plywood and I

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.990 
for the floor I took my plywood and I
actually<00:01:03.780> painted<00:01:04.530> my<00:01:04.739> plywood<00:01:05.189> before<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> put

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
actually painted my plywood before I put

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.609 
actually painted my plywood before I put
the<00:01:06.119> flooring<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.630> then<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.110> took<00:01:07.170> contact

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the flooring on then I took contact

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.219 
the flooring on then I took contact
paper<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.610> stuck<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:10.200> I

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
paper and just stuck it on then I

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.649 
paper and just stuck it on then I
flipped<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.740> over<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.310> place<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.880> plywood<00:01:12.479> on

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
flipped it over and place the plywood on

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.780 
flipped it over and place the plywood on
to<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> mellah<00:01:13.560> mine<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:14.220> screwed<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
to the mellah mine then screwed the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.429 
to the mellah mine then screwed the
plywood<00:01:15.210> into<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.869> mellah<00:01:16.080> mine

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
plywood into the mellah mine

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.950 
plywood into the mellah mine
after<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.220> trimmed<00:01:17.759> up<00:01:18.000> all<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.450> contact

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
after that I trimmed up all the contact

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.990 
after that I trimmed up all the contact
paper<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.500> was<00:01:19.619> sticking<00:01:19.890> out<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.520> edges

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
paper that was sticking out of the edges

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.300 
paper that was sticking out of the edges
then<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.540> flipped<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.140> whole<00:01:22.350> entire<00:01:22.770> cage

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
then I flipped the whole entire cage

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.880 
then I flipped the whole entire cage
over<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.090> moved<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.659> into<00:01:24.780> place<00:01:25.170> at<00:01:25.619> this

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
over and moved it into place at this

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.370 
over and moved it into place at this
time<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.460> had<00:01:26.729> some<00:01:27.000> extra<00:01:27.450> melamine<00:01:27.900> pieces

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
time I had some extra melamine pieces

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.319 
time I had some extra melamine pieces
from<00:01:28.680> cutting<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.189> shelfs<00:01:29.579> down<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.299> I

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
from cutting the shelfs down so I

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.840 
from cutting the shelfs down so I
decided<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.990> screw<00:01:31.439> those<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.520> front

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
decided to screw those on to the front

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.149 
decided to screw those on to the front
and<00:01:33.000> side<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.750> give<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.229> little<00:01:34.619> bit<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.890> a

inch<00:01:46.380> Plexiglas<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:48.030> don't<00:01:48.090> recommend

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
inch Plexiglas and I don't recommend

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.170 
inch Plexiglas and I don't recommend
going<00:01:48.960> any<00:01:49.290> smaller<00:01:49.890> than<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.520> if<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.000> can

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
going any smaller than that if you can

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.270 
going any smaller than that if you can
afford<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.659> quarter<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.170> an<00:01:52.290> inch<00:01:52.380> thick<00:01:52.799> then<00:01:53.159> I

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
afford a quarter of an inch thick then I

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
afford a quarter of an inch thick then I
would<00:01:53.579> definitely<00:01:54.149> recommend<00:01:54.299> going<00:01:54.810> for

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140
