00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.410
 Over the years scientists have come to agree that 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.510
 craters are not fissures of volcanic character 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.610
 on the contrary it would only be the result of the impact of the meteorite 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.039
 on the surface of the planet 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.780
 the connections between celestial bodies are frequent and in the world 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.179
 results in the union of both 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:20.140
 the captors 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.410
 can therefore provide clues to how planets grow 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.960
 we know for example that the surface of the moon the same as that of tercovi the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.960
 recent project similar and not as it has always been 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:35.350
 when we send to the world we have a pretty accurate idea of ​​what aspect 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.840
 he had the land immediately after its creation 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.100
 a vice president 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.490
 It is a drama that began about four thousand 600 million years ago 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.220
 when the universe I had 10 initials of years 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.420
 we do not know with precision 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.439
 what happened more than four thousand 500 million years ago 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.640
 but if we have a basic idea 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.640
 the dust is that they were scattered throughout the universe 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.160
 they began to concentrate and form a spiral of very hot gas 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.950
 in the core of the spiral 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.030
 started the combustion of the molten materials 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.030
 this was the birth of the star we call 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.440
 Around the sun 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.450
 other solid bodies were formed 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.450
 these were the earth and the other planets 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.020
 according to curry this process 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.150
 the gas began to cool 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.140
 and in the same way that steam produces water droplets 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.390
 it began to condense 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.390
 to the result we carry blanton 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.110
 I want a big ball of charcoal with a diameter of 10 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.030
 kilometer 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.980
 if there were a large number 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.210
 an estimate assumes a number greater than one million million 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.949
 maybe it was not surprising that they started to collide with each other 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:24.609
 sometimes the plans where it was fragmented 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.609
 sometimes they joined to form a larger body 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.419
 lime 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:38.260
 the collisions 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
 continued to occur for many years 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:02.569
 finally a change took place in the way collisions occur 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:09.419
 gradually 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.029
 began to suffer among the small planetoids a body much larger than 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:16.419
 we 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:18.499
 as its mass was growing 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:21.669
 severity attracted more and more puts workshops 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:25.529
 every time they collided their growth accelerated 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:30.929
 this teacher 

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:33.929
 port growing in size an increasing rate 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.249
 p 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:49.089
 for today 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:10.469
 i 1 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:11.799
 what we just saw 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.999
 it has been the creation of the original earth 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:19.079
 and following this cycle Mercury Venus planets were also created and 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.079
 Tuesday 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.849
 immediately after its creation 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.050
 showed the traces of all those conditions 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.990
 its surface appeared covered 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.849
 the process however 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.849
 continued and has been reinforced 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.240
 in primitive periods the surface of our planet was covered in 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.240
 leganés 

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:18.210
 let's make our idea of ​​its appearance 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.550
 if we look at the surface of the moon 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.550
 rondón of the craters appear almost as they were originally 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.719
 4,600 million years later 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:39.679
 the appearance of the land little information can contribute 

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:41.559
 sectors 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:43.150
 according to the statement 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.889
 bush discover new clues 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.110
 characters that have been formed most recently 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.289
 observations made from artificial satellites 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.539
 confirm the existence of more than 100 tractors on the surface of the earth 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.110
 a considerable 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.099
 is in canada
