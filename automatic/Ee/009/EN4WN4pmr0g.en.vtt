you're looking at the serial monitor of
the<00:00:13.309> Arduino<00:00:14.309> IDE<00:00:15.260> you<00:00:16.260> can<00:00:16.410> see<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.650> it's<00:00:16.890> a

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
the Arduino IDE you can see that it's a

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.510 
the Arduino IDE you can see that it's a
menu-driven<00:00:17.750> program<00:00:18.920> it<00:00:19.920> allows<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.310> to

motor unable disable the motor and you
can<00:00:27.359> also<00:00:27.510> store<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.080> program<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.890> moves<00:00:29.460> this

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
can also store a program of moves this

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.200 
can also store a program of moves this
would<00:00:30.300> allow<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:31.109> store<00:00:31.170> up<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.550> about<00:00:32.880> two

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
would allow you to store up to about two

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.910 
would allow you to store up to about two

it so now I'll demonstrate the stored

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.199 
it so now I'll demonstrate the stored
program<00:02:32.650> I'm<00:02:33.370> not<00:02:33.520> going<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.760> take<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:34.000> time

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
program I'm not going to take the time

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.380 
program I'm not going to take the time
to<00:02:34.390> write<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.690> program<00:02:35.020> here<00:02:35.590> but<00:02:36.180> i'll<00:02:37.180> show

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
to write a program here but i'll show

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.990 
to write a program here but i'll show
you<00:02:37.480> what<00:02:37.630> i<00:02:37.690> have<00:02:37.750> in<00:02:38.140> there<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:39.790> is<00:02:39.970> a

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
you what i have in there this is a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.540 
you what i have in there this is a
6-line<00:02:40.660> program<00:02:41.260> it's<00:02:42.010> going<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.250> run<00:02:42.370> out<00:02:42.400> to

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
6-line program it's going to run out to

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.290 
6-line program it's going to run out to
thirty<00:02:42.880> thousand<00:02:43.390> steps<00:02:44.580> at<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.640> given<00:02:45.970> rate

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
thirty thousand steps at a given rate

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.390 
thirty thousand steps at a given rate
and<00:02:46.600> acceleration<00:02:47.290> then<00:02:47.950> it's<00:02:48.130> going<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.280> go

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
and acceleration then it's going to go

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.120 
and acceleration then it's going to go
to<00:02:48.459> 60,000<00:02:49.390> steps<00:02:49.810> at<00:02:50.050> a<00:02:50.110> slightly<00:02:50.770> faster

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
to 60,000 steps at a slightly faster

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.610 
to 60,000 steps at a slightly faster
speed<00:02:51.700> that's<00:02:52.600> going<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.900> dwell<00:02:53.050> for<00:02:53.470> two

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
speed that's going to dwell for two

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.430 
speed that's going to dwell for two
thousand<00:02:54.070> milliseconds<00:02:54.540> which<00:02:55.540> means<00:02:56.170> pause

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
thousand milliseconds which means pause

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.760 
thousand milliseconds which means pause
for<00:02:56.860> two<00:02:57.610> seconds<00:02:58.290> then<00:02:59.290> it's<00:02:59.440> going<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.620> go

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
for two seconds then it's going to go

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.650 
for two seconds then it's going to go
out<00:02:59.830> to<00:03:00.010> a<00:03:00.040> hundred<00:03:00.310> thousand<00:03:00.700> steps<00:03:00.940> at<00:03:01.600> a

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
out to a hundred thousand steps at a

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.140 
out to a hundred thousand steps at a
really<00:03:01.959> fast<00:03:02.230> rate<00:03:02.620> do<00:03:03.250> I'll<00:03:03.370> at<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.670> end<00:03:03.850> and

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
really fast rate do I'll at the end and

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.860 
really fast rate do I'll at the end and
then<00:03:04.989> return<00:03:05.320> back<00:03:05.549> so<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:07.030> run<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.360> program<00:03:07.390> i

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
then return back so to run the program i

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.340 
then return back so to run the program i
just<00:03:08.110> type<00:03:08.290> g4<00:03:08.860> go<00:03:09.510> way<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.630> goes<00:03:10.870> there's<00:03:11.200> the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
just type g4 go way it goes there's the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:18.539 
just type g4 go way it goes there's the
first<00:03:11.620> move

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.270 

second<00:03:19.549> move

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.630 

out<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.180> end<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:25.280> it's<00:03:26.280> going<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.490> return

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
out to the end and it's going to return

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:34.880 
out to the end and it's going to return
to<00:03:27.209> zero<00:03:28.520> after<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:30.180> pause

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.550 

that's<00:03:35.890> basically<00:03:36.130> it
