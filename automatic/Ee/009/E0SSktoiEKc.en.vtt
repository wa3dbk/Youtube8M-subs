isn't<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.320> much<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.530> marvel<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.219> speed<00:01:59.700> but<00:02:00.000> a

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
isn't so much a marvel of speed but a

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.569 
isn't so much a marvel of speed but a
marvel<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.540> logistics<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:02.159> were<00:02:02.280> merely

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
marvel of logistics if it were merely

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.760 
marvel of logistics if it were merely
about<00:02:02.909> taking<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.630> balloon<00:02:03.960> around<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.500> world

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
about taking a balloon around the world

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.620 
about taking a balloon around the world
it<00:02:05.100> would<00:02:05.219> be<00:02:05.250> much<00:02:05.579> less<00:02:05.820> interesting<00:02:06.479> than

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
it would be much less interesting than

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.080 
it would be much less interesting than
the<00:02:07.110> triumph<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.770> risk<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.399> reward<00:02:08.580> and

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
the triumph of risk and reward and

the triumph of risk and reward and
travel<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.780> game<00:02:10.530> captures<00:02:10.979> this

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129

travel and the game captures this
concept<00:02:11.670> very<00:02:12.150> well<00:02:12.480> ex

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140

you difficulty is a really hard thing to

but it does well instill a sense of
wonder<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:29.490> game<00:02:29.700> feels<00:02:30.000> less<00:02:30.360> geared

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840

towards a challenge as it does toward

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
the best anyway because as it turns out

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.500 
the best anyway because as it turns out
Vladivostok<00:03:29.070> is<00:03:29.250> under<00:03:29.459> martial<00:03:29.940> law<00:03:29.970> at<00:03:30.360> the

Vladivostok is under martial law at the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.840 
Vladivostok is under martial law at the
moment<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:31.049> great<00:03:31.560> hint<00:03:31.829> I<00:03:31.980> picked<00:03:32.430> up<00:03:32.610> from

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
moment a great hint I picked up from

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.550 
moment a great hint I picked up from
conversing<00:03:33.360> with<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.510> soldier<00:03:33.989> on<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.170> train

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
conversing with a soldier on the train

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.280 
conversing with a soldier on the train
and<00:03:34.890> then<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.940> last<00:03:36.120> thing<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.540> say<00:03:36.570> is<00:03:37.019> the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
and then the last thing to say is the

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.160 
and then the last thing to say is the
graphics<00:03:37.860> has<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.400> pretty<00:03:38.940> good<00:03:39.329> if<00:03:39.570> simplistic

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
graphics has a pretty good if simplistic

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.009 
graphics has a pretty good if simplistic
style<00:03:40.739> mostly<00:03:41.730> silhouettes<00:03:42.299> but<00:03:42.600> a<00:03:42.630> very

smooth visual experience all in all
perhaps<00:03:46.410> my<00:03:46.680> biggest<00:03:46.709> issue<00:03:47.310> with<00:03:47.549> this<00:03:47.610> game

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
perhaps my biggest issue with this game

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.289 
perhaps my biggest issue with this game
is<00:03:48.030> that<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.450> sound<00:03:48.840> design<00:03:49.200> was<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.440> bit<00:03:49.769> off

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
is that the sound design was a bit off

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.000 
is that the sound design was a bit off
when<00:03:51.299> traveling<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.959> background<00:03:52.470> noise<00:03:52.739> is

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
when traveling the background noise is

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.550 
when traveling the background noise is
rather<00:03:53.280> omnipresent<00:03:54.000> but<00:03:54.510> once<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:55.260> get<00:03:55.380> to<00:03:55.530> a

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
rather omnipresent but once you get to a

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.440 
rather omnipresent but once you get to a
city<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:56.130> have<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.579> moment<00:03:56.850> of<00:03:57.090> chatter

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
city you have a moment of chatter

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.020 
city you have a moment of chatter
followed<00:03:57.900> by<00:03:58.049> mostly<00:03:58.709> silence<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.730> would<00:03:59.940> have

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
followed by mostly silence it would have

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.729 
followed by mostly silence it would have
been<00:04:00.150> better<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.510> keep<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.140> sound<00:04:01.320> levels

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
been better to keep the sound levels

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.410 
been better to keep the sound levels
roughly<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.400> same<00:04:02.610> throughout<00:04:02.850> because<00:04:03.180> it

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
roughly the same throughout because it

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.210 
roughly the same throughout because it
starts<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.810> call<00:04:03.959> attention<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.500> itself<00:04:04.739> after

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
starts to call attention to itself after

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.750 
starts to call attention to itself after
a<00:04:05.700> few<00:04:06.030> in-game<00:04:06.570> days<00:04:07.040> there<00:04:08.040> is<00:04:08.070> one<00:04:08.519> other

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
a few in-game days there is one other

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.819 
a few in-game days there is one other
mechanic<00:04:09.359> that<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.630> will<00:04:09.780> not<00:04:09.900> see<00:04:10.260> here<00:04:10.680> but

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
mechanic that you will not see here but

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.530 
mechanic that you will not see here but
it<00:04:10.920> is<00:04:11.070> a<00:04:11.100> feature<00:04:11.400> that's<00:04:11.640> implemented<00:04:12.150> and

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
it is a feature that's implemented and

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.420 
it is a feature that's implemented and
that<00:04:13.019> is<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.380> ability<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.799> race<00:04:14.160> fellow

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
that is the ability to race fellow

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.849 
that is the ability to race fellow
players<00:04:14.850> with<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.239> live<00:04:15.570> updating<00:04:16.410> map<00:04:16.620> that

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
players with a live updating map that

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.430 
players with a live updating map that
includes<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.400> locations<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.299> paths<00:04:19.019> of

other<00:04:19.620> players<00:04:19.919> not<00:04:20.910> having<00:04:21.239> any<00:04:21.359> friends

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
other players not having any friends

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.570 
other players not having any friends
that<00:04:21.840> were<00:04:22.019> playing<00:04:22.349> at<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.620> same<00:04:22.860> time<00:04:23.160> it's

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
that were playing at the same time it's

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.700 
that were playing at the same time it's
not<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:23.970> feature<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.450> I<00:04:24.479> show<00:04:24.930> here<00:04:24.960> but<00:04:25.500> it<00:04:25.620> is

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
not a feature that I show here but it is

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.210 
not a feature that I show here but it is
noteworthy<00:04:25.979> now<00:04:26.820> if

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
noteworthy now if

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.500 
noteworthy now if

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510
