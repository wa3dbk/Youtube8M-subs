00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:04.150
 we are sharing the reading of the word of God in the old testament 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.480
 I invite you to join me in chapter 5 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.369
 the book of the cso 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.319
 chapters 5 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:17.300
 from the book of this 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.810
 says yes the word of god 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.060
 Then Moses and I argued for Pharaoh's presence and they told him 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:27.330
 Jehovah 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.359
 the god of israel says so 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.490
 let my people go to celebrate a party in the desert 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.520
 and for an answered 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.960
 who demanded baa so that I heard his voice 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.220
 and decided to israel 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.250
 I do not know jehovah 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.400
 nor will I let Israel go 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.290
 and they said 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.590
 the god of the Hebrews was not found 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.640
 We will go then now three days in the desert 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.699
 and we will offer sacrifices so our god goes so that he does not come over 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.699
 us with plague and with sword 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.450
 then the king of egypt told them 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.680
 to Moses and Aaron 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.680
 because six to cease the people from their work 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.090
 return to your families 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.270
 said Pharaoh 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.650
 and here the people of the earth is now much 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.650
 and you six to stop their tasks 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.120
 and sent for now that the same day 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.420
 village caddy 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.079
 what they had in charge and their foremen saying 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.329
 from now on 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.129
 you will not give straw to the people to make bricks as up to now 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.210
 go ni god and collect for themselves the peace 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.260
 and will impose airs the same task of bricks they did before 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.580
 and not diminish isp anything 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.540
 because they are sewn 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.710
 that's why raise your voice saying go and offer sacrifices to our god 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.000
 thank the servitude on them so that they are occupied in the day and do not attend to 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.319
 lying words 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.620
 and leaving the village crews 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.499
 and his foremen spoke to the people saying 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.469
 Pharaoh said so 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.219
 I do not give you ipad 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.609

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.329
 but nothing will be diminished from your task 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:33.839
 then the village spread throughout the land of Egypt 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.510
 to pick stubble instead of straw 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.549
 the crews 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.579
 the papers looked from being finished the work sample 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.439
 the task of each day in his day 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.619
 like when you were given straw 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:50.769
 and that was it 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.030
 to the foremen of the children of Israel 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.859
 that the gangs of Pharaoh had put on them saying 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.509
 why you have not fulfilled your brick task neither yesterday nor today as 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:03.379
 before 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.690
 the foremen of the sons of israel 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.690
 pharaoh came and complained azael saying 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.209
 because you do it this way with your servant 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.760
 your servants will not be extinguished 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.689
 and yet they tell us 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:19.359

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.459
 and here your servant zone whipped and your people is the culprit 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.129
 and he answered this exhibition alone I followed 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:29.649
 or if you 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:30.940
 and that's why you say 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.950
 we go and we look like sacrifices like that 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.649
 and then now and work 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:39.709

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.170
 and has come to deliver 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.779
 the same brick task 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:46.880
 then the foremen of the children of israel 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.599
 they saw themselves in friction by saying they were 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.540
 nothing of your brick will be diminished 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.889
 of the task of each day 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.640
 and finding a very simple aragon 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.469
 that were in sight of them when they came out 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:03.969
 of Pharaoh's presence they were told 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:06.979

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.629
 to kill us 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:19.629
 then moses turned to jehovah and said sir 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:22.900
 because police to this town 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.110
