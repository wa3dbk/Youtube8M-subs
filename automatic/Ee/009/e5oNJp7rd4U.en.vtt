Alberta that a boat that is around the
time<00:00:38.739> that<00:00:38.769> you<00:00:38.949> would<00:00:39.100> want<00:00:39.339> to<00:00:39.489> desiccate

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
time that you would want to desiccate

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.470 
time that you would want to desiccate
them<00:00:40.379> if<00:00:41.379> you<00:00:41.559> could<00:00:41.710> if<00:00:41.980> you<00:00:42.370> could<00:00:43.059> come<00:00:43.269> in<00:00:43.390> a

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
them if you could if you could come in a

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.240 
them if you could if you could come in a
little<00:00:43.600> bit<00:00:43.839> earlier<00:00:44.199> that<00:00:44.470> would<00:00:44.769> be<00:00:44.920> okay

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
little bit earlier that would be okay

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.009 
little bit earlier that would be okay
but<00:00:45.730> you<00:00:45.879> don't<00:00:46.030> want<00:00:46.150> to<00:00:46.210> go<00:00:46.300> much<00:00:46.480> later<00:00:46.809> than

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
but you don't want to go much later than

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.680 
but you don't want to go much later than
that<00:00:47.260> and<00:00:47.610> when<00:00:48.610> you<00:00:48.730> desiccate<00:00:49.239> them<00:00:49.420> you

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
that and when you desiccate them you

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.119 
that and when you desiccate them you
might<00:00:49.870> think<00:00:50.140> that<00:00:50.199> they<00:00:50.379> might<00:00:50.530> not<00:00:50.769> quite<00:00:51.070> be

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
might think that they might not quite be

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.490 
might think that they might not quite be
ready<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:52.000> timing<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.750> desiccate<00:00:53.230> these

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
ready the timing to desiccate these

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.770 
ready the timing to desiccate these
would<00:00:53.829> be<00:00:54.010> when<00:00:54.340> about<00:00:54.879> 90<00:00:55.270> percent<00:00:55.629> of<00:00:55.719> the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
would be when about 90 percent of the

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.200 
would be when about 90 percent of the
pods<00:00:56.230> are<00:00:56.530> starting<00:00:56.890> to<00:00:57.010> turn<00:00:57.190> black<00:00:57.489> but

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
pods are starting to turn black but

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.880 
pods are starting to turn black but
there's<00:00:58.420> still<00:00:58.570> a<00:00:58.629> fair<00:00:58.899> amount<00:00:59.019> of<00:00:59.260> green<00:00:59.559> on

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
there's still a fair amount of green on

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.220 
there's still a fair amount of green on
the<00:01:00.160> plant<00:01:00.430> which<00:01:00.910> might<00:01:01.120> be<00:01:01.300> surprising<00:01:02.199> you

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
the plant which might be surprising you

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.079 
the plant which might be surprising you
might<00:01:02.559> think<00:01:02.859> that<00:01:02.920> it's<00:01:03.160> still<00:01:03.489> very<00:01:03.519> green

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
might think that it's still very green

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.820 
might think that it's still very green
looking<00:01:04.509> but<00:01:04.660> when<00:01:04.809> you<00:01:04.929> get<00:01:05.080> down<00:01:05.320> into<00:01:05.590> the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
looking but when you get down into the

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.529 
looking but when you get down into the
canopy<00:01:06.160> you'll<00:01:06.670> see<00:01:06.880> that<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.149> pods<00:01:07.330> are

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
canopy you'll see that the pods are

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:09.749 
canopy you'll see that the pods are
actually<00:01:07.810> starting<00:01:08.170> to<00:01:08.289> turn<00:01:08.470> black<00:01:08.710> from<00:01:09.490> the

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
actually starting to turn black from the

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.200 
actually starting to turn black from the
bottom<00:01:10.210> up<00:01:10.390> and<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.460> reason<00:01:12.759> why<00:01:12.850> we<00:01:13.060> need

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
bottom up and if the reason why we need

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.650 
bottom up and if the reason why we need
to<00:01:13.270> desiccate<00:01:13.750> that<00:01:14.410> early<00:01:14.860> and<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:16.210> because

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
to desiccate that early and is because

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.930 
to desiccate that early and is because
if<00:01:16.869> you<00:01:17.080> don't<00:01:17.890> desiccate<00:01:18.520> them<00:01:18.670> they<00:01:18.820> might

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
if you don't desiccate them they might

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.430 
if you don't desiccate them they might
not<00:01:19.119> actually<00:01:19.330> make<00:01:19.660> it<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:19.869> harvest<00:01:20.259> in

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
not actually make it to harvest in

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.399 
not actually make it to harvest in
central<00:01:20.979> Alberta<00:01:21.460> areas<00:01:22.270> because<00:01:23.020> once<00:01:23.259> the

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
central Alberta areas because once the

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.350 
central Alberta areas because once the
frost<00:01:23.710> comes<00:01:24.040> in<00:01:24.220> you<00:01:24.490> have<00:01:24.640> these<00:01:24.759> big<00:01:24.970> seeds

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
frost comes in you have these big seeds

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.870 
frost comes in you have these big seeds
and<00:01:25.720> if<00:01:26.200> these<00:01:26.380> seats<00:01:26.650> are<00:01:26.979> not<00:01:27.220> quite<00:01:27.610> ready

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
and if these seats are not quite ready

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.330 
and if these seats are not quite ready
yet<00:01:28.689> they'll<00:01:28.990> just<00:01:29.200> turn<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.590> absolute<00:01:30.040> mush

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
yet they'll just turn to absolute mush

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.020 
yet they'll just turn to absolute mush
so<00:01:30.880> we<00:01:31.509> always<00:01:32.170> recommend<00:01:33.030> desiccating

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
so we always recommend desiccating

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.179 
so we always recommend desiccating
before<00:01:34.390> September<00:01:34.810> 10th<00:01:35.049> in<00:01:35.229> fact<00:01:35.470> it's<00:01:35.979> kind

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
before September 10th in fact it's kind

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.420 
before September 10th in fact it's kind
of<00:01:36.340> a<00:01:36.490> calendar<00:01:37.210> rule<00:01:37.450> that<00:01:38.110> we<00:01:38.380> that<00:01:39.040> we<00:01:39.159> say

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
of a calendar rule that we that we say

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.130 
of a calendar rule that we that we say
to<00:01:39.909> make<00:01:40.060> sure<00:01:40.210> that<00:01:40.329> you<00:01:40.420> actually<00:01:40.570> make<00:01:40.930> its

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
to make sure that you actually make its

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.760 
to make sure that you actually make its
harvest<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:43.240> order<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:43.810> get<00:01:43.990> these<00:01:44.200> these

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
harvest in order to get these these

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.590 
harvest in order to get these these
plants<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:45.759> point<00:01:46.030> where<00:01:46.240> they<00:01:46.420> are<00:01:46.450> ready

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
plants to the point where they are ready

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.109 
plants to the point where they are ready
to<00:01:46.960> desiccate<00:01:47.439> by<00:01:47.619> September<00:01:48.250> 10th<00:01:48.520> they<00:01:48.939> need

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
to desiccate by September 10th they need

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.499 
to desiccate by September 10th they need
to<00:01:49.240> be<00:01:49.360> seated<00:01:49.810> as<00:01:49.930> early<00:01:50.350> as<00:01:50.439> possible<00:01:50.530> and

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
to be seated as early as possible and

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.789 
to be seated as early as possible and
when<00:01:52.509> I<00:01:52.540> say<00:01:52.840> early<00:01:53.259> I<00:01:53.290> mean<00:01:53.710> by<00:01:53.950> May<00:01:54.700> 7th<00:01:55.270> and

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
when I say early I mean by May 7th and

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.170 
when I say early I mean by May 7th and
hopefully<00:01:56.799> no<00:01:56.950> later<00:01:57.250> than<00:01:57.340> that<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:57.909> the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
hopefully no later than that and the

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.700 
hopefully no later than that and the
reason<00:01:58.509> is<00:01:58.659> because<00:01:58.899> these<00:01:59.259> are<00:01:59.439> a<00:01:59.469> long

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
reason is because these are a long

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.819 
reason is because these are a long
season<00:02:00.159> crop<00:02:00.700> they<00:02:00.939> need<00:02:01.119> a<00:02:01.149> long<00:02:01.479> time<00:02:01.930> to

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
season crop they need a long time to

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.240 
season crop they need a long time to
mature<00:02:03.399> and<00:02:03.670> get<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:03.969> that<00:02:04.119> point<00:02:04.420> and<00:02:04.630> if

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
mature and get to that point and if

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.249 
mature and get to that point and if
September<00:02:06.250> 10th<00:02:06.490> comes<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.119> you<00:02:07.930> haven't

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
September 10th comes and you haven't

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.840 
September 10th comes and you haven't
seated<00:02:08.530> them<00:02:08.649> quite<00:02:08.829> early<00:02:09.009> enough<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.640> when

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
seated them quite early enough and when

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.370 
seated them quite early enough and when
you<00:02:09.940> do<00:02:10.149> desiccate<00:02:10.630> them<00:02:10.840> they'll<00:02:11.019> just<00:02:11.200> turn

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
you do desiccate them they'll just turn

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.080 
you do desiccate them they'll just turn
to<00:02:11.590> mush<00:02:11.829> because<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.310> seeds<00:02:12.519> are<00:02:12.640> quite<00:02:12.820> big

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
to mush because the seeds are quite big

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.690 
to mush because the seeds are quite big
and<00:02:13.329> they'll<00:02:14.260> just<00:02:14.560> completely<00:02:15.130> break<00:02:15.489> down

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
and they'll just completely break down

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.729 
and they'll just completely break down

seated<00:06:01.510> you<00:06:01.900> can<00:06:02.110> feed<00:06:02.440> those<00:06:02.680> to<00:06:02.979> the<00:06:03.100> Hogs

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
seated you can feed those to the Hogs

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.200 
seated you can feed those to the Hogs
and<00:06:04.030> any<00:06:04.419> mono<00:06:04.780> gastric<00:06:05.290> animal<00:06:05.770> but<00:06:06.400> with<00:06:07.030> the

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
and any mono gastric animal but with the

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.640 
and any mono gastric animal but with the
tip<00:06:07.360> with<00:06:07.510> the<00:06:07.570> addition<00:06:07.870> of<00:06:07.960> the<00:06:08.110> tannins<00:06:08.530> and

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
tip with the addition of the tannins and

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.520 
tip with the addition of the tannins and
the<00:06:08.770> larger<00:06:09.250> seeds<00:06:09.720> metal<00:06:10.720> gas<00:06:10.870> trucks<00:06:11.140> cannot

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
the larger seeds metal gas trucks cannot

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.950 
the larger seeds metal gas trucks cannot
handle<00:06:12.040> the<00:06:12.370> tannins<00:06:12.820> so<00:06:13.120> we<00:06:13.240> can't<00:06:13.450> feed<00:06:13.750> that

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
handle the tannins so we can't feed that

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.490 
handle the tannins so we can't feed that
so<00:06:14.650> the<00:06:15.250> smaller<00:06:16.030> ones<00:06:16.300> are<00:06:16.510> mixed<00:06:16.930> in<00:06:17.050> rations

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
so the smaller ones are mixed in rations

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.900 
so the smaller ones are mixed in rations
whereas<00:06:17.830> the<00:06:17.890> larger<00:06:18.190> ones<00:06:18.340> are<00:06:18.460> pretty<00:06:18.669> much

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
whereas the larger ones are pretty much

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.980 
whereas the larger ones are pretty much
exported<00:06:19.510> exclusively<00:06:20.350> to<00:06:21.690> Ethiopia<00:06:22.690> and

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
exported exclusively to Ethiopia and

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.980 
exported exclusively to Ethiopia and
Egypt<00:06:23.229> for<00:06:24.120> human<00:06:25.120> consumption<00:06:25.510> because<00:06:25.810> they

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
Egypt for human consumption because they

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.810 
Egypt for human consumption because they
they<00:06:26.229> actually<00:06:26.650> like<00:06:26.830> the<00:06:26.860> taste<00:06:27.220> of<00:06:27.430> the<00:06:27.580> of

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
they actually like the taste of the of

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.550 
they actually like the taste of the of
the<00:06:28.270> tannins<00:06:28.660> a<00:06:28.750> little<00:06:28.990> bit<00:06:29.140> like<00:06:29.290> to<00:06:29.410> have

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
the tannins a little bit like to have

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.370 
the tannins a little bit like to have
that<00:06:29.650> little<00:06:29.710> snap<00:06:30.220> in<00:06:31.180> in<00:06:31.660> the<00:06:31.780> flavor<00:06:32.050> they

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
that little snap in in the flavor they

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:40.350 
that little snap in in the flavor they
prefer<00:06:32.800> that<00:06:32.830> so<00:06:37.410> yes<00:06:38.490> yeah<00:06:39.490> they<00:06:40.060> grow<00:06:40.330> very

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
prefer that so yes yeah they grow very

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.060 
prefer that so yes yeah they grow very
much<00:06:40.750> the<00:06:41.169> same

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
much the same

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.070 
much the same
the<00:06:42.310> seeds<00:06:42.550> are<00:06:42.700> bigger<00:06:42.940> in<00:06:43.330> the<00:06:43.479> tannin<00:06:43.870> type

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
the seeds are bigger in the tannin type

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.670 
the seeds are bigger in the tannin type
so<00:06:44.290> the<00:06:44.410> pods<00:06:44.620> will<00:06:45.190> be<00:06:45.340> bigger<00:06:45.580> but<00:06:46.150> growth

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
so the pods will be bigger but growth

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.390 
so the pods will be bigger but growth
characteristics<00:06:47.680> are<00:06:47.830> pretty<00:06:48.040> much<00:06:48.220> exactly

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 
characteristics are pretty much exactly

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.479 
characteristics are pretty much exactly
the<00:06:48.760> same<00:06:48.850> yep
