00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
just messed up I don't know why but it

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.410

basically you can just get every berry

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.600 
basically you can just get every berry
so<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.140> pretty<00:02:10.319> cool<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:11.009> can<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.340> all

these berries the
slots<00:02:14.290> 999<00:02:15.290> but<00:02:15.980> that's<00:02:16.670> pretty<00:02:16.850> much<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.090> for

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
slots 999 but that's pretty much it for

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.330 
slots 999 but that's pretty much it for
the<00:02:17.360> berries<00:02:17.750> now<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.260> last<00:02:18.680> thing<00:02:18.920> that<00:02:19.069> they

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.400 
that you're missing and also they have a
Japanese<00:03:55.430> inkay<00:03:55.880> not<00:03:56.450> exactly<00:03:56.780> sure<00:03:56.989> what

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
Japanese inkay not exactly sure what

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.910 
Japanese inkay not exactly sure what
this<00:03:57.560> inkay<00:03:58.010> is<00:03:58.280> but<00:03:59.090> I<00:03:59.410> assume<00:04:00.410> it's<00:04:00.680> just

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
this inkay is but I assume it's just

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.250 
this inkay is but I assume it's just
some<00:04:01.519> event<00:04:01.850> random<00:04:02.329> event<00:04:02.570> in<00:04:02.780> k<00:04:02.959> that<00:04:03.140> they

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
some event random event in k that they

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.740 
some event random event in k that they
just<00:04:03.470> put<00:04:03.650> out<00:04:03.680> but<00:04:04.370> pretty<00:04:04.790> cool<00:04:05.030> that<00:04:05.540> they

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
just put out but pretty cool that they

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.080 
just put out but pretty cool that they
have<00:04:06.110> that<00:04:06.140> now<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:07.370> last<00:04:07.579> thing<00:04:07.730> that<00:04:07.970> they

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
have that now the last thing that they

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.030 
have that now the last thing that they
did<00:04:08.150> really<00:04:08.600> cool<00:04:09.019> they<00:04:09.470> have<00:04:09.500> a<00:04:09.680> language

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
did really cool they have a language

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.880 
did really cool they have a language
modifier<00:04:10.820> here<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:11.600> you<00:04:11.660> can<00:04:11.930> actually<00:04:12.109> change

modifier here so you can actually change

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.349 
modifier here so you can actually change
your<00:04:13.130> language<00:04:13.280> if<00:04:13.760> you<00:04:13.880> screwed<00:04:14.180> up<00:04:14.329> your

English you can switch to Japanese and

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.160 
English you can switch to Japanese and
it's<00:04:25.370> pretty<00:04:25.610> cool<00:04:25.849> because

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
it's pretty cool because

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.890 
it's pretty cool because
you<00:04:27.740> can't<00:04:28.040> switch<00:04:28.580> your<00:04:28.820> language<00:04:29.390> normally

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
you can't switch your language normally

you can't switch your language normally
I<00:04:29.930> don't<00:04:30.140> believe<00:04:30.350> so<00:04:30.670> basically<00:04:31.670> you<00:04:31.790> can

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
I don't believe so basically you can

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.850 
I don't believe so basically you can
switch<00:04:32.210> throughout<00:04:32.660> your<00:04:32.840> languages<00:04:33.410> and<00:04:33.680> try

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
switch throughout your languages and try

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.220 
switch throughout your languages and try
that<00:04:34.100> really<00:04:34.790> nice<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:35.270> that's<00:04:35.960> pretty<00:04:36.110> much

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
that really nice and that's pretty much

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.220 
that really nice and that's pretty much
it<00:04:36.350> for<00:04:36.560> version<00:04:37.160> 1.1<00:04:37.730> six<00:04:38.150> I'm<00:04:38.450> hoping<00:04:39.170> that

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
it for version 1.1 six I'm hoping that

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.820 
it for version 1.1 six I'm hoping that
they<00:04:39.530> put<00:04:39.880> more<00:04:40.880> like<00:04:41.600> items<00:04:42.170> and<00:04:42.380> stuff<00:04:42.500> in

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
here because other than that they

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.950 
here because other than that they
nothing's<00:04:46.330> nothing's<00:04:47.330> you<00:04:47.510> know<00:04:47.630> different
