00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
I hope they one day have a one piece

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.820 
I hope they one day have a one piece
versus<00:03:44.790> one<00:03:45.030> piece<00:03:45.270> singlet<00:03:45.750> match<00:03:46.020> so<00:03:46.410> we

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
versus one piece singlet match so we

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.380 
versus one piece singlet match so we
find<00:03:47.100> out<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.550> don't<00:03:47.640> know<00:03:47.880> what's<00:03:48.120> going

on<00:03:48.480> with<00:03:48.690> this<00:03:48.840> head<00:03:49.020> I<00:03:49.050> keep<00:03:49.320> coming<00:03:49.530> back<00:03:49.680> to

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
on with this head I keep coming back to

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.500 
on with this head I keep coming back to
that<00:03:50.010> this<00:03:50.250> said<00:03:50.459> what's<00:03:50.670> really<00:03:51.090> off<00:03:51.270> for

this<00:03:51.600> figure<00:03:51.959> which<00:03:52.410> is<00:03:52.440> disappointing

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
this figure which is disappointing

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.860 
this figure which is disappointing
because<00:03:53.250> it's<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.580> really<00:03:53.760> strong<00:03:54.270> ride<00:03:54.630> back

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
because it's a really strong ride back

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.290 
because it's a really strong ride back
piece<00:03:55.140> I<00:03:55.380> just<00:03:55.650> wish<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.459> head<00:03:56.700> match

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
piece I just wish that the head match

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.830 
piece I just wish that the head match
the<00:03:57.600> tone<00:03:57.840> of<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.320> body<00:03:59.180> let's<00:04:00.180> just<00:04:00.390> throw<00:04:00.570> is

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
the tone of the body let's just throw is

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.970 
the tone of the body let's just throw is
Ryback<00:04:01.440> rule<00:04:01.709> shirt<00:04:02.010> on

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.040 

and<00:04:07.980> he's<00:04:08.099> ready<00:04:08.459> for<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.940> world<00:04:09.209> now<00:04:09.810> what<00:04:09.959> do

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.449 
and he's ready for the world now what do
I<00:04:10.110> think<00:04:10.230> about<00:04:10.500> this<00:04:10.770> figure<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.370> the

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
I think about this figure and the

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.940 
I think about this figure and the
supplies<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:12.750> accessories<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:13.709> think

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
supplies and the accessories I think

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.930 
supplies and the accessories I think
that<00:04:14.130> it's<00:04:14.310> it's<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.510> good<00:04:16.079> good<00:04:16.620> -<00:04:16.980> accessory
