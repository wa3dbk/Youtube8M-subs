00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.220
 early in the morning 7 o'clock faced with the fact that 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.460
 some actions take place on the back yard 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.939
 3 so wake up 7 hours and at the theater 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.950
 The backyard is such a figovina 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.050
 figovina will be digging 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.119
 violation 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:34.220

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.220
 sewer measures that is what thing 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.870
 to measure doryl what lead removed 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:49.180
 there follows plywood was a shield as well 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:51.030

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.909

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.189
 gas I asked a guy what is this 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.859
 device means it is a laser device 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.619
 which level is shown 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:22.880
 tilt angle because when they 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.890
 sewage being made means they need 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.240
 a certain angle to observe this 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.789
 laser bullshit don't honestly know how 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.619

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.159

 This parses on Soviet times ace 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:09.000
 the shaft of the worm is much thicker than its fig bend 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:12.329
 in general, that is, it is very 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.040
 non-flexible material roofing material I remember 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:17.709
 bargaining rolls delivered 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.350
 I don't know what you can call here 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.260
 simple thing 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.150
 here they are like roofs like 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.360
 it's on ours already 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.010
 there is a lot of work here too 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.010
 due to the fact that there is incised 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:45.300
 it will also be such a light on the light 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.110

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.110

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.629

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.319
 and a narrow bucket that is not here 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.319

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.040
 Hello UTB 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.740
 remnants of former luxury we are not easy 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.740
 big hotels 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.580
 curtains 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.580
 get away from him 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.720
 big Stone 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.720
 single 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.160
 ogosport human hand 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.980
 I became a great pleasure because 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.310
 it is dangerous 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.390
 did not know so far I am shooting 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.250
 through the glass from our home and 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.440
 maybe hear synthon's voice she 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:46.519
 took another and there to her 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:50.629
 shoots in parallel with me I thought 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:53.010
 need to shoot while it is physically in time 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.340
 unable 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.340
 So 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:04.319
 I would say that just as if apparently not 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.480
 All finished work front, something like 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.350
 it is unlikely that their task is to align 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.870
 something 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:15.310
 I must say that there is already a design 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:18.310
 landscape design deal and will be there 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.490
 a couple of levels in 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.280
 the land they organize there 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:28.100
 example there and away 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.010
 network don't you think he's trying 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.410
 something to do under the future 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.410
 landscaped work beautiful place of work 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.310
 and someone just imagine a platform I already see 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.020
 how are you going to cop editor right now 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.489

00:04:47.489 --> 00:05:04.599
 here is a small moth that big tree 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:05:09.569
 It is a beautiful well, that's a 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:09.569
 feeling that it is behind him 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.240
 see how he is neat and so 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.240
 neat video 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.250
 one 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.980
 joystick 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:56.990
 this show is passing 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.990
