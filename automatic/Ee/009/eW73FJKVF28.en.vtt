00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello dear fans we want you shortly 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.770
 to introduce a game and indeed to 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.750
 Perfect 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.389
 that is just reduced is free 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.969
 available and costs 2 39 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.560
 We just want a game like that 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.400
 show a level, we play such a yes 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.560
 cell 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.330
 we have to deal with the heidi 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.220
 Scientists kill those here 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.260
 soldiers and terrorists 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.869
 In addition we can or we must 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.699
 just free our colleagues and do so 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.260
 music here through the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.620
 different levels are a total of 35 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.219
 and five worlds and how to get here 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.829
 sees you move just always so in 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.969
 the direction where the father is and us 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.160
 go now just up here long 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.320
 you can not be long and you can not 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.200
 There is one more skill this one 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.000
 Let's introduce you to the then 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.020
 can infect colleagues here and then 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.699
 they are just dead 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.969
 we already have a boyfriend 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.190
 collected and we can ours 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.010
 namely cells also divide and total 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.579
 with up to five people at 15 at a time 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.920
 play 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.060
 that's what you need, for example, whenever 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.770
 you activate two things at the same time 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.909
 must then can the cell part 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.890
 Now we get here for example 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.720
 even the hint if we have one 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.310
 we want elite soldiers 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.320
 within rear attack because 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.070
 otherwise that will not be us 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.250
 Let's see you again 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.330
 turn around and try again 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.799
 otherwise we could be up here as well 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.650
 hide it again 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.700
 works and but that went now 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.659
 directly we go up here and 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.700
 try us here too 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.110
 to sneak either you two about 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.329
 to attack or make 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.240
 you double-click it will be 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.040
 also executed 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.800
 but still we can live the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.680
 Turks was then make us rise 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.760
 ok the elite soldier and we hide 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.560
 let's go up here now we can 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.250
 example so with two fingers the cell 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.620
 divide, for example, to distract us or we 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.000
 go now just down here there 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.040
 Of course, it was a bit too late now 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.990
 now have distracted him and could 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.970
 to eliminate them from the inside and us 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.930
 then put it together again and then 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.450
 continue playing again 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.550
 that the complete game principle is coming 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.820
 probably a few more 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.910
 We have to do some actions here 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.290
 are now only in zone b level 5 78 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.850
 about I do not know exactly and 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.290
 have now reached the exit here 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.890
 and then see who's okay 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.420
 we killed all the buildings and 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.850
 then get the time here 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.500
 displayed for the long we were long 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.780
 needed and that's a lot 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.690
 complete game there is fun here 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.330
 it still in the options few options 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.920
 for music sound and so on you can do that 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.959
 turn on the game center so that the 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.959
 high scores are registered there and 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.330
 As you can see, there are 35 levels in total 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.870
 five sections for free on each 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.870
 case recommendations
