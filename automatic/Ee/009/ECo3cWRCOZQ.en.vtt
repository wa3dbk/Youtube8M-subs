00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.670 
close so my first time really initial
thoughts<00:03:34.420> was<00:03:34.690> that<00:03:34.810> this<00:03:35.020> thing<00:03:35.080> is<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.500> lot

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
thoughts was that this thing is a lot

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.500 
thoughts was that this thing is a lot
heavier<00:03:36.130> than<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.490> thought<00:03:36.670> it<00:03:36.820> would<00:03:36.910> be<00:03:37.060> which

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
heavier than I thought it would be which

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.560 
heavier than I thought it would be which
is<00:03:37.630> really<00:03:37.810> cool<00:03:37.990> is<00:03:38.140> I<00:03:38.200> really<00:03:38.410> feel<00:03:38.560> like<00:03:38.590> the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
is really cool is I really feel like the

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.600 
is really cool is I really feel like the
quality's<00:03:40.570> there<00:03:40.920> everything's<00:03:41.920> really<00:03:42.070> real

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
quality's there everything's really real

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.480 
quality's there everything's really real
maybe<00:03:42.790> it's<00:03:43.000> hard<00:03:43.240> plastic<00:03:43.810> everywhere<00:03:44.490> the

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
maybe it's hard plastic everywhere the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.100 
maybe it's hard plastic everywhere the
straw<00:03:45.820> I<00:03:45.850> guess<00:03:46.150> that's<00:03:46.330> what<00:03:46.480> you<00:03:46.570> call<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:46.780> is

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
straw I guess that's what you call it is

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.410 
straw I guess that's what you call it is

same<00:04:44.759> as<00:04:44.819> the<00:04:45.029> other<00:04:45.149> two<00:04:45.360> if<00:04:45.509> not<00:04:45.689> worse<00:04:46.050> it

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319 
same as the other two if not worse it

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.790 
same as the other two if not worse it
kind<00:04:46.499> of<00:04:46.529> looks<00:04:46.710> like<00:04:46.800> it<00:04:48.169> not<00:04:49.169> as<00:04:49.319> much<00:04:49.499> on<00:04:49.680> the

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
kind of looks like it not as much on the

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.359 
kind of looks like it not as much on the
hood<00:04:49.949> as<00:04:50.129> the<00:04:50.430> honeydew<00:04:50.969> as<00:04:51.449> the<00:04:51.719> mr.<00:04:52.559> pink<00:04:52.770> I

00:04:55.359 --> 00:04:55.369 

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:58.189 

would<00:04:56.369> say<00:04:56.610> it's<00:04:56.819> a<00:04:56.909> tie<00:04:57.089> if<00:04:57.360> not<00:04:57.599> a<00:04:57.899> little

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
would say it's a tie if not a little

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.570 
would say it's a tie if not a little
worse<00:05:00.319> alright<00:05:01.319> so<00:05:01.589> for<00:05:01.740> my<00:05:01.889> final<00:05:02.159> thought

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
worse alright so for my final thought

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.189 
worse alright so for my final thought
between<00:05:02.789> these<00:05:03.149> things<00:05:03.419> again<00:05:03.809> I've<00:05:04.110> already

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199

it<00:05:09.389> for<00:05:09.569> $90<00:05:10.139> and<00:05:10.409> I<00:05:10.499> would<00:05:10.620> totally<00:05:10.860> do<00:05:11.279> it

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370

the 2 bucket method so 5 out of 5 for

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.679 
the 2 bucket method so 5 out of 5 for
that<00:05:31.409> if<00:05:32.219> it<00:05:32.430> was<00:05:32.550> just<00:05:32.759> one<00:05:32.969> be<00:05:33.089> 25<00:05:33.509> dollars

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:33.689 
that if it was just one be 25 dollars

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:35.769 
that if it was just one be 25 dollars
cheaper<00:05:34.050> I'd<00:05:34.409> recommend<00:05:34.800> it<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:34.889> anybody<00:05:35.219> but

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:35.779 
cheaper I'd recommend it to anybody but

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:37.730 
cheaper I'd recommend it to anybody but
some<00:05:36.779> it<00:05:36.930> does<00:05:37.050> have<00:05:37.229> a<00:05:37.259> little<00:05:37.409> more<00:05:37.620> of<00:05:37.680> a

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
some it does have a little more of a

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.139 
some it does have a little more of a
high<00:05:37.889> price<00:05:38.189> tag<00:05:38.399> maybe<00:05:38.729> it's<00:05:38.909> not<00:05:38.999> as

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:39.149 
high price tag maybe it's not as

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:42.589 
high price tag maybe it's not as
expensive<00:05:39.479> to<00:05:39.870> you<00:05:40.229> as<00:05:40.469> it<00:05:40.589> is<00:05:40.620> to<00:05:40.860> me<00:05:41.009> but<00:05:41.879> yeah

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
expensive to you as it is to me but yeah

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:44.959 
expensive to you as it is to me but yeah
still<00:05:43.080> 5<00:05:43.499> out<00:05:43.649> of<00:05:43.680> 5<00:05:43.830> just<00:05:44.279> partial<00:05:44.849> is<00:05:44.939> a

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:44.969 
still 5 out of 5 just partial is a

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:48.799 
still 5 out of 5 just partial is a
little<00:05:45.149> cheap<00:05:46.069> now<00:05:47.069> between<00:05:47.309> the<00:05:47.490> soaps<00:05:47.809> this

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:48.809 
little cheap now between the soaps this

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:51.290 
little cheap now between the soaps this
was<00:05:48.990> kind<00:05:49.169> of<00:05:49.199> interesting<00:05:49.649> I<00:05:49.769> think<00:05:50.059> now<00:05:51.059> on

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
was kind of interesting I think now on

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.239 
was kind of interesting I think now on
the<00:05:51.419> website<00:05:51.599> this<00:05:52.379> is<00:05:52.439> rated<00:05:52.979> the<00:05:53.129> highest

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:53.249 
the website this is rated the highest

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:57.769 
the website this is rated the highest
foaming<00:05:54.240> soap<00:05:54.599> mr.<00:05:55.379> pink<00:05:55.680> is<00:05:55.949> second<00:05:56.629> but<00:05:57.629> on

00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:57.779 
foaming soap mr. pink is second but on

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:00.619 
foaming soap mr. pink is second but on
the<00:05:57.870> tests<00:05:58.319> shown<00:05:58.620> today<00:05:58.830> I<00:05:59.309> think<00:05:59.430> that<00:06:00.089> this

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:00.629 
the tests shown today I think that this

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:04.790 
the tests shown today I think that this
did<00:06:01.279> the<00:06:02.279> worst<00:06:02.519> out<00:06:02.819> of<00:06:02.939> the<00:06:03.029> 3<00:06:03.240> or<00:06:03.800> really

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
did the worst out of the 3 or really

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.619 
did the worst out of the 3 or really
maybe<00:06:04.979> maybe<00:06:05.339> should<00:06:05.550> be<00:06:05.580> second<00:06:05.969> place<00:06:05.999> um

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:06.629 
maybe maybe should be second place um

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:09.049 
maybe maybe should be second place um
but<00:06:07.620> I'm<00:06:07.709> gonna<00:06:07.800> say<00:06:07.979> worst<00:06:08.219> of<00:06:08.430> the<00:06:08.550> three<00:06:08.580> for

00:06:09.049 --> 00:06:09.059 
but I'm gonna say worst of the three for

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:10.850 
but I'm gonna say worst of the three for
summary<00:06:09.360> it<00:06:09.509> may<00:06:09.689> be<00:06:09.749> in<00:06:10.169> a<00:06:10.319> gas<00:06:10.499> pressure

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
summary it may be in a gas pressure

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.179 
summary it may be in a gas pressure
situation<00:06:11.719> be<00:06:12.719> different<00:06:13.050> but<00:06:13.229> my<00:06:13.740> electric

00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:14.189 
situation be different but my electric

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:16.249 
situation be different but my electric
situation<00:06:14.729> I<00:06:14.819> think<00:06:15.089> the<00:06:15.209> honeydew<00:06:15.509> did<00:06:16.110> not

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
situation I think the honeydew did not

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:17.719 
situation I think the honeydew did not
do<00:06:16.439> as<00:06:16.529> good<00:06:16.649> as<00:06:16.800> these<00:06:16.919> 2<00:06:17.159> even<00:06:17.459> though<00:06:17.490> I<00:06:17.580> use

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
do as good as these 2 even though I use

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.899 
do as good as these 2 even though I use
the<00:06:17.849> same<00:06:18.059> amount<00:06:18.180> of<00:06:18.419> soap<00:06:18.599> all<00:06:18.809> three<00:06:19.139> tests

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:19.909 
the same amount of soap all three tests

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:23.959 
the same amount of soap all three tests
I<00:06:20.930> just<00:06:21.930> think<00:06:22.139> that<00:06:22.289> that<00:06:22.349> didn't<00:06:22.860> do<00:06:23.069> as<00:06:23.309> good

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:23.969 
I just think that that didn't do as good

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:26.839 
I just think that that didn't do as good
so<00:06:24.360> we<00:06:24.689> replace<00:06:24.990> to<00:06:25.139> that<00:06:25.319> so<00:06:26.189> second<00:06:26.669> place

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:26.849 
so we replace to that so second place

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:29.869 
so we replace to that so second place
goes<00:06:27.209> between<00:06:27.479> these<00:06:27.930> two<00:06:28.259> and<00:06:28.529> I<00:06:29.039> think<00:06:29.729> it's

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:29.879 
goes between these two and I think it's

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.749 
goes between these two and I think it's
a<00:06:29.969> really<00:06:30.149> close<00:06:30.449> thing<00:06:31.050> but<00:06:31.469> I'm<00:06:32.399> gonna<00:06:32.580> have

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 
a really close thing but I'm gonna have

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:36.300 
a really close thing but I'm gonna have
to<00:06:32.939> give<00:06:33.149> first<00:06:33.629> mr.<00:06:34.169> pink

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
to give first mr. pink

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:43.010 
to give first mr. pink
emphasis<00:06:36.730> did<00:06:37.000> more<00:06:38.640> suds<00:06:39.640> than<00:06:40.000> McGuire's

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020

the time I bought that for nine other
prices<00:07:24.010> might<00:07:24.160> be<00:07:24.250> different<00:07:24.520> now<00:07:24.610> they<00:07:24.910> might

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.030 
prices might be different now they might

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.010 
prices might be different now they might
more<00:07:25.240> expensive<00:07:25.750> but<00:07:25.960> yeah<00:07:26.110> anyway<00:07:27.750> yeah<00:07:28.750> so

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.020 
more expensive but yeah anyway yeah so

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.210 
but if they would come down in price on

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.880 
but if they would come down in price on
that<00:07:31.390> and<00:07:31.600> maybe<00:07:31.720> match<00:07:31.990> the<00:07:32.230> size<00:07:32.530> of<00:07:32.770> this

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:32.890 
that and maybe match the size of this

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.960 
that and maybe match the size of this
