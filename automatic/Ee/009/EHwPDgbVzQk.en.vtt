studying and practicing it you'll be

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.060 
studying and practicing it you'll be
able<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.630> internalize<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.649> you'll<00:01:52.950> be

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
able to internalize it and you'll be

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.310 
able to internalize it and you'll be
able<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.310> utilize<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.909> information<00:01:54.290> for<00:01:55.290> a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
able to utilize the information for a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.520 
able to utilize the information for a
very<00:01:55.619> long<00:01:55.860> time<00:01:56.689> this<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.869> how<00:01:58.020> they're<00:01:58.409> going

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
very long time this is how they're going

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.410 
very long time this is how they're going
to<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.680> doing<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.070> at<00:01:59.189> field<00:01:59.430> training<00:01:59.729> now<00:02:00.180> at

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
to be doing it at field training now at

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.120 
to be doing it at field training now at
your<00:02:00.570> field<00:02:00.869> training<00:02:01.170> encampment<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.799> might

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
your field training encampment it might

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.580 
your field training encampment it might
be<00:02:02.250> doing<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.579> different<00:02:02.939> for<00:02:03.509> example<00:02:04.020> they

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
be doing it different for example they

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.620 
be doing it different for example they
might<00:02:04.770> just<00:02:04.950> have<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.399> open<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> ranks<00:02:06.509> up

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
might just have you open the ranks up

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.330 
might just have you open the ranks up
before<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.140> inspector<00:02:07.530> even<00:02:07.740> gets<00:02:07.950> there<00:02:08.160> if

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
before the inspector even gets there if

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.309 
before the inspector even gets there if
that's<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.270> case<00:02:09.450> then

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
that's the case then

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.239 
that's the case then
I<00:02:10.349> do<00:02:10.829> it<00:02:10.950> exactly<00:02:11.069> exactly<00:02:11.790> as<00:02:12.090> they<00:02:12.209> say

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:13.249 
I do it exactly exactly as they say

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:17.330 
I do it exactly exactly as they say
right<00:02:14.249> for<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.629> purposes<00:02:16.079> here<00:02:16.469> we're<00:02:17.219> going

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
right for the purposes here we're going

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.800 
right for the purposes here we're going
to<00:02:17.400> learn<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.700> full<00:02:17.909> breadth<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.359> it<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.689> the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
to learn the full breadth of it and the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.690 
to learn the full breadth of it and the
full<00:02:18.989> length<00:02:19.139> of<00:02:19.319> it<00:02:19.439> just<00:02:19.889> as<00:02:20.010> they<00:02:20.579> would

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
full length of it just as they would

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.170 
full length of it just as they would
have<00:02:20.879> you<00:02:21.090> do<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.689> in<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.319> real<00:02:22.439> life<00:02:22.560> force<00:02:23.180> so

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
have you do it in the real life force so

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.940 
have you do it in the real life force so
keep<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.569> in<00:02:24.689> mind<00:02:24.989> use<00:02:25.620> all<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.920> resources

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
keep that in mind use all the resources

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.369 
keep that in mind use all the resources
that<00:02:26.519> you<00:02:26.639> have<00:02:26.730> here<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.359> you'll<00:02:28.230> be

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
that you have here and you'll be

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.140 
that you have here and you'll be
successful<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:29.099> you'll<00:02:29.280> have<00:02:29.459> open<00:02:30.000> ranks

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
successful and you'll have open ranks

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.230 
successful and you'll have open ranks
down<00:02:30.450> pat
