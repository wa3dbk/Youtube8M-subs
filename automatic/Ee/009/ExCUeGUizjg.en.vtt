00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.880

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.710
 Of course not all answer

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.119
 Of course I would be glad if you

 in the video a positive rating of 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.469
 Last the first question comes from sitting like 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.170
 before is asking what's your favorite 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.940
 season and I personally say that 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.860
 It's summer and winter as if it was not like that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.890
 a favorite season I say so 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.750
 I like skiing and that's why I like it 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.280
 stop also the winter but I'd say 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.170
 the summer is already really cool 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.000
 you need is just warm and 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.379
 Winter is also skiing 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.600
 content is standing around or that's just it 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.160
 sometimes really cold and that's why 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.899
 he is the summer but I am also the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.850
 winter completely new the second question 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.859
 which languages â€‹â€‹can you all speak? 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.059
 does not have to be liquid so just 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.510
 at least a bit 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.710
 I 'm in school with Latin 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.840
 as a second foreign language and come with it 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.850
 just can not cope and I will 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.860
 even now in the next school year stop 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.420
 Deselect and I can still speak English 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.250
 but that should of course be clear that 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.890
 Yes, practically everyone in the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.960
 school is and the third question is who has 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.430
 stole the biscuit from the tin and me 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.020
 We did not steal in any case 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.930
 have stolen then I want him in any 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.820
 come back and that will not work 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.619
 daily ration of biscuits because of that 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.439
 please leave my loose in peace and quiet 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.650
 nothing clown please the next question 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.770
 comes from visor 23h school taught 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.909
 dx the hashtag few kicks do you think so 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.380
 that for the ps3 also the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.590
 underbody lighting is coming or about 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.820
 not no i do not think so 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.140
 First, why should rockstar do that 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.759
 Now it's already done that way 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.890
 long ago that the underbody lighting 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.250
 falls for the ps4 issue resp 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.780
 she was already on the ps4 and respectively on 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.250
 the nextgen consoles and i believe 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.110
 not that now rockstar always for 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.340
 Above all, the ps3 wants it 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.340
 of course, that the people also the ps3 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.869
 buy ps4 and xbox version or the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.280
 pc version that's why I think so 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.929
 not that they underbody lighting 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.610
 you come or she is her 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.190
 just add a game then 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.780
 then writes ps wishes from 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.340
 wien thank you that we also have one 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.709
 Austrian audience is looking forward to it 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.340
 every case the next question comes from 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.989
 made in korea rostock game club hash 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.030
 tech freaks makes when a fan meeting 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.770
 Of course, people are a bit 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.000
 difficult i come from hessen how many 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.890
 know and i do not know if at all 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.200
 you do something like that at all 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.370
 makes or even then anyone 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.810
 comes and so I of course 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.090
 do not stand alone 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.670
 that's why the first time is up anyway 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.590
 ice but if somehow people 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.790
 questioning photo environment come there can 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.920
 Of course we can do that too 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.660
 Of course you can also ask questions and so on 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.010
 come here but not now 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.269
 no way such a huge one 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.280
 make a fancy people 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.420
 there you have to already then you have to 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.040
 now also the community one more 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.390
 be a little bit bigger or 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.459
 we have to look even more people 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.550
 and want that right and then out 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.290
 but I know some cities 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.430
 live in Frankfurt or in 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.079
 near Frankfurt 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.180
 if there are a few people interested 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.799
 but i will not be in the moment 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.609
 You have to make a mistake then 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.560
 wait a bit longer 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.969
 or if at some point 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.769
 a bit bigger 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:22.390
 should then perhaps you can the times 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.790
 At some point but at the moment it is 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.139
 just do not hold the next one 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.879
 question comes from guadalupe manufacturer 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.540

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.030

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.560
 In addition I say I know some 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.400
 Youtube many do that too 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.980

 So I know here from youtube

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.340
 Personally, I would again like to 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:59.500

 So maybe a few know 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.180
 the first hit the clicks follow so 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.260
 really like three people do not like 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.689

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.960
 and generally like little youtuber 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.479

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.949

 so of these three youtube if 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.460
 I would meet the times personally 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:54.250
 that would be the last question 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.729
 would you like to have school people what 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.169
 What should this question be? 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:01.120
 one of you here watching this video 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.800

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.070
 very short 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.659

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:10.090
 Comments 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.120
 Who of you likes to go to school? 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.409
 is of course accepted I say so 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.880
 if you are so in the 89th 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:17.440
 tenth grade is who is still there 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.900
 Please like the school I say completely 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.300
 Honestly 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.669
 Many people just do not mind 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.020
 want to want home want your peace 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.000
 want to gamble 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.620
 Hobbies says, what do I know about you? 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.120
 want to do and there is still no 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.729
 human being at school i know 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.160
 of course, a few where I say yes 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.630
 they have no life and that 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.759
 focus only on school 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.840
 Personally, let's say you have to 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.240
 just keep separating so much 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.580
 school and leisure so I'll say so 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.840
 Leisure is so important to me 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.669
 I do not always like to go to school 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.440
 Concentrate white say if I am now 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.630
 so i am now asking teenagers 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.370
 or a child if not me now 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.600
 I'll do what I can in ten years 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.699
 somehow I regret made as a child 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.949
 to have 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:59.210
 That's why I'm doing now before me 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:01.130
 then someday out of this kindes or 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.330
 adolescents age out and then 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.050
 said why I did that then and then 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.090
 not done yet 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.789
 that's why I'm doing this just now prefer 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.840
 and then not sometime later 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:10.039
 that's why school is not my thing 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.150
 important and I do not go that way 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:12.620
 really like to go to school 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.630
 especially not because I always like that 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.389
 get up early the need had gone there 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.400
 everybody asks people like me that we are here 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.690
 has fallen again and if that is the 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.479
 case then i would of course 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.889
 about a rating or about 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.660
