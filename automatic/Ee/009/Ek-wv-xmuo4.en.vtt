00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
in the previous two fights so you have a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.240 
in the previous two fights so you have a

better<00:02:38.750> fighter<00:02:39.190> this<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.370> amazing<00:02:40.730> this<00:02:41.030> is

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
better fighter this is amazing this is

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.270 
better fighter this is amazing this is
unbelievable<00:02:41.720> both<00:02:42.349> fighters<00:02:42.650> are<00:02:42.980> building

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
unbelievable both fighters are building

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.250 
unbelievable both fighters are building
their<00:02:43.340> legacy<00:02:43.879> and<00:02:44.090> i<00:02:44.450> think<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:44.989> amount

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
their legacy and i think that the amount

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.899 
their legacy and i think that the amount
of<00:02:45.379> interest<00:02:45.769> and<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.220> amount<00:02:46.400> press<00:02:46.670> around

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
of interest and the amount press around

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.910 
of interest and the amount press around
that<00:02:47.120> would<00:02:47.299> be<00:02:47.450> even<00:02:47.690> more<00:02:48.049> so<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:48.799> think

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
that would be even more so and I think

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.009 
that would be even more so and I think
this<00:02:49.310> this<00:02:49.879> just<00:02:50.180> sets<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.569> the<00:02:50.780> bar<00:02:50.989> even

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
this this just sets it the bar even

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.379 
this this just sets it the bar even
higher<00:02:51.290> in<00:02:51.709> terms<00:02:52.099> of<00:02:52.220> of<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.700> intensity<00:02:53.150> and

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:53.389 
higher in terms of of the intensity and

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.020 
higher in terms of of the intensity and
the<00:02:53.450> emotion<00:02:54.139> Ryland<00:02:54.379> spike<00:02:54.590> I'm<00:02:55.489> sure<00:02:55.790> the

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
the emotion Ryland spike I'm sure the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.270
