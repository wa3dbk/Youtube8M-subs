00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.120 
says makeup remover and I just finished
it<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.330> thought<00:01:27.570> I'd<00:01:27.720> film<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.980> know<00:01:29.100> a

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
it so I thought I'd film you know a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.520 
it so I thought I'd film you know a
video<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.670> me<00:01:29.850> making<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.540> again<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.350> only

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
video of me making it again the only

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.110 
video of me making it again the only
thing<00:01:31.620> you<00:01:31.860> need<00:01:31.980> to<00:01:32.040> keep<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.670> mind<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.090> that

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
thing you need to keep in mind is that

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.020 
thing you need to keep in mind is that
you<00:01:33.480> want<00:01:33.720> more<00:01:33.960> oil<00:01:34.260> than<00:01:34.920> water<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.730> if

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
you want more oil than water so if

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.500 
you want more oil than water so if
you're<00:01:36.480> going<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.690> put<00:01:37.430> half<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.270> filled

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
you're going to put half of it filled

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.810 
you're going to put half of it filled
with<00:01:39.660> oil<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.440> aren't<00:01:40.680> less<00:01:40.920> than<00:01:41.280> half<00:01:41.520> of

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
with oil you aren't less than half of

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.150 
with oil you aren't less than half of
water<00:01:42.260> that's<00:01:43.260> all<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.470> got<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.680> keep<00:01:43.800> in<00:01:43.950> mind

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
water that's all you got to keep in mind

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.950 
water that's all you got to keep in mind
there's<00:01:44.400> it<00:01:44.880> always<00:01:45.060> has<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.420> more<00:01:45.750> oil

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
there's it always has to have more oil

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.530 
there's it always has to have more oil
because<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:47.040> oil<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.550> what's<00:01:47.970> going<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.270> take

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
because the oil is what's going to take

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.950 
because the oil is what's going to take
off<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.050> makeup<00:01:49.260> um<00:01:49.850> honestly<00:01:50.850> sometimes<00:01:51.750> I

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
off the makeup um honestly sometimes I

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.690 
off the makeup um honestly sometimes I
don't<00:01:52.020> even<00:01:52.260> use<00:01:52.470> water<00:01:52.710> sometimes<00:01:53.190> I'll<00:01:53.370> just

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
don't even use water sometimes I'll just

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.080 
don't even use water sometimes I'll just
use<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.360> alone<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.350> um<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.820> feels

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
use this alone but um it just feels

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.890 
use this alone but um it just feels
really<00:01:57.630> gross<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:59.159> use<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.940> oil<00:02:00.120> so

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
really gross if I just use the oil so

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.390 
really gross if I just use the oil so
that's<00:02:01.080> why<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.260> add<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> little<00:02:01.890> bit<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.100> water

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
that's why I add a little bit of water

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.290 
that's why I add a little bit of water
to<00:02:02.720> kind<00:02:03.720> of<00:02:04.220> make<00:02:05.220> it<00:02:05.250> not<00:02:05.520> as<00:02:05.760> heavy<00:02:06.090> and

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
to kind of make it not as heavy and

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.820 
to kind of make it not as heavy and
disgusting<00:02:06.900> even<00:02:07.200> though<00:02:07.260> I<00:02:07.290> wash<00:02:07.560> my<00:02:07.800> face

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
disgusting even though I wash my face

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.850
