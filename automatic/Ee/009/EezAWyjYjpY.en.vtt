00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 I'll show you today like you a whole 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.700
 can crochet simple flower when the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.849
 by the way, I have it all thread 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.880
 slowly so hard is for you can you 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.859
 It also with an air mesh chain 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.490
 make the beginning 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.779
 So you hit four stitches 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.789
 and includes the whole round 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.789
 a chain mesh and into this mouth 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.530
 in between did the same as us 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:39.300
 now it is nicer with the flags ring 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.510
 of course with a threadbare ring good 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.050
 thread it closes with an air mesh 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:54.720
 two air stitches three air stitches 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:58.350
 and now you're 11 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:03.510
 more chopsticks into the whole town 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.900
 that is, once the envelope goes there 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.820
 you put an envelope in the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:15.030
 in the middle of your ring brings in the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:17.310
 thread high only goes through two stitches 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:27.600
 pick him up again and then again 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:31.640
 two and he just does that 11x12 me 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.640
 turn the whole thing up fast 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.179
 its finished behind the ring 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.250
 the short end but only if it with 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.369
 have made a threadbare ring differently 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.829
 it does not work and pulls it to 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.069
 close her by putting her in the 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:01.640
 top air mass think third 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:05.319
 woodpecker and a chain mesh does so 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.319
 got the thread 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:14.769
 and pull him through the net and through 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.769
 the loop on the ash by 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.790
 then you make two air meshes in 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.870
 the next 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:29.750
 but makes an envelope and makes 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:34.400
 a whole town in the same 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:38.390
 Masche makes her three more that 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.920
 in a mesh so four sticks in it 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:47.750
 are what I have now three and one 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:51.950
 last time you make two air again 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.590
 mesh plugged into the nearest mesh 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.340
 then do like your chains mesh 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.590
 made again two air meshes made 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.709
 an envelope and move on to the next 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.590
 mesh four chopsticks so the same 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:12.160
 as made vorrink petal 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.160
 have and so it goes on 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.730
 So again two air masses in the nix 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:26.150
 grooving makes a chain mesh 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:30.109
 again meshed and made the 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:34.540
 next piece for pie I'll 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.540
 Now turn the whole thing fast 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:49.170
 and you are not in the back again 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:53.280
 same air mesh and make one 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:56.100
 chain stitch at the end and finished 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.800
 your flowers have fun imitating 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.800
 and a crochet happy day
