00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.390 
the side here as well later on we're in
the<00:02:29.600> midst<00:02:29.780> bit<00:02:30.050> more<00:02:30.290> rigid<00:02:30.500> I'll<00:02:30.830> put<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.310> on

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
the midst bit more rigid I'll put it on

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.040 
the midst bit more rigid I'll put it on
the<00:02:31.520> fat<00:02:31.730> side<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:32.150> crisp<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.540> fat<00:02:32.720> as<00:02:32.900> well

the fat side to crisp the fat as well
but<00:02:33.650> at<00:02:33.800> this<00:02:33.920> point<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:34.220> can't<00:02:34.460> do<00:02:34.610> that

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
but at this point I can't do that

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.930 
but at this point I can't do that
an<00:02:35.810> interesting<00:02:36.320> fact<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.770> learned<00:02:37.040> one

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
an interesting fact that I learned one

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.790 
an interesting fact that I learned one
year<00:02:38.240> working<00:02:38.720> with<00:02:38.960> the<00:02:39.050> caterer<00:02:39.380> up<00:02:39.560> in<00:02:39.710> the

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
year working with the caterer up in the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.820 
year working with the caterer up in the
towel<00:02:40.300> was<00:02:41.300> if<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.750> do<00:02:41.960> a<00:02:41.990> piece<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.440> meat<00:02:42.620> on

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
towel was if you do a piece of meat on

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.520 
towel was if you do a piece of meat on
the<00:02:43.010> fire<00:02:43.220> like<00:02:43.400> this<00:02:43.580> you<00:02:44.300> leave<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.720> until

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
the fire like this you leave it until

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.040 
the fire like this you leave it until
the<00:02:45.620> blood<00:02:45.830> surfaces<00:02:46.550> on<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.180> top<00:02:47.420> they

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
the blood surfaces on to the top they

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.020 
the blood surfaces on to the top they
know<00:02:48.260> they're<00:02:48.440> one<00:02:48.590> sides<00:02:48.920> ready<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.640> turn<00:02:49.910> it

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
know they're one sides ready you turn it

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.180 
know they're one sides ready you turn it
over<00:02:50.320> for<00:02:51.320> another<00:02:51.500> five<00:02:51.740> minutes

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
over for another five minutes

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.990 
over for another five minutes
and<00:02:52.280> often<00:02:53.090> rais'd<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:55.430> can<00:02:55.550> see<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.790> little

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
and often rais'd you can see a little

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.580 
and often rais'd you can see a little
bit<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.300> blood<00:02:56.480> coming<00:02:56.690> through<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:57.140> don't<00:02:57.500> like

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
bit of blood coming through I don't like

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.949 
bit of blood coming through I don't like
keeping<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:58.120> too<00:02:59.120> long<00:02:59.330> in<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.510> final<00:02:59.810> see

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
keeping it too long in the final see

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.140 
keeping it too long in the final see
it'll<00:03:00.110> be<00:03:00.200> nice<00:03:00.410> coloring<00:03:00.770> now<00:03:00.890> turn<00:03:01.790> around

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
it'll be nice coloring now turn around

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.490 
it'll be nice coloring now turn around

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
me I like a medium rain you can look for

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.750 
me I like a medium rain you can look for
example<00:03:09.110> they<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:09.739> you<00:03:10.070> can<00:03:10.190> see<00:03:10.400> it's<00:03:10.580> still

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
example they and you can see it's still

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.760 
example they and you can see it's still
nice<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.000> pink<00:03:11.330> inside<00:03:11.510> or<00:03:12.290> what<00:03:12.410> you<00:03:12.500> do<00:03:12.650> is

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
nice and pink inside or what you do is

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.120 
nice and pink inside or what you do is
you<00:03:13.060> feed<00:03:14.060> it<00:03:14.150> like<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.510> if<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:15.020> gives<00:03:15.320> easily

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
you feed it like that if it gives easily

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.000 
you feed it like that if it gives easily
it's<00:03:16.790> minimally<00:03:17.360> and<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:18.410> more<00:03:18.620> then<00:03:18.890> it

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
it's minimally and the more then it

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.100 
it's minimally and the more then it
becomes<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.520> harder<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:20.600> becomes<00:03:20.930> to

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
becomes the harder it becomes to

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.479 
becomes the harder it becomes to
actually<00:03:21.910> push<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.209> taste<00:03:24.050> it<00:03:24.260> so<00:03:24.459> what<00:03:25.459> I

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
I don't like it that much because

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.470 
I don't like it that much because
usually<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.890> basin's<00:03:37.310> got<00:03:37.489> sugar<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:38.030> sugar

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.290 
usually the basin's got sugar and sugar
burns<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:39.739> I<00:03:39.769> prefer<00:03:40.190> doing<00:03:40.519> this<00:03:40.760> and<00:03:41.030> if<00:03:41.150> you

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
burns so I prefer doing this and if you

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.060 
burns so I prefer doing this and if you

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
end just to warm it through and then let

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.170 
end just to warm it through and then let
it<00:03:47.209> rest<00:03:47.300> in<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.720> basting<00:03:48.140> sauce<00:03:48.580> I<00:03:49.580> like<00:03:50.000> the
