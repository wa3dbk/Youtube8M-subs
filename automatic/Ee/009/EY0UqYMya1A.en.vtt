season and important is that you opened
the<00:00:50.739> file<00:00:51.010> with<00:00:51.249> X<00:00:51.489> also<00:00:52.059> that<00:00:52.329> the<00:00:52.479> CSV<00:00:53.049> file

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
the file with X also that the CSV file

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.329 
the file with X also that the CSV file
is<00:00:53.859> converted<00:00:54.190> directly<00:00:54.909> into<00:00:55.449> X<00:00:55.629> zone

is converted directly into X zone

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.489 
is converted directly into X zone
because<00:00:57.339> I<00:00:57.370> heard<00:00:57.670> from<00:00:57.969> several<00:00:58.839> users<00:00:59.260> are

corner until diseases cross double-click

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.670 
corner until diseases cross double-click
and<00:01:20.020> then<00:01:20.100> we<00:01:21.100> have<00:01:21.340> some<00:01:21.700> data<00:01:22.540> numbered<00:01:23.320> from

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
and then we have some data numbered from

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.930 
and then we have some data numbered from
1<00:01:24.040> to<00:01:24.390> 306<00:01:25.390> this<00:01:26.200> is<00:01:26.320> quite<00:01:26.590> important<00:01:27.220> when<00:01:27.580> we

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
1 to 306 this is quite important when we

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.330 
1 to 306 this is quite important when we
start<00:01:28.300> with<00:01:29.020> swatting<00:01:29.410> Cesare<00:01:29.770> that<00:01:30.100> data

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
start with swatting Cesare that data

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.620 
start with swatting Cesare that data
again<00:01:30.850> so<00:01:31.720> now<00:01:31.960> we<00:01:32.020> click<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:33.120> insert<00:01:34.120> another

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
again so now we click and insert another

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.550 
again so now we click and insert another
column<00:01:35.200> which<00:01:36.130> will<00:01:36.460> indicate<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.720> season<00:01:38.410> of

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
column which will indicate the season of

column which will indicate the season of
the<00:01:38.740> spreadsheet<00:01:39.370> so<00:01:40.000> that<00:01:40.030> will<00:01:40.570> be<00:01:40.750> copy<00:01:41.200> and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
the spreadsheet so that will be copy and

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.880 
the spreadsheet so that will be copy and
paste<00:01:41.650> the<00:01:41.860> data<00:01:42.040> and<00:01:42.520> all<00:01:42.730> spreadsheets

do<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:11.480> I<00:04:11.840> just<00:04:11.870> show<00:04:12.410> you<00:04:12.470> what<00:04:12.769> happens<00:04:13.190> is

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
do it I just show you what happens is

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.009 
do it I just show you what happens is
you<00:04:14.750> have<00:04:14.810> here<00:04:15.560> for<00:04:15.890> example<00:04:16.220> first<00:04:17.150> match<00:04:17.690> in

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
you have here for example first match in

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.490 
you have here for example first match in
November<00:04:18.950> then

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
November then

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.940 
November then
March<00:04:19.650> March<00:04:20.280> August<00:04:21.239> this<00:04:22.019> is<00:04:22.230> certainly<00:04:22.650> not

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
March March August this is certainly not

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.120 
March March August this is certainly not
how<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.280> want<00:04:23.850> your<00:04:24.330> data<00:04:24.570> sorted<00:04:25.380> so

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
how you want your data sorted so

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.990 
how you want your data sorted so
therefore<00:04:26.580> we<00:04:26.670> do<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:26.940> sorting<00:04:27.330> again<00:04:27.720> and

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
therefore we do the sorting again and

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.440 
therefore we do the sorting again and
includes<00:04:30.000> a<00:04:30.240> column<00:04:30.480> a<00:04:30.780> for<00:04:31.230> sorting<00:04:32.210> so<00:04:33.210> now

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
includes a column a for sorting so now

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.430 
includes a column a for sorting so now
we<00:04:33.510> have<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.200> teams<00:04:34.910> in<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:36.480> nice<00:04:36.990> order<00:04:38.210> five

here we had a little mistake we just

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.030 
here we had a little mistake we just
inserted<00:04:52.320> here<00:04:52.680> and<00:04:53.100> takes<00:04:53.730> us<00:04:53.940> on<00:04:54.150> out<00:04:54.390> here

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
inserted here and takes us on out here

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.710
