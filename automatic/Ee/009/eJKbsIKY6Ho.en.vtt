00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.480
 I'm here all right oh I think 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.989
 you are not killed yet someone is underground there 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.960
 stayed 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.079
 where rum and may be dead but i'm not sure 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.090
 the last time was on the first level there 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.450
 everything is ruined I will try to find another 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.230
 exit and just in such a visual way 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.440
 found out that it was all a setup and 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:55.980
 the last bomb was with explosives they 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.010
 virus and blown to hell one of 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.699
 main stations in washington our task 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.680
 to this level just get out of here 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.950
 periodically we will fall into 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.470
 Such are the dude and hot that it would 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.010
 no matter how silly it may sound to us 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.750
 later than from harry you don't know the test 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.650
 stoves or some kind of gasoline and yes and 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.290
 Problems 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.580
 happens which is not an easy time 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.220
 his legs could not pass 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.640
 for level design who are power here 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.800
 some kind of clumsy example i knew that 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.860
 many simply did not know how to get here 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.970
 here is just that you need to climb 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.940
 on the subway car at all I was of course 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.980
 not very difficult to take place in the club because 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.910
 what do you know in clubs such an atmosphere 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.830
 sit a couple of dude always behind those 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.860
 suggest can't help you with them 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.050
 there is access to the park and let them stay 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:00.170
 on the ground I'll get another explosive 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:03.110
 the parties that is, yes, I basically say 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.120
 everything is so simple but when I passed 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.000
 first time hitting the cube is not easy 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.030
 suggested that where and how well not always 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.180
 Of course from difficult moments I turned 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.850
 for help dudes who are already a toy 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.490
 passed here in this place necessarily 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.370
 need to run as far as possible to the left because 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.380
 there rez this dude with grenades sketches with 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.290
 grenades here but very annoying 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:33.290
 when it is necessary here is extremely imbalanced 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:35.270
 have they bring meters there to be alert 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.780
 now we will take 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:44.000
 explosives here here wrote another kid 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.660
 Dress us here lies c4 explosives 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.370
 with the help could n't could blow the passage and 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.010
 Those agents from 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.170
 biological squad and mine this 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.800
 the bomb that was left above 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.090
 and we are still going to deliver to the wreckage 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.400
 you need to try to 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.270
 to block 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.600
 what else is important for the games of that time 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.700
 it was still started development 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.820
 97 game is very diverse 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.340
 there will be levels in every possible way 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.190
 hook fall gothic turar level on 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:24.730
 Winter location level in Russia is not well 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:27.560
 version of kazakhstan i.e. variety 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.170
 just rolls over rubles before 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.510
 time and what's interesting is a lot 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:38.189
 plot to prices they certainly are not so 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.930
 outstanding places are beautiful but the plot is 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.790
 really the plot is remembered in 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.110
 original way very cool voices 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.090
 all characters but as I understand guys 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.329
 don't like english voice acting without 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.860
 translation so I still took the Russian 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.319
 version of 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.069
 so now we will undermine the passage but 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.750
 still talk to lam i ruined this 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.659
 Umar leader progressing according to plans and 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.599
 tunnels check this thread 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:09.450
 check where she leads this branch see 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.639
 Washington Park tell me to accept it 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.900
 all measures 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:20.310
 business yes here we are talking about the park 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.880
 washington apparently all all operatives 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.760
 from the squad of Romer went there and there 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.340
 They also want to create a terrorist attack here this 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.050
 the bomb which bang turned upside down well 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.440
 that she did not detonate 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:38.400
 and we will now undermine the passage and 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:44.300
 we will cover the guy again 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.300
 yellow Moscow here we have 3 2 1 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.330
 very cool by the way the sound in the game sounds 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.550
 shots sounds of explosions 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.200
 generally very cool with this all 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.270
 I worked by the way on the version 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:06.270
 emulator 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:09.700
 e.s. worth 8 quiet game on windows 7 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:13.290
 the game stably holds the frame rate and 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:17.250
 calculates no bugs here if still 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:20.140
 so let's say the quality is the quality of this version 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.120
 it would have been better 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.600
 nishtyak well, you know, in everything there is a small 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.690
 flaw 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.640
 there is nothing perfect here 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.840
 here to the sect happens now we 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:38.440
 block the gas right to exit the main 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:42.850
 main metro line mechanical not 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:45.220
 chatting I do performing tasks that 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.130
 I liked the site in St. Petersburg always 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:52.600
 so this is what the kiba behind shows 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.430
 that the Cossack and it kind of justified 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.610
 that he can carry so much with him 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:01.360
 tables milk and all here is this backpack 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:04.050
 they are still laying down 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.479
 the game that there is a 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:12.360
 your such realism is once more like 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:15.240
 myself I got the command message in 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:18.419
 park they attacked what are we going to do 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.870
 great dad done say i 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:24.150
 I â€™m headed for Gabe he said 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.490
 heading heading towards the park 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.590
 we will now go to the main metro line 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:37.680
 which will be very short 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:39.389
 chapter to start falling till next 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.430
 the mission will be very short but 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:46.680
 after it will be very long 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:54.240
 mission so don't worry 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:56.639
 pass on his jokes duration 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.009
 kid I'm actually going 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:01.370
 keep moving on the tracks i did 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:01.370
 one more try
