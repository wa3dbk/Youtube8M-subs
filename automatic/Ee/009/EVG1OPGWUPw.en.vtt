really look all that impressive I know

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.419 
really look all that impressive I know
that<00:00:13.080> but<00:00:13.259> if<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.530> take<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.679> look<00:00:13.860> at<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.099> shape

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
that but if you take a look at the shape

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.519 
that but if you take a look at the shape
of<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:14.849> device<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.809> kind<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.109> looks<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.379> lot

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
of this device it kind of looks a lot

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.460 
of this device it kind of looks a lot
like<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.890> HTC<00:00:17.160> One<00:00:17.520> max<00:00:18.029> which<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.960> pretty

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
like the HTC One max which is pretty

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.689 
like the HTC One max which is pretty
interesting<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:20.160> probably<00:00:20.369> going<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.550> be<00:00:20.609> a

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
interesting it's probably going to be a

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.290 
interesting it's probably going to be a
big<00:00:20.850> advice<00:00:21.090> then<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:22.050> Galaxy<00:00:22.410> Note<00:00:22.439> 3<00:00:23.010> and

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
big advice then the Galaxy Note 3 and

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.820 
big advice then the Galaxy Note 3 and
Musa<00:00:24.300> little<00:00:24.600> bit<00:00:24.689> bigger<00:00:24.900> probably<00:00:25.380> still

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
Musa little bit bigger probably still

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.300 
Musa little bit bigger probably still
below<00:00:26.400> 6<00:00:26.849> inch<00:00:27.119> but<00:00:27.449> then<00:00:27.810> my<00:00:28.410> experience<00:00:29.010> each

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
below 6 inch but then my experience each

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.540 
below 6 inch but then my experience each
time<00:00:29.660> the<00:00:30.660> galaxy<00:00:31.050> s<00:00:31.140> devices<00:00:31.710> increases<00:00:32.399> in

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
time the galaxy s devices increases in

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.660 
time the galaxy s devices increases in
size<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.079> s5<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.950> that's<00:00:35.309> 3

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
size like this for the s5 and that's 3

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.040 
size like this for the s5 and that's 3
esto<00:00:37.219> we<00:00:38.219> got<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> bigger<00:00:38.610> note<00:00:39.090> phone<00:00:39.660> from

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
esto we got a bigger note phone from

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.650 
esto we got a bigger note phone from
something<00:00:40.530> which<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.370> always<00:00:41.579> increasing<00:00:42.329> in

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
something which is always increasing in

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.479 
something which is always increasing in
size<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.500> looks<00:00:43.649> layer<00:00:43.829> like<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.340> home

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
size and it looks layer like the home

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.040 
size and it looks layer like the home
button<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> little<00:00:45.120> bit<00:00:45.210> bigger<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.899> screen

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
button is a little bit bigger the screen

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.340 
button is a little bit bigger the screen
looks<00:00:46.230> definitely<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> lot<00:00:47.250> wider<00:00:48.180> which<00:00:49.020> I'm

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
looks definitely a lot wider which I'm

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.080 
looks definitely a lot wider which I'm
really<00:00:49.620> not<00:00:49.829> sure<00:00:49.890> fun<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.460> enjoy<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.910> much

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
really not sure fun to enjoy that much

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.420 
really not sure fun to enjoy that much
but<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.690> one<00:00:51.899> probably<00:00:52.170> will<00:00:52.469> feature<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.219> lot

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
but this one probably will feature a lot

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.260 
but this one probably will feature a lot
of<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.579> same<00:00:53.730> specs<00:00:54.059> as<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:55.219> the<00:00:56.219> galaxy<00:00:56.789> s5

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
of the same specs as the the galaxy s5

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.400 
of the same specs as the the galaxy s5
I'm<00:00:57.600> not<00:00:57.690> sure<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.050> going<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.379> a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
I'm not sure if it's going to be a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.869 
I'm not sure if it's going to be a
waterproof<00:00:58.829> or<00:00:58.980> Duff<00:00:59.129> system<00:00:59.520> but<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.760> would

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
waterproof or Duff system but that would

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.720 
waterproof or Duff system but that would
be<00:01:00.030> pretty<00:01:00.270> cool<00:01:00.890> it<00:01:01.890> has<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> fingerprint

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
be pretty cool it has a fingerprint

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.200 
be pretty cool it has a fingerprint
sensor<00:01:03.090> probably<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.100> which<00:01:05.100> may<00:01:05.700> make

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
sensor probably here and which may make

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.600 
sensor probably here and which may make
like<00:01:06.479> PayPal<00:01:06.960> payments<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.830> such<00:01:08.369> way<00:01:08.580> that

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
like PayPal payments in such way that

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.210 
like PayPal payments in such way that
would<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:09.000> very<00:01:09.210> very<00:01:09.450> cool<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:10.680> r<00:01:10.830> also

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
would be very very cool it's r also

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.770 
would be very very cool it's r also
haven't<00:01:11.400> seen<00:01:11.580> kind<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.790> dollar<00:01:11.970> texture<00:01:12.570> back

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
haven't seen kind of dollar texture back

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.719 
haven't seen kind of dollar texture back
that<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.110> do<00:01:13.200> get<00:01:13.380> them<00:01:13.530> galaxy<00:01:13.860> s5<00:01:14.130> maybe

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
that you do get them galaxy s5 maybe

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.679 
that you do get them galaxy s5 maybe
even<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.119> 2k<00:01:15.659> resolution<00:01:15.810> display<00:01:17.479> with<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
even a 2k resolution display with a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.980 
even a 2k resolution display with a
resolution<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:20.159> 2560<00:01:20.820> x<00:01:20.850> 1440<00:01:21.360> or<00:01:21.720> something

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
resolution like 2560 x 1440 or something

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.810 
resolution like 2560 x 1440 or something
like<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.110> maybe<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.040> comes<00:01:23.189> also<00:01:23.430> with<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.640> new

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
like that maybe it comes also with a new

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.820 
like that maybe it comes also with a new
version<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.150> Snapdragon<00:01:24.869> processor<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.680> not

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
version of Snapdragon processor it's not

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.100 
version of Snapdragon processor it's not
like<00:01:25.950> an<00:01:26.040> 805<00:01:26.729> which<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.570> rumors<00:01:27.930> that's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
like an 805 which we have rumors that's

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.289 
like an 805 which we have rumors that's
going<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.409> come<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.590> later<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.400> year<00:01:29.460> so

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
going to come out later this year so

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.910 
going to come out later this year so
that<00:01:30.479> would<00:01:30.570> also<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.869> pretty<00:01:31.290> pretty<00:01:31.560> cool

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
that would also be pretty pretty cool

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.210 
that would also be pretty pretty cool
there<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:33.119> then<00:01:33.329> also<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:34.140> have<00:01:34.530> here<00:01:35.070> that

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
there and then also we have here that

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.160 
there and then also we have here that
the<00:01:35.340> problem<00:01:35.729> will<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:36.030> upgrading<00:01:36.630> 13-episode

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
the problem will be upgrading 13-episode

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.770 
the problem will be upgrading 13-episode
camera<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.950> don't<00:01:38.460> really<00:01:38.729> enjoy<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.240> camera

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
camera I don't really enjoy the camera

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.249 
camera I don't really enjoy the camera
at<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.079> moment<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.070> galaxy<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.930> galaxy

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
at the moment on the galaxy the galaxy

at the moment on the galaxy the galaxy
note<00:01:43.409> 3<00:01:43.619> which<00:01:43.950> I'm<00:01:44.130> actually<00:01:44.369> using<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:44.820> my

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
note 3 which I'm actually using as my
