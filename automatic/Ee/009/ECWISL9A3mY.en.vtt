00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:04.200
 unfortunately a lottery room really 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.030
 unique in its kind and above all in the 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.450
 his and nobody ever did it 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:11.400
 maybe someone put in ex auction kart 

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.320
 it was the art etc. but in the future it will be 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.390
 purely particular because nostalgia 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.750
