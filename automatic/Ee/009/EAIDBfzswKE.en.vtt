the<00:00:07.350> science<00:00:07.800> of<00:00:07.920> headshots<00:00:08.130> it's<00:00:08.970> not<00:00:09.120> always

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
the science of headshots it's not always

the science of headshots it's not always
easy<00:00:09.420> as<00:00:09.900> you're<00:00:10.050> saving<00:00:10.380> for<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.620> head

specifically<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.180> video<00:00:12.480> I'm<00:00:12.629> going<00:00:12.840> to

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
specifically in this video I'm going to

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.640 
specifically in this video I'm going to
go<00:00:13.049> over<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.830> three<00:00:14.129> types<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.610> headshots<00:00:15.650> it

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
go over the three types of headshots it

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.339 
go over the three types of headshots it
shots<00:00:17.099> at<00:00:17.310> long<00:00:17.490> ranges<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.750> transition

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349 
shots at long ranges and the transition

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.470

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
from normal named a hardcore and some

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.290 
from normal named a hardcore and some
tips<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.840> should<00:00:22.110> help<00:00:22.880> start<00:00:23.880> off<00:00:24.029> with<00:00:24.270> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
tips that should help start off with the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.300 
tips that should help start off with the
real<00:00:24.630> differences<00:00:25.320> between<00:00:25.529> normal<00:00:26.130> and

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
real differences between normal and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.880 
real differences between normal and

head off you think it's bullshit well
let's<00:01:50.140> see<00:01:50.289> some<00:01:50.319> examples<00:01:50.590> here<00:01:52.289> we<00:01:53.289> have<00:01:53.439> a

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
let's see some examples here we have a

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.889 
let's see some examples here we have a
normal<00:01:53.829> chipper<00:01:54.280> ocean<00:01:54.759> gang<00:01:54.939> match<00:01:55.239> that's

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
normal chipper ocean gang match that's

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.050 
normal chipper ocean gang match that's
me<00:01:56.110> with<00:01:56.319> a<00:01:56.349> springfield<00:01:56.979> and<00:01:57.789> oh<00:01:57.909> look

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
me with a springfield and oh look

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.809 
me with a springfield and oh look
there's<00:01:58.899> blood<00:01:59.170> and<00:01:59.200> running<00:01:59.560> up<00:01:59.679> see<00:02:00.610> i<00:02:00.670> don't

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
there's blood and running up see i don't

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.850 
there's blood and running up see i don't
quite<00:02:01.030> have<00:02:01.299> already<00:02:01.689> q<00:02:01.899> on<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.110> x<00:02:02.289> and<00:02:02.619> then

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
quite have already q on the x and then

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.389 
quite have already q on the x and then
up<00:02:03.610> there<00:02:04.329> you<00:02:04.450> go<00:02:04.629> now<00:02:05.560> let's<00:02:05.770> take<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.039> look<00:02:06.159> at

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
up there you go now let's take a look at

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.249 
up there you go now let's take a look at
this<00:02:06.520> all<00:02:06.759> over<00:02:06.939> again<00:02:07.119> so<00:02:07.659> we<00:02:07.780> can<00:02:07.810> break<00:02:08.140> it

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
this all over again so we can break it

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.530 
this all over again so we can break it
down

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.020 

now<00:02:12.170> if<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.409> pay<00:02:12.620> close<00:02:12.650> attention<00:02:13.610> you'll

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
now if you pay close attention you'll

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.240 
now if you pay close attention you'll
see<00:02:14.239> how<00:02:14.420> unsuccessful<00:02:15.409> I<00:02:15.560> am<00:02:15.739> it's<00:02:15.950> shooting

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
see how unsuccessful I am it's shooting

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.580 
see how unsuccessful I am it's shooting
in<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.489> head<00:02:16.700> until<00:02:17.599> I<00:02:17.659> actually<00:02:17.959> get<00:02:18.379> his

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
in the head until I actually get his

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.929 
in the head until I actually get his
head<00:02:18.859> at<00:02:19.370> 0<00:02:20.000> on<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.510> y-axis<00:02:21.010> right<00:02:22.010> here

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.860 

okey-dokey<00:02:25.939> let's<00:02:25.969> go<00:02:26.269> over<00:02:26.450> this<00:02:26.569> headshot

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
okey-dokey let's go over this headshot

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.890 
okey-dokey let's go over this headshot
one<00:02:27.469> more<00:02:27.890> time<00:02:28.250> just<00:02:28.760> so<00:02:28.939> I<00:02:28.970> can<00:02:29.150> get<00:02:29.480> one<00:02:29.720> more

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
one more time just so I can get one more

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.440 
one more time just so I can get one more
point<00:02:30.109> across<00:02:30.549> notice<00:02:31.549> how<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:31.760> twitch<00:02:32.180> the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
point across notice how I twitch the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.509 
point across notice how I twitch the
reticule<00:02:32.840> from<00:02:33.170> side<00:02:33.409> to<00:02:33.560> side<00:02:33.590> that's

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
reticule from side to side that's

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.629 
reticule from side to side that's
actually<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:35.060> must<00:02:35.540> in<00:02:35.989> hardcore<00:02:36.769> because<00:02:37.280> you

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:37.639 
actually a must in hardcore because you

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.580 
actually a must in hardcore because you
can't<00:02:37.970> just<00:02:38.209> slowly<00:02:38.599> aim<00:02:38.989> at<00:02:39.170> them<00:02:39.349> they'll

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
can't just slowly aim at them they'll

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.210 
can't just slowly aim at them they'll
just<00:02:39.739> move<00:02:39.980> right<00:02:40.220> out<00:02:40.370> from<00:02:40.760> behind<00:02:40.939> it<00:02:45.220> now

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
just move right out from behind it now

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.699

the<00:03:51.440> characters<00:03:51.860> not<00:03:52.010> moving<00:03:52.459> so<00:03:52.850> you<00:03:52.910> can

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
the characters not moving so you can

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:05.180 
the characters not moving so you can
line<00:03:53.360> up<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.690> shot<00:03:53.720> really<00:03:54.470> slow

which is head shots at a distance
something<00:04:10.800> that's<00:04:10.950> probably<00:04:11.280> really

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
something that's probably really

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.980 
something that's probably really
debatable<00:04:12.060> but<00:04:12.210> I'm<00:04:12.360> gonna<00:04:12.480> break<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.870> down

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990
