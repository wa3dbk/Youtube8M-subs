00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
were so small in terms of the return

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.670 
were so small in terms of the return
they<00:00:24.000> were<00:00:24.060> getting<00:00:24.449> sometimes<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.470> was<00:00:25.560> as

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
they were getting sometimes it was as

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.800 
they were getting sometimes it was as
low<00:00:25.830> as<00:00:25.859> point<00:00:26.369> zero<00:00:26.880> seven<00:00:27.480> eight

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
low as point zero seven eight

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.349 
low as point zero seven eight
basically<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:28.710> free<00:00:29.099> money<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:30.150> have<00:00:30.300> to

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
basically it's free money you have to

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.279 
basically it's free money you have to
understand<00:00:30.720> something<00:00:30.990> that's<00:00:31.080> very

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
understand something that's very

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.590 
understand something that's very
important<00:00:31.710> here<00:00:31.740> because<00:00:32.300> it's<00:00:33.300> not<00:00:33.570> just

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
important here because it's not just

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.660 
important here because it's not just
that<00:00:34.020> hey<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.290> get<00:00:34.590> up<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.800> loan<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.250> then<00:00:35.399> you

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
that hey you get up a loan and then you

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.520 
that hey you get up a loan and then you
know<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.850> get<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.239> loan<00:00:36.719> back<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.290> then<00:00:37.380> so

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
know you get the loan back and then so

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.250 
know you get the loan back and then so
everything's<00:00:37.890> fine<00:00:38.190> no<00:00:39.030> if<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.570> give<00:00:39.870> loans

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
everything's fine no if you give loans

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.670 
everything's fine no if you give loans
in<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:41.360> degree<00:00:42.360> with<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.989> kind<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.500> low

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
in that degree with that kind of low

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.529 
in that degree with that kind of low
interest<00:00:44.070> rate<00:00:44.309> you're<00:00:44.760> basically<00:00:45.270> giving

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
interest rate you're basically giving

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.660 
interest rate you're basically giving
away<00:00:45.899> free<00:00:46.170> money<00:00:46.320> imagine<00:00:47.129> if<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.309> gave<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
away free money imagine if I gave you a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.850 
away free money imagine if I gave you a
trillion<00:00:48.059> dollars<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.629> then<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.020> said<00:00:49.440> okay

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
trillion dollars and then I said okay

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.040 
trillion dollars and then I said okay
you<00:00:50.460> could<00:00:50.610> then<00:00:50.789> sell<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.570> back<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
you could then sell it back to the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.979 
you could then sell it back to the
government<00:00:52.410> at<00:00:52.680> three<00:00:53.610> percent<00:00:53.879> right<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:54.780> an

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
government at three percent right as an

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.380 
government at three percent right as an
example<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.620> four<00:00:56.129> Treasury<00:00:56.550> bonds<00:00:56.879> any<00:00:57.090> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
example to four Treasury bonds any and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.360 
example to four Treasury bonds any and
by<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> way<00:00:58.199> three<00:00:58.440> percent<00:00:58.770> was<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> lowest

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
by the way three percent was the lowest

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.279 
by the way three percent was the lowest
they<00:00:59.520> ever<00:00:59.730> got<00:00:59.940> okay<00:01:00.600> let's<00:01:00.809> do<00:01:00.930> some<00:01:01.109> quick

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
they ever got okay let's do some quick

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.569 
they ever got okay let's do some quick
math<00:01:01.469> on<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.800> let's<00:01:01.980> see<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.340> do<00:01:02.430> this

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
math on this let's see if I can do this

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.399 
math on this let's see if I can do this
yeah<00:01:02.940> that'd<00:01:03.090> be<00:01:03.239> free<00:01:03.510> thirty<00:01:04.080> billion

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
yeah that'd be free thirty billion

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.620 
yeah that'd be free thirty billion
dollars<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.100> would<00:01:05.220> get<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.580> year<00:01:05.630> do

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
dollars that you would get in a year do

dollars that you would get in a year do
you<00:01:06.720> understand<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.590> not<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
you understand that it's not just that

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.410 
you understand that it's not just that
you're<00:01:08.369> getting<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.760> loan<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.210> could<00:01:09.330> do

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
you're getting a loan that you could do

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.870 
you're getting a loan that you could do
something<00:01:09.750> else<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.680> free<00:01:11.100> thirty

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
something else with it's a free thirty

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.270 
something else with it's a free thirty
billion<00:01:12.540> dollars<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.770> hand<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.130> any

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
bank if you give them a trillion dollars

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.109 
bank if you give them a trillion dollars
as<00:01:15.930> an<00:01:16.259> example<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.460> lot<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.670> times<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.060> a

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
as an example and a lot of times it's a

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.550 
as an example and a lot of times it's a
lot<00:01:18.150> more<00:01:18.509> than<00:01:18.689> they<00:01:18.810> give<00:01:18.930> more<00:01:19.170> than<00:01:19.350> three

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
lot more than they give more than three

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.380 
lot more than they give more than three
percent<00:01:19.680> interest<00:01:20.159> rate<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.700> who<00:01:21.180> do<00:01:21.270> they

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
percent interest rate so who do they

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.910 
percent interest rate so who do they
give<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.840> how<00:01:22.020> do<00:01:22.080> they<00:01:22.200> give<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.530> let<00:01:22.830> me

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
give it to how do they give it to let me

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.830 
give it to how do they give it to let me
give<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.100> one<00:01:23.220> more<00:01:23.250> number<00:01:23.729> one<00:01:24.299> point<00:01:24.570> two

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
give you one more number one point two

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.020 
give you one more number one point two
trillion<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.950> maximum<00:01:26.520> amount<00:01:26.640> on

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
trillion is the maximum amount on

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.569 
trillion is the maximum amount on
December<00:01:27.570> fifth<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.930> 2008<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> Fed<00:01:29.340> had
