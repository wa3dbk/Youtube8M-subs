00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.460 
any idea what's going on do you
what<00:02:44.490> did<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.670> want<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:44.910> show<00:02:45.060> me

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:03:01.690 

what<00:02:49.470> happens<00:02:49.920> here<00:02:50.130> what<00:02:50.760> is

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:11.949 

it<00:03:03.470> doesn't<00:03:04.470> look<00:03:04.530> very<00:03:04.590> good<00:03:04.800> does<00:03:05.069> it

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.640 

you<00:03:12.959> know<00:03:13.080> I'm<00:03:13.230> gonna<00:03:13.380> get<00:03:13.530> these<00:03:13.770> easy

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
you know I'm gonna get these easy

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.590 
you know I'm gonna get these easy
specifically<00:03:16.650> made<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.340> guess<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.330> didn't<00:03:18.510> think

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
specifically made I guess I didn't think

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.210 
specifically made I guess I didn't think
that<00:03:18.780> beef<00:03:19.020> not<00:03:19.320> needing<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.770> make<00:03:19.920> honey

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
that beef not needing to make honey

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.370 
that beef not needing to make honey
would<00:03:20.430> affect<00:03:20.790> all<00:03:20.970> these<00:03:21.209> other<00:03:21.390> things<00:03:21.510> it's

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
would affect all these other things it's

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.370 
would affect all these other things it's
not<00:03:22.560> flowers<00:03:23.250> fruits<00:03:23.910> vegetables<00:03:24.660> they<00:03:25.140> all

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
not flowers fruits vegetables they all

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.120 
not flowers fruits vegetables they all
need<00:03:25.890> bees<00:03:27.020> well<00:03:28.020> that's<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.380> t-test<00:03:28.860> right

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
need bees well that's a t-test right

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.970 
need bees well that's a t-test right
there<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.690> take<00:03:30.900> away<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.230> produce<00:03:31.650> that

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
there so you take away the produce that

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.830 
there so you take away the produce that
affects<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.400> entire<00:03:32.520> Animal<00:03:33.150> Kingdom<00:03:33.180> and

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
affects the entire Animal Kingdom and

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.699 
affects the entire Animal Kingdom and
then<00:03:34.020> of<00:03:34.350> course<00:03:35.090> your<00:03:36.090> species<00:03:39.500> so<00:03:40.500> there's

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
then of course your species so there's

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.490 
then of course your species so there's
no<00:03:40.800> more<00:03:40.950> pollination<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:42.810> could<00:03:43.050> all<00:03:43.170> just<00:03:43.380> go

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
no more pollination it could all just go

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.420 
no more pollination it could all just go
south<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.630> know<00:03:45.690> this<00:03:46.410> is<00:03:46.560> awesome<00:03:47.040> partly

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
south and I know this is awesome partly

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.270 
south and I know this is awesome partly
my<00:03:47.640> fault

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.970 

how<00:03:52.850> about<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.030> suicide<00:03:53.600> pact

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.430
