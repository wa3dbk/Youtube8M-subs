last update the boom cannon got a really
beefy<00:04:11.650> crazy<00:04:12.650> upgrade<00:04:13.280> which<00:04:14.120> I<00:04:14.240> think<00:04:15.100> starts

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
beefy crazy upgrade which I think starts

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.120 
beefy crazy upgrade which I think starts
at<00:04:16.390> HDR<00:04:17.390> the<00:04:17.720> level<00:04:18.380> 10<00:04:19.070> I<00:04:19.340> believe<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:20.299> then

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
at HDR the level 10 I believe and then

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.600 
at HDR the level 10 I believe and then
the<00:04:22.130> rocket<00:04:22.520> launcher<00:04:22.910> got<00:04:23.210> a<00:04:23.480> really<00:04:24.610> neat

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
change as it goes up to level eight

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.740 
change as it goes up to level eight
level<00:04:33.560> 8<00:04:33.710> is<00:04:33.890> the<00:04:34.070> final<00:04:34.430> result<00:04:34.580> on<00:04:34.940> that<00:04:35.120> so

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
level 8 is the final result on that so

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.330 
level 8 is the final result on that so
I'm<00:04:35.840> actually<00:04:35.990> trying<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.560> go<00:04:36.680> through<00:04:36.740> all<00:04:37.040> my

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
defense

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.560 
defense
right<00:04:38.160> now<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.520> get<00:04:38.700> them<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.180> best

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
right now and get them to the best

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.380 
right now and get them to the best
looking<00:04:39.840> ones<00:04:40.260> it<00:04:40.830> might<00:04:41.010> may<00:04:41.490> may<00:04:41.940> not<00:04:42.090> be<00:04:42.240> the

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
looking ones it might may may not be the

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.990 
looking ones it might may may not be the
most<00:04:42.420> leveled<00:04:43.020> but<00:04:43.320> at<00:04:43.530> least<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:44.040> look<00:04:44.820> of

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
most leveled but at least the look of

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.200 
most leveled but at least the look of
them<00:04:45.180> is<00:04:45.600> somewhat<00:04:46.590> intimidating<00:04:47.340> so

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
them is somewhat intimidating so

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.900 
them is somewhat intimidating so
hopefully<00:04:48.420> that<00:04:48.720> scares<00:04:49.020> off<00:04:49.230> some<00:04:49.470> players

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
hopefully that scares off some players

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.660 
hopefully that scares off some players
well<00:04:50.910> this<00:04:51.120> is<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.390> last<00:04:51.740> stage<00:04:52.740> on<00:04:53.130> this

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
well this is the last stage on this

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.370 
well this is the last stage on this
