 who did not share with us voted 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.730

 thanks to this site voting 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.489
 absolutely turned out to be objective 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.809
 honest and unbiased that is 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.410
 it was not easy to vote 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.140
 clicking on a link and a layknut 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.329
 register log in and 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.940
 rate this or that video 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.449
 for me personally itâ€™s more than obvious that 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.469
 simple counting views and likes 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.440
 present drivers do not reveal it 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.359
 could vote lasted a week i 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.760
 closely followed its dynamics and 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.740
 it was clearly visible that the amount 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.549
 visits know or vote right 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.890
 proportional to the number of views 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.659
 video about how the vote will be 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.080
 pass that is, those participated in it 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.939
 who really wanted to vote for 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.350
 he liked the video and did not come 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.530
 portal links to him 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.689
 only about 400 people voted 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.720
 there are one in eight ninth of those who 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.820
 watched a video on how to vote 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.710
 will be held and I think it's like 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.590
 times that case when less is better 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.400
 better so I'm sure the guys that have 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.189
 Khanin voting took place objectively and 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.939
 that's what its results are therefore 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.549
 voting 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.369
 saw gets a score from one to
