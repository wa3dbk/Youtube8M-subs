00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
is the 82 ready there's only 79 pace I

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.539 
is the 82 ready there's only 79 pace I
think<00:01:03.090> no<00:01:03.329> 72<00:01:03.809> base<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.769> something<00:01:05.070> ridiculous

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
think no 72 base is something ridiculous

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.700 
think no 72 base is something ridiculous
i<00:01:05.640> forgot<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.720> he<00:01:06.930> just<00:01:07.170> does<00:01:07.350> not<00:01:07.380> feel

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
i forgot and but he just does not feel

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.140 
i forgot and but he just does not feel
like<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.920> think<00:01:08.280> he<00:01:08.340> has<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.460> special<00:01:08.820> attribute

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
like I think he has a special attribute

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.240 
like I think he has a special attribute
of<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.390> nine<00:01:09.659> eighty<00:01:10.200> something<00:01:10.470> agility<00:01:11.010> or

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
of like nine eighty something agility or

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.340 
of like nine eighty something agility or
I<00:01:11.280> don't<00:01:11.430> know<00:01:11.610> which<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.450> clearly<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:13.020> see

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.440 
I don't know which you clearly can see
because<00:01:13.560> he<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.490> phenomenal<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.150> here's

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
because he is just phenomenal and here's

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.640 
because he is just phenomenal and here's
a<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:15.810> shitty<00:01:16.049> mistake<00:01:16.470> from<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
other one I can't remember because I

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.109 
other one I can't remember because I
hadn't<00:01:22.799> guessed<00:01:22.950> us<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.549> would<00:01:23.640> sit<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
hadn't guessed us that would sit on the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.969 
hadn't guessed us that would sit on the
benches<00:01:24.390> well<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.630> completely<00:01:25.170> didn't<00:01:25.500> show

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
benches well I completely didn't show

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.200 
benches well I completely didn't show
them<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> squad<00:01:26.580> not<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:26.970> really

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
them in the squad not that that really

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.390 
them in the squad not that that really
matters<00:01:27.659> anyway<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.530> for<00:01:28.770> another<00:01:28.829> Torres<00:01:29.280> if

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
matters anyway and for another Torres if

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.679 
matters anyway and for another Torres if
the<00:01:29.490> one<00:01:29.640> goal<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.030> remember<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.540> little

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the one goal as you remember that little

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.499 
the one goal as you remember that little
kill<00:01:31.130> that<00:01:32.130> little<00:01:32.310> camera<00:01:32.640> like<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.150> muck

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
kill that little camera like to muck

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.060 
kill that little camera like to muck
around<00:01:33.659> with<00:01:33.900> when<00:01:34.140> doing<00:01:34.409> these<00:01:34.530> ago<00:01:34.770> series

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
around with when doing these ago series

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.670 
around with when doing these ago series
so<00:01:35.460> basically<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:35.970> isn't<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> best<00:01:36.659> man<00:01:37.530> of

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
so basically this isn't the best man of

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.069 
so basically this isn't the best man of
the<00:01:37.799> sorry<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.579> isn't<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.000> best<00:01:39.210> Fernando

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079

goal that was a really good episode and

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.020 
goal that was a really good episode and
then<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.470> name<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.650> want<00:02:15.890> is<00:02:16.040> very<00:02:16.310> skillful<00:02:16.880> as

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
then the name I want is very skillful as

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.390 
then the name I want is very skillful as
well<00:02:17.600> this<00:02:17.780> is<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.260> striker<00:02:18.710> that<00:02:18.860> doesn't<00:02:19.280> have

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
well this is a striker that doesn't have

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.870 
well this is a striker that doesn't have
the<00:02:19.580> best<00:02:20.020> pace<00:02:21.020> and<00:02:21.380> best<00:02:22.250> attributes<00:02:22.700> all

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
the best pace and best attributes all

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.850 
the best pace and best attributes all
round<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.330> it's<00:02:23.450> very<00:02:23.540> hard<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.840> do<00:02:23.990> those<00:02:24.560> kind

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
round so it's very hard to do those kind

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.020 
round so it's very hard to do those kind
of<00:02:24.920> goals<00:02:25.130> but<00:02:25.310> nevertheless<00:02:25.520> I<00:02:25.820> thought<00:02:25.970> it

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
of goals but nevertheless I thought it

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.780 
of goals but nevertheless I thought it
was<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.150> good<00:02:26.360> way<00:02:26.600> to<00:02:27.070> you<00:02:28.070> know<00:02:28.160> just<00:02:28.340> kick

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
yeah that didn't what kind of made sense

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.820 
yeah that didn't what kind of made sense
so<00:05:29.750> stay<00:05:30.750> tuned<00:05:30.930> for<00:05:30.960> that<00:05:31.139> I'm<00:05:31.379> pretty<00:05:31.680> sure

so stay tuned for that I'm pretty sure

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.990 
so stay tuned for that I'm pretty sure
this<00:05:31.979> might<00:05:32.219> might<00:05:32.430> get<00:05:32.610> quite<00:05:32.879> a<00:05:32.909> few

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
this might might get quite a few

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.269 
this might might get quite a few
dislikes<00:05:33.509> because<00:05:33.810> it's<00:05:34.169> not<00:05:34.319> my<00:05:34.500> type<00:05:35.129> of

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:35.279 
dislikes because it's not my type of

little<00:05:37.469> more<00:05:37.589> entertaining<00:05:38.009> than<00:05:38.159> this<00:05:38.580> but

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
little more entertaining than this but

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.480 
little more entertaining than this but
if<00:05:39.539> i<00:05:39.930> was<00:05:40.139> watching<00:05:40.560> this<00:05:40.649> if<00:05:40.800> i<00:05:40.919> was<00:05:41.069> in<00:05:41.219> if<00:05:41.430> i

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
if i was watching this if i was in if i

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
was one of the subscribers watching this

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.050 
was one of the subscribers watching this
I<00:05:42.990> would<00:05:43.589> I<00:05:43.860> wouldn't<00:05:44.399> have<00:05:44.490> found<00:05:44.610> it<00:05:44.789> boring

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
I would I wouldn't have found it boring

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.450 
I would I wouldn't have found it boring
but<00:05:45.449> I<00:05:45.629> wouldn't<00:05:46.349> I<00:05:46.500> may<00:05:46.770> be<00:05:46.830> a<00:05:47.009> bit<00:05:47.129> skeptical

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
but I wouldn't I may be a bit skeptical

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.730 
but I wouldn't I may be a bit skeptical
thinking<00:05:47.849> why<00:05:48.089> did<00:05:48.149> you<00:05:48.539> do<00:05:49.110> this<00:05:49.259> episode<00:05:49.649> it

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
thinking why did you do this episode it

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.459 
thinking why did you do this episode it
wasn't<00:05:49.979> as<00:05:50.039> entertaining<00:05:50.550> but<00:05:50.939> you<00:05:51.479> know<00:05:51.599> just

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:52.469 
wasn't as entertaining but you know just
