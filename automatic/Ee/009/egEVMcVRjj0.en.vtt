00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:00.249
 we can sincerely rejoice much too soon 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.019
 I am already looking forward to the should I am already looking forward to it 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.209
 because right now 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.889
 it's exhausting i tell you it's responsive but often just do it 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.949
 I hate selected films 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:13.910

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.159

 After all, side Euro on the one hand I say I still feel like 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.099

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.719
 Problem case is so Canary Mediterranean region Scandinavia 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:36.099
 Percent that we are overly drunk to be too boring 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.969
 around 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:40.980
 I just hope a trip famously infamous "fifty-fifty" yet 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:41.969
 prepared 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:44.969
 but not so long, so six months 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.859
 Miliband was normal 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.749
 ie six months AMA 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:53.709
 Percent still beautiful red and three months four months you can 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:54.659
 cope with 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.849
 but every six months old but no thanks again 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:02.189
 otherwise the cars do not mix on the bike quite something nice 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.499
 around 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:06.379
 you can already miss 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.010
 from time to time when I come here with a man from Bohemian Thomas 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.639
 Weikert 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.619
 I am definitely looking forward to the 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:17.989
 last ten years to comment percent to 10 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:22.240
 David Hettich and the most important bar acronyms stands 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.350
 I also miss that I miss that obviously they were 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.379
 the actual results show that this will be 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:34.129
 and somehow with% Manz the new regulation as always when you look for me 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:36.939
 I'll come out too dry 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:41.339
 especially since many are chosen that is definitely on the PC too poorly met 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:44.180
 Nevertheless 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.000
 The gameplay tends to be slow but sure hour hindered 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.990
 So wanted to join in my question what tips were on the go 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.840
 you can also like her 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.949
 rather, enumerate 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.439
 that would be mine, despite the easy throw 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:03.439
 that simply I know that broadcasting here has the favor of Opel 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.439
 7900 to 3000 Robert 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.870
 no question 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.330
 I hope so if you could with the savings banks so far million EUR 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:16.920
 who dominated everything 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.249
 Mailman Ringborg Alonso 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:24.199
 and yes 20 30 the game comes to an end and I get along with everyone doing well yours 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.199
 Barbara Krieger also brings up guilty until next time

 Percent for my make-up 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.330
 because I have my normal defaults something at home 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.129
 so sure education popal distorted 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:37.110
 under 50 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.710
 schalke-trailer there you have to go through 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.279
 That's where your money gets value 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:43.289
 for her run 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.860
 soon became my question and we see and hear and write drones percent and
