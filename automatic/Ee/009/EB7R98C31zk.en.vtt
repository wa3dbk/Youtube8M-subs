room<00:04:22.300> but<00:04:22.539> since<00:04:22.570> there's<00:04:22.900> no<00:04:23.020> rooms<00:04:23.289> here<00:04:24.240> it

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
room but since there's no rooms here it

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.460 
room but since there's no rooms here it
wouldn't<00:04:25.479> be<00:04:25.539> able<00:04:25.600> to<00:04:25.690> go<00:04:25.810> anywhere<00:04:26.020> but

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
wouldn't be able to go anywhere but

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.900 
wouldn't be able to go anywhere but
there<00:04:26.590> was<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:26.770> room<00:04:27.100> and<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:28.540> colors<00:04:28.870> match

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
there was a room and the colors match

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.780 
there was a room and the colors match
this<00:04:30.910> is<00:04:31.120> purple<00:04:31.600> so<00:04:31.810> purple<00:04:31.840> came<00:04:32.470> up<00:04:32.790> it

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
this is purple so purple came up it

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.090 
this is purple so purple came up it
would<00:04:33.940> keep<00:04:34.660> going<00:04:34.720> in<00:04:35.110> that<00:04:35.230> room<00:04:35.500> until<00:04:38.100> it

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
would keep going in that room until it

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.670 
would keep going in that room until it
couldn't<00:04:39.580> go<00:04:40.360> in<00:04:40.510> that<00:04:40.630> direction<00:04:40.810> according

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
couldn't go in that direction according

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.000 
couldn't go in that direction according
to<00:04:41.950> the<00:04:42.040> rules<00:04:42.250> on<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.490> card<00:04:42.760> or<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:44.650> reached<00:04:44.830> a

to the rules on the card or it reached a

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
dead end

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.890

monsters<00:04:47.350> will<00:04:47.590> loop<00:04:48.180> so<00:04:49.180> if<00:04:49.330> it<00:04:49.450> goes<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.750> end

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
monsters will loop so if it goes the end

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.480 
monsters will loop so if it goes the end
of<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.050> board<00:04:50.260> it<00:04:50.350> can<00:04:50.470> go<00:04:50.620> here<00:04:50.950> but<00:04:51.250> since

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
of the board it can go here but since

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.760 
of the board it can go here but since
the<00:04:51.910> rule<00:04:52.090> states<00:04:52.390> no<00:04:52.630> monster<00:04:53.140> can<00:04:53.170> go<00:04:53.470> in<00:04:53.650> the

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
the rule states no monster can go in the

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.250 
the rule states no monster can go in the
entrance<00:04:54.160> so<00:04:54.520> it<00:04:55.000> has<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.450> unfortunately<00:04:56.050> stay

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
entrance so it has to unfortunately stay

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.620 
entrance so it has to unfortunately stay
here<00:04:56.610> so<00:04:57.750> but<00:04:59.550> anyways<00:05:00.550> I<00:05:00.850> beat<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.180> monster

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
here so but anyways I beat the monster

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.250 
here so but anyways I beat the monster
so<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:01.900> will<00:05:02.110> get<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:02.410> one<00:05:02.590> level<00:05:03.930> go<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:04.990> two

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
so I will get the one level go to two

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.380 
so I will get the one level go to two
and<00:05:05.590> I<00:05:06.160> get<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:06.550> treasure<00:05:06.820> that<00:05:07.120> it<00:05:07.210> would

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
and I get the treasure that it would

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.880 
and I get the treasure that it would
state<00:05:08.310> which<00:05:09.310> is<00:05:09.520> one<00:05:09.880> so<00:05:10.540> that's<00:05:11.530> pretty<00:05:11.800> much

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
state which is one so that's pretty much

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.010 
state which is one so that's pretty much
how<00:05:12.010> munchkin<00:05:12.640> works<00:05:12.880> and<00:05:13.150> each<00:05:13.510> player<00:05:13.780> would

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
how munchkin works and each player would

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.510 
how munchkin works and each player would
go<00:05:14.200> until<00:05:14.590> they<00:05:14.710> get<00:05:14.830> to<00:05:14.980> someone<00:05:15.220> gets<00:05:15.400> the

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
go until they get to someone gets the

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.980 
go until they get to someone gets the
level<00:05:15.790> 10<00:05:16.110> once<00:05:17.110> someone<00:05:17.440> gets<00:05:17.530> to<00:05:17.800> level<00:05:17.919> 10

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
level 10 once someone gets to level 10

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.240 
level 10 once someone gets to level 10
they<00:05:19.990> still<00:05:20.410> make<00:05:20.560> their<00:05:20.710> way<00:05:20.800> back<00:05:20.830> to<00:05:21.130> the

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
they still make their way back to the

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.500 
they still make their way back to the
entrance<00:05:21.400> and<00:05:21.880> they'll<00:05:22.000> have<00:05:22.150> to<00:05:22.300> fight<00:05:22.480> a

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
entrance and they'll have to fight a

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.230 
entrance and they'll have to fight a
monster<00:05:23.110> of<00:05:23.560> a<00:05:23.800> level<00:05:24.250> 20<00:05:24.580> and<00:05:24.790> it's<00:05:24.970> of<00:05:25.210> course

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
monster of a level 20 and it's of course

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.350 
monster of a level 20 and it's of course
it's<00:05:25.570> randomly<00:05:25.930> generated<00:05:26.669> now<00:05:27.669> on<00:05:27.970> to<00:05:28.180> the

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
it's randomly generated now on to the

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.790 
it's randomly generated now on to the
thing<00:05:29.260> about<00:05:29.500> the<00:05:29.680> big<00:05:29.830> items<00:05:31.380> if<00:05:32.380> for<00:05:32.770> example

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
thing about the big items if for example

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:39.120 
thing about the big items if for example
I<00:05:33.280> had<00:05:33.430> a<00:05:33.460> weapon<00:05:33.640> that<00:05:33.820> said<00:05:34.950> big<00:05:35.950> on<00:05:36.220> it<00:05:38.130> for

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
I had a weapon that said big on it for

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.560 
I had a weapon that said big on it for
example<00:05:39.190> I<00:05:39.430> said<00:05:39.580> somewhere<00:05:40.120> on<00:05:40.210> here<00:05:40.360> said

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
example I said somewhere on here said

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.800 
example I said somewhere on here said
big<00:05:41.550> I'm<00:05:42.550> allowed<00:05:42.850> to<00:05:43.000> have<00:05:43.120> it<00:05:43.150> but<00:05:43.360> if<00:05:43.479> I<00:05:43.570> had

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
big I'm allowed to have it but if I had

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.659 
big I'm allowed to have it but if I had
two<00:05:44.169> items<00:05:44.470> that<00:05:44.620> were<00:05:44.710> said<00:05:44.950> they<00:05:45.040> were<00:05:45.130> big<00:05:45.400> I

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
two items that were said they were big I

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.380 
two items that were said they were big I
would<00:05:46.479> be<00:05:47.080> I<00:05:47.350> would<00:05:47.830> lose<00:05:48.010> one<00:05:48.310> I'd<00:05:49.000> ended<00:05:49.300> up

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
would be I would lose one I'd ended up

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.260 
would be I would lose one I'd ended up
having<00:05:49.720> one<00:05:49.870> less<00:05:50.050> foot<00:05:50.440> for<00:05:50.680> movement<00:05:50.860> so<00:05:51.520> the

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
having one less foot for movement so the

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.700 
having one less foot for movement so the
more<00:05:52.450> you<00:05:52.570> can<00:05:52.600> have<00:05:52.810> unlimited<00:05:53.050> amount<00:05:53.650> of

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
more you can have unlimited amount of

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.710 
more you can have unlimited amount of
big<00:05:53.860> things<00:05:54.100> but<00:05:54.250> once<00:05:54.430> you<00:05:54.580> start<00:05:54.850> piling<00:05:55.419> up

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
big things but once you start piling up

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.750 
big things but once you start piling up
eventually<00:05:56.110> gonna<00:05:56.169> have<00:05:56.320> no<00:05:56.530> feet<00:05:56.800> so<00:05:57.640> when

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
eventually gonna have no feet so when

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.830 
eventually gonna have no feet so when
you're<00:05:57.880> turning<00:05:58.120> you're<00:05:58.240> only<00:05:58.390> able<00:05:58.479> to<00:05:58.630> go<00:05:58.720> in

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
you're turning you're only able to go in

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.020 
you're turning you're only able to go in
one<00:05:58.990> room<00:05:59.229> so<00:05:59.590> it's<00:06:00.220> important<00:06:00.700> to<00:06:00.760> not<00:06:00.880> to

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
one room so it's important to not to

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.420 
one room so it's important to not to
overload<00:06:01.360> yourself<00:06:01.570> with<00:06:02.320> stuff<00:06:02.590> sigue

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
overload yourself with stuff sigue

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.450 
overload yourself with stuff sigue
former<00:06:03.880> rooms<00:06:06.960> another<00:06:07.960> factor<00:06:08.500> is<00:06:08.680> if<00:06:09.250> I'm

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
former rooms another factor is if I'm

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.920 
former rooms another factor is if I'm
here<00:06:09.880> I<00:06:09.910> couldn't<00:06:10.330> meet<00:06:10.419> him<00:06:10.570> I<00:06:10.630> could<00:06:10.810> ask

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
here I couldn't meet him I could ask

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.300 
here I couldn't meet him I could ask
someone<00:06:11.290> for<00:06:11.410> help<00:06:11.560> and<00:06:11.830> they<00:06:11.919> could<00:06:12.070> join<00:06:12.250> me

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
someone for help and they could join me

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.440 
someone for help and they could join me
but<00:06:13.180> that's<00:06:13.300> I<00:06:13.600> have<00:06:13.960> to<00:06:14.110> do<00:06:14.200> that<00:06:14.380> before<00:06:14.560> I<00:06:14.830> uh

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
but that's I have to do that before I uh
