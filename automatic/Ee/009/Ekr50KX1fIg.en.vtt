00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
is Brian here Fitzpatrick's a garage go

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.660 
is Brian here Fitzpatrick's a garage go
there<00:00:03.480> and

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:04.670 
there and

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.990 
there and
ww<00:00:05.240> does<00:00:05.420> on<00:00:05.630> decentered<00:00:06.200> of<00:00:06.350> Zoey<00:00:06.530> and<00:00:07.310> which

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.000 
ww does on decentered of Zoey and which

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.850 
ww does on decentered of Zoey and which
is<00:00:08.120> a<00:00:08.149> showing<00:00:08.510> cruise<00:00:08.809> control<00:00:09.260> that

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
is a showing cruise control that

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.220 
is a showing cruise control that
sometimes<00:00:10.400> we<00:00:10.520> get<00:00:10.639> people<00:00:10.930> questions<00:00:11.930> emerge

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
sometimes we get people questions emerge

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.190 
sometimes we get people questions emerge
that<00:00:12.590> and<00:00:13.220> cruise<00:00:13.460> control<00:00:13.490> works<00:00:14.030> a<00:00:14.300> lot<00:00:15.080> of

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
that and cruise control works a lot of

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.660 
that and cruise control works a lot of
motor<00:00:15.349> cars<00:00:15.700> it's<00:00:16.700> an<00:00:16.820> option<00:00:17.119> on<00:00:17.180> the<00:00:17.330> map

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
motor cars it's an option on the map

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.200 
motor cars it's an option on the map
standard<00:00:19.359> so<00:00:19.960> this<00:00:20.109> is<00:00:20.289> C<00:00:20.439> or<00:00:20.590> B<00:00:20.710> 1.6<00:00:21.340> and<00:00:21.580> so

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
standard so this is C or B 1.6 and so

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.089 
standard so this is C or B 1.6 and so
basically<00:00:22.599> and<00:00:23.140> to<00:00:23.470> enable<00:00:23.650> our<00:00:23.890> cruise

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
basically and to enable our cruise

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.300 
basically and to enable our cruise
control<00:00:24.869> we<00:00:25.869> will<00:00:25.990> have

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
control we will have

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.420 
control we will have
but<00:00:26.460> I'm<00:00:26.730> here<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.680> decided<00:00:28.680> refusing<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.400> a

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
but I'm here so it decided refusing on a

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.770 
but I'm here so it decided refusing on a
motorway<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:31.020> we<00:00:31.500> wanted<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.629> press<00:00:33.629> this

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
motorway and and we wanted to press this

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.200 
motorway and and we wanted to press this
button<00:00:33.840> here<00:00:34.140> which<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> main

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.160 

guide<00:00:37.750> light<00:00:37.990> comes<00:00:38.320> on<00:00:38.470> just<00:00:38.850> there<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.930> we

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
guide light comes on just there and we

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.440 
guide light comes on just there and we
say<00:00:41.440> Grimes<00:00:41.680> do<00:00:41.830> 110<00:00:42.460> so<00:00:42.760> one<00:00:43.000> oppressed<00:00:43.300> is

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
say Grimes do 110 so one oppressed is

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.130 
say Grimes do 110 so one oppressed is
what<00:00:43.630> long<00:00:43.840> hair<00:00:44.050> says<00:00:45.510> what<00:00:46.510> we<00:00:46.660> see<00:00:46.840> in<00:00:46.960> here

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
what long hair says what we see in here

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.380 
what long hair says what we see in here
then<00:00:47.380> is<00:00:47.680> at<00:00:48.220> the<00:00:48.370> very<00:00:48.550> top<00:00:48.580> the<00:00:48.880> speed<00:00:49.120> is<00:00:49.270> now

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
then is at the very top the speed is now

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.290 
then is at the very top the speed is now
set<00:00:49.690> at<00:00:49.720> 111<00:00:50.260> tumblers<00:00:50.860> now<00:00:51.040> and<00:00:51.820> now<00:00:51.940> I<00:00:51.970> can

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
set at 111 tumblers now and now I can

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.250 
set at 111 tumblers now and now I can
take<00:00:52.420> my<00:00:52.680> foot<00:00:53.680> away<00:00:54.160> from<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.520> accelerator

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
take my foot away from the accelerator

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.170 
take my foot away from the accelerator
so<00:00:56.260> my<00:00:56.379> foot<00:00:56.590> stall<00:00:56.770> over<00:00:57.010> there<00:00:57.220> which<00:00:57.940> means

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
so my foot stall over there which means

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.880 
so my foot stall over there which means
that<00:00:58.390> powers<00:00:58.720> going<00:00:58.960> to<00:00:59.340> continue<00:01:00.360> to<00:01:01.360> pull

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
that powers going to continue to pull

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.660 
that powers going to continue to pull
hours<00:01:02.890> are<00:01:03.129> until<00:01:03.820> I<00:01:03.879> brake<00:01:04.449> or<00:01:05.140> clutch

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
hours are until I brake or clutch

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.969 
hours are until I brake or clutch
disable<00:01:06.670> totally<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:08.140> other<00:01:08.260> thing<00:01:08.500> that<00:01:08.530> it

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
disable totally the other thing that it

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.590 
disable totally the other thing that it
also<00:01:09.130> does<00:01:09.460> is<00:01:09.790> it<00:01:09.820> also<00:01:10.090> has<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.300> level

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
also does is it also has a level

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.700 
also does is it also has a level
function<00:01:11.050> so<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:13.420> have<00:01:13.570> our<00:01:13.690> control<00:01:14.229> sergeant

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
function so we have our control sergeant

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.889 
function so we have our control sergeant
moment<00:01:15.100> so<00:01:15.700> if<00:01:15.880> I<00:01:16.030> come<00:01:16.210> along<00:01:16.330> and<00:01:16.600> I<00:01:16.690> press

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
moment so if I come along and I press

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.760 
moment so if I come along and I press
the<00:01:17.050> limit<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.759> car<00:01:18.940> is<00:01:19.090> now<00:01:19.210> encrypted<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
the limit the car is now encrypted and

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.530 
the limit the car is now encrypted and
it<00:01:20.890> won't

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
it won't

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.469 
it won't
when<00:01:23.260> she<00:01:23.380> said<00:01:23.560> to<00:01:23.590> them

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
when she said to them

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.440 
when she said to them
so<00:01:24.780> same<00:01:25.020> idea<00:01:25.200> they<00:01:25.740> were<00:01:25.799> success<00:01:26.299> and<00:01:27.299> our

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
so same idea they were success and our

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.660 
so same idea they were success and our
lips<00:01:27.659> apply<00:01:28.219> go<00:01:29.219> to<00:01:29.250> acceleration<00:01:29.820> at<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.180> car

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.060 

and<00:01:33.670> exceed<00:01:34.570> that<00:01:35.020> speech<00:01:35.320> -<00:01:35.710> maybe<00:01:36.070> not

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.620 

and<00:01:39.430> so<00:01:39.670> basically<00:01:39.850> that's<00:01:40.060> cruise<00:01:40.300> control

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
and so basically that's cruise control

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.810 
and so basically that's cruise control
and<00:01:40.960> Emmas<00:01:41.590> functions<00:01:41.980> on<00:01:42.130> civics<00:01:42.520> it's<00:01:42.700> on

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
and Emmas functions on civics it's on

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.760 
and Emmas functions on civics it's on
the<00:01:42.940> corn<00:01:43.210> it's<00:01:43.510> on<00:01:43.630> CRVs<00:01:44.230> and<00:01:44.470> lots<00:01:44.620> of

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
the corn it's on CRVs and lots of

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.260 
the corn it's on CRVs and lots of
character<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.670> obviously<00:01:48.670> it's<00:01:48.910> useful

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
character so obviously it's useful

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.180 
character so obviously it's useful
because<00:01:49.360> just<00:01:49.870> a<00:01:49.930> lot<00:01:50.050> of<00:01:50.140> gamers<00:01:50.410> solely<00:01:51.040> in

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
because just a lot of gamers solely in

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.460 
because just a lot of gamers solely in
the<00:01:51.220> trailing<00:01:51.580> cars<00:01:51.790> had<00:01:52.630> cruised<00:01:52.960> Ron<00:01:53.230> had

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
the trailing cars had cruised Ron had

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.590 
the trailing cars had cruised Ron had
never<00:01:53.860> used<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.550> such<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.270> useful

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
never used it and such a useful

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.310 
never used it and such a useful
functions

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.770 

so<00:01:59.320> we<00:01:59.440> have<00:01:59.530> perfect<00:01:59.890> bachelor<00:02:01.140> www.hsn

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
so we have perfect bachelor www.hsn

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.690 
so we have perfect bachelor www.hsn
three<00:02:04.140> one<00:02:04.290> zero<00:02:04.320> zero<00:02:04.590> zero<00:02:04.799> their<00:02:05.369> brains

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
three one zero zero zero their brains

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.570 
three one zero zero zero their brains
with<00:02:05.940> it<00:02:06.060> thanks<00:02:06.360> Roger
