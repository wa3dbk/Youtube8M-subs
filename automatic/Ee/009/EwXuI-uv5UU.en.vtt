00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
actual zip zipper but I've actually made

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.619

it<00:01:00.899> about<00:01:01.590> centimeter<00:01:02.370> longer<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.359> just

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
it about centimeter longer that just

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.020 
it about centimeter longer that just
allows<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.350> sloughed<00:01:04.650> slider<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.460> go<00:01:05.580> up<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
allows the sloughed slider to go up and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.550 
allows the sloughed slider to go up and
down<00:01:06.180> without<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.750> actually<00:01:06.840> getting<00:01:07.290> caught

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
down without it actually getting caught

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.660 
down without it actually getting caught
in<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.920> lining<00:01:09.229> before<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.710> actually<00:01:10.920> show<00:01:11.310> you

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670

how to sew the lining to the garment we

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.380 
how to sew the lining to the garment we
need<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.090> pin<00:01:15.360> first<00:01:16.790> I'm<00:01:17.790> working<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
need to pin first I'm working on the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.390 
need to pin first I'm working on the
wrong<00:01:18.540> side<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.930> my<00:01:18.960> garment<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.799> then

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
wrong side of my garment and then

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.270 
wrong side of my garment and then
placing<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> wrong<00:01:21.240> side<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:23.070> lining

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
placing the wrong side of the lining

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.850 
placing the wrong side of the lining
onto<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> wrong<00:01:24.330> side<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.990> garment<00:01:25.020> now

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
onto the wrong side of the garment now

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.149 
onto the wrong side of the garment now
this<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.580> area<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.840> which<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.500> lining<00:01:28.740> has

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
this is the area in which the lining has

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.160 
this is the area in which the lining has
to<00:01:29.460> be<00:01:29.759> sewn<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.659> seam<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.049> there

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
to be sewn on to the seam and there

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.460 
to be sewn on to the seam and there
isn't<00:01:31.740> much<00:01:31.979> as<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:32.970> see<00:01:33.180> there<00:01:33.479> or<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
isn't much as you can see there or the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.050 
isn't much as you can see there or the
seam<00:01:34.650> allowance<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.670> because<00:01:36.030> of

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
seam allowance and that is because of

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.240 
seam allowance and that is because of
the<00:01:36.570> type<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.470> consideration<00:01:37.979> I've<00:01:38.070> gone

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the type of the consideration I've gone

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.780 
the type of the consideration I've gone
for<00:01:39.020> so<00:01:40.020> we've<00:01:40.590> got<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> seam<00:01:41.100> line<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
for so we've got a seam line in the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.850 
for so we've got a seam line in the
actual<00:01:42.150> lining<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.049> we're<00:01:43.229> going<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.560> match

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
actual lining and we're going to match

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.350 
actual lining and we're going to match
that<00:01:44.220> up<00:01:44.659> against<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:47.159> stitching<00:01:47.790> line<00:01:48.030> as

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
that up against the stitching line as

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.620 
that up against the stitching line as
much<00:01:48.600> as<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:50.149> and<00:01:51.149> then<00:01:51.299> we're<00:01:51.450> going<00:01:51.600> to

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
much as we can and then we're going to

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.260 
much as we can and then we're going to
pin<00:01:51.899> through<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.530> lining<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.640> zipper<00:01:53.909> and

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
pin through the lining the zipper and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:03.960 
pin through the lining the zipper and
the<00:01:54.540> seam<00:01:54.750> allowance

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.389 

let's<00:02:04.970> go<00:02:05.060> all<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.660> way<00:02:05.690> down<00:02:08.920> so<00:02:09.920> pulling

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
let's go all the way down so pulling

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.200 
let's go all the way down so pulling
through<00:02:10.610> all<00:02:10.820> thicknesses<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:13.490> we'll<00:02:13.760> stop

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
through all thicknesses and we'll stop

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:23.730 
through all thicknesses and we'll stop
about<00:02:14.780> there<00:02:17.860> so<00:02:18.860> there<00:02:19.040> we<00:02:19.160> have<00:02:19.310> it

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.170 

I'm<00:02:24.740> working<00:02:25.250> on<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.520> wrong<00:02:25.670> side<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:25.970> the

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
I'm working on the wrong side of the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.120 
I'm working on the wrong side of the

garment and I'm working on the actual
seam<00:02:28.459> allowance<00:02:28.940> of<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.150> garment<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:29.840> the

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
seam allowance of the garment and the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.310 
seam allowance of the garment and the
zip<00:02:30.770> tape<00:02:31.070> is<00:02:31.310> in<00:02:31.910> between<00:02:32.570> there<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:33.020> can<00:02:33.170> just

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
zip tape is in between there I can just

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.410 
zip tape is in between there I can just
give<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.590> little<00:02:33.770> peep<00:02:34.160> there<00:02:34.850> it<00:02:34.970> is<00:02:35.150> and

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
give you a little peep there it is and

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.290 
give you a little peep there it is and
here's<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.110> lining<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.700> it's<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.760> very<00:02:38.000> narrow

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
here's the lining and it's a very narrow

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.729 
here's the lining and it's a very narrow
space<00:02:38.420> in<00:02:38.930> which<00:02:39.110> you've<00:02:39.260> actually<00:02:39.410> got<00:02:39.709> to

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
space in which you've actually got to

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.250 
space in which you've actually got to
work<00:02:39.920> in<00:02:40.340> order<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.760> catch<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.120> actual<00:02:41.840> zipper

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
work in order to catch the actual zipper

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.850 
work in order to catch the actual zipper
tape<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.100> make<00:02:43.430> sure<00:02:43.459> that<00:02:44.150> this<00:02:45.050> line<00:02:45.290> here<00:02:45.650> is

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
tape so make sure that this line here is

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.130 
tape so make sure that this line here is
actually<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.640> seam<00:02:47.000> line<00:02:47.239> in<00:02:47.510> which<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.959> zip

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
actually the seam line in which the zip

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.949 
actually the seam line in which the zip
insertion<00:02:48.800> was<00:02:49.190> actually<00:02:49.550> sewn<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:50.060> so<00:02:50.720> we

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
insertion was actually sewn to so we

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.750 
insertion was actually sewn to so we
need<00:02:50.989> to<00:02:51.290> make<00:02:51.470> sure<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:51.680> we<00:02:52.040> stay<00:02:52.220> close<00:02:52.489> to

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
need to make sure that we stay close to

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:00.400 
need to make sure that we stay close to
the<00:02:52.850> line<00:02:53.030> but<00:02:53.239> do<00:02:53.510> not<00:02:53.690> stitch<00:02:54.080> on<00:02:54.320> it<00:02:59.410> just

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
the line but do not stitch on it just

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.160 
the line but do not stitch on it just
take<00:03:00.620> your<00:03:00.709> time<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.730> may<00:03:02.120> also<00:03:02.300> be<00:03:02.480> easier

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
take your time and it may also be easier

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.070 
take your time and it may also be easier
to<00:03:03.770> make<00:03:03.920> sure<00:03:04.070> you<00:03:04.220> do<00:03:04.489> catch<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.840> zipper

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
to make sure you do catch the zipper

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
to make sure you do catch the zipper
tape<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:07.580> actually<00:03:08.030> based<00:03:11.410> if<00:03:12.410> not<00:03:12.680> then<00:03:13.070> just

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
tape to actually based if not then just

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.070 
tape to actually based if not then just
make<00:03:13.760> sure<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.030> go<00:03:14.150> slowly<00:03:14.510> because<00:03:14.780> you<00:03:14.900> want

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
make sure you go slowly because you want

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.990 
make sure you go slowly because you want
to<00:03:15.140> make<00:03:15.290> sure<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:15.650> don't<00:03:15.860> stitch<00:03:16.190> anywhere

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
to make sure you don't stitch anywhere

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.600 
to make sure you don't stitch anywhere
over<00:03:17.360> this<00:03:17.480> seam<00:03:17.780> line

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:33.710 

pull<00:03:23.610> your<00:03:23.730> pins<00:03:23.970> out<00:03:24.150> as<00:03:24.360> you<00:03:24.540> go<00:03:32.690> make<00:03:33.690> sure

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
pull your pins out as you go make sure

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.080 
pull your pins out as you go make sure
that<00:03:34.170> I'm<00:03:34.290> not<00:03:34.379> stitching<00:03:34.739> on<00:03:35.069> to<00:03:35.340> check<00:03:35.970> your

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
that I'm not stitching on to check your

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.729 
that I'm not stitching on to check your
work<00:03:36.209> now<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.810> again<00:03:37.019> just<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.440> make<00:03:37.470> sure

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
work now and again just to make sure

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:47.390 
work now and again just to make sure
that<00:03:37.920> you're<00:03:38.069> not<00:03:39.680> so<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:40.920> garment<00:03:46.400> and

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
that you're not so in the garment and

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.539 
that you're not so in the garment and
then<00:03:47.579> I've<00:03:48.180> just<00:03:48.690> passed<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.560> end<00:03:49.860> of<00:03:50.159> the

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
then I've just passed the end of the

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.210 
then I've just passed the end of the
zipper<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:51.720> I'm<00:03:52.049> now<00:03:52.260> going<00:03:52.319> to<00:03:52.560> secure<00:03:53.010> my

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
zipper so I'm now going to secure my

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.349 
zipper so I'm now going to secure my
stitching<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:56.819> would<00:03:56.970> actually<00:03:57.120> recommend

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
stitching and I would actually recommend

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.199 
stitching and I would actually recommend
that<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.440> actually<00:03:58.590> use<00:03:58.920> your<00:03:59.489> zippers<00:04:00.030> as

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
that you actually use your zippers as

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.339 
that you actually use your zippers as
well<00:04:00.560> so<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.620> should<00:04:01.650> see<00:04:02.069> a<00:04:02.370> nice<00:04:03.049> seam<00:04:04.049> line

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
well so you should see a nice seam line

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.970 
well so you should see a nice seam line
along<00:04:05.010> there<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.840> hopefully<00:04:06.840> here<00:04:07.650> we<00:04:07.739> go

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
along there and hopefully here we go

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.610 
along there and hopefully here we go
yeah<00:04:08.849> it<00:04:09.180> has<00:04:09.359> a<00:04:09.390> come<00:04:09.690> through<00:04:09.930> onto<00:04:10.530> the

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
yeah it has a come through onto the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.430 
yeah it has a come through onto the
right<00:04:10.739> side<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.129> garment<00:04:11.340> and<00:04:11.870> if<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:12.959> show

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
right side of the garment and if I show

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.670 
right side of the garment and if I show
you<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:14.280> actual<00:04:17.180> take<00:04:18.180> zipper<00:04:18.539> tape<00:04:18.720> as<00:04:19.440> it's

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
you the actual take zipper tape as it's

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.070 
you the actual take zipper tape as it's
just<00:04:20.130> about<00:04:20.430> quarter<00:04:23.750> here<00:04:24.750> we<00:04:24.870> have<00:04:24.990> it

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
just about quarter here we have it

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.379 
just about quarter here we have it
completed<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.830> lining<00:04:26.400> zone<00:04:26.639> to<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:26.910> zipper

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
completed the lining zone to the zipper

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.690 
completed the lining zone to the zipper
and<00:04:28.050> you<00:04:28.289> can<00:04:28.440> see<00:04:28.590> some<00:04:28.800> white<00:04:29.039> thread<00:04:29.070> there

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
and you can see some white thread there

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.610 
and you can see some white thread there
but<00:04:29.940> if<00:04:30.120> you're<00:04:30.300> using<00:04:30.539> your<00:04:30.660> fashion<00:04:31.440> fabric

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
but if you're using your fashion fabric

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.680 
but if you're using your fashion fabric
obviously<00:04:32.460> you'll<00:04:32.700> find<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.210> right<00:04:33.360> and

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
obviously you'll find the right and

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.409 
obviously you'll find the right and
match<00:04:34.200> to<00:04:34.500> your<00:04:34.710> actual<00:04:34.950> fabric<00:04:35.729> but<00:04:35.910> you<00:04:36.030> will

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
match to your actual fabric but you will

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.310 
match to your actual fabric but you will
get<00:04:36.750> a<00:04:37.760> stitching<00:04:38.760> line<00:04:38.970> along<00:04:39.419> there<00:04:39.690> that's

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
get a stitching line along there that's

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.219 
get a stitching line along there that's
because<00:04:41.010> I<00:04:41.520> just<00:04:42.120> can<00:04:42.389> reach<00:04:42.630> out<00:04:42.900> and<00:04:42.930> show

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
because I just can reach out and show

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.370 
because I just can reach out and show
you<00:04:43.320> what<00:04:43.500> we<00:04:43.620> did<00:04:43.860> or<00:04:44.310> what<00:04:44.370> I<00:04:45.150> did<00:04:45.300> is<00:04:45.750> that<00:04:46.080> I

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
you what we did or what I did is that I

you what we did or what I did is that I
sewn<00:04:46.889> a<00:04:47.220> stitch<00:04:47.700> line<00:04:47.940> all<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.360> way<00:04:48.389> the

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
sewn a stitch line all the way the

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.520 
sewn a stitch line all the way the
length<00:04:49.410> of<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.770> zip<00:04:49.979> and<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:51.240> made<00:04:51.870> sure<00:04:52.199> that<00:04:52.440> I

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
length of the zip and I made sure that I

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.129 
length of the zip and I made sure that I
didn't<00:04:53.099> stitch<00:04:53.400> on<00:04:53.639> this<00:04:53.880> line<00:04:54.389> here<00:04:54.720> which<00:04:54.990> is

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
didn't stitch on this line here which is
