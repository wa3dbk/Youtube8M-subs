00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.930
 root recipe that was born with the 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.570
 caboclos 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.790
 then write down the ingredients you go 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.050

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:56.399
 bovine and 500 grams of bovine muscle 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:00.670

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.289
 liters of beef broth three 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.050
 Laurel a pinch of cumin imposes salt 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:13.780

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.490
 calabresa dehydrated august 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.670
 janaína with the seasonings cut the 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.100
 next step is to work the face then 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.770
 to taste ideal stuff I use two 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.680
 cuts one is muscle is one flesh 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.799
 well known and the second is the chest 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.720
 I recommend that tours be cut and 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.409
 then turn into large cubes 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.380
 because at the time of cooking and it goes 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.780

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.790

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.530
 and mixing 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:57.159
 then you cut the bacon in 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.720

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.930
 especially put the green smell is 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.400
 All right, the meat has already taken 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.470
 that flavor 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.830
 We'll put the broth on it. 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.590
 open pot will take about three hours 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.480
 gradually you hydrate this your 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.970
 cooked because the barreado needs to stay 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.970
 with broth it can not be dry 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.650
 when we expect the average time 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.700
 but neither of the two hours and two hours 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.620

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.450
 stay above that broth of flesh then 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.810
