00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.520 
these in a bag when I first bought my
other<00:03:54.650> one<00:03:54.890> I<00:03:54.920> put<00:03:55.250> them<00:03:55.430> all<00:03:55.610> in<00:03:55.850> here<00:03:56.380> and<00:03:57.380> I

don't know I just think it's cleaner to
keep<00:03:59.690> them<00:03:59.900> in<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.080> bag<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:00.290> if<00:04:00.620> you<00:04:00.739> do<00:04:00.920> buy

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
and then you you know you fill this up

00:04:48.120 --> 00:05:01.460 
and then you you know you fill this up
with<00:04:48.180> water<00:04:48.570> and<00:04:51.289> then<00:04:59.630> put<00:05:00.630> your<00:05:00.780> top<00:05:01.020> on<00:05:01.229> it

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
with water and then put your top on it

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:08.689 
with water and then put your top on it
and<00:05:01.650> it<00:05:02.400> is<00:05:03.800> approximately<00:05:04.800> 90<00:05:05.430> seconds<00:05:07.699> these

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
and it is approximately 90 seconds these

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.279 
and it is approximately 90 seconds these
are<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:08.970> other<00:05:09.150> ones<00:05:09.660> that<00:05:09.990> come<00:05:10.259> with<00:05:10.470> it<00:05:10.910> and

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:12.289 
are the other ones that come with it and

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.930 
are the other ones that come with it and
this<00:05:13.289> is<00:05:13.349> I<00:05:13.710> think<00:05:13.740> goes<00:05:14.130> to<00:05:14.280> the<00:05:14.400> toothbrush

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
this is I think goes to the toothbrush

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.230 
this is I think goes to the toothbrush
so<00:05:15.389> I've<00:05:15.720> not<00:05:16.020> used<00:05:16.349> these<00:05:16.620> but<00:05:17.430> it<00:05:17.669> does<00:05:17.849> come

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
so I've not used these but it does come

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.580 
so I've not used these but it does come
with<00:05:18.449> directions<00:05:18.630> for<00:05:19.820> with<00:05:20.820> those<00:05:21.000> other

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
with directions for with those other

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.689 
with directions for with those other
ends<00:05:22.590> or<00:05:22.889> for<00:05:23.360> so<00:05:24.680> you<00:05:25.680> know<00:05:25.800> you<00:05:25.860> can<00:05:26.250> use<00:05:26.520> them

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
ends or for so you know you can use them

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.140 
ends or for so you know you can use them
if<00:05:26.820> you<00:05:26.940> need<00:05:27.090> them<00:05:27.210> but<00:05:27.750> after<00:05:28.110> using<00:05:28.349> this

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:24.020 
dirty but you know anything will get and
buildup<00:06:19.650> and<00:06:20.460> actually<00:06:21.449> it<00:06:21.840> has<00:06:21.870> cleaning<00:06:23.030> for

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
buildup and actually it has cleaning for

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.120 
buildup and actually it has cleaning for
removing<00:06:24.599> hard<00:06:24.840> water<00:06:25.080> deposits<00:06:25.199> and<00:06:25.979> that's

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
removing hard water deposits and that's

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.610 
removing hard water deposits and that's
really<00:06:26.340> what<00:06:26.580> I<00:06:26.610> was<00:06:26.849> trying<00:06:27.120> to<00:06:27.180> do<00:06:27.620> because

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
really what I was trying to do because

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.430 
really what I was trying to do because
there<00:06:29.099> was<00:06:29.310> you<00:06:29.880> know<00:06:29.909> some<00:06:30.200> deposit<00:06:31.200> stuff

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
there was you know some deposit stuff

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.620 
there was you know some deposit stuff
going<00:06:31.770> on<00:06:31.979> so<00:06:32.550> anyway<00:06:32.940> next<00:06:33.180> time<00:06:33.300> I'll<00:06:33.599> just

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
going on so anyway next time I'll just

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.719 
going on so anyway next time I'll just
read<00:06:33.990> this<00:06:34.200> instead<00:06:34.560> of<00:06:34.620> throwing<00:06:35.250> it<00:06:35.520> in<00:06:35.639> a

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
read this instead of throwing it in a

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.180 
read this instead of throwing it in a
pot

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
pot

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.620 
pot
and<00:06:38.190> I<00:06:38.280> mean<00:06:38.490> I<00:06:38.669> was<00:06:38.820> watching<00:06:39.240> that<00:06:39.270> I<00:06:39.389> didn't

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
and I mean I was watching that I didn't

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.900 
and I mean I was watching that I didn't
even<00:06:39.750> that<00:06:40.050> there<00:06:40.470> in<00:06:40.740> there<00:06:41.040> that<00:06:41.280> long<00:06:41.520> but

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910 
even that there in there that long but

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.900 
even that there in there that long but
it<00:06:42.479> was<00:06:42.660> long<00:06:42.720> enough<00:06:43.229> for<00:06:43.470> this<00:06:43.650> to<00:06:44.100> change

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910 
it was long enough for this to change

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.590 
it was long enough for this to change
shape<00:06:46.130> this<00:06:47.130> didn't<00:06:47.550> change<00:06:47.580> shape<00:06:48.120> so<00:06:48.360> much

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 
shape this didn't change shape so much

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.420 
shape this didn't change shape so much
but<00:06:49.260> these<00:06:49.820> definitely<00:06:50.820> changed<00:06:51.510> their<00:06:51.840> shape

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.430 
but these definitely changed their shape

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.240 
but these definitely changed their shape
and<00:06:53.750> the<00:06:54.750> reason<00:06:55.320> that<00:06:55.380> I<00:06:55.440> really<00:06:55.889> had<00:06:56.040> to<00:06:56.130> get

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
and the reason that I really had to get

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.189 
and the reason that I really had to get
another<00:06:56.400> one<00:06:56.639> was<00:06:56.820> because<00:06:56.970> this<00:06:57.870> one

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 
another one was because this one

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.920 
another one was because this one
actually<00:06:58.650> just<00:06:59.340> went<00:06:59.550> straight<00:06:59.760> up<00:07:00.180> and<00:07:00.479> it

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
actually just went straight up and it

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.780 
actually just went straight up and it
wasn't<00:07:01.139> Ben's<00:07:01.590> anymore<00:07:02.160> and<00:07:02.400> the<00:07:02.490> force

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:02.790 
wasn't Ben's anymore and the force

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.430 
wasn't Ben's anymore and the force
wasn't<00:07:03.060> there<00:07:03.389> so<00:07:03.720> that's<00:07:03.930> why<00:07:04.080> I<00:07:04.110> had<00:07:04.410> to

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 
wasn't there so that's why I had to

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.219 
wasn't there so that's why I had to
purchase<00:07:05.070> another<00:07:05.340> one<00:07:05.610> so<00:07:06.300> you<00:07:06.900> know<00:07:07.020> learn

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
purchase another one so you know learn

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:10.129 
purchase another one so you know learn
