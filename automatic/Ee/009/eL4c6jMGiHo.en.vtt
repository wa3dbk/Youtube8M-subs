00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
this is the free add-on I think this was

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.479 
this is the free add-on I think this was
the<00:01:02.760> free<00:01:02.969> part<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.320> kid<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.309> don't

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the free part in the kid and I don't

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.530 
the free part in the kid and I don't
have<00:01:05.729> any<00:01:06.030> idea<00:01:06.510> why<00:01:06.869> they<00:01:07.409> put<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.100> there

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
have any idea why they put this in there

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.969 
have any idea why they put this in there
seems<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:09.960> bizarre<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.560> me<00:01:12.680> it's<00:01:13.680> cool

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
seems really bizarre to me it's cool

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.219 
seems really bizarre to me it's cool
enough<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.240> didn't<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:15.689> buy<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.020> for

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
enough but I didn't really buy it for

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.740 
enough but I didn't really buy it for
this<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:17.280> set<00:01:17.549> was<00:01:17.580> twenty-eight<00:01:18.420> dollars

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
this the set was twenty-eight dollars

this the set was twenty-eight dollars
and<00:01:19.229> I'm<00:01:19.590> guessing<00:01:19.979> out<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.280> that

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
and I'm guessing out of that

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.429 
and I'm guessing out of that
twenty-eight<00:01:20.970> dollars<00:01:21.119> maybe<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.900> was<00:01:22.110> one

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
twenty-eight dollars maybe this was one

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.300 
twenty-eight dollars maybe this was one
dollar<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.540> little<00:01:25.310> chunk

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
dollar of that it's just a little chunk

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:35.020 
dollar of that it's just a little chunk
of<00:01:26.460> plastic<00:01:30.140> pulling<00:01:31.140> these<00:01:31.320> heads<00:01:31.619> out<00:01:31.890> and

bit<00:02:44.610> tricky<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.120> get<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.510> on<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:46.410> have<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.590> push

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
bit tricky to get it on you have to push

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.820 
bit tricky to get it on you have to push
it<00:02:46.830> pretty<00:02:47.550> hard<00:02:47.630> but<00:02:48.630> once<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.990> is<00:02:49.020> on<00:02:49.320> makes<00:02:49.710> a

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
it pretty hard but once it is on makes a

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.420 
it pretty hard but once it is on makes a
nice<00:02:50.360> solid<00:02:51.360> bond<00:02:51.780> much<00:02:52.110> more<00:02:52.380> solid<00:02:53.010> than<00:02:53.160> the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
nice solid bond much more solid than the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.610 
nice solid bond much more solid than the
bond<00:02:53.640> on<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.240> standard<00:02:54.720> Hercules<00:02:55.200> head<00:02:55.410> and

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
bond on the standard Hercules head and

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.290 
bond on the standard Hercules head and
same<00:02:56.580> with<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.850> other<00:02:56.880> face<00:02:57.240> we<00:02:58.110> just<00:02:59.270> tap<00:03:00.270> it

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
same with the other face we just tap it

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.500 
same with the other face we just tap it
in<00:03:00.540> at<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.810> sides<00:03:01.050> give<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.710> really<00:03:02.510> hard

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
in at the sides give it a really hard

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.350 
in at the sides give it a really hard
push<00:03:04.020> just<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.530> make<00:03:04.710> that<00:03:04.980> mating<00:03:05.250> happen<00:03:08.360> and

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
push just to make that mating happen and

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.020 
push just to make that mating happen and
then<00:03:09.750> we've<00:03:10.470> got<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.650> solid<00:03:10.980> solid<00:03:11.490> connection

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
then we've got a solid solid connection

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.300 
then we've got a solid solid connection
there<00:03:12.180> it's<00:03:12.330> not<00:03:12.420> going<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.660> fall<00:03:12.870> off<00:03:16.250> one<00:03:17.250> of

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
there it's not going to fall off one of

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.250 
there it's not going to fall off one of
the<00:03:17.460> good<00:03:17.580> things<00:03:17.640> about<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.210> set<00:03:18.480> let's<00:03:19.050> get

going to peg right into the fist of dr.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.000 
going to peg right into the fist of dr.
cranky<00:03:59.390> really<00:04:00.390> easy<00:04:00.570> just<00:04:00.930> push<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.230> in<00:04:01.470> it

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
cranky really easy just push it in it

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.120 
cranky really easy just push it in it
makes<00:04:02.220> nice<00:04:02.960> secure<00:04:03.960> connection<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.650> there

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
makes nice secure connection and there

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.510 
makes nice secure connection and there
you<00:04:05.220> go<00:04:06.560> so<00:04:07.560> it's<00:04:08.280> supposed<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.730> look<00:04:08.910> more<00:04:10.520> g1

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
you go so it's supposed to look more g1

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.650 
you go so it's supposed to look more g1
I<00:04:11.930> think<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.020> does<00:04:13.200> look<00:04:13.770> a<00:04:14.010> bit<00:04:14.070> more<00:04:14.430> g<00:04:14.670> 1<00:04:14.880> i'm

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
I think it does look a bit more g 1 i'm

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
I think it does look a bit more g 1 i'm
not<00:04:15.959> a<00:04:16.230> hundred<00:04:16.980> percent<00:04:17.190> sure<00:04:17.609> if<00:04:18.680> I'm

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
not a hundred percent sure if I'm

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.090 
not a hundred percent sure if I'm
entirely<00:04:20.070> happy<00:04:20.310> with<00:04:20.580> it<00:04:20.820> I<00:04:20.880> think

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
entirely happy with it I think

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.710 
entirely happy with it I think
I<00:04:22.360> think<00:04:23.360> it's<00:04:23.480> just<00:04:23.570> a<00:04:23.810> tad<00:04:24.200> too<00:04:24.620> small<00:04:25.720> but

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
I think it's just a tad too small but

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.880 
I think it's just a tad too small but
it's<00:04:26.870> it's<00:04:27.170> pretty<00:04:27.440> good<00:04:27.650> i<00:04:27.680> mean<00:04:29.560> it<00:04:30.560> holds<00:04:30.830> up

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
it's it's pretty good i mean it holds up

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.820 
it's it's pretty good i mean it holds up
well<00:04:31.100> in<00:04:31.340> comparison<00:04:31.880> to<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.210> TFC<00:04:32.840> versions<00:04:33.290> i

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
well in comparison to the TFC versions i

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.500 
well in comparison to the TFC versions i
have<00:04:34.340> to<00:04:34.460> live<00:04:34.640> with<00:04:34.820> it<00:04:34.910> a<00:04:35.000> little<00:04:35.150> bit<00:04:35.270> longer

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
have to live with it a little bit longer

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.810 
have to live with it a little bit longer
before<00:04:35.840> i<00:04:36.050> can<00:04:36.290> say<00:04:37.100> which<00:04:37.340> one<00:04:37.520> I<00:04:37.550> like<00:04:37.790> the

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
before i can say which one I like the

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.620 
before i can say which one I like the
best<00:04:37.940> I<00:04:38.270> think<00:04:38.300> but<00:04:39.110> it<00:04:39.200> does<00:04:40.190> have<00:04:40.490> a<00:04:40.790> really

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
best I think but it does have a really

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.340 
best I think but it does have a really
nice<00:04:41.780> book<00:04:42.080> just<00:04:42.320> in<00:04:42.560> and<00:04:42.860> of<00:04:42.920> itself<00:04:44.290> and<00:04:45.290> for

nice book just in and of itself and for

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.890 
nice book just in and of itself and for
the<00:04:45.590> price<00:04:46.270> twenty-eight<00:04:47.270> dollars<00:04:47.450> for<00:04:47.750> two

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
the price twenty-eight dollars for two

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.170 
the price twenty-eight dollars for two
heads<00:04:48.140> why<00:04:49.070> not<00:04:49.310> I<00:04:49.520> mean<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:49.850> range<00:04:50.060> of

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180
