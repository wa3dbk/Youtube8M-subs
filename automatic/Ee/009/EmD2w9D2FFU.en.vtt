00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
the decision we should try the easy

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.150 
the decision we should try the easy
boots<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.270> extend<00:04:07.630> that<00:04:07.720> barefoot<00:04:08.260> time<00:04:08.500> and

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
boots to extend that barefoot time and

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.010

it<00:04:09.310> worked<00:04:09.520> really<00:04:09.820> well<00:04:09.970> but<00:04:10.450> as<00:04:10.570> soon<00:04:10.750> as<00:04:10.810> I'd

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
it worked really well but as soon as I'd

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.570 
it worked really well but as soon as I'd
