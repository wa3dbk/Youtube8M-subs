 to 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.900

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.130
 academy where the royal rae academy 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.810

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.630
 when 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.519
 and an adjective in honor of lio messi arrives 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:21.840
 to the real Spanish pressure academy 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:25.260

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.310
 natural goal dip before 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.620
