00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
mode in the vehicle mode it works fine

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.370

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
bit weird now that might just be the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.010 
bit weird now that might just be the

doing anything to it I'm just letting
gravity<00:03:56.790> take<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.209> hold<00:03:57.449> of<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.659> that<00:03:58.229> tells<00:03:58.500> me

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
gravity take a hold of it that tells me

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.979 
gravity take a hold of it that tells me
that<00:03:58.799> that<00:03:59.220> was<00:03:59.760> it's<00:04:00.000> assembled<00:04:00.569> incorrectly

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
that that was it's assembled incorrectly

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.319 
that that was it's assembled incorrectly
so<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:01.799> normally<00:04:02.220> just<00:04:02.250> keep<00:04:02.669> the<00:04:02.879> flippers

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
so I normally just keep the flippers

costs $100 or close to 100 dollars have
the<00:05:53.330> problems<00:05:53.899> that<00:05:54.199> this<00:05:54.349> guy<00:05:54.589> does<00:05:54.919> it's

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
the problems that this guy does it's

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.480 
the problems that this guy does it's
just<00:05:55.909> absolutely<00:05:56.139> inexcusable<00:05:57.159> so<00:05:58.159> I

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
just absolutely inexcusable so I

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.879 
just absolutely inexcusable so I

wouldn't bother with this guy instead I

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.639 
wouldn't bother with this guy instead I
would<00:06:01.009> go<00:06:01.430> search<00:06:02.000> out<00:06:02.270> the<00:06:02.569> hunt<00:06:03.409> for<00:06:03.560> the
