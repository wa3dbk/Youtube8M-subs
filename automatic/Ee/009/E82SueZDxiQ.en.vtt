00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello youtube people are said to them 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.180
 brings a very important news background 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.490
 a game of modern warfare 2 being 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.599
 by the nape of the neck and good if you follow me in 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.639
 facebook on twitter will have already 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.219
 aware if I do not happen to comment now 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.020
 same what is happening ultra the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.720
 company that made me partner has promised 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.910
 several things in a written contract that 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.830
 you have to read and sign before entering 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.390
 to the company and then at the time of 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.210
 meet those terms listed in 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.019
 this contract they think about not fulfilling them and 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.240
 ignore them 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.610
 first of all I'm going to talk about the subject of 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.200
 payments and monetization of videos that 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.090
 really the personal has not yet 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.579
 interested and I have not received a single 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.260
 cent for example have promised to pay 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.780
 a value for every 1000 visits that 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.180
 have in your videos and then let us know 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.640
 once made partners and working in 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.430
 that company that number is going to be less 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.379
 of half who promised an example 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.600
 of this to make it clear it 's as if in 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.270
 your work will pay you say a few 100 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.399
 weights per extra hour of work that 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.640
 you do and then when they give you the receipt of 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.530
 salary they gave you 40 pesos or much less 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.240
 for those hours worked 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.190
 I do not want to give ultra values 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.260
 because each one can vary between 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.750
 partner and partner I the truth that I have not 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.490
 charged nothing they pay every two months 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.650
 and I have not been a month since I'm 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.600
 partner and requested the exit 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.220
 immediate business , which is why 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.170
 I guess they will not give me five 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.180
 cents another thing that has me 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.369
 disappointed is also the attention that 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.229
 I just said that it was something that 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.299
 was very pleased at the beginning in 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.399
 comparison to other companies the attention 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.320
 and will of the recruiters of ultras 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.690
 but it seems that once inside the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.429
 company no longer give you little ball does not take you 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.560
 the point I made a lot of 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.420
 questions about the contract and other 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.909
 queries about the network and I do not 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.640
 they knew neither answer and directly I 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.649
 they ignored sometimes so everyone 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.210
 these facts have made me think and now 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.409
 I have decided not to waste more time 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.750
 between my discharge and the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.190
 Total linkage of the company I decided 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.409
 continue to normally go up 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.450
 videos on a new channel I really am 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.240
 very hurt because he dedicates a lot of 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.909
 long hours and days of dedication 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.800
 I work at this channel play by life that 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.229
 it has been almost one year and four months 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.490
 creation to bring such a disappointment 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.010
 great as this 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.170
 with more than 3000 subscribers over 1000 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.360
 daily visits and more than 60 like in 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.700
 average in each video it hurts me to boot 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.650
 very much everything again I do not know if in this 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.380
 new channel the cowboy play I'll be able 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.030
 get so much in so little time the 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.150
 it really hurts to start everything again 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.650
 of zero but there is no other so that 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.660
 I leave a word of advice to all those who 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.390
 they want to boot on youtube you're going to 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.920
 be in this and dedicate yourself to these 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.790
 are the risks and you always have to 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.710
 put him in and put him in and keep moving forward 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.170
 enthusiasm patience and will are the 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.940
 keys to grow the only thing I ask is 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.100
 that at least 1 in 3 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.320
 subscribers in this channel are 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.450
 subscribe then nothing more to know that 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.030
 the support is still and the good vibes 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.170
 they have with me stays now 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.580
 what I 'm going to do is upload 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.110
 those videos that I had left 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.450
 earrings that I was going to upload on this channel 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.420
 and I also wanted to tell you how they know 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.610
 start again everything is zero implies 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.690
 do everything again in terms of 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.060
 videos 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.850
 channel entity are introductions of 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.620
 the videos logos watermarks and 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.630
 background so all those 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.880
 people who sent me the funds 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.040

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.810

 the design as always is the free 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.710
 criterion the only thing I ask you to have 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.570
 is that it says the play baqueiro the name 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.220

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.280

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.770
 background and the same with the logo or the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.480
 watermark for videos this new 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.280

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.590
 had here do not worry 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.420
