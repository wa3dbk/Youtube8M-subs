00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:01.970 
trailer was great but they say that the
trailer<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.230> nothing<00:01:01.590> compared<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
trailer is nothing compared to the

about<00:01:06.299> neill<00:01:06.600> blomkamp<00:01:07.140> i<00:01:07.260> think<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.799> usually

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
about neill blomkamp i think is usually

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.520 
about neill blomkamp i think is usually
I'm<00:01:08.610> one<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.880> those<00:01:08.939> guys<00:01:09.000> don't<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.600> CG<00:01:10.049> but

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
I'm one of those guys don't like CG but

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.340 
I'm one of those guys don't like CG but
I<00:01:10.590> think<00:01:10.860> he<00:01:11.580> blends<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.330> with<00:01:12.360> real<00:01:12.930> life<00:01:13.140> well

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
I think he blends it with real life well

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.350 
I think he blends it with real life well
yeah<00:01:13.799> seamlessly<00:01:14.340> yes<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.970> would<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.180> like

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
yeah seamlessly yes it would be like

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.330 
yeah seamlessly yes it would be like
well<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:15.900> better<00:01:16.080> than<00:01:16.170> well<00:01:16.439> really<00:01:17.159> good
