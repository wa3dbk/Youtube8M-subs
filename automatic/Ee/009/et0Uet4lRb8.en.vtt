this<00:00:00.420> video<00:00:00.780> is<00:00:00.840> about<00:00:00.960> star-delta<00:00:01.560> starter

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:02.179 
this video is about star-delta starter

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.599 
this video is about star-delta starter
so<00:00:03.179> why<00:00:03.510> we<00:00:03.689> nice<00:00:03.899> turn<00:00:04.140> is<00:00:04.290> a<00:00:04.380> starter<00:00:04.859> if<00:00:05.310> we

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
so why we nice turn is a starter if we

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.700 
so why we nice turn is a starter if we
run<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:06.000> motor<00:00:06.240> directly<00:00:06.540> in<00:00:07.080> Delta<00:00:07.470> more

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
run the motor directly in Delta more

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.799 
run the motor directly in Delta more
initial<00:00:08.550> current<00:00:08.730> can<00:00:08.970> be<00:00:09.000> four<00:00:09.300> times<00:00:09.570> higher

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
initial current can be four times higher

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.839 
initial current can be four times higher
it<00:00:10.230> can<00:00:10.500> cause<00:00:10.740> very<00:00:10.950> heavy<00:00:11.219> torque<00:00:11.519> on<00:00:11.700> the

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
it can cause very heavy torque on the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.030 
it can cause very heavy torque on the
motor<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.929> need<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.200> large<00:00:13.440> contactor

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
motor and you need the large contactor

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.039 
motor and you need the large contactor
in<00:00:14.219> cable<00:00:14.549> size<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:15.059> run<00:00:15.240> directly<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:15.719> Delta

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
in cable size to run directly in Delta

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.230 
in cable size to run directly in Delta
mode<00:00:16.310> solution<00:00:17.310> will<00:00:17.460> be<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.670> done<00:00:17.970> initially

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.280 
interlocking so it will make sure that
term<00:02:11.700> only<00:02:11.940> Q<00:02:12.480> 2<00:02:12.660> or<00:02:12.870> queue

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
term only Q 2 or queue

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.890 
term only Q 2 or queue
three<00:02:13.489> either<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:14.790> them<00:02:15.030> operate<00:02:15.420> at<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.659> same

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
three either of them operate at the same

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.740 
three either of them operate at the same
time<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:16.409> not<00:02:16.650> both<00:02:16.890> at<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.340> same<00:02:17.549> time<00:02:17.819> okay

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
time but not both at the same time okay

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.949 
time but not both at the same time okay
so<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:19.799> is<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.280> simulation<00:02:21.180> on<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.510> control

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
so this is the simulation on the control

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.740 
so this is the simulation on the control
circuit<00:02:22.319> think<00:02:23.189> so<00:02:23.400> as<00:02:23.579> you<00:02:23.760> can<00:02:23.909> see<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
circuit think so as you can see the the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.530 
circuit think so as you can see the the
new<00:02:24.900> start<00:02:25.769> button<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.159> pressed<00:02:26.430> Q<00:02:26.849> 1<00:02:27.030> T<00:02:27.269> 1<00:02:27.420> and

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
new start button is pressed Q 1 T 1 and

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.720 
new start button is pressed Q 1 T 1 and
Q<00:02:27.780> 2<00:02:27.810> are<00:02:27.959> owned<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.439> motor<00:02:29.069> is<00:02:29.280> running<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.610> a

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
Q 2 are owned and motor is running in a

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.819 
Q 2 are owned and motor is running in a
star<00:02:30.000> mode<00:02:31.069> okay<00:02:32.069> after<00:02:32.280> some<00:02:32.849> time<00:02:33.500> Q<00:02:34.500> 2<00:02:34.650> is

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
star mode okay after some time Q 2 is

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.940 
star mode okay after some time Q 2 is
open<00:02:35.250> now<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.640> as<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.480> can<00:02:36.690> see<00:02:36.870> Q<00:02:37.290> 3<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.590> close

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
open now and as you can see Q 3 is close

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.069 
open now and as you can see Q 3 is close
enough<00:02:38.220> water<00:02:38.849> is<00:02:39.209> running<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:39.690> Delta

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
enough water is running in the Delta

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.319 
enough water is running in the Delta
mode
