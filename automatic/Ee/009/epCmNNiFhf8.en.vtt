00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
and let's build ourselves fennekin what

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:43.870 
and let's build ourselves fennekin what
I<00:02:42.830> wanted<00:02:43.130> to<00:02:43.190> show<00:02:43.640> you<00:02:43.730> guys<00:02:43.760> first

I wanted to show you guys first

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.180 
I wanted to show you guys first
obviously<00:02:44.569> by<00:02:44.870> not<00:02:45.230> having<00:02:45.590> him<00:02:45.739> assembled

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
obviously by not having him assembled

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.640 
obviously by not having him assembled
was<00:02:46.400> how<00:02:46.519> cool<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.000> fan<00:02:47.299> the<00:02:47.569> INX<00:02:48.319> I<00:02:48.410> was<00:02:48.530> to

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
was how cool the fan the INX I was to

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.340 
was how cool the fan the INX I was to
say<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:48.830> fennekin<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.790> INX<00:02:50.360> bricks<00:02:50.720> are<00:02:50.989> so

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
say the fennekin the INX bricks are so

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.789 
say the fennekin the INX bricks are so
they<00:02:51.980> really<00:02:52.400> start<00:02:52.850> as<00:02:53.600> like<00:02:54.049> a<00:02:54.260> 2<00:02:54.709> by<00:02:54.920> 4<00:02:54.950> brick

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
they really start as like a 2 by 4 brick

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.289 
they really start as like a 2 by 4 brick
it<00:02:57.799> looks<00:02:58.250> like<00:02:58.489> it<00:02:58.610> is<00:02:58.760> made<00:02:59.060> up<00:02:59.209> of

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
it looks like it is made up of

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.670 
it looks like it is made up of
components<00:02:59.540> because<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:00.170> are<00:03:00.260> absolutely

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
components because you are absolutely

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.890 
components because you are absolutely
correct<00:03:00.860> but<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.790> starting<00:03:02.269> point<00:03:02.299> at<00:03:02.660> least

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
correct but the starting point at least

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.420 
correct but the starting point at least
gives<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.350> very<00:03:03.739> simple<00:03:04.040> 2<00:03:04.430> by<00:03:04.459> 4<00:03:04.940> brick<00:03:06.430> the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
gives you a very simple 2 by 4 brick the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.050 
gives you a very simple 2 by 4 brick the
2<00:03:07.609> by<00:03:07.730> 4<00:03:07.970> brick<00:03:08.120> has<00:03:08.859> legs<00:03:09.859> we<00:03:10.430> just<00:03:10.640> reached

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
2 by 4 brick has legs we just reached

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.300 
2 by 4 brick has legs we just reached
underneath<00:03:11.600> here<00:03:12.019> and<00:03:12.200> surprisingly<00:03:13.130> enough

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
underneath here and surprisingly enough

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.550 
underneath here and surprisingly enough
the<00:03:13.489> one<00:03:13.700> hardest<00:03:14.269> part<00:03:14.510> I<00:03:14.660> find<00:03:14.900> is<00:03:15.200> just

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
the one hardest part I find is just

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.770 
the one hardest part I find is just
getting<00:03:15.859> the<00:03:15.890> legs<00:03:16.250> out<00:03:16.519> is<00:03:17.329> it<00:03:17.450> gonna<00:03:17.570> get

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
getting the legs out is it gonna get

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.870 
getting the legs out is it gonna get
your<00:03:17.989> finger<00:03:18.350> in<00:03:18.380> there<00:03:18.739> there<00:03:19.190> we<00:03:19.250> go<00:03:19.370> take

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
your finger in there there we go take

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.160 
your finger in there there we go take
the<00:03:20.000> first<00:03:20.209> leg<00:03:20.390> soon<00:03:20.570> as<00:03:20.630> you<00:03:20.690> get<00:03:20.780> one<00:03:20.959> leg

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
the first leg soon as you get one leg

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.970 
the first leg soon as you get one leg
out<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.500> other<00:03:21.650> everything<00:03:22.370> else<00:03:22.519> is<00:03:22.820> gravy

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
out the other everything else is gravy

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.580 
out the other everything else is gravy
delicious<00:03:24.980> gravy<00:03:26.200> also<00:03:27.200> helps<00:03:27.380> if<00:03:27.470> you<00:03:27.530> have

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
delicious gravy also helps if you have

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.860 
delicious gravy also helps if you have
fingernails<00:03:27.890> too<00:03:28.250> there<00:03:28.430> we<00:03:28.489> go

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
fingernails too there we go

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.940 
fingernails too there we go
but<00:03:29.870> once<00:03:30.140> you<00:03:30.200> get<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.410> one<00:03:30.620> leg<00:03:30.799> out

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
but once you get the one leg out

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.559 
but once you get the one leg out
everything<00:03:31.670> else<00:03:31.730> seems<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.030> be<00:03:32.090> relatively

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
everything else seems to be relatively

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.099 
everything else seems to be relatively
easy<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:32.930> you<00:03:33.019> have<00:03:33.140> your<00:03:33.260> your<00:03:33.560> legs<00:03:33.799> and<00:03:35.109> you

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
easy so you have your your legs and you

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.949 
easy so you have your your legs and you
have<00:03:36.260> other<00:03:36.500> areas<00:03:36.920> that<00:03:37.130> hinge<00:03:37.489> out<00:03:37.790> this<00:03:38.750> is

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
have other areas that hinge out this is

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.270 
have other areas that hinge out this is
essentially<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.829> basic<00:03:40.930> ionics<00:03:41.930> brick<00:03:42.319> is<00:03:42.980> what

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
essentially a basic ionics brick is what

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.970 
essentially a basic ionics brick is what
you're<00:03:43.400> seeing<00:03:43.579> right<00:03:43.730> here<00:03:44.769> what<00:03:45.769> we<00:03:45.859> are

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
you're seeing right here what we are

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.410 
you're seeing right here what we are
though<00:03:46.160> going<00:03:46.370> to<00:03:46.430> do<00:03:46.549> is<00:03:46.760> we're<00:03:47.060> gonna<00:03:47.120> keep

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
though going to do is we're gonna keep

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.930 
though going to do is we're gonna keep
these<00:03:47.660> sections<00:03:48.350> folded<00:03:48.889> down<00:03:49.069> because<00:03:49.400> we're

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
these sections folded down because we're

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.780 
these sections folded down because we're
not<00:03:50.060> going<00:03:50.239> to<00:03:50.299> use<00:03:50.540> them<00:03:50.870> for<00:03:51.170> fennekin<00:03:51.950> so

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
not going to use them for fennekin so

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.670 
not going to use them for fennekin so
you<00:03:52.850> have<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:53.989> have<00:03:54.109> the<00:03:54.230> legs<00:03:54.410> that<00:03:54.620> look

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
you have you have the legs that look

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.340 
you have you have the legs that look
like<00:03:55.069> this<00:03:55.420> then<00:03:56.420> you're<00:03:56.750> gonna<00:03:56.870> take<00:03:57.170> this

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
like this then you're gonna take this

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.410 
like this then you're gonna take this
piece<00:03:57.590> right<00:03:57.829> here<00:03:57.889> a<00:03:58.160> little<00:03:58.340> smooth<00:03:58.880> yellow

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
piece right here a little smooth yellow

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.650 
piece right here a little smooth yellow
brick<00:03:59.859> it<00:04:00.859> just<00:04:01.010> snaps<00:04:01.220> into<00:04:01.430> place<00:04:01.660> you're

connect two points on the stand
so<00:05:00.970> even<00:05:01.270> though<00:05:01.389> you<00:05:01.450> really<00:05:01.660> kind<00:05:01.900> of<00:05:01.960> just

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
so even though you really kind of just

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.580 
so even though you really kind of just
put<00:05:02.260> it<00:05:02.350> like<00:05:02.380> this<00:05:03.570> you<00:05:04.570> can<00:05:04.600> slightly

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
put it like this you can slightly

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.500 
put it like this you can slightly
sandwich<00:05:06.250> him<00:05:06.400> on<00:05:06.580> to<00:05:06.760> the<00:05:06.790> stand<00:05:07.180> but<00:05:07.389> he

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
sandwich him on to the stand but he

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.620 
sandwich him on to the stand but he
doesn't<00:05:07.870> really<00:05:08.139> stand<00:05:09.060> unless<00:05:10.060> you<00:05:10.210> kind<00:05:10.570> of

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
doesn't really stand unless you kind of

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.590 
doesn't really stand unless you kind of
folded<00:05:11.020> his<00:05:11.139> legs<00:05:11.380> if<00:05:11.650> you<00:05:11.710> folded<00:05:12.190> his<00:05:12.310> legs

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
folded his legs if you folded his legs

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.210 
folded his legs if you folded his legs
without<00:05:13.600> actually<00:05:14.350> closing<00:05:14.800> them<00:05:14.919> all<00:05:15.130> the

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
without actually closing them all the

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.650 
without actually closing them all the
way<00:05:15.340> in<00:05:15.520> but<00:05:15.729> if<00:05:15.850> you<00:05:15.880> folded<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.450> legs

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
way in but if you folded the legs

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.190 
way in but if you folded the legs
slightly<00:05:17.340> and<00:05:18.340> take<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.640> stand<00:05:18.960> try<00:05:19.960> not<00:05:20.110> to

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
slightly and take the stand try not to

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.740 
slightly and take the stand try not to
drop<00:05:20.410> it<00:05:20.590> everywhere<00:05:21.060> you<00:05:22.060> could<00:05:22.210> technically

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
drop it everywhere you could technically

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.480 
drop it everywhere you could technically
peg<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:23.289> legs<00:05:23.500> in<00:05:23.710> like<00:05:23.740> that<00:05:24.070> and<00:05:24.130> you<00:05:24.340> can

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
peg the legs in like that and you can

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.490 
peg the legs in like that and you can
have<00:05:24.669> them<00:05:24.760> kind<00:05:25.000> of<00:05:25.090> sitting<00:05:25.510> if<00:05:25.660> you<00:05:26.140> wanted

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
have them kind of sitting if you wanted

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.010 
have them kind of sitting if you wanted
to<00:05:26.650> but<00:05:27.520> I<00:05:27.789> probably<00:05:28.000> will<00:05:28.180> not<00:05:28.330> use<00:05:28.539> the<00:05:28.720> stand

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
to but I probably will not use the stand

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.580 
to but I probably will not use the stand
but<00:05:29.740> I<00:05:30.039> like<00:05:30.250> that<00:05:30.430> you<00:05:30.550> at<00:05:30.789> least<00:05:30.820> get<00:05:31.180> one

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590
