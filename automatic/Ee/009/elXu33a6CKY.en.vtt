usability<00:00:24.759> so<00:00:25.509> its<00:00:25.660> many<00:00:25.930> contradicting

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
usability so its many contradicting

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.269 
usability so its many contradicting
terms<00:00:27.910> that<00:00:28.210> has<00:00:28.329> to<00:00:28.480> come<00:00:28.630> together<00:00:28.840> and<00:00:29.320> it's

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
terms that has to come together and it's

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.249 
terms that has to come together and it's
about<00:00:30.550> proving<00:00:30.849> all<00:00:31.210> of<00:00:31.329> those<00:00:31.480> continuously

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
about proving all of those continuously

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.590 
about proving all of those continuously
and<00:00:32.500> showing<00:00:32.920> that<00:00:33.130> the<00:00:33.579> bar<00:00:33.820> is<00:00:34.000> raised<00:00:34.329> in

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
and showing that the bar is raised in

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.080 
and showing that the bar is raised in
every<00:00:34.930> area<00:00:37.350> outside<00:00:38.350> our<00:00:38.860> factory<00:00:39.640> in<00:00:39.730> Sweden

every area outside our factory in Sweden

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.370 
every area outside our factory in Sweden
we<00:00:40.120> have<00:00:40.330> a<00:00:40.360> test<00:00:40.570> track<00:00:40.780> which<00:00:40.930> used<00:00:41.110> to<00:00:41.200> be<00:00:41.350> a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380 
we have a test track which used to be a

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.710 
we have a test track which used to be a
military<00:00:41.620> runway<00:00:42.370> where<00:00:43.030> we<00:00:43.150> do<00:00:43.270> shakedown

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
military runway where we do shakedown

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.140 
military runway where we do shakedown
rounds<00:00:44.170> and<00:00:44.320> our<00:00:44.440> prototypes<00:00:44.980> and<00:00:45.280> production

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
rounds and our prototypes and production

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.630 
rounds and our prototypes and production
cars<00:00:46.360> and<00:00:46.600> so<00:00:46.750> on<00:00:46.930> and<00:00:47.170> we<00:00:47.980> just<00:00:48.010> noticed<00:00:48.520> with

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
cars and so on and we just noticed with

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.630 
cars and so on and we just noticed with
the<00:00:48.730> power<00:00:48.910> level<00:00:49.150> we<00:00:49.480> have<00:00:49.660> in<00:00:49.930> India<00:00:50.680> grr<00:00:51.100> we

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
the power level we have in India grr we

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.490 
the power level we have in India grr we
can<00:00:51.820> actually<00:00:52.120> go<00:00:52.210> all<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.600> way<00:00:52.630> up<00:00:52.810> to<00:00:52.840> 200

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
can actually go all the way up to 200

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.280 
can actually go all the way up to 200
miles<00:00:53.650> per<00:00:53.800> hour<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.250> break-in<00:00:55.120> only<00:00:55.540> 1.5

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
miles per hour and break-in only 1.5

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.740 
miles per hour and break-in only 1.5
kilometers<00:00:56.920> which<00:00:57.130> is<00:00:57.280> amazing<00:00:57.850> so<00:00:58.120> we<00:00:58.570> said

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
kilometers which is amazing so we said

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.110 
kilometers which is amazing so we said
why<00:00:58.899> don't<00:00:58.960> we<00:00:59.260> cloak<00:01:00.220> this<00:01:00.460> officially<00:01:00.940> see

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
why don't we cloak this officially see

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.330 
why don't we cloak this officially see
what<00:01:01.270> it<00:01:01.390> does<00:01:01.570> and<00:01:01.810> it<00:01:01.899> turned<00:01:02.140> out<00:01:02.260> to<00:01:02.320> be<00:01:02.649> way

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
what it does and it turned out to be way

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.760 
what it does and it turned out to be way
way<00:01:03.550> faster<00:01:03.850> than<00:01:04.360> any<00:01:04.600> other<00:01:04.839> car<00:01:05.229> on<00:01:05.439> a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
way faster than any other car on a

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.560 
way faster than any other car on a
production<00:01:06.040> car<00:01:06.399> on<00:01:06.549> earth<00:01:06.700> it's<00:01:07.420> actually

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
production car on earth it's actually

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.340 
production car on earth it's actually
five<00:01:07.960> six<00:01:08.350> second<00:01:08.799> faster<00:01:09.280> zero<00:01:09.999> to<00:01:10.149> 300<00:01:10.990> 20

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
five six second faster zero to 300 20

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.859 
five six second faster zero to 300 20
then<00:01:11.710> then<00:01:12.009> the<00:01:12.159> closest<00:01:12.549> competitor<00:01:13.149> so<00:01:13.749> it's

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
then then the closest competitor so it's

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.469 
then then the closest competitor so it's
just<00:01:14.049> massive<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:14.950> it<00:01:15.490> was<00:01:15.670> almost<00:01:15.999> like<00:01:16.299> we

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
just massive and it was almost like we

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.450 
just massive and it was almost like we
didn't<00:01:16.689> even<00:01:16.780> try<00:01:17.139> we<00:01:17.380> didn't<00:01:17.649> push<00:01:18.189> very<00:01:18.340> hard

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
didn't even try we didn't push very hard

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.399 
didn't even try we didn't push very hard
to<00:01:18.700> do<00:01:18.819> this<00:01:19.030> or<00:01:19.270> or<00:01:19.509> create<00:01:20.109> the<00:01:20.229> perfect

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
to do this or or create the perfect

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.559 
to do this or or create the perfect
launch<00:01:20.889> or<00:01:21.009> anything<00:01:21.249> it's<00:01:21.369> just<00:01:21.429> a<00:01:21.819> natural

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569 
launch or anything it's just a natural

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:40.090 
launch or anything it's just a natural
thing<00:01:22.600> for<00:01:22.810> our<00:01:23.049> car<00:01:23.409> to<00:01:23.560> do

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.669 

it<00:01:41.100> was<00:01:41.249> a<00:01:41.280> nice<00:01:41.579> way<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.840> show<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.319> lot<00:01:43.560> of

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
it was a nice way to show a lot of

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.559 
it was a nice way to show a lot of
different<00:01:44.069> aspects<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.819> a<00:01:44.999> very<00:01:45.179> short<00:01:45.270> period

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
different aspects in a very short period

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.740 
different aspects in a very short period
of<00:01:45.899> time<00:01:46.049> because<00:01:46.859> actually<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.549> 0<00:01:47.819> to<00:01:48.090> 300<00:01:48.630> is

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
of time because actually the 0 to 300 is

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.679 
of time because actually the 0 to 300 is
irregular<00:01:49.140> there's<00:01:49.920> 300<00:01:50.490> 20<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.179> record<00:01:51.359> and

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
irregular there's 300 20 is a record and

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.440 
irregular there's 300 20 is a record and
together<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.469> irregular<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.789> a<00:01:54.209> time

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
together it's irregular so in a time

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.069 
together it's irregular so in a time
span<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.810> under<00:01:55.200> 22<00:01:55.619> seconds<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.640> actually

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
span of under 22 seconds it's actually

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.819 
span of under 22 seconds it's actually
well<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.349> records<00:01:59.659> in<00:02:00.659> one<00:02:00.899> go<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.560> shows

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
well to records in one go and it shows

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.889 
well to records in one go and it shows
how<00:02:02.459> stable<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.240> car<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.539> that<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.750> can

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
how stable the car is that you can

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.830 
how stable the car is that you can
actually<00:02:04.520> first<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.700> all<00:02:05.759> force<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.270> up<00:02:06.390> with

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
actually first of all force it up with

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.020 
actually first of all force it up with
extreme<00:02:07.259> energy<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.770> 300<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.429> then<00:02:08.580> directly

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
extreme energy to 300 and then directly

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.869 
extreme energy to 300 and then directly
bring<00:02:09.299> it<00:02:09.420> down<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:10.259> zero<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:11.039> not<00:02:11.280> extreme

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
bring it down to zero is not extreme

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.640 
bring it down to zero is not extreme
when<00:02:12.150> you're<00:02:12.269> doing<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:13.170> can<00:02:13.319> handle

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
when you're doing it is you can handle

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.949 
when you're doing it is you can handle
the<00:02:13.769> car<00:02:13.980> very<00:02:14.010> well<00:02:14.459> then<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:15.329> made<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.629> do

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
the car very well then it's made to do

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.950 
the car very well then it's made to do

there is no way of achieving these

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.090 
there is no way of achieving these
results<00:02:26.270> because<00:02:27.020> first<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.680> all<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:27.890> have<00:02:27.980> to

results because first of all you have to

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.950 
results because first of all you have to
put<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.310> power<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.000> ground<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.780> only

contact from the car to the ground is

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.250 
contact from the car to the ground is
via<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.020> tire<00:02:33.350> so<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.070> has<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.250> do<00:02:34.520> its<00:02:34.700> job<00:02:34.910> and

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
via the tire so it has to do its job and

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
than anything else you can't get this

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.690 
than anything else you can't get this
result<00:02:40.730> either<00:02:41.390> in<00:02:41.810> in<00:02:42.110> cornering

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
result either in in cornering

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.470 
result either in in cornering
acceleration<00:02:43.700> or<00:02:43.910> braking<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.950> tire<00:02:46.160> is<00:02:46.370> a

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
acceleration or braking so the tire is a

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.600 
acceleration or braking so the tire is a
vital<00:02:47.480> part<00:02:47.720> of<00:02:47.900> these<00:02:48.080> records<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:49.160> crucial

vital part of these records the crucial

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.580 
vital part of these records the crucial
part<00:02:49.850> we<00:02:50.480> have<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.630> very<00:02:50.870> good<00:02:51.050> collaboration

with<00:02:51.830> Michelin<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:52.610> of<00:02:52.940> course<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.390> goes

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
with Michelin so of course it goes

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.870 
with Michelin so of course it goes
together<00:02:53.780> with<00:02:54.290> with<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.250> well-functioning

we're interested in our directors like

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.950 
we're interested in our directors like
top<00:03:08.200> speed<00:03:08.440> records<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:08.980> lap<00:03:09.160> records<00:03:09.960> and

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
top speed records and lap records and

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.390 
top speed records and lap records and
maybe<00:03:11.170> some<00:03:11.440> endurance<00:03:11.890> records<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.370> show

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
maybe some endurance records to show

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.490 
maybe some endurance records to show
that<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:13.000> total<00:03:13.360> aspect<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.020> performance

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
that the total aspect of the performance

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.950 
that the total aspect of the performance
of<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.680> car<00:03:14.890> we're<00:03:15.730> looking<00:03:16.000> at<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.330> nuvaring

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
of the car we're looking at the nuvaring

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.900 
of the car we're looking at the nuvaring
we're<00:03:17.200> looking<00:03:17.410> at<00:03:17.530> top<00:03:17.710> speed<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.400> and

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
we're looking at top speed and and

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.330 
we're looking at top speed and and
things<00:03:19.630> like<00:03:19.780> that<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.320> we<00:03:20.680> believe<00:03:21.040> that<00:03:21.070> our

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
things like that and we believe that our

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.900 
things like that and we believe that our
car<00:03:21.760> has<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.360> specification<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:24.010> be<00:03:24.460> the<00:03:24.670> top

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
car has to specification to be the top

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.420 
car has to specification to be the top
in<00:03:25.120> all<00:03:25.360> of<00:03:25.540> these<00:03:25.660> areas<00:03:25.930> so<00:03:26.530> we're

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
in all of these areas so we're

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.399 
in all of these areas so we're
we're<00:03:28.090> very<00:03:28.269> hungry<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.840> go<00:03:28.959> out<00:03:29.049> and<00:03:29.260> prove

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:29.409 
we're very hungry to go out and prove

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.469 
we're very hungry to go out and prove
that
