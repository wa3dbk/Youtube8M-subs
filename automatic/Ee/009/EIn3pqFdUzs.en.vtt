some pop-tarts

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.270 
some pop-tarts
they're<00:01:36.380> not<00:01:36.500> always<00:01:36.680> as<00:01:36.860> healthy<00:01:37.190> as<00:01:37.250> you

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
guys think that they are so let's take a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.420 
guys think that they are so let's take a
look<00:01:39.170> at<00:01:39.230> the<00:01:39.380> pop<00:01:39.590> tarts<00:01:39.830> either<00:01:40.190> great

look at the pop tarts either great

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.970 
look at the pop tarts either great
example<00:01:40.910> is<00:01:40.940> something<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:41.390> people<00:01:41.450> often

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
example is something that people often

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.720 
example is something that people often
warm<00:01:42.980> up<00:01:43.100> quickly<00:01:43.250> for<00:01:43.820> their<00:01:43.940> kids<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:44.540> p.m.

warm up quickly for their kids and p.m.
now<00:01:46.730> when<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.060> think<00:01:47.240> of<00:01:47.270> serving<00:01:47.690> size<00:01:47.900> here

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
now when you think of serving size here

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.290 
now when you think of serving size here
this<00:01:48.290> is<00:01:48.410> one<00:01:48.740> about<00:01:49.190> Dartmouth<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.210> you

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
this is one about Dartmouth to that you

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.880 
this is one about Dartmouth to that you
should<00:01:50.450> have<00:01:50.480> a<00:01:50.600> package<00:01:50.930> actually<00:01:51.620> just<00:01:51.770> one

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
should have a package actually just one

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.880 
should have a package actually just one
and<00:01:52.460> if<00:01:52.940> you<00:01:53.060> look<00:01:53.270> here<00:01:53.600> it<00:01:53.870> does<00:01:54.050> have<00:01:54.320> 11

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
and if you look here it does have 11

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.310 
and if you look here it does have 11
grams<00:01:55.070> of<00:01:55.250> sugars<00:01:55.610> in<00:01:55.790> it<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.750> most<00:01:56.960> of<00:01:57.050> you

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
grams of sugars in it so most of you

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.810 
grams of sugars in it so most of you
know<00:01:57.350> most<00:01:57.620> you<00:01:57.710> are<00:01:57.830> me<00:01:57.950> two<00:01:58.190> of<00:01:58.310> these<00:01:58.400> sort

of<00:01:58.850> 22<00:01:59.240> grams<00:01:59.480> of<00:01:59.660> sugar<00:01:59.870> and<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:00.560> start

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
of 22 grams of sugar and you start

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.800 
of 22 grams of sugar and you start
reading<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.310> labels<00:02:01.790> what<00:02:02.360> you<00:02:02.480> guys<00:02:02.600> are

what<00:02:51.340> we're<00:02:51.460> looking<00:02:51.580> at<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:52.060> one<00:02:52.240> of<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.390> main

what we're looking at is one of the main

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.540 
what we're looking at is one of the main
ingredient<00:02:52.720> is<00:02:53.230> actually<00:02:53.560> sugar<00:02:53.830> high

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
ingredient is actually sugar high

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.690 
ingredient is actually sugar high
maltose<00:02:54.790> corn<00:02:55.060> syrup<00:02:56.250> more<00:02:57.250> sugar<00:02:59.700> we're

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
maltose corn syrup more sugar we're

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.860 
maltose corn syrup more sugar we're
gonna<00:03:00.790> let<00:03:00.940> them<00:03:01.030> go<00:03:01.180> through<00:03:01.210> you<00:03:01.450> guys<00:03:01.600> so<00:03:01.810> I

again<00:04:39.070> that's<00:04:39.250> not<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.580> as<00:04:39.790> bad<00:04:40.240> as<00:04:40.390> that

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
again that's not the as bad as that

again that's not the as bad as that
Snickers<00:04:40.870> bar<00:04:41.110> was<00:04:41.290> but<00:04:41.590> again<00:04:41.830> every<00:04:42.070> little

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
Snickers bar was but again every little

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.860 
Snickers bar was but again every little
bit<00:04:42.430> adds<00:04:42.610> up<00:04:42.850> now<00:04:43.390> the<00:04:43.450> main<00:04:43.630> thing<00:04:43.780> you<00:04:43.810> want

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
bit adds up now the main thing you want

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.320 
bit adds up now the main thing you want
to<00:04:43.990> look<00:04:44.050> for<00:04:44.200> here<00:04:44.650> is<00:04:44.890> that<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.330> second

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
to look for here is that the second

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.390 
to look for here is that the second
ingredient<00:04:46.810> on<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:46.960> list<00:04:47.140> is<00:04:47.380> sugar<00:04:47.650> so<00:04:48.220> this

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
ingredient on the list is sugar so this

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.040 
ingredient on the list is sugar so this
you<00:04:48.850> would<00:04:48.970> think<00:04:49.000> would<00:04:49.480> be<00:04:49.600> some<00:04:49.810> kind<00:04:49.990> of

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
you would think would be some kind of

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.380 
you would think would be some kind of
oil<00:04:50.230> or<00:04:50.620> maybe<00:04:50.920> some<00:04:51.190> raspberries<00:04:51.760> no<00:04:52.240> the

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
oil or maybe some raspberries no the

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.150 
oil or maybe some raspberries no the
first<00:04:52.570> ingredients<00:04:53.080> water<00:04:53.290> the<00:04:53.770> second

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
first ingredients water the second

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.690 
first ingredients water the second
ingredient<00:04:54.550> is<00:04:54.670> sugar<00:04:54.700> so<00:04:56.280> yeah<00:04:57.280> just<00:04:57.490> looking

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
ingredient is sugar so yeah just looking

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.700 
ingredient is sugar so yeah just looking
at<00:04:57.790> the<00:04:57.910> label<00:04:58.240> too<00:04:58.480> concentrated<00:04:58.720> juice<00:04:59.440> in

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
at the label too concentrated juice in

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.340 
at the label too concentrated juice in
there<00:05:00.240> but<00:05:01.240> yeah<00:05:01.390> that's<00:05:01.600> the<00:05:01.750> thing<00:05:01.960> the

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
there but yeah that's the thing the

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.750 
there but yeah that's the thing the
second<00:05:02.650> greedy<00:05:02.830> under<00:05:03.100> sugar<00:05:03.370> so<00:05:03.490> you're<00:05:03.700> not

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
second greedy under sugar so you're not

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.640 
second greedy under sugar so you're not
getting<00:05:04.210> exactly<00:05:04.540> what<00:05:04.660> you<00:05:04.810> thinking<00:05:05.260> we<00:05:05.500> are

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
getting exactly what you thinking we are

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.200 
getting exactly what you thinking we are
getting<00:05:05.860> so<00:05:06.100> look<00:05:06.310> for<00:05:06.520> salad<00:05:06.850> dressing<00:05:07.180> that

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
getting so look for salad dressing that

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.270 
getting so look for salad dressing that
again<00:05:07.510> is<00:05:07.660> going<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:07.900> be<00:05:08.020> oil<00:05:08.620> based<00:05:08.950> as<00:05:09.160> the

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
again is going to be oil based as the

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.100 
again is going to be oil based as the
first<00:05:09.550> ingredient<00:05:09.760> and<00:05:10.270> yeah<00:05:10.780> there<00:05:10.960> might<00:05:11.050> be

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
first ingredient and yeah there might be

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.360 
first ingredient and yeah there might be
some<00:05:11.350> sugar<00:05:11.590> in<00:05:11.740> it<00:05:11.830> but<00:05:11.950> look<00:05:12.100> for<00:05:12.250> it<00:05:12.340> later

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
some sugar in it but look for it later

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.250 
some sugar in it but look for it later
