00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
you get rid of those creatures and you

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.530 
you get rid of those creatures and you
draw<00:00:49.070> up<00:00:49.100> a<00:00:49.220> lava<00:00:49.399> golem<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:49.940> it<00:00:50.270> pretty<00:00:50.450> much

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
draw up a lava golem and it pretty much

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.389 
draw up a lava golem and it pretty much
takes<00:00:50.780> away<00:00:50.989> that<00:00:51.020> Icarus<00:00:51.290> being<00:00:51.680> viable<00:00:52.010> and

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
takes away that Icarus being viable and

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.220 
takes away that Icarus being viable and
from<00:00:52.850> there<00:00:53.000> you<00:00:53.030> can<00:00:53.180> set<00:00:53.450> freely<00:00:53.899> and<00:00:54.079> then

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
from there you can set freely and then

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.330 
from there you can set freely and then
wait<00:00:54.380> to<00:00:54.469> your<00:00:54.559> opponent's<00:00:54.920> turn<00:00:54.980> to<00:00:55.100> change

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
everything again so it's a really good

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.740 
everything again so it's a really good
card<00:00:59.379> 30<00:01:00.379> gardna's<00:01:00.860> zero<00:01:01.700> gardna<00:01:01.940> is<00:01:02.239> another

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
card 30 gardna's zero gardna is another

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.840 
card 30 gardna's zero gardna is another
monster<00:01:03.500> that<00:01:03.770> pretty<00:01:04.040> much<00:01:04.189> shuts<00:01:04.460> down<00:01:04.610> the

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
monster that pretty much shuts down the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.609 
monster that pretty much shuts down the
battle<00:01:05.119> phase<00:01:05.299> for<00:01:05.479> your<00:01:05.600> opponent<00:01:05.749> or<00:01:06.020> you

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119

can sacrifice this card during either
player's<00:01:08.479> turn<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.609> during<00:01:10.609> that<00:01:10.639> turn

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:10.999 
player's turn and during that turn

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:13.330 
player's turn and during that turn
monsters<00:01:11.329> are<00:01:11.600> not<00:01:11.749> destroyed<00:01:12.109> in<00:01:12.229> battle<00:01:12.409> nor

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
monsters are not destroyed in battle nor

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.580 
monsters are not destroyed in battle nor
do<00:01:13.789> you<00:01:14.030> take<00:01:14.479> any<00:01:14.719> battle<00:01:15.079> damage<00:01:15.109> from<00:01:15.530> the

do you take any battle damage from the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.069 
do you take any battle damage from the
battle<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.399> that<00:01:16.639> pretty<00:01:16.909> much<00:01:17.029> helps<00:01:17.569> protect

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
battle so that pretty much helps protect

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:19.809 
battle so that pretty much helps protect
your<00:01:18.409> life<00:01:18.560> points<00:01:18.619> and<00:01:19.130> any<00:01:19.249> damage<00:01:19.549> from<00:01:19.579> any

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:19.819 
your life points and any damage from any

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:20.859 
your life points and any damage from any
of<00:01:19.909> your<00:01:20.029> creatures<00:01:20.209> that<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:20.539> might<00:01:20.689> have<00:01:20.840> on

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
of your creatures that you might have on

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.899 
of your creatures that you might have on
the<00:01:20.990> board<00:01:21.229> and<00:01:21.380> buys<00:01:21.979> you<00:01:22.130> an<00:01:22.189> extra<00:01:22.459> turn<00:01:22.670> and

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
the board and buys you an extra turn and

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.010 
the board and buys you an extra turn and
that<00:01:22.999> really<00:01:23.240> helps<00:01:23.569> especially<00:01:23.659> if<00:01:23.929> your

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
that really helps especially if your

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.719 
that really helps especially if your
opponent<00:01:24.170> will<00:01:24.409> play<00:01:24.560> book<00:01:24.859> or<00:01:25.130> brain<00:01:25.369> control

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
opponent will play book or brain control

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.580 
opponent will play book or brain control
you<00:01:26.270> just<00:01:26.299> sacrifice<00:01:26.899> the<00:01:27.049> creature<00:01:27.259> for<00:01:27.560> the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
you just sacrifice the creature for the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.919 
you just sacrifice the creature for the
turn<00:01:27.799> the<00:01:28.009> effect<00:01:28.369> will<00:01:28.459> be<00:01:28.520> inactive<00:01:29.090> so<00:01:29.779> they

chain what it's ruled is is that the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.030

now what a lot of people don't know
about<00:03:57.260> scrub<00:03:57.859> rate<00:03:58.100> is<00:03:58.280> that<00:03:58.459> it's<00:03:58.640> actually

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
about scrub rate is that it's actually

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.150 
about scrub rate is that it's actually
one<00:03:59.060> of<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.180> few<00:03:59.450> cards<00:03:59.959> where<00:04:00.380> you<00:04:00.650> can<00:04:00.829> chain

graveyard and it ends the battle phase
and<00:04:11.389> I<00:04:11.450> still<00:04:11.690> draw<00:04:11.900> a<00:04:11.959> card<00:04:12.200> because<00:04:12.739> it's

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
and I still draw a card because it's

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.029 
and I still draw a card because it's
ruled<00:04:13.670> that<00:04:13.850> square<00:04:14.600> grade<00:04:14.750> will<00:04:14.959> still<00:04:15.260> allow

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
ruled that square grade will still allow

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.580 
ruled that square grade will still allow
other<00:04:16.430> cards<00:04:16.760> to<00:04:16.910> trigger<00:04:17.289> within<00:04:18.289> the<00:04:18.409> same

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
other cards to trigger within the same

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.500 
other cards to trigger within the same
window<00:04:18.890> as<00:04:18.919> best<00:04:19.310> they<00:04:19.430> can<00:04:19.549> since<00:04:20.030> legacy<00:04:20.419> is

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
window as best they can since legacy is

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.330 
window as best they can since legacy is
the<00:04:20.599> oddest<00:04:20.720> as<00:04:20.930> I<00:04:21.019> drew

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
the oddest as I drew

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.830 
the oddest as I drew
card<00:04:21.489> even<00:04:21.699> though<00:04:21.940> I've<00:04:22.180> sent<00:04:22.480> it<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.750> the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
card even though I've sent it to the

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.510 
card even though I've sent it to the
graveyard<00:04:23.199> and<00:04:23.320> in<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.980> battle<00:04:24.220> phase<00:04:24.340> you

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
graveyard and in the battle phase you

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.250 
graveyard and in the battle phase you
think<00:04:24.760> the<00:04:24.850> timing<00:04:25.180> would<00:04:25.270> be<00:04:25.449> missed<00:04:25.690> but<00:04:26.199> it

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
think the timing would be missed but it

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.990 
think the timing would be missed but it
still<00:04:26.350> allows<00:04:26.740> us<00:04:26.889> to<00:04:26.980> go<00:04:27.100> through<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:27.639> that's

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
still allows us to go through and that's

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.460 
still allows us to go through and that's
why<00:04:28.120> scrub<00:04:28.389> rate<00:04:28.540> is<00:04:28.600> amazing<00:04:29.050> because<00:04:29.230> it

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
why scrub rate is amazing because it

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.500

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
to stay on the board so the more cards

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.360 
to stay on the board so the more cards
the<00:04:52.840> better<00:04:53.020> because<00:04:53.530> you<00:04:53.620> can<00:04:53.650> do<00:04:53.830> 200<00:04:54.190> times

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370

the better because you can do 200 times
the<00:04:54.520> amount<00:04:54.580> and<00:04:54.850> it<00:04:55.030> helps<00:04:55.240> further<00:04:55.419> burn

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
the amount and it helps further burn

the amount and it helps further burn
your<00:04:55.900> part<00:04:56.200> for<00:04:56.350> most<00:04:56.470> of<00:04:56.680> their<00:04:56.830> their<00:04:57.430> life

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
just desserts some people prefer 3 but I

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.830 
just desserts some people prefer 3 but I
think<00:05:03.340> two<00:05:03.550> is<00:05:03.580> enough<00:05:04.000> because<00:05:04.450> in<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:04.630> fact

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
think two is enough because in the fact

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.210 
think two is enough because in the fact
that<00:05:04.960> your<00:05:05.410> opponent<00:05:05.590> always<00:05:05.919> does<00:05:06.040> have

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
that your opponent always does have

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.100 
that your opponent always does have
monsters<00:05:06.669> especially<00:05:06.850> now<00:05:07.510> with<00:05:07.570> every<00:05:07.990> one

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
monsters especially now with every one

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.020 
monsters especially now with every one
synchro<00:05:08.440> summoning<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:09.130> doesn't<00:05:09.790> really<00:05:09.910> do

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
synchro summoning it doesn't really do

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.300 
synchro summoning it doesn't really do
as<00:05:10.150> much<00:05:10.300> as<00:05:10.419> it<00:05:10.540> used<00:05:10.570> to<00:05:10.780> do<00:05:10.930> so<00:05:11.740> especially

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
as much as it used to do so especially

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.010 
as much as it used to do so especially
since<00:05:12.789> Oh<00:05:12.910> John<00:05:13.120> materials<00:05:13.479> at<00:05:13.600> one<00:05:13.810> it

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
since Oh John materials at one it

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.690 
since Oh John materials at one it
doesn't<00:05:14.139> exactly<00:05:14.440> allow<00:05:14.889> more<00:05:15.220> burn<00:05:15.520> to

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
doesn't exactly allow more burn to

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.670 
doesn't exactly allow more burn to
happen<00:05:16.030> but<00:05:16.360> it's<00:05:17.050> still<00:05:17.289> good<00:05:17.470> in<00:05:17.560> my<00:05:17.650> opinion

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
happen but it's still good in my opinion

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.840 
happen but it's still good in my opinion
just<00:05:18.100> at<00:05:18.190> least<00:05:18.310> have<00:05:18.520> to<00:05:20.850> two-dimensional

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
just at least have to two-dimensional

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.990 
just at least have to two-dimensional
walls<00:05:22.590> pretty<00:05:23.590> much<00:05:23.860> if<00:05:24.190> your<00:05:24.639> opponent's

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
walls pretty much if your opponent's

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.610 
walls pretty much if your opponent's

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
going to attack you directly this is a

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.800 
going to attack you directly this is a
full-blown<00:05:27.250> hit<00:05:27.639> for<00:05:28.000> them<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:28.389> it's<00:05:28.750> like

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
full-blown hit for them and it's like

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.450 
full-blown hit for them and it's like
another<00:05:29.110> magic<00:05:29.530> cylinder<00:05:29.710> for<00:05:29.979> the<00:05:30.039> deck<00:05:30.220> I

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
another magic cylinder for the deck I

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.279 
another magic cylinder for the deck I
actually<00:05:30.910> don't<00:05:31.150> run<00:05:31.419> magic<00:05:31.750> cylinder<00:05:31.930> only

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
actually don't run magic cylinder only

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:33.659 
actually don't run magic cylinder only
in<00:05:32.350> the<00:05:32.440> fact<00:05:32.620> that<00:05:32.680> it<00:05:32.830> targets<00:05:33.070> and<00:05:33.430> just<00:05:33.580> in

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
in the fact that it targets and just in

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.490 
in the fact that it targets and just in

two<00:05:37.690> dimensional<00:05:38.080> walls<00:05:38.260> better<00:05:38.560> and<00:05:38.800> it's

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
two dimensional walls better and it's

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.500 
two dimensional walls better and it's
actually<00:05:39.580> been<00:05:39.669> more<00:05:39.849> successful<00:05:40.030> too

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
why this car is at one and manipulates

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.339 
why this car is at one and manipulates
too<00:06:00.789> much<00:06:01.000> even<00:06:01.510> though<00:06:01.599> there<00:06:01.780> is<00:06:01.900> their

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:02.349 
too much even though there is their

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:05.219 
too much even though there is their
level<00:06:02.770> two<00:06:02.889> tokens<00:06:03.330> it<00:06:04.330> doesn't<00:06:04.840> exactly<00:06:04.990> do

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
level two tokens it doesn't exactly do

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:06.629 
level two tokens it doesn't exactly do
as<00:06:05.320> much<00:06:05.470> as<00:06:05.620> it<00:06:05.710> used<00:06:05.740> to<00:06:06.070> because<00:06:06.430> of<00:06:06.550> the

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
as much as it used to because of the

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:10.140 
as much as it used to because of the
tuner<00:06:07.330> engine<00:06:07.630> now<00:06:07.950> but<00:06:08.950> if<00:06:09.430> the<00:06:09.760> card<00:06:10.000> ever

went<00:06:10.360> back<00:06:10.479> two<00:06:10.599> three<00:06:10.750> or<00:06:10.930> even<00:06:10.960> two<00:06:11.349> would

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
went back two three or even two would

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.350 
went back two three or even two would
really<00:06:11.950> help<00:06:12.070> bring<00:06:12.729> this<00:06:12.820> deck<00:06:13.030> to<00:06:13.120> even

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
really help bring this deck to even

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.520 
really help bring this deck to even
further<00:06:13.539> popularity<00:06:14.789> one<00:06:15.789> chain<00:06:16.530> detonation

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
further popularity one chain detonation

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.140 
further popularity one chain detonation
what<00:06:18.280> this<00:06:18.430> does<00:06:18.639> is<00:06:18.789> if<00:06:18.880> you<00:06:19.000> actually

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
what this does is if you actually

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.839 
what this does is if you actually
activate<00:06:19.900> it<00:06:20.020> on<00:06:20.139> a<00:06:20.169> chain<00:06:20.440> link<00:06:20.650> two<00:06:21.490> or<00:06:21.669> more

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:21.849 
activate it on a chain link two or more

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:24.900 
activate it on a chain link two or more
to<00:06:22.240> two<00:06:22.539> or<00:06:22.660> four<00:06:22.870> you<00:06:23.800> get<00:06:23.979> to<00:06:24.130> return<00:06:24.700> it<00:06:24.789> back

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
to two or four you get to return it back

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.640 
to two or four you get to return it back
to<00:06:24.970> your<00:06:25.120> deck<00:06:25.300> but<00:06:25.630> if<00:06:25.780> it's<00:06:25.930> four<00:06:26.200> or<00:06:26.349> higher

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
to your deck but if it's four or higher

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.620 
to your deck but if it's four or higher
you<00:06:27.400> get<00:06:27.550> to<00:06:27.669> add<00:06:27.820> the<00:06:28.000> card<00:06:28.210> back<00:06:28.360> to<00:06:28.510> your

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
you get to add the card back to your

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.500 
you get to add the card back to your
hand<00:06:28.810> and<00:06:28.960> you

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
hand and you

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.140 
hand and you
do<00:06:29.630> in<00:06:29.750> 500<00:06:30.410> for<00:06:30.530> either<00:06:30.650> effect<00:06:31.100> so<00:06:31.790> it<00:06:31.970> really

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
do in 500 for either effect so it really

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.580 
do in 500 for either effect so it really
helps<00:06:32.450> to<00:06:32.540> say<00:06:32.720> if<00:06:32.840> you<00:06:32.960> have<00:06:33.110> three<00:06:33.350> cards

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
helps to say if you have three cards

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.910 
helps to say if you have three cards
facedown<00:06:34.270> let<00:06:35.270> alone<00:06:35.420> four<00:06:35.780> and<00:06:36.020> you<00:06:36.650> chained

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920 
facedown let alone four and you chained

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.380 
facedown let alone four and you chained
all<00:06:37.070> of<00:06:37.190> them<00:06:37.310> and<00:06:37.460> on<00:06:37.550> the<00:06:37.730> fourth<00:06:37.970> chain<00:06:38.210> you

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390 
all of them and on the fourth chain you

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.940 
all of them and on the fourth chain you
chained<00:06:38.600> this<00:06:38.840> your<00:06:39.050> deal<00:06:39.200> 500<00:06:39.770> and<00:06:39.920> the

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950 
chained this your deal 500 and the

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.650 
chained this your deal 500 and the
credible<00:06:40.340> back<00:06:40.520> into<00:06:40.730> your<00:06:40.850> hand<00:06:41.030> and<00:06:41.210> it's

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660 
credible back into your hand and it's

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.820 
credible back into your hand and it's
actually<00:06:41.780> the<00:06:42.200> reason<00:06:42.320> why<00:06:42.530> chain

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
actually the reason why chain

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.230 
actually the reason why chain
detonations<00:06:43.280> in<00:06:43.370> here<00:06:43.550> just<00:06:43.760> to<00:06:43.850> help<00:06:43.970> further

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 
detonations in here just to help further

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.030 
detonations in here just to help further
increase<00:06:45.170> a<00:06:45.200> little<00:06:45.380> bit<00:06:45.590> damaged<00:06:45.950> and

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.040 
increase a little bit damaged and

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.610 
increase a little bit damaged and
activate<00:06:46.370> the<00:06:46.460> chain<00:06:46.640> even<00:06:46.910> more<00:06:47.120> and<00:06:47.620> then

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620 
activate the chain even more and then

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.410 
activate the chain even more and then
the<00:06:48.680> last<00:06:48.800> card<00:06:49.130> copy<00:06:49.310> is<00:06:49.580> ceasefire<00:06:50.060> this

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:50.420 
the last card copy is ceasefire this

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.510 
the last card copy is ceasefire this
basically<00:06:50.780> replaced<00:06:51.260> my<00:06:51.560> third<00:06:51.860> copy<00:06:52.100> of<00:06:52.310> Just

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
basically replaced my third copy of Just

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.700 
basically replaced my third copy of Just
Desserts<00:06:52.610> because<00:06:53.300> there's<00:06:54.140> a<00:06:54.200> lot<00:06:54.350> of<00:06:54.380> effect

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
Desserts because there's a lot of effect

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.930 
Desserts because there's a lot of effect
monsters<00:06:55.040> floating<00:06:55.340> around<00:06:55.430> the<00:06:55.580> game<00:06:55.760> now

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
monsters floating around the game now

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.610 
monsters floating around the game now
and<00:06:56.210> the<00:06:56.360> fact<00:06:56.510> is<00:06:56.690> this<00:06:56.810> can<00:06:57.020> be<00:06:57.110> changed<00:06:57.470> both

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
and the fact is this can be changed both

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.170 
and the fact is this can be changed both
both<00:06:57.950> players<00:06:58.250> sides<00:06:58.520> of<00:06:58.640> the<00:06:58.700> board<00:06:58.910> so<00:06:59.150> it

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180 
both players sides of the board so it

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.330 
both players sides of the board so it
can<00:06:59.390> add<00:06:59.510> up<00:06:59.540> more<00:06:59.930> so<00:07:00.800> that's<00:07:01.010> why<00:07:01.130> i<00:07:01.160> feel

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
can add up more so that's why i feel

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.440 
can add up more so that's why i feel
that<00:07:01.370> ceasefire<00:07:01.670> is<00:07:01.970> actually<00:07:02.240> one<00:07:02.330> of<00:07:02.360> the

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:02.450 
that ceasefire is actually one of the

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.240 
that ceasefire is actually one of the
few<00:07:02.630> cards<00:07:03.200> that<00:07:03.350> should<00:07:03.530> be<00:07:03.680> in<00:07:03.890> the<00:07:04.070> deck

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.250 
few cards that should be in the deck

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.650 
few cards that should be in the deck
because<00:07:04.610> it<00:07:04.730> actually<00:07:04.880> can<00:07:05.180> do<00:07:05.420> a<00:07:05.450> lot<00:07:05.630> more

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660 
because it actually can do a lot more

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.450 
because it actually can do a lot more
damage<00:07:05.930> it<00:07:06.140> even<00:07:06.380> just<00:07:06.560> just<00:07:06.740> just<00:07:07.100> deserts

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460
