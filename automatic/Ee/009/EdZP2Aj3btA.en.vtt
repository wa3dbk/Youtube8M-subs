00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.029
 how to make a constant day machine 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.840
 here as you can see this one block 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.400
 new from the minecraft 1.5 this this 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.259
 is going to come out right now I do not know when I do not 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.700
 ask when I do not know these 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.550
 new minecraft snapshots came out 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.680
 this this block that is here is a 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.080
 intel there sensors is basically a 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.180
 daylight sensor but what does 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.070
 here is an emits a resonance signal 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.650
 in bright enough to 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.390
 do it force the signal would result 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.710
 for the time of day for example if the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.050
 Sun 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.410
 the sensor emits 15 what at noon 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.600
 but approximately 5 what is to the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.879
 late this we are using for this 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.730
 mechanism that this one how can 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.550
 see right now it's broadcasting I think that 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.700
 10 blocks or more then when this 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.949
 go down from 10 blocks down this one 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.780
 will stop learning is to learn 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.539
 this rest and this is here this a 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.879
 command this is to take out what is going to have 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.320
 what to do this you're going to have to do 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.750
 this command is to search all the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.550
 commands that I put to put that you're going to 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.710
 have to do that gif command 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.390
 man and this is the number of blocks and 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.950
 This what it does is it makes 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.260
 commands that you want for example me 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.350
 here I have this command the command of 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.050
 time 6000 precisely when this 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.480
 block of when this region is garments 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.480
 so much 8 it's going to make this command 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.670
 it is done and it is torch is to learn 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.520
 When is daylight sensor this sensor 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.550
 of the day of the utility lower the signal and 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.930
 do not turn on this block that is going to be 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.150
 this torch is lit and then both 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.580
 right chapel ok let's make a 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.600
 example here let's put is times &amp; 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.960
 night 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.939
 ok and as you can see here and quick it 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.330
 learn because this was learned fast - 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.430
 for example I put it at night this for 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.380
 give this power to this this was learned 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.040
 torch and fast this command will 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.500
 executed as you can see here 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.720
 and that's all there are a lot of things that 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.010
 you can do with this because it makes that 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.680
 not only serves for the worlds 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.050
 creative that I know what there is in a world 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.390
 creative that you do not like the night in that 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.000
 world and then to do this little thing for 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.830
 that it's always daytime I'm going to 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.050
 have the videos so see this 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.860
 command over there is this little machine 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.020
 that is here for nothing 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.190
 and this one I ask for lack of success if you 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.500
 like all videos please 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.500
 subscribed this goodbye
