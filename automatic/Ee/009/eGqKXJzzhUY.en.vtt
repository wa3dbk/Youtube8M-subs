at my first game

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.650 
at my first game

though I have used them before always

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.130 
though I have used them before always
good<00:03:36.080> fun<00:03:36.290> I<00:03:36.910> guess<00:03:37.910> it's<00:03:38.090> not<00:03:38.300> too<00:03:38.360> late<00:03:38.989> to

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
aggressively and that would probably get

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.540 
aggressively and that would probably get
me<00:03:41.690> killed<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:42.140> then<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.070> two<00:03:43.190> things<00:03:43.400> kind
