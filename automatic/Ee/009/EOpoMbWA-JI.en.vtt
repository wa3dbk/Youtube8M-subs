 [Music] 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.650
 I android today I will teach how 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.970
 clean the samsung galaxy s 5 abel 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.439
 load that this tutorial is going to 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.900
 work for different versions 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.820
 of this device whether you have the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.890
 8-core version with 4 cores 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.839
 among others to make this 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.419
 procedure I based on a page of 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.400
 x developers which I'm going to leave you in 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.620
 the description of the video this tutorial 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.420
 it is very easy and simple wants to divide 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.250
 the several steps very easy to perform 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.379
 It should be noted that with this procedure 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.629
 you will not lose any of your information 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.879
 your images will not be deleted 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.739
 contacts and so on so you're going to 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.629
 have no problem in that aspect 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.890
 for you to do this successfully 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.899
 procedure I will give you some 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.090
 suggestions the first is that you have to 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.859
 temporarily disable the antivirus from 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.629
 your computer since in some cases 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.059
 often make some mistakes by having 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.890
 activated certain antivirus so 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.690
 temporarily disabling other 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.039
 recommendations that if they do not work for you 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.660
 in the first attempt then you go to 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:08.479
 try it but this time changing from 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.100
 usb port on your computer since outside 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.289
 also mark some more mistakes 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.060
 often what you think should 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.980
 also have charged at least the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.660
 80% of the battery 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.610
 positive in time aspect and very 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.110
 important is that you must have installed 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.360
 correctly the drivers of the 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.950
 device good now as first step 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.020
 we have to go to the configurations 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.600
 from our terminal we go to where 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.520
 says about the device now it 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.410
 we have to give where it says number of 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.300
 compilation repeatedly until 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.130
 tell us that we already have options 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.480
 developer now yes we're going to the 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.150
 part of below we are going to have 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.980
 developer functions we give you in 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.070
 them and let's check the box that 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.110
 says USB debugging once already 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.340
 we activate we accept and we 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.340
 let's turn off the device 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.670
 as once it's turned off our 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.040
 terminal let's press the key 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.170
 volume down the power key and the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.910
 home button at the same time we have 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.220
 have to keep pressed until we 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.690
 a message appears and we give you here 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.880
 volume or up to continue 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.980
 now let's move on to the second step in our 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.570
 computer we are going to go to the page of 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.310
 x of a must lopez that had them 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.260
 mentioned at the beginning of the video 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.850
 we go down a bit and we're going to find 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.550
 all the different versions of 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.990
 casemate s 5 as international 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.760
 coal tone that is the four-core 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.380
 here is also the international 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.150
 exynos which is what I have in this 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.280
 moment here we will also find 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.980
 other versions affiliated with different 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.870
 companies like t-mobile sprint between 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.180
 many others that corresponds to your 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.250
 device you do not have to download in 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.000
 this case as I have the samsung galaxy s 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.250
 5 smg 900 h I am going to download this file 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.710
 and I click here and we're going to proceed 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.330
 download the df bus once you already 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.490
 we have downloaded it we put it in 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.140
 our desktop in the description of 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.790
 video is also very moving away links 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.280
 so that they are downloaded in quiles and in 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.200
 samsung usb drivers once we already 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.030
 have downloaded to your computer we are going to 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.520
 proceed to install the key is then 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.690
 we installed the samsung usb drive once 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.850
 that have installed both 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.530
 correctly we will proceed to create 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.170
 a folder on the desktop that 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.180
 call the galaxy s 5 now let's 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.480
 proceed to cut and paste this file 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.819
 let's make the roots in this folder 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.159
 here we are going to click right and go 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.260
 to put where it says extract here now 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.909
 let's proceed to open the audi and 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.500
 immediately we have to connect our 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.019
 mobile device for the computer 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.150
 using the microusb cable immediately 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.950
 that we connect the device and it's going to 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.870
 recognize we do not have to mark the 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.849
 box where it says fight and we open 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.250
 fight now we look for the file that 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.140
 we just downloaded cf bus him 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.000
 we give in April and now we just have to 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.440
 press start immediately 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.030
 process begins and in a few seconds 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.190
 our terminal is going to start the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.930
 routing process this takes a couple of 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.480
 minutes and immediately our 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.260
 device is going to swell 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.030
 automatically when we have it 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.620
 rebooted that we go to the drawer of 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.180
 applications we will find that already 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.400
 we installed application 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.140
 superuser now to verify that already 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.819
 we have boot permissions we are going to 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.590
 install the ruth app to check 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.180
 this application lets us know if you already 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.430
 we are root on any device 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.290
 android we give in verifying and of 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.180
 immediately a message is sent to us 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.650
 says congratulations that our 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.840
 device already has permissions 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.789
 superuser and how they could observe 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.400
