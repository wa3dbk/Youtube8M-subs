 number 55 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.930

 advanced works see outside door 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.240

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.660
 innovative tight and folk bringing 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.490
 I get an inevitable evolution of the 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.280
 gender towards a theme set in 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.260
 the future with jet packs prototype weapons 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.940
 a skeleton connection armor and 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.400
 holograms that undoubtedly gave 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.050
 a great plus to the franchise nonetheless 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.030
 these visual functions stayed in 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.560
 the campaign in multiplayer mode 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.670
 he saw shriveled which was hard 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.670
 criticized by the player 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.740
 number 44 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.180
 the fiercest critics that modern 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.490
 warfare2 had received they were heading to 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.680
 that infinity ward had done very little 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.540
 for differentiating this title from 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.750
 had previously developed for the 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.030
 saga call of duty fortunately the 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.759
 story was good and it showed us a turn 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.710
 argument that we never imagined by 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.659
 what the final scene is something that up 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.100
 today we remember those that 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.100
 we enjoy this title 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.370
 also stands out for including the famous 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.410
 non-pink mission where we were placed 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.810
 in an airport and we had the freedom 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.810
 to shoot innocent civilians or not 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.310
 number 33 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.400
 with beauty 2 I take the foundations of 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.690
 watershed that was call of duty 1 and the 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.880
 take to another level with a game 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.830
 challenging entertaining and artistically 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.959
 beautiful for the time it was created 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.209
 this was the first game in the saga of 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.770
 introduce the regeneration system 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.750
 health automatic another of the points 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.640
 most remembered of the game is intelligence 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.770
 artificial that convert enemies 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.440
 in authentic soldiers ready to everything 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.420
 in order to kill you in addition to the 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.400
 difficulty this is a fun game and 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.380
 long then to finish they were not required 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.760
 more than 7 hours of game thing that 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.760
 we miss a lot now 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.900
 number 22 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.300
 we could consider black ops 2 as 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.980
 an attempt to reinvent the saga call 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.319
 of duty as it did in its 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.569
 modern warfare moment since now we 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.970
 located in a post-apocalyptic future in 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.340
 where the people of trier game tells us 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.390
 the story of the enigmatic enemy raul 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.460
 menÃ©ndez 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.290
 This is probably the call of duty 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.360
 what is more important in the world 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.130
 of the competitive multiplayer since 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.230
 weak or how well done that was this 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.150
 facet of the game to this day still 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.870
 being the reference in tournaments and others 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.870
 competitions 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.669
 number 11 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.370
 as here 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.080
 modern warfare was the first great 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.730
 revolution that the franchise had since 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.650
 left in the past the themes of the 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.780
 first and second world war for 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.730
 give a 180 degree turn and place us in 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.500
 a modern war with conflicts in 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.240
 different nations that established a 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.650
 of the best campaigns that gender has 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.690
 viewed 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.610
 infinity ward won the respect of 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.020
 all with this title which was the 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.000
 basis to go reproducing in the 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.800
 following installments of the saga is for 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.870
 this which occupies the number one position of 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.870
 our top 5 until next time 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.030
