00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.730
 good sunday to all guys i am 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.349
 pudding and welcome back with the 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.030
 sixty-seventh episode of the tops 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.709
 five place of the week since the last 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.110
 time we have dedicated ourselves more than anything to 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.360
 clip out of the sniper today back to 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.670
 immerse yourself in sniping in fifth place 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:27.110
 we find matt mick mars playing 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.210
 with the psr diamond it makes a trick cola 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.920
 tom across the map and hack the cam 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.260
 really the beautiful omitted fifth 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.150
 because then you will see what they are anyway 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.670
 the other clips that level are 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.310
 just now to also review the kill 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.230
 cannes just very very beautiful but it 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.329
 mold also lucky anyway 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.040
 compliments is already the second time that 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.590
 these girls appear in the top year 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.170
 last reached a few last year 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.790
 episodi ago reached the first place 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.860
 even today he still manages to 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.690
 reconfirm well with a fifth place 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.489
 now the clip goes a little further until there 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.500
 also shows the medals of that 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.910
 which honestly doesn't matter much 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.920
 the fact is that he did one anyway 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.870
 great clip is the fifth place if it is 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.810
 really deserved everything we pass now in 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.870
 fourth position where we find neuss that 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.120
 is playing with mors on me not 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.299
 I remember what it's called with beck and it makes us 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.159
 a beautiful five men on screen 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.500
 just all in a very fast coop quiz 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.240
 and without collateral so I think not 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.920
 having made collateral is indeed 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.770
 very good has prepared continue 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.229
 massacre is not not happy continues to 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.460
 kill them and then unfortunately is killed 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.960
 he, too, is the fact that I did one 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.630
 very nice clip compliments for the 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.240
 fourth place at the third position 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.619
 we find the finally that is playing with 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.850
 the bari is opening a first enemy e 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.970
 medium to a second enemy third switch 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.130
 45 64 56 for the five men on screen 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.780
 let's go and watch it slow again 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.759
 I especially liked it because it has 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.170
 also made the switch with the ICS PR 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.880
 let's see when already taken two then do it 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.110
 switch 123 x pity really not that 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.299
 he took the fourth if he couldn't 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.560
 be a fictional screen with 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.180
 the switch is actually a clip 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.340
 really fantastic the same in the second one 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.399
 position we find united flights that 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.460
 plays with the bartender quad wan bullet on 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.650
 reid 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.180
 very very beautiful but also arranged it 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.830
 very very lucky 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.780
 goes out with the bartender we can see how 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.120
 aims to see one then appear 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.830
 four and queue with the other then 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.870
 really nice clip compliments 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.730
 but let us now pass the first position one 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.270
 very similar clip but really really 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.070
 out of the normal we find the grid that 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.990
 I think it's also jtf clid now not 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.530
 I would like to say a bullshit that plays with 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:40.290
 l'ics pierre sur and exits in the spot 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.960
 leap cola trani luol deng takes 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.030
 The fifth my mom my mom I 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.410
 put put this first first because 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.970
 did not see the sailing enemies made in 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.320
 wolgang second because he took then 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.700
 also the fifth for the five on 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.070
 but the fact is that it was the thing 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.560
 absurd because when he shoots not 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.390
 see not even one look if one sees one 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.940
 and does the cud with the other really something 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.550
 of very sick therefore congratulations for the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.530
 victory of this of this top but not 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.300
 I could do great club otherwise 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.800
 so raga I hope the top was 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.880
 to your liking it was so 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.920
