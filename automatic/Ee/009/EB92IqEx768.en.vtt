00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.509
 and what's up kids are in a new 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.130
 video for the channel and this time I bring you 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.009
 a somewhat different video and it's about 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:17.220
 fight night at fredys is concretely 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:22.290
 2 and today I come to talk about a 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.630
 animatronic or that few people know and 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.280
 flame shadow bonnie vale is a 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.550
 animatronic or that has 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.620
 features is a black silhouette a 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.790
 black silhouette with white eyes are not 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.980
 living in the photo his fifth 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:43.040
 characteristic of being boiling is that 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.040
 shadow money means shadow bonnie 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:52.339
 what is said seems to be like a shadow 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:56.500
 although it does not look much like bonnie anymore 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:01:00.049
 what bonnie has as the head 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.210
 circular or more square and not like 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:04.339
 Solomon and that has more puppet type 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.409
 more chubby 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:13.560
 in its fourth feature is that if you 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:16.590
 it appears that there is a small probability 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.360
 can you grace the game and return to 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.729
 menu that you are one of them is to say you 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.210
 put the you see it on the left side of 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.280
 the room that appears shadow bond and you get 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.820
 the black screen is left and you return to 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.890
 main menu the second one is that it sounds 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.880
 a child laugh like some I go over or 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:45.780
 less and it goes away and you class to the game 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:48.209
 pÃ©rez and the third option is that they go to 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.799
 per shot leaves matronic or faster and the 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:53.670
 you have to give him more box 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.399
 constantly be faster and stay 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.090
 more time in the third feature 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.360
 is that although it is quite frightening not 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.750
 has james that you high of terror not 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.989
 kill but you can give yourself a scare 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.560
 equally the second characteristic is 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.599
 let's say like freddy golem since they are a 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.230
 kind of like hallucinations not yet 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:22.109
 it has been confirmed a lot but it could be 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.320
 a hallucination the two and the first 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:28.709
 characteristic is that it is not known if it is 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.870
 man or woman since not only are they seen 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.170
 the eyes without the teeth do not 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.750
 very well what it is and even 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.209
 that the video has arrived we do not have 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.590
 many features about shadow pony 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.769
 because it is an animatronic or very 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.480
 unknown and it's a top 5 because it's that 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.519
 it does not go for more 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.170
 I've been searching the internet and 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.810
 some found no high 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.200
 invented you have invented the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.790
 demonstrated also and good I hope that you 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.790
 have liked and until next time
