now<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.220> watched<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.030> video<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.420> YouTube<00:01:21.780> where

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
now I watched a video on YouTube where

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.020 
now I watched a video on YouTube where
someone<00:01:22.259> actually<00:01:22.470> took<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.759> machine

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
someone actually took this on a machine

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.510 
someone actually took this on a machine
lathe<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.990> machined<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.950> all<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.400> way

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
lathe and machined it all the way

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.210 
lathe and machined it all the way
through<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:28.080> think<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.439> he<00:01:28.590> did<00:01:28.829> two<00:01:29.040> or

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
through and I think it he did two or

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.609 
through and I think it he did two or
three<00:01:29.810> attempts<00:01:30.810> because<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.290> kept<00:01:31.500> breaking

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
three attempts because it kept breaking

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.920 
three attempts because it kept breaking
that's<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.520> lot<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.729> money<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:33.390> lose<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.840> a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
that's a lot of money to just lose in a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.870 
that's a lot of money to just lose in a
video<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.220> wasn't<00:01:35.549> sure<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:35.790> I
