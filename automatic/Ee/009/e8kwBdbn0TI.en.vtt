that's<00:05:01.960> that's<00:05:02.200> an<00:05:02.440> easy<00:05:02.830> way<00:05:03.130> to<00:05:03.160> just<00:05:03.490> get

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
that's that's an easy way to just get

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.540 
that's that's an easy way to just get
out<00:05:03.760> of<00:05:03.790> Varrick<00:05:04.240> and<00:05:04.600> go<00:05:05.470> anywhere<00:05:05.710> or<00:05:06.220> not

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
out of Varrick and go anywhere or not

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.910 
out of Varrick and go anywhere or not
really<00:05:06.880> like<00:05:07.180> like<00:05:07.930> you<00:05:08.080> shown<00:05:08.290> the<00:05:08.530> video<00:05:08.800> you

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.970 
can't go past year but I got other ones
still<00:05:13.630> working<00:05:14.020> this<00:05:14.620> one<00:05:14.770> you<00:05:14.860> could

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
still working this one you could

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.920 
still working this one you could
probably<00:05:15.130> just<00:05:15.460> glide<00:05:15.730> over<00:05:15.880> there<00:05:16.180> to<00:05:16.480> get

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
probably just glide over there to get

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.010 
probably just glide over there to get
there<00:05:17.170> too<00:05:17.470> but<00:05:17.680> I<00:05:18.010> want<00:05:18.490> to<00:05:18.550> try<00:05:18.700> it<00:05:18.730> out<00:05:19.020> be

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
there too but I want to try it out be

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.060 
there too but I want to try it out be
easiest<00:05:20.650> if<00:05:21.070> you<00:05:21.880> want<00:05:22.870> pies<00:05:23.170> use<00:05:23.650> once<00:05:23.890> you're

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
easiest if you want pies use once you're

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.580 
easiest if you want pies use once you're
through<00:05:24.250> and<00:05:24.720> like<00:05:25.720> I<00:05:25.900> showed<00:05:26.110> you<00:05:26.230> you<00:05:26.410> can

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
through and like I showed you you can

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.710 
through and like I showed you you can
get<00:05:26.710> a<00:05:26.740> lot<00:05:27.190> of<00:05:27.220> places<00:05:27.730> so<00:05:28.240> you<00:05:28.300> might<00:05:28.570> as<00:05:28.660> well

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
get a lot of places so you might as well

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.240 
get a lot of places so you might as well
just<00:05:28.930> try<00:05:29.110> it<00:05:29.200> out<00:05:29.380> you've<00:05:29.590> got<00:05:29.710> nothing<00:05:30.010> to

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
just try it out you've got nothing to

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:38.030 
just try it out you've got nothing to
lose

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.730 

and<00:05:39.040> then<00:05:39.220> I<00:05:39.310> guess<00:05:39.580> I'll<00:05:39.759> see<00:05:39.910> you<00:05:40.000> guys<00:05:40.060> later

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
and then I guess I'll see you guys later

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.610 
and then I guess I'll see you guys later
late<00:05:41.740> comment<00:05:42.190> and<00:05:42.370> subscribe
