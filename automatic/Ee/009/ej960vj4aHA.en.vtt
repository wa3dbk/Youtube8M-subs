 this time we will teach you to 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.109
 preparing a cute Christmas wreath for 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.430

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.430
 beautiful time of year 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.269
 The materials we need are a 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:20.810
 circle in icopor 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:23.449
 garland about 4 meters a 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.309
 allusive to Christmas doll which will 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.519
 let's put a skewer stick to 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:30.609
 fix the Christmas decorations which 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.489
 they bring wires or if we can not put them 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:36.980
 the skewer stick to paste gold and 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.649
 implements like silicone and scissors what 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.040
 first thing we're going to do is line the 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.440
 ico x with the garland we will place 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.829
 a little dot of silicone so that it 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.829
 fix 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.890
 and we're going to wrap the rest of the 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.700
 garland through the crown passing it 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.700
 inside out 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.239
 we are organizing the and covering the 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.239
 Blanks 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.909
 if you want you can go placing points 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.640
 of silicone so you do not leave 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.690
 running or if not at the end we're going to 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.690
 hold well 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.280
 when we finish we are going to fix it 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.180
 again 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.010
 so that it stays fixed organizing 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.820
 the good as I told you not to stay 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.820
 Blanks 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.799
 and for this bit where we ended up 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.799
 let's place the golden thread 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.970
 This golden thread we will serve 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.970
 hang it 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.460
 and it will also serve as a guide for 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.680
 place our ornaments 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.240
 we make a very strong knot because 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.240
 it's a bit heavy 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.310
 at the top we will place the 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.840
 bigger bow that we have and hopefully 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.840
 is a good color live 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.780
 it does not matter that they are flowers fruit leaves 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.970
 all these adornments are very good and in 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.490
 the bottom part we are going to place 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.920
 our doll that as I told you should 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.030
 carry a wire or a skewer stick 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.410
 to be able to get it right in the ico by 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.010
 we try to locate what we have left 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:40.140
 centered and organized the little flowers 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.140
 we are going to place them next to 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.850
 We drill the ico x with the wire that 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.920
 bring the figure and in case you do not 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.380
 have we can also go to the 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.830
 silicone to paste them if we see that 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.670
 it was very depopulated we are going to place more 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.730
 flowers while more dense we have of 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:06.010
 more beautiful ornament we have the crown and 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.010
 we try to make everything symmetrical 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.110
 As you can see it's a very hard work 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:16.260
 simple very decorative and very beautiful not
