00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 yes I went to 26 I think we can 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.089
 to say that I completely finished the game 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:16.619
 Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:17.940
 to test them and so hello to all 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.470
 and to all and f4 in greece I hope that 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.449
 you have good for me it's okay 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.150
 really very very well today 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.350
 find himself paul videau rather 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.699
 enormously particular because it's going 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.039
 to be a video like the plot view 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.949
 Egyptian because basically I wanted 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.360
 do something like theories 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.070
 the illuminati that was really delirious 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.570
 hyper slow but sure that the heat of 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.190
 I asked myself a question 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.020
 completely stupid in connection with 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.910
 Egypt and I wanted to answer that 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.350
 question making full of 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.969
 logical reasoning that are not 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.879
 at all and so the question that one has to 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:53.010
 to ask oneself that's it 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.690
 answer that question in this 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.039
 video is so I hope you who 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.390
 will do well this video because me at 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.800
 level of editing was really 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.539
 hold on for a long time whether it's for the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.250
 assembly search information 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.449
 writing the text because yes it's 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.500
 not something that I invented like that in 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.210
 two seconds it really took me 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.189
 time so certainly the video is short 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.020
 but it's intense not really there 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.090
 a lot of work behind and it's good 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.560
 realize the blow offers you 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.210
 we watch this video all from 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.299
 follow up and remember the question that 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.270
 is its source we find ourselves right after 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.829
 the little video for the end of video 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.479
 how are the Egyptian pharaohs 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.390
 actors in clash operation 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.090
 of clan 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.800
 in Ancient Egypt everything starts with the 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.930
 pyramids in everyone's minds 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.180
 so we can see that the 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.760
 second world village to a form 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.729
 of triangle included that pyramid to 105 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.890
 m the pyramid is in the symbol of 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.570
 famous illuminati an existing group 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.550
 well before ancient egypt and so 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.290
 before the pyramids 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:55.360
 this player is 4931 trophy 4931 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.930
 and the number of a train that has undergone 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.050
 collision in russia on june 1, 2012 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.350
 you do not see 2012 is the year when the 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.250
 short would have released it on your devices 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.220
 but not on all devices 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.430
 only ios so from the apple business 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.420
 you noticed you on this picture 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.950
 and yes in the twenty-four of 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.980
 schedule is again 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.190
 conceal a pyramid that she means 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.660
 so only 24 to 24 represents the number 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.670
 military burst 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.570
 sold by France to Egypt 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.390
 on February 12, 2015 again this 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.010
 airplane and a pyramid silhouette for 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.959
 finish here is a picture where we can 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.180
 very well imagine that every pyramid 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.600
 represents part of the title and the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.519
 burst Egypt is in 15 centers of 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.780
 group the clash of clan y group 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.670
 a lot of phenomena very 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.860
 particular grouping together in 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.450
 this country and egypt 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.100
 so we can conclude from egypt 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.079
 plays a major role so the heater 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.940
 was sleeping which is another 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.430
 question know one thing 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.640
 nothing is there by chance but as for 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.640
 denied him 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.530
 and here are the friends it's already the end of 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.850
 this video I hope you 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.170
 would have appreciated it because my wife 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.730
 took as I told you ai 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.170
 much time to mount so 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.670
 I hope you will have that but 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.340
 it's not over I still have two small ones 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.350
 pictures to show you why you 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.540
 show to show you that really 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.360
 they are everywhere the illuminatis are 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.370
 present as you can know it 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.440
 666 the devil figure a little bit carries 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.870
 happiness or misfortune we do not know 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.340
 well in the meantime I show you his 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.790
 two screen and you will tell me what you 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.590
 think 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.870
 and yes it is to show you that 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.520
 indeed they are everywhere but that's it 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.580
 no more than that it's just there are some 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.280
 six 6 everywhere coincidence I'm not 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.000
 sure in my opinion there is something there is 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.440
 something fishy 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.210
 I want to tell you no it's a 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.710
 joke about this I hope you'll have 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.120
 who makes this video you will have passed a 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.590
 good time there want to tell you 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.090
 feel free to drop a like for everything 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.920
 the work that I have that I put in 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.360
 this video hopes to comment 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.520
 by asking a question completely 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.040
 wacky to which perhaps later 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.690
 if I feel like it I will be able to answer 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.340
 in a video similar to the one at 10 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.840
 years completely amazing stuff 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.190
 please subscribe to is not 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.360
 already done on this pretty chao everyone 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.720
 it was maybe a quarter to the 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.720
 next
