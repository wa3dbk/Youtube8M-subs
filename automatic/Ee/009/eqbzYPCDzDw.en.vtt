another<00:01:30.229> thing<00:01:30.470> that<00:01:30.500> I<00:01:30.650> heard<00:01:30.890> was<00:01:30.950> their

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
another thing that I heard was their

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.969 
another thing that I heard was their
tubing<00:01:34.299> was<00:01:35.299> a<00:01:35.360> lot<00:01:35.630> more<00:01:35.979> aesthetically

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
tubing was a lot more aesthetically

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.450 
tubing was a lot more aesthetically
pleasing<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:40.210> just<00:01:41.470> better<00:01:42.470> quality<00:01:43.159> than

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
pleasing and just better quality than

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.810 
pleasing and just better quality than
other<00:01:43.610> most<00:01:44.390> other<00:01:44.659> external<00:01:45.290> filters<00:01:45.890> so<00:01:47.110> and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
other most other external filters so and

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.109 
other most other external filters so and
seems<00:01:49.820> a<00:01:50.270> little<00:01:50.780> more<00:01:50.960> flexible<00:01:51.590> than

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
seems a little more flexible than

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.609 
seems a little more flexible than
average<00:01:53.119> tubing<00:01:53.570> they'd<00:01:53.720> get<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.049> Menard<00:01:54.950> to

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
average tubing they'd get a Menard to

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:05.639 
average tubing they'd get a Menard to
your<00:01:57.619> local<00:01:58.810> store<00:02:00.580> here's<00:02:01.580> some<00:02:01.940> end<00:02:02.560> pieces

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
tubing suction cups sorry the video is

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.220 
tubing suction cups sorry the video is
probably<00:02:11.720> all<00:02:11.870> over<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.230> place<00:02:12.470> just<00:02:12.890> kind<00:02:13.700> of

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
probably all over the place just kind of

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.630 
probably all over the place just kind of
taking<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.290> with<00:02:15.470> me<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:16.030> think<00:02:17.030> this<00:02:17.330> is<00:02:17.600> the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
taking it with me I think this is the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.729 
taking it with me I think this is the
the<00:02:19.640> levers<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.660> go<00:02:20.840> on<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.610> tubing<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:24.470> stop

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
the levers that go on the tubing to stop

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.110 
the levers that go on the tubing to stop
the<00:02:24.950> flow<00:02:25.160> if<00:02:25.459> you're<00:02:25.610> trying<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:25.910> change

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
the flow if you're trying to change

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:41.050 
the flow if you're trying to change
things<00:02:26.480> out

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.570 

it's<00:02:42.060> pretty<00:02:42.360> heavy<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.959> lot<00:02:43.890> heavier<00:02:44.280> than<00:02:44.459> I

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
it's pretty heavy a lot heavier than I

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.500 
it's pretty heavy a lot heavier than I
was<00:02:44.730> expecting

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
was expecting

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.070 
was expecting
I<00:02:45.540> mean<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:45.990> not<00:02:46.230> massive<00:02:47.100> but<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:48.120> thought<00:02:48.930> it

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
I mean it's not massive but I thought it

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.590 
I mean it's not massive but I thought it
might<00:02:49.260> be<00:02:49.440> light<00:02:49.680> Oh<00:02:52.100> equivalent<00:02:53.100> to<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.600> small

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600
