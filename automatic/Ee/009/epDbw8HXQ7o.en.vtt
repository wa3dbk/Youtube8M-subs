00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.879
 today we are going to talk about the movie of the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.400
 snails a comedy of 94 thematic 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:13.139
 alien which in principle is a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.750
 point in favor of libya put together more aliens 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.400
 it's fine before you start making a 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.320
 small paragraph the original title of the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.220
 film is with ge what translated into 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.289
 Spanish would be something like head with 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.400
 imagine the guy who thought of the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.680
 translation of the movie saying 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.439
 head every scene power leave 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.110
 let's put cardboard you can not have a face 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.100
 with as cojones is a face of ccoo 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.100
 to see someone explain it to me 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.870
 it is not the head of non 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.390
 it is kiko mattamoros roll feeling 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.940
 annoyance but the worst thing is that nobody 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.220
 strange for that reason I imagine of the 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.370
 baldness should be part of evolution 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.370
 natural 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.820
 imagine having hair with a piece of 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.660
 head 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.730
 and appeal if you have to do the least 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.220
 and other things are already characterized by people 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.820
 they communicate on the basis of technicalities 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.159
 strange scientists 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.900
 for example one that I really like the 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.240
 molten treatment of mammal tate 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.250
 simulated 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.920
 strata of ungulate mammal data 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.409
 mozzarella 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.939
 mozzarella damn cheese of truth and 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.770
 prime and are sent to earth to 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.600
 enslave the human race but a 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.100
 error in your ship makes you have to 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.159
 stay here and adapt to the 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.530
 customs of American life 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.210
 rites 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.740
 the voucher finds employment repairing 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.350
 pottery 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.790
 but the black woman is hiring him 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.880
 ask your social life 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.640
 not have it because he likes an identity 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.320
 false and there we see the best role of alan 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.320
 come out from your fucking lives 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.409
 the studio champion what 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.540
 raises suspicions of the service of 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.900
 immigration which have sides and 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.170
 also painted on the face of the story 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.100

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.990

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.520

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.840
 aliens and need a fade of 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.840
