00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.450
 I have 5 tips to lose weight in one 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.570
 way much faster and they will see that 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.090
 it's not as difficult as it seems the most 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.920
 important is that number 1 we learn to 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.050
 eat instead of thinking about diets 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.060
 that they take away carbohydrates or that you 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.390
 they remove certain food groups what 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.800
 it is best to eat from each group in each 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.230
 of the strong meals of the day that's 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.449
 breakfast meal and then we must 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.130
 of eating something that has proteins like 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.199
 it can be the egg as it can be meat 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.550
 the fish some carbohydrates like 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.739
 they can be cactus tortillas or 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.589
 corn tortillas brown rice that is 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.389
 very good or amaranth for example and 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.699
 we must also include something that 

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:47.239
 have vegetables or fruits for example here 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.399
 I have some celery nopales some 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.409
 fruits like banana apple guava 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.959
 then at each meal we must include 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.359
 a little of each of these groups in 

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:58.180
 every strong meal of the day and also by 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.760
 supposed to take care of the sachets 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.530
 in number 2 something very important is 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.269
 eat five times a day let's do 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.850
 three strong meals that are breakfast 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.760
 lunch and dinner and among those you have to eat 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.979
 some collation can be an apple or 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.870
 a bar for example but this is going to 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.729
 help speed up the metabolism and that 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.160
 let's have much less hunger throughout 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.920
 of the day in number three take 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.800
 a lot of water is essential if it's 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.600
 we want to lose weight or slimming 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.100
 recommends that we should approximately 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.810
 to drink two liters of water a day 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.119
 although that also depends on the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.470
 body structure of each person but 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.750
 the water will help us feel a lot 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.790
 more satisfied we will feel better and 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.070
 will also eliminate many things like that 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.170
 that I recommend you to fill a 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.790
 one liter bottle and try to be 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.200
 taking over the day to get used to 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.720
 if they are in the office if they are in their 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.759
 house and fill it at least twice 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.610
 so they have enough of 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.160
 water and can lose much more 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.290
 in number 4 the exercise is of the 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.090
 most important parts if that 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.690
 We want to be healthy and we want to go down 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.190
 weight 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.960
 so if you 've never exercised 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.880
 you can start with little you can 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.740
 start doing 10-15 minutes and 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.390
 daily going up to try to 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.640
 Do at least 30 minutes a day 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.310
 this is going to greatly accelerate the process 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.320
 and we're going to burn a lot of calories in addition 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.530
 that we 're going to feel really good 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.930
 physically and especially emotionally 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.490
 and in number 5 remember to write all 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.620

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.380
