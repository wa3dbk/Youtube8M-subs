but<00:00:47.720> there's<00:00:48.260> still<00:00:48.410> three<00:00:48.800> notes<00:00:48.980> we<00:00:49.130> haven't

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
but there's still three notes we haven't

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.670 
but there's still three notes we haven't
used<00:00:49.640> we<00:00:50.120> haven't<00:00:50.360> used<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.660> flat<00:00:51.170> 9<00:00:51.410> which

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
used we haven't used the flat 9 which

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.540 
used we haven't used the flat 9 which
would<00:00:51.830> be<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.010> B<00:00:52.130> flat<00:00:52.340> in<00:00:52.610> this<00:00:52.670> case<00:00:52.910> an<00:00:53.120> A

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
would be the B flat in this case an A

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.160 
would be the B flat in this case an A
and<00:00:55.550> there's<00:00:56.450> a<00:00:56.480> reason<00:00:56.690> we<00:00:56.780> have<00:00:56.870> used<00:00:57.020> it

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
and there's a reason we have used it

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.520 
and there's a reason we have used it
sounds<00:00:57.380> kind<00:00:57.500> of<00:00:57.530> strange<00:00:59.170> we<00:01:00.170> also<00:01:00.290> haven't

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
sounds kind of strange we also haven't

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.750 
sounds kind of strange we also haven't
used<00:01:00.770> the<00:01:00.980> minor<00:01:01.460> 6<00:01:03.160> and<00:01:04.160> we<00:01:04.309> haven't<00:01:04.490> used<00:01:04.640> the

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
used the minor 6 and we haven't used the

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.890 
used the minor 6 and we haven't used the
major<00:01:04.910> 7th<00:01:06.160> and<00:01:07.240> there's<00:01:08.240> a<00:01:08.300> way<00:01:08.450> we<00:01:08.480> can<00:01:08.630> do

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
major 7th and there's a way we can do

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.390 
major 7th and there's a way we can do
tho<00:01:09.050> those<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.650> way<00:01:09.740> we<00:01:09.860> can<00:01:09.950> use<00:01:10.070> them<00:01:10.220> notes

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
tho those the way we can use them notes

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.810 
tho those the way we can use them notes
by<00:01:10.910> using<00:01:11.060> some<00:01:11.330> chromatic<00:01:11.660> techniques<00:01:12.530> and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
by using some chromatic techniques and

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.610 
by using some chromatic techniques and
let<00:01:13.820> me<00:01:13.880> show<00:01:14.060> you<00:01:14.120> the<00:01:14.330> first<00:01:14.570> one<00:01:14.780> which

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
let me show you the first one which

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.609 
let me show you the first one which
would<00:01:16.130> be<00:01:16.280> to<00:01:16.460> use<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.730> major<00:01:16.880> 7th<00:01:17.619> and

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
would be to use the major 7th and

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.590 
would be to use the major 7th and
basically<00:01:19.100> you<00:01:19.310> do<00:01:19.460> is<00:01:19.580> you<00:01:19.790> have<00:01:19.820> to<00:01:20.119> have<00:01:20.330> all

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
basically you do is you have to have all

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.200 
basically you do is you have to have all
the<00:01:21.080> good<00:01:21.229> notes<00:01:21.440> surround<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.369> bad<00:01:22.490> one<00:01:22.700> like

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
the good notes surround the bad one like

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.140 
the good notes surround the bad one like
this<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:24.340> then<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:25.430> don't<00:01:25.610> really<00:01:25.729> notice<00:01:25.910> it

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
this and then you don't really notice it

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.060 
this and then you don't really notice it
the<00:01:26.270> bad<00:01:26.420> one<00:01:26.630> just<00:01:26.840> sort<00:01:27.110> of<00:01:27.140> flows<00:01:27.470> right

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
the bad one just sort of flows right

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:36.550 
the bad one just sort of flows right
into<00:01:28.130> it<00:01:28.430> sort<00:01:28.610> of<00:01:28.640> passive<00:01:35.470> and<00:01:36.470> then

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
into it sort of passive and then

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.660 
into it sort of passive and then
everything's<00:01:36.860> okay<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:37.190> you<00:01:37.400> can<00:01:37.520> actually

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
everything's okay so you can actually

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.490 
everything's okay so you can actually
use<00:01:38.030> those<00:01:38.270> strange<00:01:38.690> notes<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:39.110> don't<00:01:39.259> fit

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
use those strange notes that don't fit

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.800 
use those strange notes that don't fit
as<00:01:39.770> long<00:01:40.340> as<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:40.610> just<00:01:40.820> start<00:01:41.450> with<00:01:41.570> a<00:01:41.600> good

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
as long as you just start with a good

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.600 
as long as you just start with a good
one<00:01:41.960> stick<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.650> weird<00:01:42.830> one<00:01:42.979> in<00:01:43.070> between<00:01:43.369> and

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
one stick the weird one in between and

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:51.649 
one stick the weird one in between and
then<00:01:43.700> end<00:01:43.880> with<00:01:43.940> another<00:01:44.210> good<00:01:44.360> one

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.590 

for<00:01:52.659> the<00:01:53.220> Jews<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.250> minor<00:01:54.670> sixth<00:01:55.180> I<00:01:55.330> like<00:01:55.570> to

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
for the Jews the minor sixth I like to

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.980 
for the Jews the minor sixth I like to
do<00:01:55.810> this<00:01:55.990> slick<00:01:56.259> where<00:01:56.920> I<00:01:56.950> take<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.780> major

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
do this slick where I take the the major

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.530 
do this slick where I take the the major
sex<00:01:59.380> and<00:02:00.100> do<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:00.850> little<00:02:00.970> chromatic<00:02:01.210> like

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
sex and do a little chromatic like

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.770 
sex and do a little chromatic like
surrounding<00:02:01.960> yet<00:02:02.640> which<00:02:03.640> of<00:02:04.270> course<00:02:04.299> uses

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
surrounding yet which of course uses

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.499 
surrounding yet which of course uses
that<00:02:04.930> that<00:02:05.560> weird<00:02:05.799> not<00:02:05.979> right<00:02:06.130> there<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:07.390> I

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
that that weird not right there and I

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.570 
that that weird not right there and I
end<00:02:07.630> on<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.840> route<00:02:08.020> pretty<00:02:08.770> much<00:02:08.890> anytime<00:02:09.459> you

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
end on the route pretty much anytime you

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.250 
end on the route pretty much anytime you
end<00:02:09.759> on<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.090> route<00:02:10.270> so<00:02:10.750> I<00:02:10.780> was<00:02:10.899> gonna<00:02:10.959> sound

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
end on the route so I was gonna sound

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.280 
end on the route so I was gonna sound
good<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:13.180> that's<00:02:13.330> got<00:02:13.510> those<00:02:13.660> three<00:02:13.870> chromatic

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
good so that's got those three chromatic

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.570 
good so that's got those three chromatic
kind<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.530> things<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.860> looks<00:02:21.130> real<00:02:21.370> useful

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
kind of things that looks real useful

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:36.030 
kind of things that looks real useful
he's<00:02:21.849> it<00:02:21.970> all<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.150> time

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.640 

and<00:02:37.299> I<00:02:38.299> think<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.629> toughest<00:02:39.049> one<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.260> fit<00:02:39.500> and

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
and I think the toughest one to fit and

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.740 
and I think the toughest one to fit and
it's<00:02:39.739> probably<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.159> flat<00:02:40.430> 9<00:02:40.730> which<00:02:41.329> is<00:02:41.359> just<00:02:41.599> a

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
it's probably the flat 9 which is just a

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.920 
it's probably the flat 9 which is just a
half<00:02:41.930> step<00:02:42.200> above<00:02:42.379> your<00:02:42.680> route<00:02:43.750> it's<00:02:44.750> real

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
half step above your route it's real

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.839 
half step above your route it's real
dissonant<00:02:45.439> and<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:46.370> only<00:02:46.489> one<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:46.700> could<00:02:46.760> think

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
dissonant and the only one I could think

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.399 
dissonant and the only one I could think
of<00:02:47.060> right<00:02:47.239> off<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.359> bat<00:02:47.629> is<00:02:47.989> this<00:02:48.170> sort<00:02:48.349> of

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
of right off the bat is this sort of

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:49.809 
of right off the bat is this sort of
thing<00:02:48.469> it's<00:02:48.769> almost<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:49.099> diminished<00:02:49.549> sending

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
thing it's almost a diminished sending

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.000 
thing it's almost a diminished sending
like<00:02:50.000> with<00:02:50.900> some<00:02:51.049> string<00:02:51.319> skipping<00:02:51.500> in<00:02:51.799> it<00:02:51.920> I

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
like with some string skipping in it I

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.530 
like with some string skipping in it I
do<00:02:52.069> this<00:02:53.409> just<00:02:54.409> got<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:55.060> little<00:02:56.060> minor<00:02:56.269> third

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
do this just got the little minor third

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.140 
do this just got the little minor third
lick<00:02:56.900> on<00:02:57.109> the<00:02:57.200> g<00:02:57.349> string<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:58.519> then<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:58.879> skip

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
lick on the g string and then I skip

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.990 
lick on the g string and then I skip
over<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.420> bead<00:02:59.569> I'll<00:02:59.750> play<00:02:59.930> it<00:02:59.959> at<00:03:00.109> all<00:03:00.939> go<00:03:01.939> to

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
over the bead I'll play it at all go to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.920 
over the bead I'll play it at all go to
this<00:03:02.150> one<00:03:02.329> here<00:03:02.599> same<00:03:03.139> frets<00:03:03.439> on<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.739> high<00:03:03.859> E

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
this one here same frets on the high E

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.250 
this one here same frets on the high E
then<00:03:05.930> I<00:03:06.019> slide<00:03:06.379> up<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:08.720> do<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.900> same<00:03:09.049> thing

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
then I slide up and do the same thing

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.280 
then I slide up and do the same thing
descending<00:03:10.510> just<00:03:11.510> do<00:03:11.599> that<00:03:11.720> over<00:03:12.169> and<00:03:12.200> over
