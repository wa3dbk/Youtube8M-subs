00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.090
 very good I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.010
 quite interesting enough that it ends 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.760
 to leave with the last update that 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.140
 they have taken out of modern warfare 3 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.390
 good 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.150
 the hack more than anything is a nun that the 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:36.510
 cry of more than anything is elite 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:39.780
 can be put on the clan badge 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.879
 the button buttons and everything and in the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.740
 name of the clan also here in the in the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.690
 title is worth 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.860
 good what you need is a clan 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.050
 logically and to be able to put it in the 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.730
 title you need level 5 and if you want 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.780
 put it in clan line you need the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.250
 level 10 well I'll explain 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.440
 more or less how it goes in the title 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.500
 when the law when you open the notebook 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.570
 notes what I will do in the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.479
 good inscription I will also leave the 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.190
 channel of the English guy who has done or 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.590
 be that you have created the tutorial that is the 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.270
 who has found the fault and all that 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.700
 I will also leave a description for 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.960
 what do you want if you want and good 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.119
 positive 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.130
 here in the notebook will come everything 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:30.550
 Like that is like everything is the same and 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.550
 such but I do not know if we go that changes 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.470
 Well, I'll take some random ones 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.470
 in this same 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.390
 we copy it normally and we paste it 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:49.630
 we will leave this these symbols but 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.630
 then the game either normal worth 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.830
 also the e1 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.560
 but here 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.869
 it therefore it is that simple 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.800
 then in the badge of the plan we put 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.800
 also anything 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.070
 OK 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.700
 and you can put up to four if you 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.890
 you want I've put 43 some that 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.250
 can you put what you want I'll put 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.400
 well more or less and good to tell you that 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.470
 This tutorial was searched by youtube 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.440
 OK and the only thing he found was 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.250
 guiris so I think it 's the first 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.650
 tutorial 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.690
 from galicia on ps3 because there's also 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.700
 one of xbox is worth that we also 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.770
 I will put the description so you have a 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.960
 incisive that if they want to do it 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.170
 and today you saw it is much more complicated 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.170
 so 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.660
 so what do you know that is more 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.980
 complicated in an xbox but I'll leave it 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.110
 also in the description of the kid 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.320
 this he has also done in Spanish 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.510
 and from xbox good as you see has been saved 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.820
 Normally I will leave you now an image 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.590
 of how your clan can be and 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.590

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.590
