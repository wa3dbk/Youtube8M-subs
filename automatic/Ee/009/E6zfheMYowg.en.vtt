00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
first we're going to try the photograph

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.500 
first we're going to try the photograph
of<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.770> Corvette<00:00:23.250> I'm<00:00:23.850> going<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.150> take<00:00:24.330> my

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.800 
of the Corvette I'm going to take my
transfer<00:00:25.170> sheet<00:00:25.530> lay<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.610> over<00:00:26.790> and<00:00:27.150> we're

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
transfer sheet lay it over and we're

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.660 
transfer sheet lay it over and we're
going<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.020> try<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.200> apply<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.650> white<00:00:29.010> base<00:00:29.340> to

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
going to try to apply the white base to

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.990 
going to try to apply the white base to
this<00:00:29.820> image<00:00:30.210> let's<00:00:30.810> see<00:00:31.020> what<00:00:31.230> happens<00:00:35.000> let's

this image let's see what happens let's
see<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.420> happens

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.650 

once<00:00:46.129> we<00:00:46.280> peeled<00:00:46.489> away<00:00:46.670> our<00:00:46.910> transfer<00:00:47.420> sheet

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
once we peeled away our transfer sheet

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.049 
once we peeled away our transfer sheet
you<00:00:48.170> will<00:00:48.260> notice<00:00:48.710> these<00:00:48.890> drop<00:00:49.280> out<00:00:49.519> areas

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
you will notice these drop out areas

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.740 
you will notice these drop out areas
here<00:00:50.690> in<00:00:50.809> our<00:00:51.140> image<00:00:51.820> these<00:00:52.820> drop<00:00:53.149> out<00:00:53.360> areas

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
here in our image these drop out areas

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.049 
here in our image these drop out areas
were<00:00:53.960> because<00:00:54.320> we<00:00:54.350> had<00:00:54.800> either<00:00:55.190> white<00:00:55.670> or<00:00:55.940> a

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
were because we had either white or a

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.470 
were because we had either white or a
very<00:00:56.930> light<00:00:57.309> concentration<00:00:58.309> of<00:00:58.460> toner<00:00:58.699> where

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
very light concentration of toner where

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.479 
very light concentration of toner where
the<00:00:59.659> white<00:00:59.930> base<00:01:00.260> from<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:00.680> transfer<00:01:01.190> sheet

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
the white base from the transfer sheet

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.329 
the white base from the transfer sheet
did<00:01:01.909> not<00:01:02.089> properly<00:01:02.479> adhere<00:01:03.199> let's<00:01:03.890> see<00:01:04.100> what

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
did not properly adhere let's see what

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.490 
did not properly adhere let's see what
happens<00:01:04.759> when<00:01:05.000> this<00:01:05.119> image<00:01:05.360> is<00:01:05.630> applied<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.470> a

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
happens when this image is applied to a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.029 
happens when this image is applied to a
t-shirt<00:01:07.930> we<00:01:08.930> went<00:01:09.110> ahead<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:09.530> applied<00:01:09.799> the

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
t-shirt we went ahead and applied the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:13.270 
t-shirt we went ahead and applied the
transfer<00:01:10.549> to<00:01:10.789> our<00:01:10.820> t-shirt<00:01:11.560> 375<00:01:12.560> degrees<00:01:12.920> 30

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
transfer to our t-shirt 375 degrees 30

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.490 
transfer to our t-shirt 375 degrees 30
seconds<00:01:13.789> we<00:01:14.299> let<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.570> shirt<00:01:14.780> cool<00:01:15.020> down<00:01:15.229> for<00:01:15.470> a

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
seconds we let the shirt cool down for a

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.779 
seconds we let the shirt cool down for a
couple<00:01:15.710> of<00:01:15.830> minutes<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.220> I'll<00:01:16.310> remove<00:01:16.610> the

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
couple of minutes and I'll remove the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:18.940 
couple of minutes and I'll remove the
backing<00:01:17.000> sheet<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.600> this<00:01:18.080> is<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:18.409> result<00:01:18.770> I

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
backing sheet and this is the result I

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.669 
backing sheet and this is the result I
got<00:01:19.130> as<00:01:19.399> you<00:01:19.460> can<00:01:20.149> see<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.810> areas<00:01:21.289> where<00:01:21.470> there

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
got as you can see the areas where there

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.559 
got as you can see the areas where there
was<00:01:21.920> white<00:01:22.250> or<00:01:22.550> light<00:01:22.909> color<00:01:23.149> in<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.479> image

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
was white or light color in the image

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:26.770 
was white or light color in the image
now<00:01:24.259> appears<00:01:24.770> as<00:01:24.860> dropout<00:01:25.610> spots<00:01:26.030> on<00:01:26.360> the

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
now appears as dropout spots on the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.809 
now appears as dropout spots on the
shirt<00:01:27.020> which<00:01:27.619> is<00:01:27.770> why<00:01:27.950> we're<00:01:28.159> saying<00:01:28.429> when<00:01:28.729> it

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
shirt which is why we're saying when it

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.029 
shirt which is why we're saying when it
comes<00:01:29.000> to<00:01:29.149> photographic<00:01:29.810> output<00:01:30.229> instead<00:01:30.920> of

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
comes to photographic output instead of

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.249 
comes to photographic output instead of

using image clip laser dark you might

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.960 
using image clip laser dark you might
want<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.530> use<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.740> traditional<00:01:34.069> opaque

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
keep that white within the image it's

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.480 
keep that white within the image it's
best<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.229> use<00:01:42.319> a<00:01:42.530> traditional<00:01:42.770> opaque
