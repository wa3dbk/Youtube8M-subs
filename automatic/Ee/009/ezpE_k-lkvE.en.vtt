00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.790
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.130
 issue of pcgh new in the test lab 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.610
 Today we have two mini itx mainboards 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.109
 on the one hand that it's rock b75 mtx 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.150
 that a very reasonably priced 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:22.539
 mainboard with a rather puristic 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.999
 equipment and we have the evga 77 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.800
 singer the board convinced by a 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:28.539
 very rich equipment and how 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.829
 the name implies by the 77th 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.770
 chip set so synonymous overclocking 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.470
 possible we would be the two now 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.530
 unpack the boards and see what we have 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.650
 is commanded like that or start right away 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.550
 take a look at the board of s rock dmb 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.400
 75m itx relatively inexpensive mainboard 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.140
 price is currently around 70 euros 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.020
 So first have a little flyer 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.350
 doing manual of course driver cd 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.240
 everything is the same as it is 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.060
 usual is sascha kramer two pieces 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.180
 Aperture kept very simple in this 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.070
 so here's the water on accessories 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.560
 Now we had the board here 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.310
 from this antistatic cover and 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.710
 look what is offered then 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.920
 So we have here first so a 4 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.079
 pin cpu plug 24 pin atx 1 x sata 6 gb 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.249
 3 x sata 3gb bios chip is only 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.219
 plugged so can also be changed 

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:26.700
 Usb3 would have as existing names 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:33.130
 pci express 3.0 connected with 16 lanes 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:37.229
 display have vga dvi and hdmi usb ports 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.310
 of course gigabit ethernet and 7.1 audio 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.999
 backside as I said very simple 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.329
 held 

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:44.979
 a very purist board is there 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.920
 really just what you can 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.590
 absolutely we need to lay that one 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.170
 this side and continue with the 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.029
 a bit more expensive board namely the 77 is 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.350
 always that is currently starting at about 180 185 

00:01:58.029 --> 00:02:01.630
 to receive euro 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.509
 so cost the same time 100 euro 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.819
 more and now let's have a look 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.549
 one gets clear for this 100 euro more 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.260
 first hold 17 70 chipset can so 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.400
 thus also easily by multiplier 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.019
 overclock and has 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.239
 yes no limit in the case here 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.069
 look at the carton are now first 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.500
 very classy packed the accessories 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.700
 because these bags even fed the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.420
 kabel we will do it now 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.280
 make up quickly 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.709
 look what a cable trainer me 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.049
 you have that a little bad 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:35.379
 sorted out a 4 pin molex spring 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:38.620
 2 x sata power plug adapters further 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.379
 hammer two sata cables ever in 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.609
 next bag is exciting 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.519
 So here too , all accessories are plentiful 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.970
 there enough there seems to have thereby 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.930
 his 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.400
 We have two sata cables 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.859
 each with a round cable and no 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.810
 shallow as you can at the halls 2 and 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:59.859
 1 4 pin molex to 3 x sata power plug 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.189
 That should be enough 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.709
 are 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:03.400
 the lab dazzle is very classic black 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.230
 held 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.040
 of course, also here again 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.269
 doing driver cd small flyer 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.310
 this is equivalent to the standard accessories 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.170
 we say and we devote ourselves now 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.280
 the more important part of the board 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.329
 which is very well packed 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.040
 Overall, the packaging is something 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.569
 higher quality than the esbk variant 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.760
 Nevertheless, of course, also pack in the whole 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.569
 more they have the first as static 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.980
 envelope and then again a 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.209
 Bubble wrap around too before 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.560
 Shake well so protect it 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.930
 first out and now we see here 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.540
 again several flyers on the 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.069
 platinum, the so we were notes 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.709
 give or hints to 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.319
 installation yes the cooler for the 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.269
 voltage transformer 7.7 +1 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:51.159
 power supply 8 pin cpu 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:52.540
 power plug 24 ptx plug otherwise 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.489
 quite classic, simply kept simple 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.489
 Diagnosis LED start and reset button is 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.739
 Also available on the board 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.349
 but otherwise two sata 6 gb and two 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.889
 sata 3gb s here and there on the 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:10.329
 cooler among other things for the for the 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:13.870
 Chipset the 770 chip set we have usb 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:17.470
 3.0 hd and two usb-2 would have clear again 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.109
 a pci express 3.0 in the field of hammer 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.590
 bluetooth among other mini displayport 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.840
 and hdmi for the picture edition gigabit 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.980
 ethernet and 8.1 audio on the 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.770
 Back of the board is natural 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.590
 clearly packed fuller than the esbk 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.540
 Variation that 's it for today already 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.590
 again with pcgh new in the test lab we 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.490
 Hope you liked it and he did 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.260
 Look again next time 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.340
 over here if we have the latest one here 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.340
 to introduce hardware
