00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.160
 hello how about people greetings welcome 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:05.990
 to the channel decora finally bring ufc here 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.609
 I had wanted and I'll explain before 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.010
 to start talking about nothing what is it 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.800
 what I'm going to do here first with the l2 or 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.610
 the r2 moved super fast and I stopped it 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.740
 random 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.080
 Now I'm choosing random player 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.490
 pulling up very often and very 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.340
 fast the same thing that I'm doing here 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.410
 to choose the opponent so they go to 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.940
 be my ufc games like that are going to be 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.910
 the combats that I am going to teach you 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.660
 I have decided not to upload career mode 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.150
 reasons why not none in particular but 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.340
 I think there will be more variety of weights 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.840
 fighters obviously if I go up the 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.000
 you fight like this even the way 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.970
 I'm going to do it in difficulty 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.309
 random I have already played one in difficult and 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.649
 I have to tell you that I won it but 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.600
 this one plays in normal and as you can see I'm 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.610
 georges thompson against pension 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.950
 Henderson Henderson Henderson on 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.020
 paper is better than them so now 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.489
 we will see what happens the scenes 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.680
 of these input I'll leave but 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.030
 not the presentations because if not the 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.630
 video is going to run out a lot and I do not 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.650
 interest is good there esports ufc what happens 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.690
 with this game 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.940
 Well, I've been playing some 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.430
 weeks and if I have to say that has 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.050
 liked it seems to me a correct game but 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.060
 I also find it a very difficult game 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.700
 the career mode in normal mode in 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.860
 Normal difficulty has seemed difficult 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.780
 and fights in normal mode are 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.740
 relatively affordable but in mode 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.470
 difficult are difficult and there are still two 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.930
 more difficulties do not touch the eggs 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.120
 you have to practice a lot I'm not going to 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.890
 assess the graphics because talk about a 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.510
 game rate a game for graphics 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.490
 it's like saying that a movie with more 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.229
 special effects and more explosions is 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.010
 better movie than another that has less 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.860
 it's absolutely absurd so I'm going to 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.300
 I'm going to basically spend 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.430
 playability in what is in the fighting 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.070
 also happened olÃ­mpicamente of the 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.020
 tutorials what is 'bruce lee' 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.090
 that if it is stoneware to me all that gives me 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.660
 just as seriously I'm going to talk about what 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.530
 what is the fidelity with the part 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.280
 technique 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.050
 if I compare it success you with the fifa no 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.700
 you can start making roulettes from this one 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.980
 continue from one goal to another and score 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.110
 a goal is not no not true is not true 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.430
 nobody plays soccer so then 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.280
 I was very worried that in this 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.769
 game you could win a single combat 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.860
 punching non-stop one behind 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:28.730
 another and kicking one after the other 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.739
 in mma cardio is a must and the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.160
 cardio ladies and gentlemen does not last a 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.110
 Really seriously fucking cardio or 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.660
 is not ye can not even imagine what 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.459
 it's hard to be a minute at the top of 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.019
 pulsations and I do not want to talk to you anymore 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.900
 of the five that are these guys 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.580
 giving of hosts with the cardio for the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.560
 Airs pulsations through the air 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.440
 nerves people cheering the pressure of 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.750
 win the bets the money or here 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.700
 they have assaults of three to three rounds of 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.519
 five minutes and when it's for the title 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.260
 it's five five-minute rounds 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.660
 that little joke with physical preparation 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.120
 of these really good people we are going to 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.590
 see I'm going to talk by blocks I'm going to 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.450
 talk about the hard part or what it is 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.739
 or what is the fight on foot then I'm going to 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.240
 talk about the cleanz and then I'll talk 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.570
 from the ground 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.180
 in the foot there is no problem is to say there 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.250
 already enters what you get to dose the 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.380
 histamine 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.510
 to make dodges 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.970
 heat the nose and start distributing 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.830
 a sack and you spend energy or dose 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.860
 there it is already a little bit, it is at the pleasure of 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.690
 consumer is very well gotten that 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.120
 a ko is a ko in a corporal is a blow 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.650
 that you enter does not have to be a blow 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.930
 of bonito does not have to be a blow 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.760
 perfect a ko enters when it enters and how 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.770
 come in and make you the ko this is like this 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.620
 is when you are and where you are and that is 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.480
 very well there is also liver chaos 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.200
 cause the body and that is also of 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.090
 fucking mother and the hard part I have little 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.120
 what to say is very well done too 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.000
 that the heavy weight moves slower 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.830
 that the fly and light weights and such 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.790
 that's true is that reality and I 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.670
 like so that part lasts little more 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.350
 I could say the clinch is the part of 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.750
 fight the fight part of that more 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.460
 unnoticed happens is a bit the one that 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.400
 it seems to be a priori that less 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.080
 importance when it is not like that 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.940
 clinch is fundamental is the transition 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.180
 what there is between standing and being in the 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.970
 floor in this game is a bit false 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.640
 in quotes I would say because they are 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.100
 still a long time taken when that in 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.900
 reality would not happen if the clinch or you're 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.970
 or you are not you do not stay in the clinch 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.500
 to see what happens either you stay on your feet 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.750
 to see what happens and neither do you stay in the 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.460
 floor to see what happens so the cleanz 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.190
 I'm going to put a well approved 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.870
 enough because he has the high clinch 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.550
 from muay thai and the clean if the 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.920
 neutral kleenex already when you have advantage 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.920
 you go to the back there is knee 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.380
 sagittal but it's a bit like that because of 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.000
 it gives me the sensation summarizing I would say that 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.150
 functionally the clinch is very 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.040
 fine movements very well 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.060
 how they close it is very good how 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.630
 they hit is very good 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.850
 but not just convinced me 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.980
 dead times there are with the clinch 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:15.450
 there's a slow fight there when 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.880
 actually the ufc fighters do not 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.820
 they are so long in the clinch so 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.680
 Well, the guy can be there almost 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.510
 I caught a triangle missing well 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.430
 little to lose the fight in the 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.090
 first good assault let's talk about the 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.540
 ground 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.340
 today in this video that you are 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.620
 I saw I tell you I am not convinced 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.240
 soil I do not like the soil is possible 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.800
 I change my mind as I play 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.569
 more and you will see that you can not do another 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.599
 shape 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:45.200
 have sought to do it I do not know who have 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:49.790
 Wanted to do but 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:52.490
 it is slow the finalizations are that 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:55.190
 you have to go forward and improving 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.530
 the position but that's very slow in the 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.690
 real life does not happen like that is that for a 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.550
 part I want to say that I'm not born saying 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.810
 that is not real but on the other you say fuck 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.150
 It's a video game 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.800
 you take a tie and you make it very 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.720
 quick so that the guy does not defend you 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.760
 in a video game you will not get a 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.220
 tie in two seconds 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.550
 you have to improve it and try to 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.950
 defend it or I understand it to be 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:22.670
 difficult d 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.740
 to execute is the idea and translate it into a 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.510
 I understand it but at the same time I 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.420
 I see that and the first thing I was born saying 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.750
 is not it's not like that that's not like that that's not 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.640
 true 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.920
 I'm not going to go in there are any 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.630
 keys that are not well made 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.730
 for example the key arm extended 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.110
 in fact in the photo on the web you see 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.650
 round rose and catching an arm wrench 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.360
 extended and only in that photo is that not 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.800
 it's like that that's not true knees 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.380
 they have to be closed so that 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.030
 key come out and in the photo are the 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.500
 open knees bone I imagine 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.900
 they will have had consultants for three of 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.120
 game of course they will have had 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.130
 and there are details that for me are serious in 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.300
 I would continue talking about this but I'm going to 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:03.060
 stay here the video is going to stay 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.680
 in 7 long minutes I refuse to do 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.780
 Longer videos, you can not really see them 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.270
 integers so they do not make any sense 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.860
 make longer videos the average of 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.750
 minutes of people watching my videos 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.790
 it's four and a half five, so 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.650
 make them longer so in the 

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:18.680
 next in the next video I'll talk 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.570
 I will continue talking about the ground and you will see the 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.460
 missing jumps you have seen the first 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.210
 assault I have not commented anything because only 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:29.060
 I wanted to talk about my opinion 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.169
 just the next ufc video 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.690
 will come soon I will not do 

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:34.580
 wait a lot quiet and see you in 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:37.040
 the next video be very happy and for 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.580
 the shadow god
