light/medium<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.839> picked<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.619> up<00:00:16.710> for<00:00:16.920> about

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
foundation I didn't see a great

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.650 
foundation I didn't see a great
selection<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.190> colors<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.910> pretty<00:00:57.360> much<00:00:57.480> was

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
selection of colors it pretty much was

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.869 
selection of colors it pretty much was
only<00:00:57.899> light<00:00:58.170> light<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.829> medium<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.609> think

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
only light light to medium and I think

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.770 
only light light to medium and I think
dark<00:01:00.530> so<00:01:01.530> about<00:01:02.100> three<00:01:02.370> colors<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.629> is

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
dark so about three colors and this is

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.750 
dark so about three colors and this is
the<00:01:04.110> one<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.589> matched<00:01:04.830> me<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> best<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
the one that matched me the best the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.450 
the one that matched me the best the
light<00:01:05.939> was<00:01:06.090> really<00:01:06.360> really<00:01:06.600> light<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.280> light

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
light was really really light so light

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.510 
light was really really light so light
medium<00:01:08.640> runs<00:01:09.180> really<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:10.250> pink<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.490> my

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
medium runs really really pink in my

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.429 
medium runs really really pink in my
opinion<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.299> when<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.049> look<00:01:13.080> at<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.350> in

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
opinion it and when you look at it in

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.920 
opinion it and when you look at it in
the<00:01:13.500> bottle<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.979> does<00:01:14.220> look<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.729> tad<00:01:15.299> bit<00:01:15.600> dark

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
the bottle it does look a tad bit dark

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.310 
the bottle it does look a tad bit dark
but<00:01:16.200> what's<00:01:16.680> strange<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.100> when<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:18.200> when<00:01:19.200> you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
but what's strange is when you when you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.130 
but what's strange is when you when you
blend<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.710> foundation<00:01:20.220> out<00:01:20.600> it<00:01:21.600> gets

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
blend this foundation out it gets

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.149 
blend this foundation out it gets
lighter<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.759> see<00:01:23.820> um<00:01:24.860> it<00:01:25.860> looks

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
lighter so as you can see um it looks

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.010 
lighter so as you can see um it looks
really<00:01:26.640> really<00:01:26.880> dark<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:27.450> once<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.780> start

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
really really dark but once you start

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.920 
really really dark but once you start
blending<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.619> out<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.100> does<00:01:29.600> light<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.780> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
blending it out it does light in a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.280 
blending it out it does light in a
little<00:01:31.200> bit<00:01:32.420> see<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.570> then<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.020> looks

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
little bit see and then it just looks

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.149 
little bit see and then it just looks
really<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.579> me<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.880> just<00:01:35.909> looks<00:01:36.180> really<00:01:36.270> pink

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
really to me it just looks really pink

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.590 
really to me it just looks really pink
but<00:01:38.159> once<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.549> blend<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:38.970> foundation<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.570> it

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
but once you blend this foundation in it

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.800 
but once you blend this foundation in it
does<00:01:40.079> give<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.740> about<00:01:41.070> medium<00:01:41.549> coverage<00:01:42.030> now

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
does give you about medium coverage now

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.069 
does give you about medium coverage now
the<00:01:43.350> way<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.920> looks<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.490> skin<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:45.149> not

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
the way that it looks on the skin is not

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.780 
the way that it looks on the skin is not
my<00:01:46.290> favorite<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> definitely<00:01:47.220> has<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
my favorite it definitely has a

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.080 
my favorite it definitely has a
luminosity<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.520> it's<00:01:50.520> really<00:01:50.759> hard<00:01:50.970> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
luminosity to it it it's really hard to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.550 
luminosity to it it it's really hard to
describe<00:01:51.270> but<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.720> because<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.290> not<00:01:52.500> really

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
describe but it because it's not really

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.319 
describe but it because it's not really
like<00:01:53.490> um<00:01:54.740> like<00:01:55.740> glitter<00:01:56.130> or<00:01:56.640> shimmer<00:01:56.670> or

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
like um like glitter or shimmer or

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.260 
like um like glitter or shimmer or
something<00:01:57.689> it's<00:01:58.200> more<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.619> like<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.570> glaze<00:02:00.600> to

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
something it's more of like a glaze to

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.819 
something it's more of like a glaze to
finish<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> glaze<00:02:04.170> finish<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.680> don't

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
finish it's like a glaze finish I don't

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.010 
finish it's like a glaze finish I don't
know<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.399> even<00:02:05.610> makes<00:02:05.640> sense<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.210> as<00:02:06.899> you

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
know if that even makes sense but as you

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.770 
know if that even makes sense but as you
can<00:02:07.140> see<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.439> definitely<00:02:07.590> has<00:02:08.209> some<00:02:09.209> kind<00:02:09.629> of

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
can see it definitely has some kind of

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.610 
can see it definitely has some kind of
glow<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:12.000> me<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.239> find<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.349> be

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
glow to it and to me I find that to be

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.649 
glow to it and to me I find that to be
problem<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.549> I'll<00:02:14.940> tell<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.209> why<00:02:15.330> just<00:02:15.599> a

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
problem and I'll tell you why just a

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.070 
problem and I'll tell you why just a
second<00:02:15.989> so<00:02:16.430> applying<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.730> blends<00:02:17.940> well<00:02:18.180> it

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
second so applying it blends well it

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.800 
second so applying it blends well it
sets<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.860> about<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.159> not<00:02:20.790> really<00:02:21.060> matte<00:02:21.330> but<00:02:21.750> not

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
sets to about a not really matte but not

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.520 
sets to about a not really matte but not
really<00:02:23.390> more<00:02:24.390> like<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.599> satin<00:02:25.019> finish<00:02:25.170> yeah

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
really more like a satin finish yeah

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:34.730 
really more like a satin finish yeah
like<00:02:25.799> a<00:02:25.830> satin<00:02:26.190> finish

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.320 

it<00:02:35.740> does<00:02:35.980> cover<00:02:36.459> up<00:02:36.640> some<00:02:36.819> of<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:37.000> redness

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
it does cover up some of the redness

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.690 
it does cover up some of the redness
that<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.540> had<00:02:37.720> my<00:02:37.870> skin<00:02:38.200> mind<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.160> had<00:02:39.400> just

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
that I had my skin mind you I had just

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.440 
that I had my skin mind you I had just
taken<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.510> shower<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.920> did<00:02:42.670> do<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.000> little<00:02:43.209> bit

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
taken a shower and I did do a little bit

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.690 
taken a shower and I did do a little bit
of<00:02:43.480> popping<00:02:44.260> on<00:02:44.440> my<00:02:44.560> nose<00:02:44.770> so<00:02:45.130> that's<00:02:45.459> why<00:02:45.550> my

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
of popping on my nose so that's why my

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.570 
of popping on my nose so that's why my
nose<00:02:45.880> looks<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.150> lot<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.599> lot<00:02:46.989> more<00:02:47.200> red<00:02:47.580> but

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
nose looks a lot a lot more red but

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.820 
nose looks a lot a lot more red but
either<00:02:49.120> way<00:02:49.300> did<00:02:49.810> cover<00:02:50.080> up<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.470> lot<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.650> the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
either way did cover up a lot of the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.440 
either way did cover up a lot of the
redness<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.400> overall<00:02:51.910> I<00:02:51.940> think<00:02:52.090> it's<00:02:52.360> a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
redness and overall I think it's a

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.110 
redness and overall I think it's a
really<00:02:52.660> great<00:02:53.130> medium<00:02:54.130> coverage<00:02:54.610> like<00:02:54.880> I'm

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
really great medium coverage like I'm

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.000 
really great medium coverage like I'm
really<00:02:55.450> uncomfortable<00:02:56.200> with<00:02:56.350> that<00:02:56.590> coverage

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
really uncomfortable with that coverage

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.370 
really uncomfortable with that coverage
on<00:02:57.220> my<00:02:57.370> skin<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:58.569> things<00:02:58.780> that<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:58.959> don't<00:02:59.230> like

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
on my skin the things that I don't like

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.710 
on my skin the things that I don't like
about<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.709> foundation<00:03:00.220> are<00:03:00.569> things<00:03:01.569> that<00:03:01.630> I

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
about the foundation are things that I

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.940 
about the foundation are things that I
thought<00:03:01.930> I<00:03:01.989> would<00:03:02.140> like<00:03:02.470> about<00:03:02.680> this

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
thought I would like about this

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.470 
thought I would like about this
foundation<00:03:03.459> which<00:03:03.670> is<00:03:03.760> why<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:03.940> bought<00:03:04.209> it<00:03:04.390> I

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
foundation which is why I bought it I

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.180 
foundation which is why I bought it I
thought<00:03:04.870> that<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.290> would<00:03:05.380> be<00:03:05.620> nice<00:03:05.890> and

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
thought that it would be nice and

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.150 
thought that it would be nice and
luminous<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:06.790> that<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:08.500> really<00:03:08.920> does

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
luminous and that it is it really does

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.040 
luminous and that it is it really does
give<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.430> glow<00:03:09.819> to<00:03:09.880> your<00:03:10.120> skin<00:03:10.209> but<00:03:10.660> that<00:03:10.840> glow<00:03:11.019> I

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
give a glow to your skin but that glow I

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.500 
give a glow to your skin but that glow I
find<00:03:11.470> only<00:03:11.709> lasts<00:03:12.250> like<00:03:12.459> what<00:03:12.730> maybe<00:03:13.239> two

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
find only lasts like what maybe two

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.930 
find only lasts like what maybe two
hours<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:14.260> then<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:15.040> foundation<00:03:15.250> starts<00:03:15.760> to

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
hours and then the foundation starts to

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.870 
hours and then the foundation starts to
fade<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:17.319> doesn't<00:03:17.590> fade<00:03:17.739> evenly<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.489> fades

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
fade and it doesn't fade evenly it fades

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.150 
fade and it doesn't fade evenly it fades
very<00:03:19.660> awkwardly<00:03:20.170> because<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.650> feel<00:03:20.920> like<00:03:20.950> it

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
very awkwardly because I feel like it

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.280 
very awkwardly because I feel like it
still<00:03:21.400> leaves<00:03:21.700> like<00:03:22.000> that<00:03:22.209> glow<00:03:22.630> on<00:03:22.900> your<00:03:22.930> face

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
still leaves like that glow on your face

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.130 
still leaves like that glow on your face
but<00:03:24.040> there's<00:03:24.220> no<00:03:24.400> coverage<00:03:24.819> so<00:03:25.600> it's<00:03:25.840> kind<00:03:26.080> of

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
but there's no coverage so it's kind of

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.259 
but there's no coverage so it's kind of
like<00:03:26.319> it<00:03:26.500> just<00:03:26.530> leaves<00:03:26.920> like<00:03:27.069> a<00:03:27.220> glaze<00:03:27.700> on<00:03:28.060> your

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
like it just leaves like a glaze on your

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.990 
like it just leaves like a glaze on your
skin<00:03:28.739> with<00:03:29.739> no<00:03:29.769> coverage<00:03:30.250> which<00:03:30.489> just<00:03:30.850> looks

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
skin with no coverage which just looks

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.490 
skin with no coverage which just looks
really<00:03:31.299> weird<00:03:31.510> because<00:03:31.750> then<00:03:32.049> it<00:03:32.140> accentuates

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
really weird because then it accentuates

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.300 
really weird because then it accentuates
all<00:03:32.920> of<00:03:33.040> your<00:03:33.250> flaws<00:03:34.120> like<00:03:34.420> your<00:03:34.780> dry<00:03:35.410> skin<00:03:35.470> any

spots<00:03:55.000> times<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.750> million<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:56.440> it's<00:03:57.400> very

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
spots times a million and it's very

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.220 
spots times a million and it's very
frustrating<00:03:57.790> because<00:03:58.390> it<00:03:58.840> just<00:03:58.989> looks<00:03:59.170> really

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
frustrating because it just looks really

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.930 
frustrating because it just looks really
bad<00:03:59.680> especially<00:03:59.950> like<00:04:00.370> around<00:04:00.549> your<00:04:00.760> nose

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
bad especially like around your nose

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.870 
bad especially like around your nose
area<00:04:01.420> it<00:04:01.600> doesn't<00:04:01.870> really<00:04:02.430> look<00:04:03.430> really<00:04:03.730> nice

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
area it doesn't really look really nice

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.699 
area it doesn't really look really nice
here<00:04:04.329> and<00:04:04.690> you<00:04:04.810> can<00:04:04.930> definitely<00:04:05.079> tell<00:04:05.470> that

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
here and you can definitely tell that

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.530 
here and you can definitely tell that
you're<00:04:05.859> wearing<00:04:06.100> foundation<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:07.090> another

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
you're wearing foundation and another

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.410 
you're wearing foundation and another
thing<00:04:07.840> is<00:04:08.019> that<00:04:08.170> it<00:04:08.320> makes<00:04:08.500> my<00:04:08.709> skin<00:04:08.769> itchy<00:04:09.420> I

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
thing is that it makes my skin itchy I

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.050 
thing is that it makes my skin itchy I
have<00:04:11.049> this<00:04:11.230> problem<00:04:11.500> with<00:04:11.769> primers<00:04:12.459> where<00:04:12.790> if

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
have this problem with primers where if

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.000 
have this problem with primers where if
the<00:04:13.540> problem<00:04:13.959> if<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.290> primer<00:04:14.530> is<00:04:14.680> really

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
the problem if the primer is really

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.979 
the problem if the primer is really
silicone<00:04:15.579> II<00:04:15.609> like<00:04:16.239> it<00:04:16.359> has<00:04:16.750> a<00:04:16.780> lot<00:04:16.959> of

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
silicone II like it has a lot of

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.229 
silicone II like it has a lot of
silicone<00:04:17.380> in<00:04:17.560> it<00:04:17.680> it<00:04:18.039> will<00:04:18.370> make<00:04:18.579> my<00:04:18.729> skin<00:04:19.030> itch

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
silicone in it it will make my skin itch

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.300 
silicone in it it will make my skin itch
which<00:04:19.630> is<00:04:19.810> why<00:04:20.049> I<00:04:20.079> really<00:04:20.530> can't<00:04:20.829> wear<00:04:21.039> any

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
which is why I really can't wear any

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.090 
which is why I really can't wear any
most<00:04:22.150> primers<00:04:22.600> I<00:04:22.870> will<00:04:23.530> wear<00:04:23.740> them<00:04:23.890> you<00:04:24.010> know

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
most primers I will wear them you know

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.980 
most primers I will wear them you know
if<00:04:24.220> I<00:04:24.340> have<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:24.850> for<00:04:25.210> like<00:04:25.330> a<00:04:25.360> video<00:04:25.690> or

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
if I have to for like a video or

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.320 
if I have to for like a video or
something<00:04:26.229> but<00:04:26.710> on<00:04:26.979> an<00:04:27.370> everyday<00:04:27.669> basis<00:04:28.210> I

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
something but on an everyday basis I

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.600 
something but on an everyday basis I
tend<00:04:28.840> to<00:04:28.930> skip<00:04:29.289> primers<00:04:29.919> because<00:04:30.250> they<00:04:30.430> just

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
tend to skip primers because they just

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.850 
tend to skip primers because they just
make<00:04:31.180> my<00:04:31.300> skin<00:04:31.539> itch<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:32.020> they<00:04:32.350> break<00:04:32.500> me<00:04:32.710> out

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
make my skin itch and they break me out

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.240 
make my skin itch and they break me out
so<00:04:33.220> I<00:04:33.490> don't<00:04:34.389> know<00:04:34.479> this<00:04:34.780> audition<00:04:35.229> will<00:04:35.440> break

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
so I don't know this audition will break

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.940 
so I don't know this audition will break
me<00:04:36.460> out<00:04:36.639> I've<00:04:36.970> worn<00:04:37.360> it<00:04:37.510> for<00:04:37.570> about<00:04:37.990> two<00:04:38.680> weeks

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
me out I've worn it for about two weeks

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.760 
me out I've worn it for about two weeks
on<00:04:39.190> and<00:04:39.400> off<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.970> it<00:04:40.479> hasn't<00:04:40.720> made<00:04:40.990> me<00:04:41.530> break

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
on and off and it hasn't made me break

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.180 
on and off and it hasn't made me break
out<00:04:41.950> yet<00:04:42.310> but<00:04:42.580> I<00:04:43.169> think<00:04:44.169> it<00:04:44.320> might<00:04:44.530> eventually

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
out yet but I think it might eventually

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.310 
out yet but I think it might eventually
you<00:04:45.340> know<00:04:45.460> it's<00:04:45.700> just<00:04:45.849> I<00:04:46.030> feel<00:04:46.330> itchy<00:04:46.840> when<00:04:47.289> I

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
you know it's just I feel itchy when I

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.910 
you know it's just I feel itchy when I
apply<00:04:47.680> it

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
apply it

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.500 
apply it
so<00:04:48.010> I<00:04:48.040> just<00:04:48.250> don't<00:04:48.400> think<00:04:48.700> you<00:04:49.150> should<00:04:49.330> really

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
so I just don't think you should really

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.850 
so I just don't think you should really
keep<00:04:49.720> wearing<00:04:49.930> anything<00:04:50.380> that<00:04:50.500> makes<00:04:50.680> your

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
keep wearing anything that makes your

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.340 
keep wearing anything that makes your
skin<00:04:50.890> itchy<00:04:51.340> but<00:04:52.240> that<00:04:52.390> could<00:04:52.570> just<00:04:52.720> be<00:04:52.810> me<00:04:53.110> it

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
skin itchy but that could just be me it

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.050 
skin itchy but that could just be me it
could<00:04:53.380> just<00:04:53.710> be<00:04:53.920> you<00:04:54.280> know<00:04:54.310> my<00:04:54.550> skin<00:04:54.880> being

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
could just be you know my skin being

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.500 
could just be you know my skin being
sensitive<00:04:55.690> but<00:04:56.220> besides<00:04:57.220> that<00:04:57.370> I<00:04:57.670> just<00:04:57.940> really

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
sensitive but besides that I just really

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.470 
sensitive but besides that I just really
didn't<00:04:58.780> like<00:04:58.900> how<00:04:58.960> it<00:04:59.470> it<00:04:59.860> wears<00:05:00.300> it's<00:05:01.300> not<00:05:01.450> a

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
didn't like how it it wears it's not a

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.180 
didn't like how it it wears it's not a
foundation<00:05:01.900> that<00:05:02.020> I<00:05:02.050> would<00:05:02.260> choose<00:05:02.560> to<00:05:02.620> wear

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
foundation that I would choose to wear

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.330 
foundation that I would choose to wear
for<00:05:03.550> a<00:05:03.580> long<00:05:03.760> time<00:05:04.150> because<00:05:04.530> like<00:05:05.530> I<00:05:05.800> said<00:05:06.160> it

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
for a long time because like I said it

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.240 
for a long time because like I said it
fades<00:05:06.610> so<00:05:06.820> quickly<00:05:07.180> and<00:05:07.420> by<00:05:08.230> the<00:05:08.770> eighth<00:05:08.950> hour

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
fades so quickly and by the eighth hour

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.480 
fades so quickly and by the eighth hour

just it's just not my favorite
foundation<00:05:27.280> I<00:05:27.340> just<00:05:27.580> have<00:05:27.670> to<00:05:27.790> be<00:05:27.880> completely

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
foundation I just have to be completely

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.440 
foundation I just have to be completely
honest<00:05:28.540> so<00:05:29.260> if<00:05:29.740> you<00:05:29.860> see<00:05:30.130> this<00:05:30.280> foundation<00:05:30.970> I

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
honest so if you see this foundation I

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.560 
honest so if you see this foundation I
would<00:05:32.050> say<00:05:32.530> skip<00:05:33.400> it<00:05:33.580> just<00:05:34.060> because<00:05:34.420> I<00:05:34.510> don't

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
would say skip it just because I don't

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.590 
would say skip it just because I don't
think<00:05:34.690> it's<00:05:34.960> worth<00:05:35.820> worth<00:05:36.820> the<00:05:37.000> price<00:05:37.210> I<00:05:37.570> think

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
think it's worth worth the price I think

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.330 
think it's worth worth the price I think
it's<00:05:37.900> gonna<00:05:38.020> be<00:05:38.230> very<00:05:38.260> expensive<00:05:38.650> out<00:05:39.130> at<00:05:39.220> the

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
it's gonna be very expensive out at the

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.010 
it's gonna be very expensive out at the
drugstores<00:05:39.760> anyway<00:05:40.120> and<00:05:40.420> I<00:05:40.690> don't<00:05:40.750> know<00:05:40.990> I

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
drugstores anyway and I don't know I

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.500 
drugstores anyway and I don't know I
just<00:05:41.310> did<00:05:42.310> not<00:05:42.430> like<00:05:42.730> this<00:05:42.880> one<00:05:43.060> nation<00:05:43.270> I<00:05:43.330> feel

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
just did not like this one nation I feel

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.000 
just did not like this one nation I feel
like<00:05:43.630> if<00:05:43.750> you<00:05:43.840> really<00:05:44.110> want<00:05:44.380> a<00:05:44.530> luminous

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
like if you really want a luminous

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.730 
like if you really want a luminous
luminous<00:05:45.700> foundation<00:05:46.630> from<00:05:47.200> the<00:05:47.320> drugstore<00:05:47.530> I

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
luminous foundation from the drugstore I

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.080 
luminous foundation from the drugstore I
would<00:05:47.920> definitely<00:05:48.220> just<00:05:48.370> go<00:05:48.520> with<00:05:48.700> the

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
would definitely just go with the

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.600 
would definitely just go with the
L'Oreal<00:05:49.540> Lumi<00:05:49.660> I<00:05:49.960> think<00:05:50.350> that<00:05:50.530> gives<00:05:51.250> a<00:05:51.340> really

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
L'Oreal Lumi I think that gives a really

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.220 
L'Oreal Lumi I think that gives a really
pretty<00:05:51.880> finish<00:05:52.210> on<00:05:52.390> the<00:05:52.480> skin<00:05:52.720> and<00:05:52.840> it<00:05:52.930> wears<00:05:53.080> a

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
pretty finish on the skin and it wears a

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.950 
pretty finish on the skin and it wears a
lot<00:05:53.470> better<00:05:53.710> than<00:05:54.100> this<00:05:54.630> anyway<00:05:55.630> I<00:05:55.660> think

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
lot better than this anyway I think

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.800 
lot better than this anyway I think
that's<00:05:56.200> all<00:05:56.350> that<00:05:56.530> I<00:05:56.560> have<00:05:56.740> to<00:05:56.890> say<00:05:57.480> about<00:05:58.480> this

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
that's all that I have to say about this

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.320 
that's all that I have to say about this
foundation<00:05:59.460> it's<00:06:00.460> such<00:06:00.640> a<00:06:00.670> bummer<00:06:01.000> because

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
foundation it's such a bummer because

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.930 
foundation it's such a bummer because
this<00:06:01.990> foundation<00:06:02.410> is<00:06:02.530> so<00:06:02.680> pretty<00:06:02.950> and<00:06:03.550> I

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
this foundation is so pretty and I

almost want to like dump the foundation
out<00:06:06.340> and<00:06:06.670> then<00:06:06.880> like<00:06:07.090> put<00:06:07.450> my<00:06:07.990> favorite

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
foundation in and just so that I can

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.090 
foundation in and just so that I can
keep<00:06:10.270> using<00:06:10.450> it<00:06:10.750> but<00:06:12.750> yeah<00:06:13.750> I<00:06:13.990> can't<00:06:14.290> because<00:06:14.860> I

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
keep using it but yeah I can't because I

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.320 
keep using it but yeah I can't because I
just<00:06:15.430> think<00:06:15.670> that<00:06:15.790> would<00:06:15.880> be<00:06:16.060> too<00:06:16.240> much

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
just think that would be too much

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.140 
just think that would be too much
trouble<00:06:16.830> but<00:06:17.830> anyway<00:06:18.220> I<00:06:18.250> hope<00:06:18.640> that<00:06:18.820> this<00:06:18.970> was

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
trouble but anyway I hope that this was
