pleasure and everyone knows it's funny
it<00:00:13.910> smells<00:00:14.910> we<00:00:15.660> all<00:00:15.929> do<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.500> on<00:00:16.650> average<00:00:16.949> 14

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
it smells we all do it on average 14

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.900 
it smells we all do it on average 14
times<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.850> day<00:00:18.050> but<00:00:19.050> why<00:00:19.470> does<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.369> happen<00:00:20.550> uh

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
times a day but why does it happen uh

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.340 
times a day but why does it happen uh
well<00:00:21.359> they're<00:00:21.510> two<00:00:21.630> main<00:00:21.810> reasons<00:00:22.230> that

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
well they're two main reasons that

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.429 
well they're two main reasons that
people<00:00:22.800> fart<00:00:23.519> one<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.480> produce<00:00:24.660> gas<00:00:25.080> and

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
people fart one is you produce gas and

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.990 
people fart one is you produce gas and
the<00:00:25.619> other<00:00:25.740> one<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.160> take<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.580> gas<00:00:26.760> like

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the other one is you take in gas like

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.429 
the other one is you take in gas like
see<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.269> guy<00:00:27.420> he's<00:00:27.660> eating<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.080> quickly

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
see this guy he's eating so quickly

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.500 
see this guy he's eating so quickly
eating<00:00:29.130> quickly<00:00:29.310> makes<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.880> swallow<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.359> lot

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
eating quickly makes you swallow a lot

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.359 
eating quickly makes you swallow a lot
of<00:00:30.570> gas<00:00:30.869> having<00:00:31.710> beverages<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.340> are

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
of gas having beverages that are

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.459 
of gas having beverages that are
carbonated<00:00:33.030> sometimes<00:00:33.420> using<00:00:33.780> straw<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.290> this

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
carbonated sometimes using straw so this

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.860 
carbonated sometimes using straw so this
brings<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.130> certain<00:00:35.730> gases<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.390> your<00:00:36.570> body

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
brings in certain gases that your body

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.700 
brings in certain gases that your body
burps<00:00:37.440> out<00:00:37.739> but<00:00:38.550> sometimes<00:00:39.110> sometimes<00:00:40.110> you

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
burps out but sometimes sometimes you

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.500 
burps out but sometimes sometimes you
don't<00:00:40.920> burp<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.370> out<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.760> goes<00:00:41.879> into<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
don't burp it out and it goes into the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.420 
don't burp it out and it goes into the
stomach<00:00:42.570> where<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.469> keeps<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.920> moving<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
stomach where it keeps on moving the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.029 
stomach where it keeps on moving the
gases<00:00:44.850> into<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> small<00:00:45.989> intestine<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.710> then

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
gases into the small intestine and then

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.619 
gases into the small intestine and then
at<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.340> time<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.640> gases<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.180> couldn't

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
at that time the gases that couldn't

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.470 
at that time the gases that couldn't
come<00:00:48.809> out<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.710> sort<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.219> live<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> small

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
come out just sort of live in the small

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.069 
come out just sort of live in the small
intestine<00:00:52.140> where<00:00:52.289> they<00:00:52.800> move<00:00:53.129> down<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
intestine where they move down all the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.420 
intestine where they move down all the
way<00:00:55.230> through<00:00:55.500> twenty<00:00:55.829> or<00:00:55.920> thirty<00:00:56.160> feet<00:00:56.370> of

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
way through twenty or thirty feet of

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.840 
way through twenty or thirty feet of
small<00:00:56.640> intestine<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:58.399> they<00:00:59.399> start<00:00:59.699> releasing

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
small intestine and they start releasing

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.150 
small intestine and they start releasing
different<00:01:00.359> gases<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.649> beautiful<00:01:02.070> a

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
different gases this is beautiful a

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.709 
different gases this is beautiful a
little<00:01:02.399> bit<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.550> hydrogen<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.180> little<00:01:03.539> bit<00:01:03.629> of

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
little bit of hydrogen a little bit of

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.929 
little bit of hydrogen a little bit of
methane<00:01:04.049> not<00:01:04.470> let<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.860> one<00:01:05.040> out<00:01:05.220> no<00:01:05.610> well

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
methane not let that one out no well

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.060 
methane not let that one out no well
it's<00:01:06.180> going<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.630> come<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:06.840> no<00:01:07.439> matter<00:01:07.650> what

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
it's going to come out no matter what

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.130 
it's going to come out no matter what
it's<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> come<00:01:08.700> out<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> colon

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
it's going to come out here in the colon

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.960 
it's going to come out here in the colon
or<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.740> call<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.130> fart<00:01:11.430> factory

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
or what I like to call the fart factory

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.840 
or what I like to call the fart factory
of<00:01:12.180> nature<00:01:12.659> oh<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
of nature oh and it is it is in the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.700 
of nature oh and it is it is in the
colon<00:01:15.270> there<00:01:15.540> are<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> lot<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.840> bacteria<00:01:16.140> that

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
colon there are a lot of bacteria that

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.859 
colon there are a lot of bacteria that
go<00:01:17.040> ahead<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.520> digest<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.509> undigested

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
go ahead and digest the undigested

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.700 
go ahead and digest the undigested
especially<00:01:19.680> carbohydrates<00:01:20.040> some<00:01:20.610> more<00:01:20.790> so

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
especially carbohydrates some more so

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.620 
especially carbohydrates some more so
the<00:01:22.710> food<00:01:22.920> particles<00:01:23.430> go<00:01:23.850> into<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> cells

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the food particles go into the cells

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.749 
the food particles go into the cells
where<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> cell<00:01:25.799> then<00:01:26.009> goes<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.430> starts<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
where the cell then goes and starts a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.160 
where the cell then goes and starts a
digestive<00:01:27.240> process<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.750> they<00:01:27.840> bring<00:01:28.080> out

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
digestive process and they bring out

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.310 
digestive process and they bring out
even<00:01:28.530> more<00:01:28.560> gases<00:01:29.310> methane<00:01:30.320> sulfur

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
even more gases methane sulfur

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.520 
even more gases methane sulfur
containing<00:01:32.540> gases<00:01:33.540> those<00:01:33.840> are<00:01:33.990> very<00:01:34.229> pungent

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
containing gases those are very pungent

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.590 
containing gases those are very pungent
very<00:01:35.130> punchy<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.970> great<00:01:36.180> because<00:01:36.420> we

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
very punchy so this is great because we

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.210 
very punchy so this is great because we
get<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.290> blame<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.710> bacteria

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
get to just blame the bacteria

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.460 
get to just blame the bacteria
absolutely<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:38.970> should<00:01:39.119> blame<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.540> then<00:01:39.869> it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
absolutely we should blame and then it

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.200 
absolutely we should blame and then it
all<00:01:40.590> has<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.860> go<00:01:40.890> somewhere<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.909> has<00:01:42.060> to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
all has to go somewhere so it has to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.179 
all has to go somewhere so it has to
come<00:01:42.240> out<00:01:42.420> through<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.780> colon<00:01:43.229> where<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.979> goes

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
come out through the colon where it goes

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.760 
come out through the colon where it goes
into<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.640> rectum<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.270> anal<00:01:46.170> sphincter<00:01:46.290> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
into the rectum the anal sphincter and

into the rectum the anal sphincter and
then<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.909> determines<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.509> loudness<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
then this determines the loudness and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.980 
then this determines the loudness and
the<00:01:49.320> pitch<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:51.180> finger<00:01:51.600> does<00:01:51.750> absolutely

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the pitch this finger does absolutely

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.620 
the pitch this finger does absolutely
it's<00:01:52.740> very<00:01:52.770> musical<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.420> why<00:01:54.570> some

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
it's very musical so is that why some

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.080 
it's very musical so is that why some
people<00:01:54.930> -<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.649> some<00:01:55.860> people<00:01:55.890> roar

let's<00:01:59.270> go<00:01:59.420> sit<00:01:59.600> back<00:01:59.780> down<00:01:59.930> because<00:02:00.110> I<00:02:00.260> want<00:02:00.410> to

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
let's go sit back down because I want to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.600 
let's go sit back down because I want to
talk<00:02:00.590> about<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:01.040> for<00:02:01.190> a<00:02:01.250> moment<00:02:01.550> and

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
talk about that for a moment and

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.400 
talk about that for a moment and
hopefully<00:02:02.450> everyone<00:02:02.900> understands<00:02:03.290> that

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
hopefully everyone understands that

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.560 
hopefully everyone understands that

particularly<00:02:06.380> fiber<00:02:06.770> fiber<00:02:07.670> is<00:02:07.940> a

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
particularly fiber fiber is a

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.760 
particularly fiber fiber is a
carbohydrate<00:02:08.630> that<00:02:08.660> our<00:02:09.080> bodies<00:02:09.440> can't

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
carbohydrate that our bodies can't

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.130 
carbohydrate that our bodies can't
digest<00:02:10.009> but<00:02:10.490> bacteria<00:02:11.000> they<00:02:11.330> love<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:11.900> it's

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
digest but bacteria they love it so it's

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.800 
digest but bacteria they love it so it's
good<00:02:12.440> for<00:02:12.710> our<00:02:12.740> GI<00:02:13.100> tract<00:02:13.490> but<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.240> bacteria

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
good for our GI tract but the bacteria

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.540 
good for our GI tract but the bacteria
get<00:02:14.990> in<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.200> colon<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.830> they<00:02:16.250> start

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
get in the colon and they start

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.970 
get in the colon and they start
producing<00:02:16.880> some<00:02:17.150> terrible<00:02:17.930> smelling<00:02:18.260> gases

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
producing some terrible smelling gases

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.880 
producing some terrible smelling gases
now<00:02:19.430> that's<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:20.090> hydrogen<00:02:20.720> sulfide<00:02:21.320> as<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.680> gas

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
now that's a hydrogen sulfide as the gas

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.560 
now that's a hydrogen sulfide as the gas

that's a different kind of fart yes that
is<00:02:41.000> butyric<00:02:41.690> acid<00:02:41.890> nothing<00:02:42.890> beautiful<00:02:43.130> about

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
is butyric acid nothing beautiful about

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.480 
is butyric acid nothing beautiful about
the<00:02:43.760> uric<00:02:44.030> acid<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:45.290> find<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:45.650> primarily<00:02:46.070> in

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
the uric acid you find that primarily in

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.870 
the uric acid you find that primarily in
fruits<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.090> have<00:02:47.270> seeds<00:02:47.600> like<00:02:47.870> oranges

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
fruits that have seeds like oranges

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.690 
fruits that have seeds like oranges
grapefruits<00:02:49.880> um<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:51.470> know<00:02:51.590> peaches<00:02:52.160> things

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
grapefruits um you know peaches things

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.840 
grapefruits um you know peaches things
like<00:02:52.880> that<00:02:53.060> but<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:54.020> is<00:02:54.350> not<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:55.459> winner<00:02:55.670> the

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
like that but that is not the winner the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.510 
like that but that is not the winner the
most<00:02:56.030> popular<00:02:56.420> part<00:02:56.660> I<00:02:56.810> think<00:02:56.870> by<00:02:57.709> far<00:02:58.010> the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
most popular part I think by far the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.540 
most popular part I think by far the
Oscar<00:02:58.850> winner<00:02:59.030> is<00:02:59.290> nothing<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:01.160> that's<00:03:01.250> one

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
Oscar winner is nothing and that's one

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.320 
Oscar winner is nothing and that's one
you<00:03:01.700> can<00:03:01.820> light<00:03:02.000> up<00:03:02.030> that's<00:03:02.660> one<00:03:04.239> there's<00:03:05.239> a

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
you can light up that's one there's a

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.550 
you can light up that's one there's a
reason<00:03:05.510> islet<00:03:06.380> natural<00:03:07.250> gas<00:03:08.170> so<00:03:09.170> we<00:03:09.290> will<00:03:09.440> not

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
reason islet natural gas so we will not

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.170 
reason islet natural gas so we will not
like<00:03:09.830> this<00:03:10.010> up<00:03:10.190> here<00:03:10.220> in<00:03:10.430> case<00:03:10.610> we<00:03:10.670> all<00:03:10.850> go<00:03:11.090> up

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
like this up here in case we all go up

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.420 
like this up here in case we all go up
in<00:03:11.300> flames<00:03:11.570> but<00:03:12.170> like<00:03:12.470> we<00:03:12.620> said<00:03:12.650> methane<00:03:13.280> is

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
in flames but like we said methane is

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.570 
in flames but like we said methane is
made<00:03:13.670> you<00:03:14.090> know<00:03:14.209> in<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.480> colon<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.950> does<00:03:16.340> light

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
made you know in the colon it does light

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.130 
made you know in the colon it does light
up<00:03:16.610> I<00:03:16.850> mean<00:03:16.970> some<00:03:17.150> fraternities<00:03:17.600> have<00:03:17.630> blue

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
up I mean some fraternities have blue

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.220 
up I mean some fraternities have blue
flame<00:03:18.440> clubs<00:03:18.830> I<00:03:18.980> don't<00:03:19.220> even<00:03:20.170> I<00:03:21.170> remember

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
flame clubs I don't even I remember

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.860 
flame clubs I don't even I remember
never<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.340> college<00:03:22.670> days<00:03:22.850> yeah<00:03:23.420> don't<00:03:23.690> try<00:03:23.840> it

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
never the college days yeah don't try it

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.960 
never the college days yeah don't try it
at<00:03:24.019> home<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.500> again<00:03:24.830> you<00:03:25.430> fight<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:25.820> get

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
at home and again you fight you get

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.030 
at home and again you fight you get
methane<00:03:26.330> again<00:03:26.600> with<00:03:26.720> lots<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:27.110> protein<00:03:27.590> you

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
methane again with lots of protein you

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.520 
methane again with lots of protein you
know<00:03:28.190> with<00:03:28.400> cauliflower<00:03:28.910> so<00:03:29.360> all<00:03:29.900> of<00:03:30.350> these

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530

you<00:03:35.510> know<00:03:35.600> so<00:03:35.720> you<00:03:35.780> can<00:03:35.900> decrease<00:03:36.290> them

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
you know so you can decrease them

it's part of our make up if you're if

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.590 
it's part of our make up if you're if
you're<00:03:54.080> not<00:03:54.500> passing<00:03:54.799> gas<00:03:55.190> that's<00:03:55.910> probably<00:03:56.510> a

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
you're not passing gas that's probably a

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.810 
you're not passing gas that's probably a
problem<00:03:56.959> now<00:03:57.500> beans<00:03:57.799> being<00:03:58.280> beans<00:03:58.670> are

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
problem now beans being beans are

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.210 
problem now beans being beans are
considered<00:03:59.180> a<00:03:59.269> big<00:03:59.540> gassy<00:04:00.080> food<00:04:00.620> right<00:04:00.920> but

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
considered a big gassy food right but

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.340 
considered a big gassy food right but
one<00:04:01.700> thing<00:04:01.970> one<00:04:02.239> way<00:04:02.390> you<00:04:02.450> can<00:04:02.690> cut<00:04:02.870> down<00:04:03.110> how

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
one thing one way you can cut down how

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.080 
one thing one way you can cut down how
much<00:04:03.470> gas<00:04:03.920> will<00:04:04.130> beans<00:04:04.370> will<00:04:04.519> give<00:04:04.640> you<00:04:04.760> is<00:04:04.910> how

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
much gas will beans will give you is how

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.030 
much gas will beans will give you is how
you<00:04:05.150> cook<00:04:05.540> them<00:04:05.720> if<00:04:05.930> you<00:04:06.110> soak<00:04:06.440> them<00:04:06.620> in<00:04:06.740> water

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
you cook them if you soak them in water

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.309 
you cook them if you soak them in water
for<00:04:07.220> overnight<00:04:07.760> before<00:04:08.300> you<00:04:08.420> cook<00:04:08.660> them<00:04:08.690> that

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
for overnight before you cook them that

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.470 
for overnight before you cook them that
actually<00:04:09.650> leeches<00:04:10.400> out<00:04:10.520> some<00:04:10.760> of<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:11.000> some<00:04:11.450> of

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
actually leeches out some of the some of

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.340 
actually leeches out some of the some of
the<00:04:11.600> sugars<00:04:11.930> in<00:04:12.050> the<00:04:12.140> beans

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
the sugars in the beans

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.740 
the sugars in the beans
the<00:04:12.550> oligosaccharides<00:04:13.550> and<00:04:13.700> which<00:04:14.330> are<00:04:14.540> what

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
the oligosaccharides and which are what

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.040 
the oligosaccharides and which are what
caused<00:04:14.990> the<00:04:15.230> gas<00:04:15.470> so<00:04:16.420> that's<00:04:17.420> one<00:04:17.570> way<00:04:17.690> is<00:04:17.810> so

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.050 
caused the gas so that's one way is so

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.380 
caused the gas so that's one way is so
what<00:04:18.860> you<00:04:18.980> cook<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.310> beans<00:04:19.490> into<00:04:19.820> right<00:04:20.270> I

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
what you cook the beans into right I

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.810 
what you cook the beans into right I
mean<00:04:20.630> refried<00:04:21.260> beans<00:04:21.530> are<00:04:21.770> gonna<00:04:21.890> have<00:04:22.160> gonna

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
mean refried beans are gonna have gonna

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.640 
mean refried beans are gonna have gonna
have<00:04:23.030> a<00:04:23.060> lot<00:04:23.270> of<00:04:23.420> grease<00:04:23.840> you<00:04:24.350> know<00:04:24.470> that

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
have a lot of grease you know that

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.100 
have a lot of grease you know that
fermentable<00:04:25.400> sugars<00:04:25.970> that<00:04:26.360> old<00:04:26.600> butter<00:04:26.840> oh

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
fermentable sugars that old butter oh

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.770 
fermentable sugars that old butter oh
yeah<00:04:27.920> I've<00:04:28.640> never<00:04:28.760> tried<00:04:29.090> this<00:04:29.330> but<00:04:29.540> I've

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
yeah I've never tried this but I've

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.510 
yeah I've never tried this but I've
heard<00:04:30.050> Pete<00:04:30.260> some<00:04:30.440> people<00:04:30.650> use<00:04:30.980> activated

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
heard Pete some people use activated

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.360 
heard Pete some people use activated
charcoal<00:04:32.170> to<00:04:33.170> kind<00:04:33.410> of<00:04:33.470> cut<00:04:33.680> down<00:04:33.920> the<00:04:34.250> amount

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
charcoal to kind of cut down the amount

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.610 
charcoal to kind of cut down the amount
of<00:04:34.520> gas<00:04:34.670> do<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:35.780> think<00:04:36.050> it<00:04:36.140> definitely<00:04:36.470> helps

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
of gas do I think it definitely helps

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.140 
of gas do I think it definitely helps
and<00:04:36.740> if<00:04:36.800> you<00:04:36.830> look<00:04:37.040> at<00:04:37.130> some<00:04:37.310> cultures<00:04:37.760> I<00:04:38.000> mean

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
and if you look at some cultures I mean

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.940 
and if you look at some cultures I mean
they<00:04:38.270> also<00:04:38.420> even<00:04:38.870> used<00:04:39.140> a<00:04:39.440> little<00:04:39.740> bit<00:04:39.830> of

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
they also even used a little bit of

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.130 
they also even used a little bit of
burnt<00:04:40.280> food<00:04:40.520> burnt<00:04:40.940> cows<00:04:41.210> can<00:04:41.450> help<00:04:41.660> some

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
burnt food burnt cows can help some

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.660 
burnt food burnt cows can help some
cultures<00:04:42.500> actually<00:04:42.620> even<00:04:42.980> need<00:04:43.070> you<00:04:43.580> know

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
cultures actually even need you know

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.370 
cultures actually even need you know
matches<00:04:44.150> that<00:04:44.270> they've<00:04:44.450> lit<00:04:44.630> up<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:44.930> it's<00:04:45.140> all

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
matches that they've lit up and it's all

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.710 
matches that they've lit up and it's all
because<00:04:45.740> of<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.980> charcoal<00:04:46.730> okay<00:04:47.150> interesting

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
because of the charcoal okay interesting

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.020 
because of the charcoal okay interesting
