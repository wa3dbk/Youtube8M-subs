day<00:00:22.599> outside<00:00:22.990> very<00:00:23.200> overcast<00:00:23.619> and<00:00:23.890> a<00:00:23.919> little

day outside very overcast and a little
bit<00:00:24.189> rainy<00:00:24.340> so<00:00:24.789> I<00:00:24.820> decided<00:00:25.180> it<00:00:25.390> would<00:00:25.539> be<00:00:25.570> a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
bit rainy so I decided it would be a

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.439 
bit rainy so I decided it would be a
good<00:00:26.199> time<00:00:26.470> to<00:00:26.740> change<00:00:27.130> things<00:00:27.340> over<00:00:27.640> as<00:00:28.329> you

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
good time to change things over as you

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.490 
good time to change things over as you
can<00:00:28.570> see<00:00:28.689> I<00:00:28.720> have<00:00:28.840> slightly<00:00:29.140> changed<00:00:29.410> the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
can see I have slightly changed the

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.100 
can see I have slightly changed the
track<00:00:29.710> plan<00:00:29.949> because<00:00:30.340> the<00:00:31.240> nice<00:00:31.660> thing<00:00:31.900> about

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
track plan because the nice thing about

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.740 
track plan because the nice thing about
my<00:00:32.460> English<00:00:33.460> stock<00:00:33.790> is<00:00:33.940> that<00:00:34.120> all<00:00:34.330> of<00:00:34.480> it<00:00:34.570> is

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
my English stock is that all of it is

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.869 
my English stock is that all of it is
now<00:00:34.960> digital<00:00:35.589> so<00:00:35.920> I<00:00:35.949> can<00:00:36.220> set<00:00:36.550> up<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:36.730> layout

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
now digital so I can set up the layout

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.750 
now digital so I can set up the layout
slightly<00:00:37.300> differently<00:00:37.629> I<00:00:37.690> can<00:00:37.960> use<00:00:38.339> I<00:00:39.339> can<00:00:39.730> use

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
slightly differently I can use I can use

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.920 
slightly differently I can use I can use
this<00:00:40.030> cross<00:00:40.239> over<00:00:40.390> here

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
this cross over here

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.509 
this cross over here
which<00:00:41.140> frees<00:00:41.440> up<00:00:41.470> a<00:00:41.680> couple<00:00:41.860> of<00:00:41.980> other<00:00:42.129> extra

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519

points and frees up quite a lot of
straight<00:00:44.739> track<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:45.309> it<00:00:45.400> means<00:00:45.519> I<00:00:45.610> can<00:00:45.760> just

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:45.909 
straight track and it means I can just

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:47.310

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.660 
bit smarter here's our fantastic little
class<00:01:32.050> one<00:01:32.230> five<00:01:32.440> three<00:01:32.470> these<00:01:33.340> are

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
class one five three these are

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.140 
class one five three these are
absolutely<00:01:34.210> perfect<00:01:34.450> for<00:01:34.930> layouts<00:01:35.860> like<00:01:35.950> this

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
absolutely perfect for layouts like this

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.130 
absolutely perfect for layouts like this
and<00:01:37.150> they<00:01:37.330> can<00:01:37.390> go<00:01:37.690> just<00:01:37.900> about<00:01:37.990> anywhere

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
and they can go just about anywhere

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
don't require a lot of styling space so

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.700 
don't require a lot of styling space so
you<00:01:40.030> can<00:01:40.150> see<00:01:40.300> that<00:01:40.480> little<00:01:40.630> Bay<00:01:41.050> platform<00:01:41.260> is
