I<00:01:43.750> was<00:01:44.440> wondering<00:01:44.950> aloud<00:01:45.070> in<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:45.490> last<00:01:45.700> video

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
I was wondering aloud in the last video

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.090 
I was wondering aloud in the last video
if<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.479> preview<00:01:46.900> pack<00:01:47.080> has<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.410> same<00:01:47.650> cards

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
if the preview pack has the same cards

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.070 
if the preview pack has the same cards
in<00:01:48.220> it<00:01:48.369> I<00:01:48.580> have<00:01:49.540> to<00:01:49.690> see

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
in it I have to see

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.710 
in it I have to see
so<00:01:50.590> there's<00:01:51.010> Lily<00:01:51.490> pub<00:01:53.100> patrat<00:01:55.740> purloined

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
so there's Lily pub patrat purloined

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.440 
so there's Lily pub patrat purloined
dove<00:01:58.720> and<00:02:00.330> Sandile

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
dove and Sandile

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.359 
dove and Sandile
so<00:02:01.900> I<00:02:01.930> think<00:02:02.020> that's<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.440> same<00:02:02.650> five<00:02:02.890> cards

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
so I think that's the same five cards

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.710 
so I think that's the same five cards
just<00:02:03.520> a<00:02:03.580> little<00:02:03.820> different<00:02:04.300> order<00:02:05.760> okay<00:02:06.760> so
