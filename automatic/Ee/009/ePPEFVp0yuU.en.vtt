00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.910
 Yes 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.619
 here it is finally would be tempted to say 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:42.670
 the big suzuki roadster derived from the gsx 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.979
 r1000 the gsx s1000 then this is not the 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.560
 more powerful of the category develops 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.840
 indeed 145 horses the same power 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.030
 than the z 1000 but a little less 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.869
 that the s 1000 r that did 160 and that the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.000
 super duke 12,90 which makes 180 but 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.509
 suzuki promises us a lot of pleasure 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.659
 with its 4 cylinders thus derived from 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.310
 the hypersportive of 2005 2007 a 4 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.539
 cylinders renowned for his torque 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.170
 it's not the most 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:13.630
 technological category because besides 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.920
 traction control and bs we do not have 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.880
 driving mode no data available 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.030
 electronic 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.410
 but for precisely July totally 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.170
 of its 4 cylinders 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.810
 suzuki promises us a cycle part very 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.180
 agile very handy taking for base a 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.940
 completely new aluminum frame 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.940
 and the swing arm of the GSR 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.440
 he 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.019
 so we just finished our run on 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.390
 still did 240 km today 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.920
 in the region of alicante comes out of the bag and 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.780
 wet first point we will 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.310
 pick up on the group on suzuki bass 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.500
 and its ergonomics that is really good 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.290
 makes the driving position is very 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.150
 nice the saddle is comfortable for 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.010
 hundred the finesse precisely high of the 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.569
 tank which is dug enough which 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.090
 strengthens the control the legs are not 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.700
 not too folded the handlebar is rather 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.439
 place low enough and relatively low 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.780
 wide which also reinforces the feeling 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:56.209
 of mastery have the levers are no 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.680
 adjustable but I'm fine and 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.480
 then I have very good visibility on 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.879
 the instrumentation which is very pleasant 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.639
 besides highlights of the new 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.769
 suzuki his engine already good for his 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.870
 flexibility or to roll on the sixth 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.299
 report under the 2000 rpm 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.470
 they accept relatively nicely 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.370
 without much complaining 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.840
 and then after we feel an engine that 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.259
 is still quite busy at 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.180
 mid-speed between 5000 and 7000 turns it is 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:25.460
 reveals it becomes more explosive and at 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.800
 beyond 7000 500 rpm until its 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.919
 red area that starts at 11 miles 5 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.449
 he is really amazing 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.970
 the mechanical atmosphere is very pleasant 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.599
 a this engine really has a very loud noise 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.060
 rocky 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:40.190
 the box is rossi when we are towards 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.659
 5000 rpm is very nice 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.370
 said when we get to this northern area 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:45.889
 not without some vibrations a few 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.349
 tingling at the level of the seat and 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.510
 handles and then what is it 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:52.550
 blame it's the little ones to blow to 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.470
 the go-around that can be pretty 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.330
 unpleasant in the long run in town 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.930
 appreciates the maneuverability of the new 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.250
 suzuki 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.169
 she also has a very good radius of 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.220
 steering and then when driving a 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.840
 little more dynamically 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.849
 we realize that the cycle part 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.849
 is very serious very solid it's a 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:10.550
 homogeneous motorcycle neutral entries in 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.060
 turns are very easy at the 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.159
 placement 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.599
 there is a match a cap that is pretty 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:18.669
 impressive we rolled anyway 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.669
 strong enough it's very convincing 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.630
 so on the other hand we love a little 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.890
 little less low and his braking the 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.240
 biting you have to go get it when 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.670
 even you have to hit hard in the brakes 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.400
 then the drop is still pretty 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.620
 sensitive rather uncomfortable with 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.380
 back on the handlebars at the back on 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.300
 does not have a good feeling just that 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.910
 it's a bit of a pity 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.250
 however his traction control is 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.020
 very well done very well set it 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.850
 is adjustable on three levels you can 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.810
 also disconnect it unlike 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.490
 the bay is what we can not 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.350
 disconnect 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.040
 I drove on mode 2 when they 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.920
 go into action 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.540
 it does not completely cut the momentum and 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.920
 that's really reassuring 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.050
 a last negative point is the 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.640
 practice of the duo allowed himself a motorcycle 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.810
 Gaullists in you see it with the 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.090
 rear seat that is really 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.520
 minimalist is not a lot of 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.890
 maintenance possibilities it's not 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.410
 terrible conclusion i would say that this 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.420
 machine is still very nice 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.610
 we expected it's a four 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.990
 cylinders classic 2000 centimeters 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.780
 cubes that is still a little bit 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.760
 easier in my opinion than a z 1000 per 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.620
 example it does not revolutionize the 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.420
 segment but it is very nice 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.210
 it will be available in the concessions 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:36.350
 of those who from the month of May in 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:39.360
 blue in red and gray for 11 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.350
 1999 euros for the standard version and 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.840
 then for the model we have 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:46.230
 tried today with the bs it will take 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.120
 count 12 1499 euros and know everything 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.940
 all the details of our ride I 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.720
 invite you to meet us on motorcycle 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:56.120
 station.com and then I tell you to 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.120
 very soon for a next lease trial 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.890
 the party
