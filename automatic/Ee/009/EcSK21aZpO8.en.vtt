thighs it's just the opposite on sumos
right<00:00:25.349> inside<00:00:25.730> so<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:27.269> should<00:00:27.509> be<00:00:27.679> wherever

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:28.679 
right inside so it should be wherever

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.919 
right inside so it should be wherever
your<00:00:29.220> stance<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:30.029> should<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.300> right

your stance is it should be right
outside<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:33.200> second<00:00:34.200> thing<00:00:34.470> this<00:00:35.250> is

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
outside of that second thing this is

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.420 
outside of that second thing this is
really<00:00:36.240> critical<00:00:36.559> this<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.770> actually<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
really critical this is actually the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.520 
really critical this is actually the
fault<00:00:38.760> that's<00:00:39.030> happening<00:00:39.539> when<00:00:40.020> people<00:00:40.050> raise

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
fault that's happening when people raise

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.400 
fault that's happening when people raise
their<00:00:40.559> hips<00:00:40.890> too<00:00:41.070> fast<00:00:41.840> what's<00:00:42.840> causing<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
their hips too fast what's causing it

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.040 
their hips too fast what's causing it
again<00:00:43.920> they<00:00:44.579> think<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.969> deadlift<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.600> pull

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
again they think a deadlift is a pull

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.920 
again they think a deadlift is a pull
not<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> push<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:47.100> proper<00:00:47.789> deadlift<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> push

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
not a push a proper deadlift is a push

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.930 
not a push a proper deadlift is a push
against<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.379> ground<00:00:49.620> not<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> pull<00:00:50.760> with<00:00:50.910> your

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
against the ground not a pull with your

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.240 
against the ground not a pull with your
back<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.020> really<00:00:55.680> important<00:00:56.219> thing

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
back so what is a really important thing

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.750 
back so what is a really important thing
to<00:00:56.519> do<00:00:57.590> to<00:00:58.590> make<00:00:58.739> sure<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.160> don't<00:00:59.340> end<00:00:59.579> up<00:00:59.670> in

torso<00:02:14.230> flexion<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.740> that<00:02:14.860> version<00:02:15.220> of<00:02:15.310> my

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
torso flexion in that version of my

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.630 
torso flexion in that version of my
deadlift<00:02:15.959> but<00:02:18.180> what's<00:02:19.180> actually<00:02:19.390> happening

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
deadlift but what's actually happening

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.210 
deadlift but what's actually happening
is<00:02:21.640> I'm<00:02:21.850> putting<00:02:22.060> force<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.470> bar<00:02:23.650> before<00:02:23.950> I

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
is I'm putting force to the bar before I

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.650 
is I'm putting force to the bar before I
ever<00:02:24.550> make<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.450> cue<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:25.690> move<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:28.150> as<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.480> can

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
ever make the cue to move so as you can

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.809 
ever make the cue to move so as you can
see<00:02:28.840> here<00:02:29.080> there<00:02:29.830> actually<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.430> little<00:02:30.730> bit

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
see here there actually is a little bit

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.990 
see here there actually is a little bit
of<00:02:30.910> play<00:02:31.090> in<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.270> bar<00:02:31.450> this<00:02:31.660> is<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.870> stiffer

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
of play in the bar this is a stiffer

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.640 
of play in the bar this is a stiffer
powerlifting<00:02:34.000> bar<00:02:34.239> Olympic<00:02:35.200> bars<00:02:35.380> are<00:02:35.560> gonna

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
powerlifting bar Olympic bars are gonna

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.170 
powerlifting bar Olympic bars are gonna
have<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:35.950> lot<00:02:36.160> more<00:02:36.190> bends<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:36.970> you're<00:02:37.090> gonna

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
have a lot more bends so you're gonna

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.610 
have a lot more bends so you're gonna
need<00:02:37.270> to<00:02:37.450> pull<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.750> tension<00:02:37.959> out<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.200> lot<00:02:38.410> more

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
need to pull the tension out a lot more

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.330 
need to pull the tension out a lot more
on<00:02:38.739> those<00:02:39.120> or<00:02:40.120> like<00:02:40.530> Texas<00:02:41.530> deadlift<00:02:41.890> bars<00:02:42.100> and

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
on those or like Texas deadlift bars and

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.420 
on those or like Texas deadlift bars and
stuff<00:02:42.430> like<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:44.110> what<00:02:45.040> are<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:45.220> trying

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
to do again you're trying to put tension

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.740 
to do again you're trying to put tension
to<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.820> bar<00:02:49.030> if<00:02:49.840> there's<00:02:50.110> slack<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.800> bar

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
to the bar if there's slack in the bar

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.690 
to the bar if there's slack in the bar
the<00:02:52.769> weight<00:02:53.769> is<00:02:53.950> going<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.190> pull<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.489> slack

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
the weight is going to pull the slack

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.229 
the weight is going to pull the slack
out<00:02:54.760> of<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.300> so<00:02:56.050> what<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.530> mean<00:02:56.769> by<00:02:56.980> that<00:02:57.010> is<00:02:57.400> you

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
out of you so what I mean by that is you

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.860 
out of you so what I mean by that is you
can<00:02:58.269> be<00:02:58.600> really<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:01.150> can<00:03:01.330> have<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.780> most

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
can be really you can have the most

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.140 
can be really you can have the most
perfect<00:03:02.440> starting<00:03:02.860> position<00:03:03.280> ever<00:03:03.430> but<00:03:04.060> you

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
perfect starting position ever but you

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.310 
perfect starting position ever but you
don't<00:03:04.329> pull<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.510> slack<00:03:04.750> out<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.049> bar<00:03:05.200> you

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
don't pull the slack out of the bar you

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.539 
don't pull the slack out of the bar you
just<00:03:05.350> immediately<00:03:05.860> try<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.040> grip<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.400> rip

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
just immediately try to grip and rip

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.990 
just immediately try to grip and rip
what<00:03:07.239> happens<00:03:07.600> is<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.500> now<00:03:08.650> pulls<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.190> it

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
what happens is it now pulls you it

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.550 
what happens is it now pulls you it
pulls<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:10.420> slack<00:03:10.540> out<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:10.870> your<00:03:11.019> spine

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
pulls the slack out of your spine

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.050 
pulls the slack out of your spine
so<00:03:11.860> either<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.280> pull<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.579> slack<00:03:12.760> out<00:03:12.910> of<00:03:12.970> the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
so either you pull the slack out of the

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.699 
so either you pull the slack out of the
bar<00:03:13.269> or<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.720> bar<00:03:13.930> pulls<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.230> slack<00:03:14.350> out<00:03:14.620> of

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
bar or the bar pulls the slack out of

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.610 
bar or the bar pulls the slack out of
you<00:03:15.239> so<00:03:16.239> again<00:03:16.540> what's<00:03:16.840> gonna<00:03:16.989> happen<00:03:17.440> there

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
you so again what's gonna happen there

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.800 
you so again what's gonna happen there
you're<00:03:18.160> gonna<00:03:18.310> end<00:03:18.549> up<00:03:18.760> hunched<00:03:19.299> over<00:03:19.450> and

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
you're gonna end up hunched over and

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.560 
you're gonna end up hunched over and
stuck<00:03:20.410> at<00:03:20.560> lockout<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.250> also<00:03:22.209> at<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.480> higher

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
stuck at lockout and also at a higher

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.860 
stuck at lockout and also at a higher
risk<00:03:22.959> for<00:03:23.290> a<00:03:23.590> disc<00:03:23.950> injury<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:25.360> unfortunately

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
risk for a disc injury and unfortunately

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.680 
risk for a disc injury and unfortunately
I'm<00:03:26.079> far<00:03:26.739> too<00:03:26.920> familiar<00:03:27.070> with<00:03:27.340> that<00:03:27.690> so

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
I'm far too familiar with that so

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.699 
I'm far too familiar with that so
so<00:03:31.690> let's<00:03:31.930> um<00:03:32.170> let's<00:03:32.730> review<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:33.880> again

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
so let's um let's review it again

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.340 
so let's um let's review it again
and<00:03:35.709> there's<00:03:36.489> a<00:03:36.549> couple<00:03:36.730> things<00:03:36.959> I'll<00:03:37.959> try<00:03:38.290> to

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
and there's a couple things I'll try to

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.620 
and there's a couple things I'll try to
go<00:03:38.560> over<00:03:38.860> right<00:03:39.250> before<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.670> initiate<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.390> move

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
go over right before I initiate the move

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.509 
go over right before I initiate the move
the<00:03:40.810> deadlift<00:03:41.970> so<00:03:42.970> again<00:03:43.299> my<00:03:43.930> stance<00:03:44.320> is<00:03:44.590> with

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
the deadlift so again my stance is with

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.039 
the deadlift so again my stance is with
the<00:03:45.670> resistance<00:03:46.090> as<00:03:46.329> close<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.840> me<00:03:46.930> as

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
the resistance as close to me as

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.850 
the resistance as close to me as
possible<00:03:47.140> I'm<00:03:48.100> going<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.579> grip<00:03:48.820> by<00:03:49.810> bending<00:03:50.680> at

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
possible I'm going to grip by bending at

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.550 
possible I'm going to grip by bending at
my<00:03:51.010> torso<00:03:51.310> down<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.180> bar<00:03:52.390> right<00:03:53.049> outside

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
my torso down to the bar right outside

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.310 
my torso down to the bar right outside
of<00:03:53.620> my<00:03:53.799> legs<00:03:54.209> now<00:03:55.209> from<00:03:55.600> this<00:03:55.750> position<00:03:55.930> like

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
of my legs now from this position like

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.660 
of my legs now from this position like
how<00:03:56.769> do<00:03:56.829> I<00:03:56.950> know<00:03:57.359> where<00:03:58.359> the<00:03:59.160> optimal<00:04:00.160> point<00:04:00.430> of

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
how do I know where the optimal point of

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.400 
how do I know where the optimal point of
hip<00:04:01.269> dip<00:04:01.510> I<00:04:01.630> need<00:04:01.810> to<00:04:01.900> have<00:04:02.079> his<00:04:03.630> well<00:04:04.630> for<00:04:04.989> me<00:04:05.109> I

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
hip dip I need to have his well for me I

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.979 
hip dip I need to have his well for me I
mean<00:04:06.160> that's<00:04:06.549> that's<00:04:06.910> partly<00:04:07.420> practice

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
mean that's that's partly practice

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.750 
mean that's that's partly practice
you're<00:04:08.319> gonna<00:04:08.470> find<00:04:08.769> that

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
you're gonna find that

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.700 
you're gonna find that
but<00:04:10.150> what<00:04:10.330> dose<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:11.050> how<00:04:11.200> you're<00:04:11.380> gonna<00:04:11.470> see

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
but what dose and how you're gonna see

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.980 
but what dose and how you're gonna see
that<00:04:11.860> is<00:04:12.070> so<00:04:12.610> obviously<00:04:13.060> if<00:04:13.240> I<00:04:13.360> dip<00:04:13.570> too<00:04:13.750> far

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
that is so obviously if I dip too far

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.949 
that is so obviously if I dip too far
look<00:04:14.200> what's<00:04:14.350> happening<00:04:14.740> to<00:04:14.980> my<00:04:15.460> my<00:04:15.850> shin<00:04:16.480> my

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
look what's happening to my my shin my

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.660 
look what's happening to my my shin my
shin<00:04:17.170> angle<00:04:17.500> it's<00:04:17.980> now<00:04:18.250> becoming<00:04:18.880> more<00:04:19.239> skewed

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
shin angle it's now becoming more skewed

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.850 
shin angle it's now becoming more skewed
further<00:04:21.670> away<00:04:21.970> from<00:04:22.000> ninety<00:04:22.660> degrees

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
further away from ninety degrees

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.330 
further away from ninety degrees
so<00:04:24.580> you're<00:04:25.270> gonna<00:04:25.390> see<00:04:25.750> that<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:26.950> stay<00:04:27.160> at

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
so you're gonna see that to stay at

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.220 
so you're gonna see that to stay at
ninety

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
ninety

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.290 
ninety
you<00:04:29.230> can<00:04:29.410> only<00:04:29.620> dip<00:04:29.800> so<00:04:29.980> far<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:30.580> also<00:04:31.120> the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
you can only dip so far and also the

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.300 
you can only dip so far and also the
bigger<00:04:31.600> thing<00:04:31.870> too<00:04:32.080> is<00:04:32.290> the<00:04:32.470> tension<00:04:32.740> point<00:04:33.130> on

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
bigger thing too is the tension point on

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.370 
bigger thing too is the tension point on
the<00:04:33.460> bar<00:04:33.670> so<00:04:34.390> you're<00:04:34.540> gonna<00:04:34.630> find<00:04:34.960> if<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.200> dip

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
the bar so you're gonna find if you dip

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.930 
the bar so you're gonna find if you dip
too<00:04:35.560> low<00:04:35.710> there's<00:04:35.950> no<00:04:36.070> longer<00:04:36.310> tension<00:04:36.760> on<00:04:36.850> the

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
too low there's no longer tension on the

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.970 
too low there's no longer tension on the
on<00:04:37.090> your<00:04:37.120> on<00:04:37.420> the<00:04:37.600> bar<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:38.050> tensions<00:04:38.590> now<00:04:38.770> on

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
on your on the bar the tensions now on

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
going to hear the noise of the bar

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.250 
going to hear the noise of the bar
coming<00:04:59.320> up<00:04:59.610> without<00:05:00.610> me<00:05:00.790> even<00:05:00.910> pulling<00:05:01.240> so<00:05:01.990> I

coming up without me even pulling so I

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.800 
coming up without me even pulling so I
have<00:05:02.500> my<00:05:02.680> grip<00:05:02.980> and<00:05:03.360> now<00:05:04.360> I'm<00:05:04.510> just<00:05:04.570> gonna

shift my weight back to my heels and

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.090 
shift my weight back to my heels and
slowly<00:05:08.620> go<00:05:09.220> back<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:10.930> also<00:05:11.290> I'm<00:05:11.680> gonna<00:05:11.800> lock

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
slowly go back and also I'm gonna lock

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.740 
slowly go back and also I'm gonna lock
I'm<00:05:12.310> gonna<00:05:12.490> start<00:05:12.760> putting<00:05:12.940> tension<00:05:13.180> bar<00:05:13.510> with

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
I'm gonna start putting tension bar with

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.000 
I'm gonna start putting tension bar with
with<00:05:14.050> my<00:05:14.340> with<00:05:15.340> my<00:05:15.520> um<00:05:15.820> my<00:05:16.180> rhomboid<00:05:16.870> and<00:05:17.260> my

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
with my with my um my rhomboid and my

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.420 
with my with my um my rhomboid and my
traps

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
traps

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:29.210 
traps
I<00:05:24.570> guess<00:05:25.570> the<00:05:25.780> noise<00:05:26.080> wasn't<00:05:26.590> as<00:05:26.680> clear<00:05:26.980> there

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.010 

so<00:05:30.220> that's<00:05:30.430> a<00:05:30.520> really<00:05:30.700> important<00:05:31.240> thing<00:05:31.270> with

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
so that's a really important thing with

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.640 
so that's a really important thing with
the<00:05:32.200> conventional<00:05:33.100> deadlift<00:05:33.460> is<00:05:34.030> uh<00:05:34.650> pulling

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
the conventional deadlift is uh pulling

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.250 
the conventional deadlift is uh pulling
the<00:05:35.740> slack<00:05:35.950> out<00:05:36.130> of<00:05:36.190> the<00:05:36.310> bar<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:37.870> other<00:05:37.900> way

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
the slack out of the bar the other way

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.320 
the slack out of the bar the other way
to<00:05:38.320> do<00:05:38.530> it<00:05:38.880> there's<00:05:39.880> actually<00:05:40.150> a<00:05:40.210> couple

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
to do it there's actually a couple

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.170 
to do it there's actually a couple
different<00:05:40.720> variations<00:05:41.230> some<00:05:41.980> people<00:05:42.310> like

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
different variations some people like

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.730 
different variations some people like
you'll<00:05:43.360> see<00:05:43.540> Magnus<00:05:44.050> I<00:05:46.560> Cameron<00:05:47.560> what<00:05:47.650> his

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
you'll see Magnus I Cameron what his

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.870 
you'll see Magnus I Cameron what his
name<00:05:47.860> is<00:05:48.010> the<00:05:48.040> guy<00:05:48.190> who<00:05:48.250> pulled<00:05:48.460> a<00:05:48.520> thousand

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
name is the guy who pulled a thousand

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.260 
name is the guy who pulled a thousand
pounds<00:05:49.980> what<00:05:50.980> does<00:05:51.100> he<00:05:51.310> do<00:05:51.490> for<00:05:51.520> his<00:05:51.820> Q<00:05:52.090> and

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
pounds what does he do for his Q and

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.360 
pounds what does he do for his Q and
this<00:05:52.360> is<00:05:52.419> another<00:05:52.750> way<00:05:52.960> actually<00:05:53.230> to<00:05:54.070> get<00:05:54.250> the

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
this is another way actually to get the

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.070 
this is another way actually to get the
bar<00:05:54.580> close<00:05:54.850> in<00:05:55.060> you<00:05:55.210> because<00:05:55.419> not<00:05:55.570> everybody

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
bar close in you because not everybody

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.040 
bar close in you because not everybody
can<00:05:56.290> comfortably<00:05:56.880> get<00:05:57.880> into<00:05:58.090> this<00:05:58.210> this

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
can comfortably get into this this

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.110 
can comfortably get into this this
position<00:05:59.590> where<00:05:59.770> their<00:06:00.430> shins<00:06:00.940> are

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
position where their shins are

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.240 
position where their shins are
perpendicular<00:06:01.690> to<00:06:01.720> the<00:06:01.870> floor<00:06:02.110> so<00:06:03.040> they'll

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
perpendicular to the floor so they'll

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.650 
perpendicular to the floor so they'll
actually<00:06:03.430> roll<00:06:04.150> the<00:06:04.390> bar<00:06:04.570> into<00:06:04.960> them<00:06:06.660> again

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
actually roll the bar into them again

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.800 
actually roll the bar into them again
anything<00:06:08.560> is<00:06:08.890> better<00:06:09.070> than<00:06:09.450> kicking<00:06:10.450> the<00:06:10.660> bar

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
anything is better than kicking the bar

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.040 
anything is better than kicking the bar
out<00:06:10.960> away<00:06:11.169> from<00:06:11.200> you<00:06:11.500> that's<00:06:11.950> a<00:06:12.070> major<00:06:12.250> problem

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
out away from you that's a major problem

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.010 
out away from you that's a major problem
so<00:06:14.370> there's<00:06:15.370> there's<00:06:15.790> two<00:06:15.850> ways<00:06:16.180> you<00:06:16.210> can<00:06:16.600> you

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
so there's there's two ways you can you

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.480 
so there's there's two ways you can you
can<00:06:17.169> pack<00:06:17.440> your<00:06:17.470> lap<00:06:17.800> so<00:06:18.039> you<00:06:18.100> can<00:06:18.250> use<00:06:18.370> the

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
can pack your lap so you can use the

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.659 
can pack your lap so you can use the
barred<00:06:18.700> pack<00:06:18.970> your<00:06:19.180> lats<00:06:19.360> which<00:06:19.630> is

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 
barred pack your lats which is

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.580 
barred pack your lats which is
right<00:06:21.360> there<00:06:21.569> you're<00:06:21.750> wedging<00:06:21.930> yourself<00:06:22.379> in

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
right there you're wedging yourself in

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.740 
right there you're wedging yourself in
and<00:06:23.129> again<00:06:23.370> you<00:06:23.460> can<00:06:23.610> hear<00:06:23.759> that<00:06:23.879> noise<00:06:24.060> that's

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
and again you can hear that noise that's

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.390 
and again you can hear that noise that's
that<00:06:25.229> means<00:06:25.439> I'm<00:06:25.590> putting<00:06:25.860> the<00:06:25.919> tension<00:06:26.280> to

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
that means I'm putting the tension to

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.730 
that means I'm putting the tension to
the<00:06:26.490> bar<00:06:26.669> where<00:06:26.849> it<00:06:26.909> should<00:06:27.180> be<00:06:27.330> or<00:06:28.050> you<00:06:28.530> can

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
the bar where it should be or you can

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.070 
the bar where it should be or you can
roll<00:06:29.370> the<00:06:29.520> bar<00:06:29.699> into<00:06:30.000> you<00:06:30.120> which<00:06:30.689> you'll<00:06:30.900> see

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
roll the bar into you which you'll see

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.990 
roll the bar into you which you'll see
some<00:06:31.289> people<00:06:31.439> do<00:06:31.740> what<00:06:32.400> does<00:06:32.460> it<00:06:32.520> allow<00:06:32.789> you<00:06:32.849> to

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
some people do what does it allow you to

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.089 
some people do what does it allow you to
do<00:06:33.180> it<00:06:33.419> allows<00:06:33.629> you<00:06:33.840> to<00:06:34.050> shift<00:06:34.800> your<00:06:34.949> weight

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:35.099 
do it allows you to shift your weight

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:37.179 
do it allows you to shift your weight
back<00:06:35.430> on<00:06:35.610> your<00:06:35.789> heels<00:06:36.000> and<00:06:36.180> keep<00:06:36.389> stability

00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:37.189 
back on your heels and keep stability

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:40.580 
back on your heels and keep stability
which<00:06:38.189> is<00:06:38.219> difficult<00:06:38.789> to<00:06:38.909> do<00:06:39.060> for<00:06:40.050> some<00:06:40.259> people

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
which is difficult to do for some people

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.179 
which is difficult to do for some people
again<00:06:40.889> because<00:06:40.919> that<00:06:41.879> kind<00:06:42.120> of<00:06:42.180> is<00:06:42.360> a<00:06:42.389> point<00:06:42.840> of

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:43.189 
again because that kind of is a point of

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:47.080 
again because that kind of is a point of
instability<00:06:44.189> you're<00:06:44.310> trying<00:06:44.550> to<00:06:44.610> take<00:06:45.229> the

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
instability you're trying to take the

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.550 
instability you're trying to take the
your<00:06:48.090> weight<00:06:48.360> your<00:06:48.569> own<00:06:48.719> weight<00:06:48.930> off<00:06:49.199> of<00:06:49.259> your

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
your weight your own weight off of your

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.249 
your weight your own weight off of your
toes<00:06:49.919> and<00:06:50.340> more<00:06:50.610> back<00:06:50.819> onto<00:06:51.120> the<00:06:51.360> back<00:06:51.840> of<00:06:51.870> or

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259 
toes and more back onto the back of or

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:54.619 
toes and more back onto the back of or
middle<00:06:52.770> of<00:06:52.830> your<00:06:52.919> foot<00:06:53.159> again<00:06:53.909> think<00:06:54.240> about<00:06:54.330> it

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:54.629 
middle of your foot again think about it

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:58.909 
middle of your foot again think about it
if<00:06:54.870> you<00:06:55.590> are<00:06:56.090> in<00:06:57.090> the<00:06:57.240> right<00:06:57.360> position<00:06:57.870> and<00:06:58.080> you

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 
if you are in the right position and you

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.800 
if you are in the right position and you
look<00:06:59.099> at<00:06:59.250> your<00:06:59.400> shin<00:06:59.669> and<00:06:59.909> you<00:06:59.969> produce<00:07:00.270> force

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
look at your shin and you produce force

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.149 
look at your shin and you produce force
where<00:07:01.469> are<00:07:01.590> you<00:07:01.710> going<00:07:01.830> to<00:07:01.889> be<00:07:01.949> pushing

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:02.159 
where are you going to be pushing

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:04.309 
where are you going to be pushing
through<00:07:02.490> if<00:07:03.180> your<00:07:03.419> shins<00:07:03.659> in<00:07:03.779> this<00:07:03.900> position

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 
through if your shins in this position

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:06.350 
through if your shins in this position
you<00:07:04.409> have<00:07:04.650> to<00:07:04.680> be<00:07:04.830> pushing<00:07:05.069> from<00:07:05.400> here<00:07:05.669> now<00:07:06.180> if

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 
you have to be pushing from here now if

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.179 
you have to be pushing from here now if
you're<00:07:06.539> up<00:07:06.659> here<00:07:06.900> you<00:07:07.349> have<00:07:07.590> to<00:07:07.710> be<00:07:07.800> pushing

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:08.189 
you're up here you have to be pushing

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:10.070 
you're up here you have to be pushing
through<00:07:08.310> here<00:07:08.550> so<00:07:08.759> where's<00:07:09.360> the<00:07:09.539> motive<00:07:09.870> for

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
through here so where's the motive for

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.089 
through here so where's the motive for
it's<00:07:10.199> going<00:07:10.319> to<00:07:10.409> be<00:07:10.469> where<00:07:10.710> is<00:07:10.800> it<00:07:10.889> going<00:07:11.039> to

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:11.099 
it's going to be where is it going to

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:13.850 
it's going to be where is it going to
move<00:07:11.639> you<00:07:11.879> if<00:07:12.000> you<00:07:12.120> push<00:07:12.330> force<00:07:12.629> with<00:07:13.500> too<00:07:13.680> much

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
move you if you push force with too much

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.769 
move you if you push force with too much
with<00:07:14.159> the<00:07:14.250> wrong<00:07:14.430> angle<00:07:14.669> it's<00:07:15.419> going<00:07:15.449> to<00:07:15.629> push

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:15.779 
with the wrong angle it's going to push

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:18.200 
with the wrong angle it's going to push
me<00:07:15.930> this<00:07:16.050> way<00:07:16.129> so<00:07:17.129> what<00:07:17.729> does<00:07:17.819> that<00:07:17.969> mean<00:07:18.150> is

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.210 
me this way so what does that mean is

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.119 
me this way so what does that mean is
going<00:07:18.300> to<00:07:18.389> happen<00:07:18.719> well<00:07:19.289> I'm<00:07:19.469> really<00:07:19.770> unstable

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:20.129 
going to happen well I'm really unstable

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:21.860 
going to happen well I'm really unstable
now<00:07:20.520> and<00:07:20.729> what's<00:07:20.909> gonna<00:07:21.120> have<00:07:21.270> to<00:07:21.389> make<00:07:21.539> up<00:07:21.689> for

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:21.870 
now and what's gonna have to make up for

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.469 
now and what's gonna have to make up for
that<00:07:22.020> my<00:07:22.500> back<00:07:22.819> if<00:07:23.819> you're<00:07:24.029> too<00:07:24.180> far<00:07:24.419> back

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 
that my back if you're too far back

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:27.469 
that my back if you're too far back
which<00:07:25.289> usually<00:07:25.500> doesn't<00:07:25.860> happen<00:07:26.449> well<00:07:27.449> it

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 
which usually doesn't happen well it

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:29.209 
which usually doesn't happen well it
does<00:07:27.719> happen<00:07:28.080> but<00:07:28.110> when<00:07:28.500> people<00:07:28.740> miss<00:07:28.889> a<00:07:28.919> lift

00:07:29.209 --> 00:07:29.219 
does happen but when people miss a lift

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:31.189 
does happen but when people miss a lift
they'll<00:07:29.580> fall<00:07:29.849> backwards<00:07:30.330> that's<00:07:30.990> how<00:07:31.139> you

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 
they'll fall backwards that's how you

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:32.689 
they'll fall backwards that's how you
know<00:07:31.469> that<00:07:31.500> they<00:07:31.770> have<00:07:31.919> all<00:07:32.159> their<00:07:32.460> weight<00:07:32.580> on

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:32.699 
know that they have all their weight on

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:34.610 
know that they have all their weight on
their<00:07:32.879> heels<00:07:33.089> that's<00:07:33.690> really<00:07:34.020> not<00:07:34.229> as<00:07:34.349> much<00:07:34.379> of

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:34.620 
their heels that's really not as much of

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.519 
their heels that's really not as much of
a<00:07:34.680> problem<00:07:34.889> as<00:07:35.360> as<00:07:36.360> forward<00:07:36.990> forwards<00:07:37.409> the

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:37.529 
a problem as as forward forwards the

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:39.860 
a problem as as forward forwards the
biggest<00:07:37.830> problem<00:07:38.190> so<00:07:38.370> you<00:07:38.400> don't<00:07:38.729> if<00:07:39.210> if<00:07:39.599> your

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:39.870 
biggest problem so you don't if if your

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.600 
biggest problem so you don't if if your
heel<00:07:40.169> is<00:07:40.379> lifting<00:07:40.830> when<00:07:40.979> you're<00:07:41.099> dead<00:07:41.279> lifting

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:41.610 
heel is lifting when you're dead lifting

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.469 
heel is lifting when you're dead lifting
you<00:07:42.029> have<00:07:42.210> a<00:07:42.240> major<00:07:42.569> major<00:07:42.900> problem
