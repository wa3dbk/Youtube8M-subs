 onion fighting with his father 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.229
 almost half of the edition goes there 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.490
 in the argument between his onion and his father 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.530
 I do not know why 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.180

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.610
 the onion and catch from his father number 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.590

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.710
 ear getting smart 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.540

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.030
 of punishment without internet and cell phone is 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.740
 so in any means of communication 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.689
 the rest of the week and this was 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.899
 fun for you to see that the times 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.090
 they changed yesterday but luana is punishment 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.460

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.560
 no country punishments at night but okay 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.540
 the issue develops develops 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.270
 developed in that fight the second 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.880
 punishment game pa arrives on the day it goes 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.830
 there and runs away from home and goes to the forest 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.350
 and here comes the cool part of the expensive edition 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.690
 He looks like hell in the morning forest. 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.350
 the guy takes experiment supplies drops 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.080
 in the water 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.820
 Then he will walk in the water he falls in the water 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.440
 for that part that fell in the river mano 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.030
 fucking river 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.830
 then it was still climbing on the tree has 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.800
 ant then starts to climb on it 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.420
 was a lot of fun but at the end 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.610
 the father must save him in the forest can 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.320
 enter the saved promise and then the 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.630
 mate will play both 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.850
 and then it's just a bird edition comes at the end 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.100
 also from the otoni serra edition because he 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.500
 where he will climb abseiling alone will 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.270
 What time is it in Brazil? It was a lot of fun. 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.980
 the issue was this in the end still gave a 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.440
 I like the taste more because the onion 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.330
 got more attached to his father was good 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.520
 here mainly per second and was 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.650
 more clinging began to find the father 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.540
 his as the ideal, man. 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.550
 This was fun editing that kind 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.200
 every child has his father as ideal 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.400
 well your father as your hero when you 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.110
 think a teenager 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.000
 you do not care more about stent than 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.480
 Do not talk to your father any more, but it was very 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.520
 good 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.240
 teen having father as hero turns 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.160
 a cool thing and editing ends there and 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.750
 ben on the onion characters was the 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.730
 protagonist of this story while the 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.950
 Monica was in the background appearing 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.900

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.700
