00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.070
 Hello everyone seems to find starting at 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.480
 worthy of appreciation ingenuity and 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.490
 mail staff ingenuity 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.529
 Russia because it seems that 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.750
 overheating track numbers to the same 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.050
 the trend that is it is done for everything 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.020
 incoming parcels and see here yes 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.390
 there is this old track so new 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.160
 which was glued accordingly by 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.570
 the old track the parcel stops the track 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.110
 ita as soon as she leaves due to 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.120
 chest of drawers 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.000
 she inca just happens not 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.130
 it is clear that this way you can not 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.710
 know which track is assigned to your package 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.690
 and it allows Russian post workers 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.670
 just steal at this rate on 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.340
 what stage was it stolen you too 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.800
 Well, you can do it like this 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.780
 let's see what's inside on 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.600
 in fact, I expect to be there 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.580
 One interesting knife I bought at 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:12.710
 a gift to one of my good friend from 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:15.229
 he probably also knew everything 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.969
 sending straight from the states and basically 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.640
 This package has reached relatively 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:24.789
 fast 340 days with his prince with three 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.789
 for months which bangs it's godly 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.999
 is here inside here is such a package 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.689
 let's still just in case 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:36.319
 fingers crossed yes because 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:40.270
 unpredictable package seems to 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.270
 hiding on again I see that in place 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:50.329
 this is zero tolerance 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:52.850
 0 200 optics 0 200 so it looks from 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.619
 handsome bought it was on ebay 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.829
 please don't ask me anymore 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.719
 questions I do not use the conditions of some 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.229
 there are special online stores if 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:06.609
 I see something on ebay I like it 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:09.530
 it is sent no I buy you all 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:12.319
 he can pretty nice i'm already in 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.940
 principle had the opportunity with him 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:21.410
 become acquainted 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:22.880
 there was no such knife now I bought this knife 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.800
 gift to your good friend from 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.810
 Melitopol 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.780
 His name is Vova his channel and for sure all 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.330
 know who doesn't know he will be with me 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.760
 description and recommended channels 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.160
 also on the page of my channel via 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.930
 let's see the most important thing and in 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.360
 principle surely predictable with me 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.710
 i.e. this is a jamb with passwords i'm sure 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.800
 anyway he is here too 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:50.560
 so remember the width of the carts here 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:55.120
 don't look the other way 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.800
 you know, in principle, a good idea in principle, but 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.040
 can not be a little uneven on 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.480
 its length but based on the fact that I 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.120
 I see I was really expecting much 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.190
 the worst 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.750
 both blind basically ok but 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.880
 of course that no without wrist 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.690
 movement that is here such pretty 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:19.040
 heavy wedge and no see that is 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:22.340
 both are great I really like was still 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.800
 a jamb with a notch here but here too 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.690
 Basically everything is good so what about you 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.670
 got myself quite so fit 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.480
 copies unfortunately without a box but you 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.860
 see yes creativity is just a bag like that 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:39.940
 but in principle, it is quite a normal 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.230
 the knife is very worthy this knife 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.320
 somehow customize up 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.850
 I donâ€™t know how to improve because 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.420
 here is quite such an interesting tenacious and 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:54.410
 complex texture on the hilt gone and 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.150
 the coating is quite stable ie knife 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.800
 already in principle self-sufficient that is 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.820
 if there is something to do here probably 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.500
 only that the new bone lining 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.070
 anyway clever once again you 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.790
 congratulations to all thanks for watching everyone 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.790
 good luck bye
