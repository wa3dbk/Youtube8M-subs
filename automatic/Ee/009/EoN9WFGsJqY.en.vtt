 I hope that you yourself will now 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.660
 guess what kind of model 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.980
 I know a model here inside 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.650
 here it is design a great clip person 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.989
 Mole is generally excellent she is gorgeous 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.379
 sits on a pocket worn smartly and 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.120
 removed too delightfully on the hilt 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:42.140
 anodized aluminum 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.570
 despite this very light weight let's 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.170
 immediately look at him how much he 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.400
 weighs and weighs it 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:55.940
 100 grams makes me very, very happy 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.220
 frankly let 's get down to the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.949
 important is the discovery of it 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.190
 automatic knife 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:07.909
 you heard a clap spring just 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.490
 Delight confident clear 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.329
 just like that and uncompromising class 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.909
 you know, after such a class, any 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:21.530
 the product should be scared but proper 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.979
 move on let's focus trick 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.159
 here he is a model of this knife 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:31.039
 2010 production and serial number with 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.880
 32 on the blade the finest mixing 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:38.479
 somewhere around 001 right here at the hilt 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.999
 and go to the tip then 02 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.380
 but in any case such subtlest 

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:45.950
 mixing is extremely difficult even just 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.719
 measure you know with such mixing 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.560
 drive the mood aggressive bend 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:55.340
 cutting edge with 32 on the blade with a knife 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.749
 gorgeous cuts you know he is just crazy 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.899
 bites into the product he's just 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:01.939
 failing and cutting him really 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.670
 delightful you know but I am very 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.969
 like its overall shape its such 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.899
 here is a general design well it is really 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.540
 delight 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.790
 if probably the flaw that I would 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.980
 could say call it hard to find 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.689
 it's hard to get such a knife with him 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.659
 fairly high price somewhere in the area 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:24.409
 10 thousand rubles now you can find them 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:27.230
 but actually about the handle i 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:29.299
 used to the big handle of the knife handles and 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.450
 for some grabs I don’t have a little 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.640
 missing a little here's missing common 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.150
 the long arm is literally here most 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.220
 a little 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.250
 look here what is dark 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.260
 the hole is here 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.920
 accordingly lanyard it here 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.650
 hidden 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.280
 but the lanyard can be hung accordingly 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.780
 in hand depending on grip sometimes 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.540
 stick really enough 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.980
 sometimes a little bit felt 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.310
 lack of overall length 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.620
 this is also due to the fact that the length of the blade 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.639
 despite its automatic 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.609
 automatic opening she 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:07.489
 meets the standards of guests 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:09.500
 Russian is not a cold weapon 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.870
 that is, literally a couple of millimeters not 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.280
 falls short of this blade and really 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.250
 look blade in a difficult condition 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.709
 use almost the entire length of the handle 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.639
 which is very, very competent in my opinion 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.709
 that is, there is nothing superfluous here 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.040
 excellent quality even here 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.620
 these here 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.449
 the lady screws are brief which is used 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.040
 so that this knife is not sorted out 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:33.349
 here on this model there is them in 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.409
 agree in principle and disassemble anything 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:40.060
 this automatic knife which is elegant 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:43.430
 works let's listen again 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:47.510

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:50.900
 open silently silently before holding it 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.419
 hand and of course it's all real but 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.440

 It opens very confidently and overall 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:05.150
 overall appearance of me is certainly very 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:07.609
