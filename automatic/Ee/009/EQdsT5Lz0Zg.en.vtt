not<00:02:16.020> much<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.560> mean<00:02:16.940> this<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.390> show<00:02:18.930> pretty

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
not much I mean this this show pretty

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.400 
not much I mean this this show pretty
much<00:02:19.710> follows<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.700> kids<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.210> mean<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.930> it's

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
much follows the kids I mean it it's

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.390 
much follows the kids I mean it it's
really<00:02:22.620> about<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.340> kids<00:02:23.970> story<00:02:24.510> there<00:02:25.140> was<00:02:25.260> a

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
really about the kids story there was a

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.500 
really about the kids story there was a
there<00:02:26.400> were<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.550> lot<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.760> adults<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.390> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
there were a lot of adults in the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.660 
there were a lot of adults in the
original<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.740> think<00:02:28.950> that's<00:02:29.130> been<00:02:29.370> scaled

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
original and I think that's been scaled

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.730 
original and I think that's been scaled
back<00:02:29.940> which<00:02:30.240> is<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.420> positive<00:02:30.690> step<00:02:31.170> because

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
back which is a positive step because

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.830 
back which is a positive step because
back<00:02:31.950> in<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.130> 80s<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:32.550> think<00:02:32.760> kids<00:02:33.240> were<00:02:33.600> a

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
back in the 80s I think kids were a

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.870 
back in the 80s I think kids were a
little<00:02:34.080> more<00:02:34.500> dependent<00:02:35.010> upon<00:02:35.070> their<00:02:35.400> parents

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
little more dependent upon their parents

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.910 
little more dependent upon their parents
or<00:02:36.030> for<00:02:36.540> whatever<00:02:36.840> parents<00:02:37.470> figured<00:02:37.770> into

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
or for whatever parents figured into

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.830 
or for whatever parents figured into
their<00:02:38.100> lives<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.550> little<00:02:38.700> bit<00:02:38.880> more<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.240> nine

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
their lives a little bit more in nine

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.680 
their lives a little bit more in nine
days<00:02:40.050> that's<00:02:40.350> not<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:40.710> much<00:02:40.860> days<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.790> the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
days that's not so much days so the
