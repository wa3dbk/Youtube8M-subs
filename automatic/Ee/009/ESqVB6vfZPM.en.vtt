00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
entire past system because you really

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.360 
entire past system because you really
will<00:02:56.340> not<00:02:56.520> need<00:02:56.820> it<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.300> some<00:02:58.020> extra<00:02:58.370> unneeded

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
skill law it's a launch design and this

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.010 
skill law it's a launch design and this
is<00:04:21.049> about<00:04:21.140> as<00:04:21.320> fast<00:04:21.680> as<00:04:21.950> you<00:04:21.980> can<00:04:22.190> go<00:04:23.020> much

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
is about as fast as you can go much

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.380 
is about as fast as you can go much
higher<00:04:24.050> than<00:04:24.350> that<00:04:24.740> will<00:04:25.550> get<00:04:25.760> too<00:04:25.970> intense

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
higher than that will get too intense

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.600 
higher than that will get too intense
and<00:04:26.810> people

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
opens up with someone already in your

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.230 
opens up with someone already in your
Park<00:06:15.470> so<00:06:15.830> you<00:06:15.860> want<00:06:16.100> to<00:06:16.160> get<00:06:16.340> them<00:06:16.610> out<00:06:16.820> or<00:06:17.150> you
