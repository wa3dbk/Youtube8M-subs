by<00:02:11.170> 25<00:02:11.590> mm<00:02:11.830> though<00:02:12.130> most<00:02:12.490> of<00:02:12.670> these<00:02:12.760> changes

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
by 25 mm though most of these changes

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.780 
by 25 mm though most of these changes
are<00:02:13.420> there<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.960> aid<00:02:14.200> in<00:02:14.410> aerodynamics<00:02:14.790> apart

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
are there to aid in aerodynamics apart

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.430 
are there to aid in aerodynamics apart
from<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.330> weight<00:02:16.510> has<00:02:16.720> increased<00:02:16.750> by<00:02:17.320> 8

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
from that the weight has increased by 8

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.170 
from that the weight has increased by 8
kgs<00:02:17.830> but<00:02:18.010> I'm<00:02:18.130> sure<00:02:18.310> they<00:02:18.520> have<00:02:18.670> tried<00:02:19.120> to

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
kgs but I'm sure they have tried to

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.510 
kgs but I'm sure they have tried to
compensate<00:02:19.600> for<00:02:19.960> that<00:02:20.020> by<00:02:21.010> making<00:02:21.220> some

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
compensate for that by making some

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.880 
compensate for that by making some
changes<00:02:21.850> in<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.230> engine<00:02:23.230> maybe<00:02:23.560> they<00:02:23.800> have

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
changes in the engine maybe they have

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.490 
changes in the engine maybe they have
remapped<00:02:24.220> 3<00:02:24.520> C<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.690> talking<00:02:26.260> about<00:02:26.350> the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
remapped 3 C and talking about the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.130 
remapped 3 C and talking about the
design<00:02:26.800> you<00:02:27.280> have<00:02:27.310> three<00:02:27.700> strip<00:02:28.060> tail<00:02:28.960> lamp

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
design you have three strip tail lamp

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.890 
design you have three strip tail lamp
cluster<00:02:29.590> one<00:02:30.220> turns<00:02:31.150> on<00:02:31.360> when<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.570> hit<00:02:31.690> the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
cluster one turns on when you hit the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.530 
cluster one turns on when you hit the
light<00:02:32.170> button<00:02:32.560> at<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.980> two<00:02:33.190> strips<00:02:34.120> turn<00:02:34.390> on

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
light button at the two strips turn on

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.390 
light button at the two strips turn on
when<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:34.810> hit<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.080> brakes<00:02:35.320> you<00:02:35.980> have<00:02:36.130> dual

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
when you hit the brakes you have dual

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.170 
when you hit the brakes you have dual
head<00:02:36.610> lamp<00:02:36.820> setup<00:02:37.240> and<00:02:37.570> you<00:02:37.690> have

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
head lamp setup and you have

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.930 
head lamp setup and you have
sinister-looking<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.860> DRLs<00:02:41.860> up<00:02:42.160> front<00:02:42.520> which

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
sinister-looking the DRLs up front which

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.000 
sinister-looking the DRLs up front which
really<00:02:43.270> enhance<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:45.240> mean<00:02:46.710> nature<00:02:47.710> of<00:02:47.860> this

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
really enhance the mean nature of this

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.810 
really enhance the mean nature of this
bike<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:49.390> that's<00:02:50.380> how<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.890> can<00:02:51.040> turn<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.550> one

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
bike and that's how you can turn a one

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.510 
bike and that's how you can turn a one
head<00:02:52.090> lamp<00:02:52.330> at<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.510> time<00:02:52.690> on<00:02:53.320> just<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.250> save<00:02:54.400> on
