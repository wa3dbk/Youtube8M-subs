00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.729
 Servus people welcome to a new one 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.559
 the result of the fitness tv is my name 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:11.480
 rafael without in this edition we dedicate ourselves 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.490
 tell us the topic when should you 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.440
 train at what time is it on 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.300
 best to train his muscles 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.130
 we have the best of one 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.949
 you should get a training session 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.349
 between 16 to 19 o'clock his muscles 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.329
 train when this time increases 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.789
 which the attention our 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.890
 body temperature on and even around 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.360
 up to 1 degree celsius 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.230
 we have one in the morning 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.239
 body temperature of about 36 5 degrees the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.920
 increases until the afternoon to about 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.899
 37 8 degrees 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.300
 and this is especially the and 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.519
 athlete interesting and important why 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.739
 quite simply through this lightweight 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.890
 increase ours 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.410
 capacity 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.140
 there are some think this one degree 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.719
 can not account for so much but still 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.699
 that's how our body reacts 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.710
 on the lowest temperature change 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.320
 very sensitive considering that one 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.330
 already at 38 5 degrees of light 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.860
 Fever speaks and all those already 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.620
 times have had fever know how 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.050
 Almost everyone can take the worst 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.970
 Athletics or road bike world record 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.580
 was in the afternoon or early evening 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.170
 this is because that the 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.780
 natural increase in body temperature 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.030
 how a kind of warm up works 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.040
 Body vessels are elevated by the 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.450
 heat storms than in the morning 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.490
 which in turn makes the body better 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.370
 Oxygen and other nutrients 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.530
 can transport our vascular system 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.960
 another advantage of the training 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.970
 between 16 to 19 o'clock is that the 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.890
 muscles are more flexible 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.870
 They were passing through our day 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.090
 activities at work school or 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.060
 uni moves well thereby during the 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.890
 injury risk decreases 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.400
 sports the highest performance 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.700
 demanded this natural 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.100
 temperature change so the 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.290
 natural temperature rise our 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.670
 Body and can be up to ten percent more 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.980
 cause power 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.240
 On the other hand, sports are practiced 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.370
 the coordination of the 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.350
 Balance is important or else 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.530
 A steady hand should be needed 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.670
 you rather train in the morning 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.770
 It is important to say that that 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.180
 Training in the afternoon or early evening 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.280
 always with the rest of the time 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.160
 must fit the day, of course, works 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.870
 not always but if it is possible 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.630
 is and you are in your daily routine 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.400
 you should be able to integrate between 16 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.540
 until 19 o'clock his training program too 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.100
 at home or in the gym 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.200
 Now the training is not in the morning 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.990
 You speak effectively in the morning 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.940
 less muscle on no, that too brings 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.650
 Of course, what should I do? 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.810
 warm up well then the body 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.180
 especially the muscles and joints 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.460
 to sleep a little stiff 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.170
 In addition, the heart is running 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.730
 circulation system on low flame 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.290
 which has the consequence that one does not 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.270
 be sure to spend so much energy 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.950
 can 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.510
 but like everything in life is that 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.090
 a getting used to who in the morning 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.090
 feels fit and can only do something about it 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.110
 this should also be maintained 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.490
 instead of convulsing somehow 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.170
 So change his training plan 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.180
 to put on another time 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.470
 the same goes for people who 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.110
 at noon or before going to sleep 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.460
 Training training must be a personal one 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.190
 it must be fun with that 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.990
 match the remaining day program together 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.940
 so be attuned and special 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.870
 important you have to feel good 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.250
 and feel awake and alert its such 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.959
 that was the topic when should you 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.610
 train as I said in the afternoon 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.550
 early evening is actually best 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.590
 for the screening so that's that 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.180
 completed training because they still 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.190
 have questions about the topic 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.020
 then a pm will send us too 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.860
