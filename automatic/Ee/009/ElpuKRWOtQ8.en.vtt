with using a cellphone you know state
but<00:02:14.300> I<00:02:14.330> think<00:02:14.570> that<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.950> message

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.970 
but I think that the that the message
seems<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:17.030> be<00:02:17.180> clear<00:02:17.780> no<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.500> wasn't<00:02:18.860> our

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
seems to be clear no that wasn't our

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.580 
seems to be clear no that wasn't our

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.760 
video well I think a good viral video in
this<00:05:56.610> particular<00:05:56.820> case<00:05:57.180> the<00:05:58.169> objective<00:05:58.650> was

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
this particular case the objective was

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.219 
this particular case the objective was
to<00:05:58.950> basically<00:05:59.160> get<00:05:59.580> kids<00:06:00.090> young<00:06:00.540> people<00:06:00.960> to<00:06:01.110> be

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
to basically get kids young people to be

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:02.570 
to basically get kids young people to be
excited<00:06:01.590> but<00:06:01.680> a<00:06:01.740> brand<00:06:02.040> that<00:06:02.130> was<00:06:02.370> very

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
excited but a brand that was very

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.250 
excited but a brand that was very
popular<00:06:02.820> among<00:06:03.150> parents<00:06:03.690> so<00:06:04.140> in<00:06:04.200> this

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
popular among parents so in this

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.780 
popular among parents so in this
particular<00:06:04.380> case<00:06:04.680> we<00:06:05.010> wanted<00:06:05.280> to<00:06:05.400> do<00:06:05.550> a

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
particular case we wanted to do a

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.690 
particular case we wanted to do a
campaign<00:06:06.120> where<00:06:06.740> older<00:06:07.740> people<00:06:07.770> said<00:06:08.250> that's

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
campaign where older people said that's

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.820 
campaign where older people said that's
gross<00:06:09.030> and<00:06:09.450> the<00:06:09.900> more<00:06:10.110> that<00:06:10.229> parents<00:06:10.650> said

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
gross and the more that parents said

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.310 
gross and the more that parents said
that<00:06:11.010> was<00:06:11.130> gross<00:06:11.370> thought<00:06:12.120> that<00:06:12.300> was<00:06:12.390> cool<00:06:12.600> so

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
that was gross thought that was cool so

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.260 
that was gross thought that was cool so
I<00:06:13.350> think<00:06:13.470> a<00:06:13.590> brand<00:06:13.860> has<00:06:14.340> to<00:06:14.520> be<00:06:14.640> able<00:06:14.729> to<00:06:15.000> do<00:06:15.150> it

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
I think a brand has to be able to do it

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.300 
I think a brand has to be able to do it
in<00:06:15.330> a<00:06:15.390> way<00:06:15.479> that's<00:06:15.660> entertaining<00:06:15.780> and<00:06:16.350> fun<00:06:16.680> but

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
in a way that's entertaining and fun but

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.860 
in a way that's entertaining and fun but
not<00:06:17.400> irresponsible<00:06:17.669> and<00:06:18.300> bottom<00:06:18.570> line<00:06:18.690> are<00:06:18.810> we

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870
