00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
looking at Assassin's Creed a bit from

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.330 
looking at Assassin's Creed a bit from
the<00:00:39.840> outside<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.410> thinking<00:00:40.739> maybe<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.280> should

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the outside and thinking maybe I should

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.890 
the outside and thinking maybe I should
jump<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:41.879> maybe<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.329> I've<00:00:42.510> missed<00:00:42.750> too

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
jump in but maybe it's I've missed too

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.390 
jump in but maybe it's I've missed too
much<00:00:43.020> everything<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.739> happened<00:00:44.010> before<00:00:44.129> in

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
much everything that happened before in

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.549 
much everything that happened before in
the<00:00:44.430> brand<00:00:44.699> happened<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.840> we're<00:00:46.290> assuming

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the brand happened and we're assuming

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.010 
the brand happened and we're assuming
that<00:00:46.860> right<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.699> it's<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.120> new<00:00:48.329> start<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
that right but it's a new start it's a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.810 
that right but it's a new start it's a
new<00:00:49.110> narrative<00:00:49.290> start<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.309> is

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
new narrative start and that is

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.880 
new narrative start and that is
symbolized<00:00:51.330> by<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.629> completely<00:00:52.199> new<00:00:52.379> context

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
symbolized by a completely new context

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.740 
symbolized by a completely new context
for<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> present<00:00:53.460> day<00:00:53.550> now<00:00:54.120> you've<00:00:54.480> seen<00:00:54.690> a

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
for the present day now you've seen a

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.060 
for the present day now you've seen a
little<00:00:55.050> bit<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.230> an<00:00:55.320> evolution<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:55.860> Black

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
little bit of an evolution with Black

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.140 
little bit of an evolution with Black
Flag<00:00:56.309> we're<00:00:56.550> not<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.790> to<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> same

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
Flag we're not going to do the same

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.610 
Flag we're not going to do the same
thing<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.839> what<00:00:58.079> we're<00:00:58.199> doing<00:00:58.230> with

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
thing this is what we're doing with

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.600 
thing this is what we're doing with
unity<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.129> really<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.909> beginning<00:01:01.400> for<00:01:02.400> this

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
unity is really the beginning for this

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.579 
unity is really the beginning for this
new<00:01:03.030> cycle<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.750> Assassin's<00:01:04.170> Creed<00:01:04.379> games

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
new cycle of Assassin's Creed games

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.580 
new cycle of Assassin's Creed games
because<00:01:05.009> it's<00:01:05.159> new<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.270> actually<00:01:06.659> explain

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
because it's new we can actually explain

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.109 
because it's new we can actually explain
it<00:01:07.740> properly<00:01:07.890> because<00:01:08.310> nobody<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:08.970> going<00:01:09.060> to

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
it properly because nobody is going to

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.810 
it properly because nobody is going to
feel<00:01:09.360> like<00:01:09.509> it's<00:01:09.660> redundant<00:01:09.960> right<00:01:10.550> so<00:01:11.550> i

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
feel like it's redundant right so i

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.639 
feel like it's redundant right so i
would<00:01:12.060> say<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.300> Assassin's<00:01:12.960> Creed<00:01:13.140> unity<00:01:13.170> is

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
would say that Assassin's Creed unity is

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.609 
would say that Assassin's Creed unity is
probably<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.759> best<00:01:14.970> entry<00:01:15.780> point<00:01:16.020> for<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
probably the best entry point for the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.800 
probably the best entry point for the
franchise<00:01:16.800> since<00:01:17.399> AC<00:01:17.700> 1<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.420> now<00:01:18.539> we're<00:01:18.690> may

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
franchise since AC 1 so now we're may

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.620 
franchise since AC 1 so now we're may
first<00:01:19.080> 2014<00:01:19.800> I<00:01:19.950> guess<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.280> puts<00:01:20.460> us<00:01:20.670> five

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
first 2014 I guess that puts us five

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.520 
first 2014 I guess that puts us five
weeks<00:01:21.899> give<00:01:22.110> or<00:01:22.170> take<00:01:22.410> from<00:01:23.250> e3<00:01:23.520> yep<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.530> what's
