00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.110
 hello I'm Pedro GarcÃ­a Aguado driver of the program Big Brother 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:13.229
 I also present the book that I co-wrote with Esther Legorgeu 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.710
 and adaros some tips and 3 accept them though as quinn son said the tips 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.609
 they are like asses everyone has one 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.140
 but I hope that those who 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.499
 we have put in this outer book postpone serving as help 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.409
 in the education of our children 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:29.439
 good as first advice 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.470
 Many families ask me what I can do in the case that I manage better 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.840
 My addiction, which I recovered from, has been recovered for seven years 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.650
 what can I do to make my son not only 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.180
 but there are many factors that influence 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.550
 in which a child approaches the consumption of drugs but it would be good 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.470
 educate them 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.770
 in a feeling of self-efficacy and positive appraisal 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.640
 another tip that I usually give lectures out for parents 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.080
 this listen to the feelings of your children 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.440
 What does this mean 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.000
 I with my daughter I cut which two daughters learn a 12 year old one 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.150
 nine years 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.530
 percent one day I took the older one and told me dad I'm stressed calamante 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.220
 what do we parents do 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.000
 you are going to be these attitudes and is reason to suspect but yes that 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.729
 certain states that you ask 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.920
 what are the reasons why you are stressed 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.750
 and she replied that she had to play tennis that she had to put up with her 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.290
 sister that she had to put up with has given her other brother 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.290
 I had to deal with things 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.050
 that his mother charged him that he had to approve that he had to do homework 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.050
 I had no reason to be stressed 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.290
 in normal circumstances with day to day and courage but that we carry 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.060
 we parents do not pay attention artists those concerns or 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.940
 the feelings that they are also entitled to have 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.510
 placed as second advice 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.040
 and I would tell you to listen to children's cars 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.700
 another advice that is to prune is that caresses and verbally to your children 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.220
 what does that mean 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.900
 My little daughter 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.009
 d you are not now condemned to five years she had many chances very much desire 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.240
 help 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.330
 points he took the dishes if he went the kitchen to take it when I said 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.590
 to pick up the table or without telling him and pick up touch as he did that 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.579
 I took the plate I was watching television 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.979
 what happened on the set with his whole body was doing sports 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.659
 but normally those cases are made it's a disaster daughter you're not worth anything 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.819
 the neighbors of that data provoked a girl 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.819
 small we may be generating maybe some insecurity 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:24.309
 but what I do is enhance those wrong as I do 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:28.349
 I made a mistake and that through trial and error, it grows with certainty 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.199
 In herself 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:34.579
 When she does something right like she does something wrong, we have to acknowledge that 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.229
 it means galicia is worth 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.109
 and it is one of the problems that I most habitually in the background the problem 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:40.059
 higher 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.059
 it is the absence of limits 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:44.259
 put limits on your children 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:48.849
 have a balance between authority and permissiveness that is very important 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.299
 because pulleys and educate and he showed his children in what he calls jose antonio 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.309
 marine the reality principle 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:59.919
 not everything in this life is going to come out as you want and that will help you to manage the 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:04.319
 frustration remember that they have been adolescents remember and understand in that 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.429
 you are going to suffer from rebound some of the symptoms of adolescence 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:12.129
 looked for his son how is it that they answer us all we have gone in certain 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.469
 somewhat rebellious measure to be a bit tolerant in that stage not by 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.560
 God answer one day and have a slam 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.569
 they are going to return as scapegoating for May but it is 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:22.719
 true that you have to know 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:26.689
 in that stage of life we â€‹â€‹are all as very unfortunate and we have to 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:30.029
 send them and guide them with tamers better we had it and we oriented 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:32.789
 better output will have climate resources 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:37.939
 to face the truth that as he said malden file x the truth 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:38.239
 it's out there
