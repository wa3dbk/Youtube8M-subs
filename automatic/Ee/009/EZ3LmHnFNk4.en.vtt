00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.270 
to add water but I like it because I
feel<00:01:36.659> like<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.960> firms<00:01:37.290> everything<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.189> it

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
feel like it firms everything in and it

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.190 
feel like it firms everything in and it
fills<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:39.090> also<00:01:39.240> makes<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.600> heavier<00:01:39.930> so

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
fills it in it also makes it heavier so

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.359 
fills it in it also makes it heavier so
in<00:01:40.290> case<00:01:40.409> if<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.560> have<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> flower<00:01:41.130> arrangement

on top of it someone's not going to

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.300 
on top of it someone's not going to
knock<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.020> over<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> final<00:01:44.070> touch<00:01:44.280> is

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310
