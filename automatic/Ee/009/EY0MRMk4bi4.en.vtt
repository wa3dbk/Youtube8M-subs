why are some drivers faster than others
well<00:00:10.660> after<00:00:11.019> coaching<00:00:11.289> and<00:00:11.559> training<00:00:11.680> drivers

of all levels for over three decades if

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.199 
of all levels for over three decades if
I<00:00:14.559> had<00:00:14.710> to<00:00:14.830> choose<00:00:15.040> just<00:00:15.099> one<00:00:15.610> thing<00:00:15.910> that<00:00:15.940> the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
I had to choose just one thing that the

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.850 
I had to choose just one thing that the
best<00:00:16.480> performance<00:00:17.080> and<00:00:17.169> race<00:00:17.349> drivers<00:00:17.710> do

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
best performance and race drivers do

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.230

better<00:00:18.160> than<00:00:18.340> the<00:00:18.430> average<00:00:18.730> driver

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
better than the average driver

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.060 
better than the average driver
it's<00:00:19.689> how<00:00:19.869> they<00:00:20.050> pick<00:00:20.290> up<00:00:20.410> and<00:00:20.590> use<00:00:20.710> more

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
it's how they pick up and use more

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.710 
it's how they pick up and use more

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.520 
and the curbing but think about it there
are<00:00:57.520> times<00:00:57.820> when<00:00:58.090> you<00:00:58.210> use<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:58.600> feel<00:00:58.989> of<00:00:59.020> going

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
are times when you use the feel of going

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.139 
are times when you use the feel of going
over<00:00:59.680> a<00:00:59.710> bump<00:01:00.010> or<00:01:00.190> change<00:01:00.430> in<00:01:00.579> track<00:01:00.790> service

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
say the tires that tell you that you're

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.999 
say the tires that tell you that you're
either<00:01:05.560> online<00:01:05.890> or<00:01:06.340> not<00:01:06.369> and<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:08.380> also<00:01:08.649> use

either online or not and you also use

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.560 
either online or not and you also use
the<00:01:09.189> sensory<00:01:09.549> information<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:10.060> sense<00:01:10.360> whether

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
limits of your car that's what driving

to the lumen is all about the more of

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
these references you have the more

these references you have the more
sensory<00:01:18.249> information<00:01:18.369> you<00:01:18.909> have<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.630> better

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
sensory information you have the better

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.840 
sensory information you have the better
you'll<00:01:20.079> drag<00:01:20.289> the<00:01:20.530> faster<00:01:21.009> more<00:01:21.219> consistent

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
you'll drag the faster more consistent

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.929 
you'll drag the faster more consistent
you'll<00:01:21.969> be<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:23.350> you'll<00:01:24.039> correct<00:01:24.340> any<00:01:24.579> errors

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
you'll be and you'll correct any errors

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:25.889 
you'll be and you'll correct any errors
you<00:01:25.030> make<00:01:25.209> earlier<00:01:25.539> because<00:01:25.780> you'll

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
you make earlier because you'll

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.749 
you make earlier because you'll
recognize<00:01:26.409> them<00:01:26.560> sooner<00:01:26.799> and<00:01:27.249> therefore<00:01:27.609> your

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
recognize them sooner and therefore your

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.309 
recognize them sooner and therefore your
Corrections<00:01:28.179> will<00:01:28.299> be<00:01:28.389> smaller<00:01:28.749> and<00:01:29.020> more

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
Corrections will be smaller and more

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.489 
Corrections will be smaller and more
subtle<00:01:29.679> so<00:01:30.659> how<00:01:31.659> do<00:01:31.719> you<00:01:31.869> learn<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.170> taking

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:32.499 
subtle so how do you learn to taking

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:35.160 
subtle so how do you learn to taking
more<00:01:32.679> quality<00:01:33.249> sensory<00:01:33.700> information<00:01:34.170> through

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
more quality sensory information through

more quality sensory information through
deliberate<00:01:35.799> strategic<00:01:36.100> practice<00:01:36.909> and

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119
