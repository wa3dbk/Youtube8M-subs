third coat and now we're starting to see

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.720 
third coat and now we're starting to see
sort<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.440> proper<00:00:14.309> purple<00:00:15.179> color<00:00:15.890> this<00:00:16.890> there

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
sort of a proper purple color this there

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.750 
sort of a proper purple color this there
are<00:00:17.910> some<00:00:19.189> cooling<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.869> wash<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:22.760> places

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
are some cooling of the wash in places

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.689 
are some cooling of the wash in places
that<00:00:24.000> doesn't<00:00:24.900> look<00:00:26.240> optimal<00:00:27.240> but<00:00:27.680> that

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
that doesn't look optimal but that

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.250 
that doesn't look optimal but that
mostly<00:00:29.699> because<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.480> use<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.109> hair

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
mostly because of the use of the hair

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:39.619 
mostly because of the use of the hair
dryer<00:00:31.470> if<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:33.440> if<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:36.860> let<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.920> dry<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.969> its

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
dryer if you if you let it dry on its

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.750 
dryer if you if you let it dry on its
own<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:41.370> also<00:00:42.829> wipe<00:00:43.829> off<00:00:44.100> some<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
own and you also wipe off some of the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.350 
own and you also wipe off some of the
excess<00:00:45.200> paint<00:00:46.399> in<00:00:47.399> between<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.890> result<00:00:49.890> is

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
excess paint in between the result is

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.510 
excess paint in between the result is
it's<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.449> little<00:00:51.660> better<00:00:52.070> which<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.250> learned

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
it's a little better which I learned

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.729 
it's a little better which I learned
from<00:00:53.969> doing<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.329> first<00:00:54.600> test<00:00:54.960> miniature<00:00:55.530> and

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
from doing this first test miniature and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.720 
from doing this first test miniature and
I<00:00:56.460> then<00:00:56.850> use<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.660> knowledge<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:59.070> painting

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
I then use that knowledge on painting

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.329 
I then use that knowledge on painting
the<00:00:59.760> other<00:01:00.059> nine<00:01:00.390> members<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:02.129> team<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:04.339> in

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.600 

third<00:01:27.970> coat<00:01:28.240> is<00:01:28.480> dry<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.110> I'm<00:01:29.500> applying<00:01:29.740> the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
third coat is dry and I'm applying the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.320 
third coat is dry and I'm applying the
fourth<00:01:31.270> coat<00:01:31.630> of<00:01:32.100> wash<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:33.430> this<00:01:34.150> was

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
fourth coat of wash and this was

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.310 
fourth coat of wash and this was
supposed<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:34.780> be<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.500> final<00:01:36.040> coat<00:01:36.300> it<00:01:37.320> turned

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
supposed to be the final coat it turned

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.610 
supposed to be the final coat it turned
out<00:01:38.470> that<00:01:38.530> I<00:01:38.800> needed<00:01:39.070> to<00:01:39.280> do<00:01:39.430> some<00:01:39.730> touch-ups

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
out that I needed to do some touch-ups

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.390 
out that I needed to do some touch-ups
because<00:01:41.620> I<00:01:43.380> didn't<00:01:44.380> cover<00:01:45.010> everything

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
because I didn't cover everything

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.680 
because I didn't cover everything
properly<00:01:46.320> with<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.350> first<00:01:47.650> few<00:01:48.340> coats<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:48.850> I

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
properly with the first few coats and I

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.560 
properly with the first few coats and I
find<00:01:50.650> that<00:01:50.800> something<00:01:51.790> that<00:01:51.820> is<00:01:52.060> really

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
find that something that is really

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.000 
find that something that is really
really<00:01:52.600> important<00:01:53.320> when<00:01:53.560> you're<00:01:53.740> doing

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
really important when you're doing

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.090 
really important when you're doing
something<00:01:54.160> like<00:01:54.460> this<00:01:54.640> is<00:01:55.050> you<00:01:56.050> make<00:01:56.470> sure<00:01:56.800> to

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
something like this is you make sure to

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.500 
something like this is you make sure to
cover<00:01:57.400> the<00:01:58.030> entire<00:01:58.150> model<00:01:58.750> with<00:01:59.220> paint<00:02:00.220> if<00:02:00.850> you

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
cover the entire model with paint if you

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.770 
cover the entire model with paint if you
leave<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:03.750> primer<00:02:05.940> showing<00:02:06.940> in<00:02:07.119> places

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
leave the primer showing in places

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.660 
leave the primer showing in places
that's<00:02:08.200> going<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.470> look<00:02:08.619> really<00:02:09.040> really<00:02:09.369> bad

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
that's going to look really really bad

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.170 
that's going to look really really bad
and<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.929> can<00:02:11.410> actually<00:02:11.560> easily<00:02:12.370> happen<00:02:12.550> when

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
and that can actually easily happen when

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.910 
and that can actually easily happen when
you<00:02:13.450> splash<00:02:13.870> on<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.440> wash<00:02:15.220> like<00:02:15.520> this<00:02:15.760> because

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.449 

bubbles<00:02:20.920> will<00:02:21.430> easily<00:02:21.730> form<00:02:22.240> and<00:02:23.370> when<00:02:24.370> the

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
bubbles will easily form and when the

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.940 
bubbles will easily form and when the
bubbles<00:02:24.790> burst<00:02:25.290> then<00:02:26.290> you're<00:02:26.680> going<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:26.890> have

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
bubbles burst then you're going to have

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.300 
bubbles burst then you're going to have
a<00:02:27.070> small<00:02:27.520> circular<00:02:28.060> spot<00:02:28.870> with<00:02:29.230> no<00:02:29.440> paint<00:02:29.860> in

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
a small circular spot with no paint in

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:41.740 
a small circular spot with no paint in
it

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.500 

here<00:02:42.750> I'm<00:02:43.040> applying<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.570> black<00:02:45.570> shade<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:47.610> the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
here I'm applying a black shade to the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.670 
here I'm applying a black shade to the
sum<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.560> recessed<00:02:50.040> areas<00:02:50.550> like<00:02:51.560> in<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
sum of the recessed areas like in the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.510 
sum of the recessed areas like in the
groin<00:02:52.920> area<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:55.550> underneath<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.610> chin<00:02:58.520> stuff

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
groin area and underneath the chin stuff

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.470 
groin area and underneath the chin stuff
like<00:02:59.700> that<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:02.220> realized<00:03:02.910> i<00:03:03.120> was<00:03:03.240> doing

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
like that and I realized i was doing

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.430 
like that and I realized i was doing
this<00:03:03.600> in<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.930> wrong<00:03:04.110> order<00:03:04.700> because<00:03:05.700> I'm<00:03:06.260> at<00:03:07.260> a

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
this in the wrong order because I'm at a

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.650 
this in the wrong order because I'm at a
later<00:03:07.710> stage<00:03:08.210> I'm<00:03:09.210> applying<00:03:10.140> black<00:03:11.130> wash<00:03:11.660> to

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
later stage I'm applying black wash to

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.870 
later stage I'm applying black wash to
the<00:03:13.320> metal<00:03:13.950> bits<00:03:14.550> that<00:03:15.210> I'm<00:03:15.570> painting<00:03:16.880> like

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
the metal bits that I'm painting like

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.930 
the metal bits that I'm painting like
wrong<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.390> so<00:03:19.080> this<00:03:19.680> was<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.070> wrong<00:03:20.700> order

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
wrong and so this was the wrong order

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.440 
wrong and so this was the wrong order
and<00:03:21.300> when<00:03:21.990> I<00:03:22.250> painted<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.700> rest<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.210> team

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
and when I painted the rest of the team

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.270
