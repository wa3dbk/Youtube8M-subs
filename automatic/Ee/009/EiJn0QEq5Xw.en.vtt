00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
the the biggest challenges of today it's

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.499 
the the biggest challenges of today it's
rideable<00:01:58.429> would<00:01:58.609> that<00:01:58.729> be<00:01:58.850> yeah<00:01:59.179> i<00:01:59.210> mean<00:01:59.329> the

probably<00:02:00.979> be<00:02:01.219> my<00:02:01.340> flying<00:02:01.549> changes<00:02:02.030> there<00:02:02.920> you

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920

know<00:02:04.039> is<00:02:04.609> one<00:02:05.149> of<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.299> most<00:02:05.389> difficult<00:02:05.509> thing

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
know is one of the most difficult thing

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.359 
know is one of the most difficult thing
is<00:02:06.079> getting<00:02:06.259> on<00:02:06.380> someone<00:02:06.649> else's<00:02:06.950> horse<00:02:07.100> and

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
is getting on someone else's horse and

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.980 
is getting on someone else's horse and
doing<00:02:07.579> flying<00:02:07.789> changes<00:02:08.149> because<00:02:08.450> your<00:02:08.600> aids

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
doing flying changes because your aids

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.680 
doing flying changes because your aids
are<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.410> different<00:02:09.710> everyone's<00:02:10.160> so<00:02:10.250> different
