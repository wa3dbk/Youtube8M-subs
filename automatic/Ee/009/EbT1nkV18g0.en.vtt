00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.580
 or both serve and disunit more the channel 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.229
 and they bring what's invite to this 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.210
 video so famous that you put virgi 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:11.100
 so many women but I love it so much 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.230
 personally this video I like to see it 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.109
 but I do not know if you will like it or not 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.640
 because I do not know what is contributed in 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.930
 I will do it anyway because 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.670
 now a lot of gurus are doing 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.250
 and I think it's appropriate to get on YouTube 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.119
 in my version and good without deceiving us more 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.289
 let's squeeze the bag is from parwan what 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.940
 I bought a couple of months ago and 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.070
 logically the best but I'm not going to 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.929
 do and less change the bags how much 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.819
 the bigger they are and the more I have become more 

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:38.249
 they like and the bigger they are and more 

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:40.170
 Hold more things you can see inside and 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:42.200
 more people help I check my 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.280
 mother but 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.500
 we are using it both 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.960
 we have that does not have that big but 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.719
 have to put them on and sometimes I put 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.180
 one that is sacrifice for all 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.039
 days to class and if you do not take the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.530
 long since the method that has to that 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.030
 Short itself and then disenchants 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.519
 with a magnet that I like more than 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.979
 zips because it's easier I think that 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.110
 at the time of security it's like enough 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.869
 easier to steal what I do not know 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.470
 but I do not wear it like that and I do not 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.299
 remove good god we have this kid 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.740
 which is like to carry cards or things 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.179
 that we are not going to take cards 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.130
 if I ask for something because it is easy to 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.630
 this falls down so what useful for 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.090
 what I use it is to put the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.310
 mobile helmets that I always go with 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.600
 helmets then have another small 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.860
 compartment that is also done with 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.770
 handle and this is the most careful 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.899
 it has but I have the phone and the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.159
 saw from house to enter house and 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.020
 Well the first thing we get is about 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.750
 handkerchiefs 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.910
 because in times of constipation 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.500
 divine salvation and then a little 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.240
 I think this is a class but I 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.650
 I use a toilet bag because it is 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.060
 too small and good until that kit 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.800
 of women's survival that goes to 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.580
 lose the first thing are tweezers because 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:58.080
 we need tweezers for my life I have 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.930
 a colony two colonies this one is 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.920
 clarice and is 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.920
 and it's in bar 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.410
 on the lips and the 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.930
 security to musicians until I dare 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.870
 throwing me this 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.879
 and he told me but you know it's colony anyway 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.290
 it is not theater that is specified already 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.939
 you know which is the big mountain I said 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.359
 my first video has the paper already with 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.359
 other perfume 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.190
 that is smaller and I love it and 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.540
 then I have two ways because always 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.489
 I'm taking the hair that bothers me 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.410
 much in the present moment is to teach 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.750
 the previous video that is a balm 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.780
 lipstick that has a name looked at a 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.220
 mascara that is broken October but 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.260
 how good will always get you out I know 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.299
 more perfume this is a sample of the 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.069
 Narcissus perfume that tales you make 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.900
 at the end then he took this mini brush 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.459
 who used it to throw me this 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.459
 plastic I just complied with you 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.380
 also through the video a gloss 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.440
 of the corrector ultra necessary for 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.910
 dark circles is a process we will continue 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.040
 then we have what shape us 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.270
 women every month that I'm not going to 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.330
 watch 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.080
 the tip of the glasses without glasses because 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.010
 I've lost them 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.010
 but they are beautiful 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.070
 a bottle of ultra-essential water 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.070
 because as a gazebo 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.950
 I dont know 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:39.000
 the big ones in a tiny and very 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.000
 practical 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.079
 next survival or a deodorant 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.440
 if I need a rubber band 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.030
 that has as 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.440
 the hitch to close that is very 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.120
 cool and how do I put this with a 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.920
 Pigtail and it's beautiful I love no 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.320
 it happens that it cost me quite expensive to be 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.990
 what is it I bought it I bought it 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.210
 when the bag in bagua also equal 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.290
 that the glasses and staying one more thing 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:15.010
 but we have the portfolio where I have everything 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.010
 from money 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.090

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.710

 drinking the nightclub of the town and 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.160
