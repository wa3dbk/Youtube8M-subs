little list but pain is pretty much a
minimum<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.240> think<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.020> was<00:00:19.140> worse<00:00:19.350> when<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.680> had

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
minimum I think it was worse when I had

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.679 
minimum I think it was worse when I had
my<00:00:20.010> tongue<00:00:20.220> pierced<00:00:20.250> then<00:00:21.060> when<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.270> did<00:00:21.510> this

tongue apart so you can really see what
it<00:01:53.290> looks<00:01:53.500> like<00:01:53.680> while<00:01:53.920> it's<00:01:54.070> healing

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.240 

a<00:02:01.430> little<00:02:02.430> gross<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.270> mean<00:02:03.860> really<00:02:04.860> not

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
a little gross but I mean really not

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.910 
a little gross but I mean really not
that<00:02:05.460> bad<00:02:05.720> so<00:02:06.720> far<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:07.080> worst<00:02:07.230> part<00:02:07.560> has<00:02:07.740> been

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
that bad so far the worst part has been

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.440 
that bad so far the worst part has been
when<00:02:08.130> I<00:02:08.160> woke<00:02:08.340> up<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.700> morning<00:02:09.120> and<00:02:09.330> they

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
when I woke up this morning and they

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.140 
when I woke up this morning and they
tend<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.810> have<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.260> hold<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.160> apart<00:02:11.490> because<00:02:11.790> my

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
tend to have to hold it apart because my

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.910 
tend to have to hold it apart because my
tongue<00:02:12.390> was<00:02:12.540> already<00:02:12.900> trying<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.260> heal<00:02:13.500> itself

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920

tongue was already trying to heal itself
back<00:02:14.220> together<00:02:14.750> but<00:02:15.750> even<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.620> didn't

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
back together but even that didn't

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.640 
back together but even that didn't
really<00:02:17.700> hurt<00:02:17.820> it<00:02:18.180> was<00:02:18.270> just<00:02:18.450> kind<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.140> really

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650
