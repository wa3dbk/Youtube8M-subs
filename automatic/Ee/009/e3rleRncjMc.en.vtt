 allows you to reach faster 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.399
 the center unfortunately notifies the task 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.840

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.010
 however it is one of the notices that 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.750
 windows who will show us in the build 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.449

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.289
 Italian unfortunately there was no trace of it 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.079
 in this version instead there is the 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:01.039
 voice in clipboard connected account office 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.719

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.970
 ending here is now very little is missing 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.830
 when compiling the rtm version is 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.960
 never is this ever occupied 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.369
 only a bug fix is 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.619
 the time has come to take a quick look 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.640
 to the bees integrated into the operating system 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.700
 and it is right to observe the behavior 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.500
 of the old win32 application 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.020
 let's start with asp and start 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.970
 from the calendar application this is the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.369

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.720
 fast and fluid and is very beautiful 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.520
 graphically we have the views 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.920
 per day week time 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.200

 print it the water hour turn photo 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.079
 selecting an image will appear a 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.590

 possibility to open the image for a 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.280

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.049
 file and size the device is 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.049
 the origin 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.209
 no changes to the store and respect 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:50.510
 to the review a few days ago is 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:52.519
 everything remained almost unchanged well 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.620
 also made the Rome because we had 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.670
 way to appreciate in the version for 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.180
 smartphone we now show a small one 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.780
 example 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.640
 let's try the directions is 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.590
 You can choose whether to go to 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:12.079
 car or the pedestrian path 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.910
 let's move on to the msn app with respect to the 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.430
 version currently available in 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.049
 windows 8.1 the step forward how 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.450
 you want to see it was huge 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.519
 they are much faster and more respectful 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.530
 of the new style and there are also new ones 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.530
 really very nice animations 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.959
 this is the old Poland of 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.790
 old man who ran the economic part 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.790
 we see in the part intended for sports 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.420
 obviously the hamburger can be accessed 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.010
 to all the various functions that the water 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.170
 also provides the kocsis la 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.240
 touch version and is well made as you can 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.170

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.760
 desktop there are all the features 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.890
 as a good part of those who 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.940
 actually the common user 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:11.970
 used now we move on to 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.340
 win32 applications because it is because in 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.470
 video comments in video comments 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.140
 previous I found various questions of the 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.850
 like the adobe suite and the one 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.840
 office and the hicks program like it 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.580
 leads 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.830
 obviously we cannot be excessive 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.720
 however, we also do a short test here 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:33.930
 let's start with a software a bomber that 8 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:37.080
 encarta 2008 the program starts 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:43.650
 correctly you can view 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:46.530
 the various items to see click to find 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.680
 in short, the articles are applied 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:55.430
 works correctly let's try to 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.430
 look for a beethoven park you put it 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:08.610
 winrar also no movie problem here 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.830
 maker at the end of the installation a 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.840
 methods a screen appears 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.970
 warning me that there may have been 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.620
 some compatibility problems and for 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.910
 this reason the application could 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.190
 not having been installed 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.260
 correctly or more on the pop up ho 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.790
 started the software works without any 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.740
 kind of problem i tried also a 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.160

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.750

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.340
 we also find with Rome you don't have 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.080
 given the pro version and why 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:41.700
 pretty fast and let's try with 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:43.050
 Photoshop software quite heavy yes 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.640
 is starting and will also start 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.950
 quite quickly because we are 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.990
 using a computer with an i5 processor 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.570

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.830
 500g solid 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.700
 These short operate the applications 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.190

 no chrome finger is a bit slow 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:34.440
 in startup, however, it works without creating 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:36.660
 problems also mozilla is started without 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.910
