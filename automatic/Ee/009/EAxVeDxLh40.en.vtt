00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.690
 the box here I have two times 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:20.210
 two generations of devices once the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.130
 galaxy nexus and once the new nexus 4 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.760
 The left device is from samsung and 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.510
 google and the right device is in 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.350
 production of lg and google 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.999
 just a little bit to the 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.289
 It would be different if you needed it 

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:36.179
 not many may still have that 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.039
 first generation I am so great 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.480
 but unfortunately I have the problem 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:44.010
 what you might not get in the video 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.809
 sees that my display is broken 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.480
 the differences times we have 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.809
 Lexus first generation a display 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.429
 with 4 65 inches which a bit 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.210
 has smaller resolution than the nexus 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:01:00.389
 we have a lot on the nexus 4 12 80 x 768 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.710
 while the first one I mean it has twelve 

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:07.140
 80 x 720 here we have the hd 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.060
 ips plus display and here we still have 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.479
 an amulet with penn number I 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.759
 personally find the ips displays in the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.969
 Area of the black value of the colors 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.930
 a bit better being the amoled 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.420
 Of course, display is always nice 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.880
 brightly colored are also in things battery 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.439
 and camera and processor is what 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.579
 been changed is 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.110
 Of course it's a new one 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.659
 generation one is with added value 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.680
 sell 5 megapixel camera 8 megapixel 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.229
 camera 2100 milliampere battery and here 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.109
 Once we have the 17 50 years like that 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.670
 I remember correctly 

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:46.109
 purely in terms of weight we have here 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.000
 once 135 grams here 139 grams 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:50.969
 I'll show you that a bit 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.250
 from the side so as I said on the 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:58.109
 right side the new nexus 4 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:02.759
 that's what the device looks like 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:08.429
 the left side we have just one 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:12.300
 size of 135 5 and here we have 133 9 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:17.280
 however, we have 91 millimeters here 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.420
 and on the a 8 0 4 millimeters like that and 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.349
 I hope you can so one 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.409
 a little bit see the back again 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.879
 I personally really like the 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:29.519
 back of the new device a bit 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.319
 better here you see the cameras below 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.280
 as appropriate if she said 5 once 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.180
 and even eight megapixel both with the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.580
 Led lightning down 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.849
 both are not technically memory 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.239
 expandable 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:49.730
 with the one exactly on the possibility 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.730
 to swap the battery 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.530
 which unfortunately what dresses of course here 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.530
 is no longer possible 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:07.769
 nfc have both charge wirelessly 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:11.640
 definitely only the new nexus 4 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.290
 so the fun looks so I hope 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.030
 you can adjust the display differences like this 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.830
 a bit I recognize the normal way that 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:22.650
 same wallpaper activates that you 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.420
 so you see the cameras have both 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.849
 so different from optically 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.489
 a reference design to say which way 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.879
 a bit changed 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:36.629
 however here 1.2 ghz dual core 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:40.620
 processor and yes the quadcore with 151 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:43.950
 netdragon it's four per otherwise from the 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.049
 the term did not have both 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.590
 So somehow in Germany is mine 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.900
 In my opinion it does not matter if it's old or not 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.450
 Of course, the americans are getting upset 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.650
 There is lte there 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:01.590
 yes that 's the nexus 4 im first 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.580
 compared to the nexus of the first 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.560
 generation 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.420
 whether you need it or not you have to 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.450
 decide for you if we of course 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.830
 a hardcore gamers' side we have it 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.590
 better than you need then you reach for 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.420
 big device the display is as I said 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.100
 on the nexus four in my opinion 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:23.310
 better otherwise you come too 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.440
 continues to be good with the nexus of 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.060
 samsung clearly you just have to say that 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.440
 It is still a great device 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.020
 which one can use quietly so who 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.790
 do not need to upgrade first 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.979
 determined what took his old 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.540
 disturbed does not need to resort to it 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.780
 who is now in the new world 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.840
 from android wants to get started 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.440
 in terms of price performance ratio 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.479
 definitely get the nexus four from lg 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.460
 because that's me, I really think so 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.220
 Processed is good 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.680
 it's fun to use and that is 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.680
 the important thing about the device yes that was it 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.960
 first in comparison galaxy nexus 4 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.960
 against samsung galaxy nexus 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.550
 I prefer online money for a 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.550
 everything
