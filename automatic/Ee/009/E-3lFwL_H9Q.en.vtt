00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.390

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.910
 slightly change the conditions of the competition 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.820

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.660
 from the people who made the video screensaver 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.699

 the video is also on the u tub where it is to the music 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.670
 very quickly makes the form and it was 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.970
 just not magic now let's 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.350
 move to the fun part namely 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.420
 screensavers you sent video 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.020
 screensavers on different themes different 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.270
 rollers 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.820
 made in different programs of different 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.860
 styles that are similar works almost 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.829
 there was of course there was work done in 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.500
 from the step fish free it is of course 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.360
 interesting but the guys at work in such 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.200
 I do not participate in the competition I think you yourself 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.439
 do you understand 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.770
 please let me read you 3 winners 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.040
 which I carefully selected and checked 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.829
 also odesse by his friend for authorship 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.420
 these works that is, that they were not 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:52.950
 downloaded and redone will do by 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.649
 video tutorial that is, the servant did everything 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.689
 guys are just great and well 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.420
 let's go to the top three finalist and so 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.110
 3rd place was taken by Aslan Almukhametov 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.110
 congratulations 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.900
 second place was taken by Cyril Lyon City 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.650
 the first place was very easy to determine 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.320
 because the man painted this 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.760
 screensaver itself plus put a bonus which 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.310
 I 'll show you the video 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.030
 you're just done inside with yuschaya 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.000
 screen saver 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.370
 but according to the idea in general 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.300
 congratulations and first place 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.300
 Mark Milas 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:07.769
 well , let's see his bonus 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.769
 which he enclosed the letter 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.520
 what are you guys all just great they 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.990
 by the way I want to say this 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.110
 the screensaver is not necessarily important shaking over 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.030
 hands made with explosions because they were 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.430
 screensavers that I really liked 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.380
 and they were very simple but 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.540
 it is made very high quality and 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.540
 very forgive and here's an example of one such 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.690
 let me read all the same games that 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.250
 You can probably winners in 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.430
 the fact that many have already managed to forget 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.460
 borderlands 2 skyrim torchlight 2 fall 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.720
 out my back a soldier shindo sauce and poet 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.020
 give me a disonord 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.480
 and xq mark you can pick up two games from 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.210
 this list is absolutely any what you like 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.390
 liked more Cyril and Aslan you 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.220
 You can pick up one game and 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.080
 absolutely not any kind of game that 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.110
 left from the winner so it was in 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.870
 conditions stipulated earlier and lips that is 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.780
 if the brand chooses for example borderlands 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.670
 2 You can also select it. 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.860
 change the conditions a bit because i 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.540
 thought it would be right in 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.780
 in general, you are just great guys 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.700

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.610
