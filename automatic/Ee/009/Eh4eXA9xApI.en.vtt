00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
smellivision you know like a

John<00:01:03.000> Waters<00:01:03.329> made<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.570> film<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.960> think

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
John Waters made a film I think

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.260 
John Waters made a film I think
polyester<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.920> came<00:01:05.159> with<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> little<00:01:05.670> card

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
polyester that came with a little card

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.830 
polyester that came with a little card
that<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.290> scratched<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.670> know<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.510> got<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
that you scratched you know and got the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.370 
that you scratched you know and got the
smells<00:01:10.140> seen<00:01:11.150> he<00:01:12.150> was<00:01:12.270> ahead<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.450> his<00:01:12.540> time<00:01:12.630> he

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
smells seen he was ahead of his time he

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.780 
smells seen he was ahead of his time he
was<00:01:13.409> unfortunately<00:01:14.159> they<00:01:14.490> didn't<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
was unfortunately they didn't have the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.219 
was unfortunately they didn't have the
technology<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.420> actually<00:01:15.630> make<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.869> happen

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
technology to actually make that happen

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.929 
technology to actually make that happen
but<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.890> interesting<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.520> mentioned

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
but it's interesting that you mentioned

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.330 
but it's interesting that you mentioned
smell<00:01:18.330> because<00:01:18.810> smell<00:01:19.170> affects<00:01:19.740> how<00:01:20.280> we

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
smell because smell affects how we

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.760 
smell because smell affects how we
perceive<00:01:21.270> food<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.900> how<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.049> taste<00:01:22.530> and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
perceive food and how we taste and

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.560 
perceive food and how we taste and
effects<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.100> tasting<00:01:23.430> experience<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:24.000> does

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
effects the tasting experience as does

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.820 
effects the tasting experience as does
sight<00:01:24.840> right<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.290> that's<00:01:25.409> something<00:01:25.650> that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
sight right and that's something that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.100 
sight right and that's something that
the<00:01:26.520> researcher<00:01:26.970> recognizes<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.720> he<00:01:27.869> says

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the researcher recognizes so he says

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.100 
the researcher recognizes so he says
quote<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.610> stimulate<00:01:30.119> flavors<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.810> need<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.020> go

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
quote to stimulate flavors we need to go

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.749 
quote to stimulate flavors we need to go
beyond<00:01:31.439> taste<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.979> incorporate<00:01:32.430> smell

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
beyond taste and incorporate smell

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.609 
beyond taste and incorporate smell
texture<00:01:33.270> colors<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.810> other<00:01:33.960> modalities

texture colors and other modalities

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.319 
texture colors and other modalities
because<00:01:35.009> flavor<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.700> cross<00:01:35.939> sensory

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
because flavor is a cross sensory

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.480 
because flavor is a cross sensory
experience<00:01:36.810> with<00:01:36.930> multiple<00:01:37.350> senses<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.280> this

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
experience with multiple senses so this

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.310 
experience with multiple senses so this
is<00:01:38.670> why<00:01:38.820> your<00:01:39.299> coca-cola<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.290> that

is why your coca-cola and a can that
read<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:41.159> taste<00:01:41.400> different<00:01:41.850> from<00:01:42.270> coca-cola

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
read can taste different from coca-cola

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.440 
read can taste different from coca-cola
and<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.229> glass<00:01:43.470> actually<00:01:44.159> what<00:01:44.729> researchers

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
and a glass actually what researchers

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.120 
and a glass actually what researchers
have<00:01:45.630> found<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.110> when<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.100> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
have found is that when you have a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.340 
have found is that when you have a
really<00:01:47.460> deep<00:01:47.759> red<00:01:48.030> color<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.630> tends<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.049> make

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
really deep red color it tends to make

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.609 
really deep red color it tends to make
food<00:01:50.280> or<00:01:50.549> taste<00:01:51.030> about<00:01:51.240> 12%<00:01:51.810> sweeter<00:01:52.320> than

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
food or taste about 12% sweeter than

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.649 
food or taste about 12% sweeter than
when<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.890> doesn't<00:01:53.159> have<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.310> color<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
when it doesn't have that color so the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.539 
when it doesn't have that color so the
color<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.140> things<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.619> texture<00:01:56.009> sensation

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
color of things the texture sensation

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.950 
color of things the texture sensation
everything<00:01:57.030> makes<00:01:57.270> something<00:01:57.540> taste

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
everything makes something taste

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.240 
everything makes something taste
different<00:01:58.680> what<00:01:58.890> are<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.070> practical

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
different what are the practical

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.429 
different what are the practical
purposes<00:02:00.060> obviously<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.869> don't<00:02:01.049> think<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.320> is

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
purposes obviously I don't think this is

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.440 
purposes obviously I don't think this is
geared<00:02:01.770> towards<00:02:02.159> cooking<00:02:02.520> shows<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:02.909> think

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
geared towards cooking shows I think

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.690 
geared towards cooking shows I think
it's<00:02:03.600> geared<00:02:03.960> towards<00:02:04.350> advertising<00:02:05.070> exactly

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
it's geared towards advertising exactly

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.229 
it's geared towards advertising exactly
so<00:02:05.969> if<00:02:06.240> there's<00:02:06.540> say<00:02:07.380> maybe<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:08.280> beer<00:02:08.819> company

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
so if there's say maybe a beer company

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.729 
so if there's say maybe a beer company
that<00:02:09.720> has<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.899> bunch<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.200> different<00:02:10.500> beers

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
that has a bunch of different beers

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.540 
that has a bunch of different beers
they're<00:02:11.069> like<00:02:11.190> do<00:02:11.310> you

fail we can deliver a bitter message so

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.680 
fail we can deliver a bitter message so
it<00:02:37.560> makes<00:02:37.740> me<00:02:37.860> feel<00:02:38.010> like<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.220> like<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> rat<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.570> a

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
it makes me feel like a like a rat in a

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.140 
it makes me feel like a like a rat in a
science<00:02:40.080> experiment<00:02:40.380> but<00:02:41.100> it's<00:02:41.460> still<00:02:41.730> really

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
science experiment but it's still really

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.240 
science experiment but it's still really
really<00:02:42.330> cool<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.440> think<00:02:43.470> also<00:02:43.890> brings<00:02:44.100> up

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
really cool and I think also brings up

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.340 
really cool and I think also brings up
these<00:02:44.340> questions<00:02:44.580> about<00:02:44.940> how<00:02:45.330> much<00:02:46.110> are<00:02:46.320> we

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
these questions about how much are we

these questions about how much are we
