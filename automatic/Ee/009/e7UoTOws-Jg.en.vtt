00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
civilians so the key tactic you need to

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.210 
civilians so the key tactic you need to
use<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.510> your<00:01:06.750> cunning<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.619> ability<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.010> spot

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
who doesn't fit into a crowd so for

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.420 
who doesn't fit into a crowd so for
Robert<00:01:10.439> doesn't<00:01:10.560> blend<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.920> well<00:01:11.070> enough<00:01:11.310> and

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
Robert doesn't blend in well enough and

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.429 
Robert doesn't blend in well enough and
a<00:01:11.490> guard<00:01:11.670> spots<00:01:12.000> them<00:01:12.240> they<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:12.960> correctly

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
a guard spots them they can correctly

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.810 
a guard spots them they can correctly
accuse<00:01:13.740> him<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.040> winter<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.340> an<00:01:14.580> evasion

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
accuse him in a winter like an evasion

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.520 
accuse him in a winter like an evasion
mode<00:01:15.180> where<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.750> Robert<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.229> run<00:01:16.409> away

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
mode where the Robert can run away

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.960 
mode where the Robert can run away
however<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.159> drains<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.490> lot<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.729> their<00:01:17.820> run

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
however it drains a lot of their run

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.399 
however it drains a lot of their run
energy<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> guards<00:01:18.840> pretty<00:01:19.049> much<00:01:19.229> going

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
energy so the guards pretty much going

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.289 
energy so the guards pretty much going
to<00:01:19.470> catch<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.890> when<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.580> get<00:01:20.670> caught<00:01:20.970> you'll
