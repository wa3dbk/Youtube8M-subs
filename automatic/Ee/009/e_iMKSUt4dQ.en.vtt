00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
piece of plastic and I'm going to anneal

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.120 
piece of plastic and I'm going to anneal
it<00:04:00.640> over<00:04:01.210> the<00:04:01.390> heat<00:04:01.660> source<00:04:02.050> like<00:04:02.290> this<00:04:02.710> and

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
it over the heat source like this and

what you're going to see is the plastics
gonna<00:04:05.500> get<00:04:05.680> kind<00:04:06.010> of<00:04:06.160> limp<00:04:06.520> and<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.240> we'd<00:04:07.660> be

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
gonna get kind of limp and and we'd be

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.710 
gonna get kind of limp and and we'd be
looking<00:04:08.370> once<00:04:09.370> it<00:04:09.610> reaches<00:04:10.090> that<00:04:10.120> annealed

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
looking once it reaches that annealed

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.410 
looking once it reaches that annealed
state<00:04:11.140> what<00:04:11.560> I<00:04:11.590> can<00:04:11.920> do<00:04:12.100> is<00:04:12.340> I'll<00:04:12.790> pick<00:04:13.030> up<00:04:13.209> this

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
to form one half of the curve of the

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.800 
to form one half of the curve of the
cuff<00:04:22.240> bracelet<00:04:22.900> then<00:04:23.770> I'll<00:04:23.980> go<00:04:24.160> back<00:04:24.190> I'll

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
cuff bracelet then I'll go back I'll

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.540 
cuff bracelet then I'll go back I'll
reheat<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:26.050> other<00:04:26.320> side<00:04:26.800> of<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.100> bracelet

and<00:04:27.820> form<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.780> other<00:04:29.020> curvature<00:04:29.950> now<00:04:30.730> if<00:04:31.060> I

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
and form the other curvature now if I

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.480 
and form the other curvature now if I
make<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.600> mistake<00:04:31.870> or<00:04:32.440> if<00:04:32.680> I<00:04:32.800> need<00:04:32.980> to<00:04:33.220> finesse

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
make a mistake or if I need to finesse

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.150 
make a mistake or if I need to finesse
the<00:04:34.030> form<00:04:34.419> a<00:04:34.600> little<00:04:34.870> bit<00:04:35.050> all<00:04:35.350> I<00:04:35.410> have<00:04:35.800> to<00:04:35.980> do

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
the form a little bit all I have to do

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.390 
the form a little bit all I have to do
is<00:04:36.460> put<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.480> bracelet<00:04:37.990> back<00:04:38.260> into<00:04:38.980> the<00:04:39.130> heat

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
is put the bracelet back into the heat

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.420 
is put the bracelet back into the heat
this<00:04:40.330> will<00:04:40.570> either<00:04:40.810> relax<00:04:41.440> it<00:04:41.740> and<00:04:41.889> cause<00:04:42.190> it

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
this will either relax it and cause it

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.850 
this will either relax it and cause it
to<00:04:42.460> open<00:04:43.030> back<00:04:43.240> up<00:04:43.540> or<00:04:44.110> it<00:04:44.260> will<00:04:44.380> give<00:04:44.650> me

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
to open back up or it will give me

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.280 
to open back up or it will give me
enough<00:04:45.280> softness<00:04:46.060> in<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.330> material<00:04:46.900> that<00:04:47.230> I

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
enough softness in the material that I

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.290 
enough softness in the material that I
can<00:04:47.530> easily<00:04:47.710> just<00:04:47.919> form<00:04:48.400> it<00:04:48.490> with<00:04:48.639> my<00:04:48.820> hands

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
can easily just form it with my hands

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.140 
can easily just form it with my hands
all<00:04:49.870> of<00:04:50.320> this<00:04:50.440> is<00:04:50.650> done<00:04:50.800> of<00:04:50.950> course<00:04:51.150> while

turn<00:04:55.570> on<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.810> heat<00:04:55.930> gun<00:04:56.169> and<00:04:56.200> we'll<00:04:56.620> get

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
turn on the heat gun and we'll get

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:13.480 
turn on the heat gun and we'll get
started

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.300 

the<00:05:13.970> acrylic<00:05:14.330> material<00:05:15.080> will<00:05:15.319> gas<00:05:15.650> out<00:05:16.039> while

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
the acrylic material will gas out while

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.219 
the acrylic material will gas out while
you<00:05:16.490> heat<00:05:16.759> it<00:05:16.789> so<00:05:17.150> be<00:05:17.360> sure<00:05:17.389> to<00:05:17.780> work<00:05:17.960> with

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
you heat it so be sure to work with

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:35.990 
you heat it so be sure to work with
ventilation

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.790 

you<00:05:36.540> can<00:05:36.690> see<00:05:36.930> that<00:05:37.110> it's<00:05:37.260> getting<00:05:37.440> a<00:05:37.650> little

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
you can see that it's getting a little

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:47.220 
you can see that it's getting a little
floppy<00:05:38.190> on<00:05:38.520> this<00:05:38.760> end

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.210 

now<00:05:47.800> I'm<00:05:47.950> gonna<00:05:48.100> place<00:05:48.400> it<00:05:48.430> over<00:05:48.730> the<00:05:48.910> form<00:05:50.220> the

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
now I'm gonna place it over the form the

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.550 
now I'm gonna place it over the form the
dowel<00:05:51.460> doesn't<00:05:51.910> give<00:05:52.090> me<00:05:52.300> the<00:05:52.330> complete<00:05:53.140> form

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
dowel doesn't give me the complete form

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.650 
dowel doesn't give me the complete form
so<00:05:54.040> I'm<00:05:54.100> going<00:05:54.310> to<00:05:54.370> just<00:05:54.610> hold<00:05:54.880> it<00:05:55.180> over<00:05:55.510> the

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
so I'm going to just hold it over the

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:12.519 
so I'm going to just hold it over the
first<00:05:55.990> curve<00:05:56.620> with<00:05:56.980> one<00:05:57.190> end<00:05:57.460> of<00:05:57.580> the<00:05:57.700> bracelet

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:12.529 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:14.769 

you<00:06:13.009> can<00:06:13.189> see<00:06:13.429> that<00:06:13.699> the<00:06:13.879> first<00:06:14.119> curve<00:06:14.569> is

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:14.779 
you can see that the first curve is

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:16.899 
you can see that the first curve is
beginning<00:06:15.259> to<00:06:15.289> relax<00:06:15.829> as<00:06:16.159> I'm<00:06:16.339> heating<00:06:16.729> to

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:16.909 
beginning to relax as I'm heating to

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:19.569 
beginning to relax as I'm heating to
make<00:06:17.149> the<00:06:17.419> second<00:06:17.929> curve<00:06:18.229> just<00:06:18.979> hold<00:06:19.249> it<00:06:19.429> with

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:19.579 
make the second curve just hold it with

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:21.459 
make the second curve just hold it with
your<00:06:19.609> gloved<00:06:20.119> hand<00:06:20.479> and<00:06:20.719> keep<00:06:20.929> it<00:06:21.079> in<00:06:21.199> place

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:21.469 
your gloved hand and keep it in place

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:44.750 
your gloved hand and keep it in place
until<00:06:21.829> you<00:06:22.159> get<00:06:22.429> the<00:06:22.609> form<00:06:22.909> that<00:06:23.119> you<00:06:23.269> want

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.760

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
I'm going to quickly turn off the heat

I'm doing is I'm just holding it in the

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.400 
I'm doing is I'm just holding it in the
form<00:06:58.070> that<00:06:58.370> I<00:06:58.400> want<00:06:58.730> it<00:06:58.850> to<00:06:58.880> take<00:06:59.330> until<00:07:00.140> it's

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410 
form that I want it to take until it's

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.460 
form that I want it to take until it's
cooled<00:07:00.800> off<00:07:01.130> now<00:07:02.060> you<00:07:02.120> don't<00:07:02.540> want<00:07:02.900> to<00:07:03.020> quench

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470 
cooled off now you don't want to quench

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.440 
cooled off now you don't want to quench
this<00:07:03.800> in<00:07:04.040> cold<00:07:04.460> water<00:07:04.820> you<00:07:05.090> might<00:07:05.240> actually

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.450 
this in cold water you might actually

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.750 
this in cold water you might actually
crack<00:07:06.110> the<00:07:06.140> plastic<00:07:07.070> or<00:07:07.220> you<00:07:07.250> might<00:07:07.460> cause<00:07:07.730> it

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760 
crack the plastic or you might cause it

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.930 
crack the plastic or you might cause it
to<00:07:08.000> torque<00:07:08.570> so<00:07:09.260> just<00:07:09.470> hold<00:07:09.710> it<00:07:09.920> it<00:07:10.430> should<00:07:10.700> be

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
to torque so just hold it it should be

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.300 
to torque so just hold it it should be
easy<00:07:11.540> to<00:07:11.660> hang<00:07:11.930> on<00:07:12.110> to<00:07:12.350> with<00:07:12.860> your<00:07:13.010> gloves

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.310 
easy to hang on to with your gloves

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.220 
easy to hang on to with your gloves
because<00:07:13.610> your<00:07:13.760> gloves<00:07:14.000> are<00:07:14.230> basically

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:15.230 
because your gloves are basically

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.170 
because your gloves are basically
deflecting<00:07:15.860> all<00:07:15.980> the<00:07:16.130> heat<00:07:16.340> from<00:07:16.490> your<00:07:16.700> hands

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.180 
deflecting all the heat from your hands

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.230 
deflecting all the heat from your hands
and<00:07:17.530> once<00:07:18.530> you<00:07:18.680> begin<00:07:18.950> to<00:07:19.010> feel<00:07:19.310> it<00:07:19.520> stiffen<00:07:20.150> up

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 
and once you begin to feel it stiffen up

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.120 
and once you begin to feel it stiffen up
in<00:07:20.450> your<00:07:20.600> hands<00:07:20.930> a<00:07:21.020> little<00:07:21.140> bit<00:07:21.290> you'll<00:07:21.950> know
