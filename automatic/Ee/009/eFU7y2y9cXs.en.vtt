electrophoresis PCR stands for

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.009 
electrophoresis PCR stands for
polymerase<00:00:08.160> chain<00:00:08.490> reaction<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.420> it's<00:00:09.809> used

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
polymerase chain reaction and it's used

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.990 
polymerase chain reaction and it's used
to<00:00:10.110> duplicate<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.679> particular<00:00:11.280> piece<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.670> DNA

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
to duplicate a particular piece of DNA

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.120 
to duplicate a particular piece of DNA
hundreds<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.540> thousands<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:12.990> times<00:00:13.200> what

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
hundreds of thousands of times what

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.010 
hundreds of thousands of times what
happens<00:00:14.460> first<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.059> double-stranded

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
happens first is that double-stranded

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.410 
happens first is that double-stranded
DNA<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.470> mixed<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:16.920> DNA<00:00:17.279> polymerase<00:00:17.730> primers

DNA is mixed with DNA polymerase primers

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.650 
DNA is mixed with DNA polymerase primers
and<00:00:18.690> nucleotides<00:00:19.369> then<00:00:20.390> everything<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.510> put

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
and nucleotides then everything is put

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.570 
and nucleotides then everything is put
in<00:00:21.779> 95-degree<00:00:22.350> water<00:00:22.710> which<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.340> hot<00:00:23.550> that

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
in 95-degree water which is so hot that

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.929 
in 95-degree water which is so hot that
it<00:00:23.910> causes<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.960> two<00:00:25.230> strands<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.890> DNA<00:00:26.340> to

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
it causes the two strands of DNA to

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.019 
it causes the two strands of DNA to
unwind<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.869> separate<00:00:28.349> into<00:00:29.160> segments<00:00:29.880> of

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029

degrees primers anneal which means
attached<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:37.040> then<00:00:38.040> at<00:00:38.280> about<00:00:38.579> 72<00:00:38.969> degrees

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
attached and then at about 72 degrees

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.130 
attached and then at about 72 degrees

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
DNA polymerase attaches nucleotides to

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.860 
DNA polymerase attaches nucleotides to
the<00:00:43.170> Strand<00:00:43.590> from<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.730> 5<00:00:44.940> prime<00:00:45.210> end<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> 3

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the Strand from the 5 prime end to the 3

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.229

rules<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:49.760> everything<00:00:50.760> that's<00:00:50.879> happening<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
rules and everything that's happening to

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.290 
rules and everything that's happening to
this<00:00:51.899> strand<00:00:52.230> happens<00:00:52.920> also<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.030> Strand

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
this strand happens also to the Strand

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.970 
this strand happens also to the Strand
that<00:00:54.449> was<00:00:54.600> separated<00:00:55.140> from<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.469> during<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
that was separated from it during the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.270 
that was separated from it during the
first<00:00:56.219> temperature<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:58.440> essentially<00:00:59.070> each

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
first temperature so essentially each

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.279 
first temperature so essentially each
time<00:00:59.730> these<00:01:00.059> 3<00:01:00.270> temperatures<00:01:00.719> are<00:01:00.870> repeated

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
time these 3 temperatures are repeated

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.410 
time these 3 temperatures are repeated
you<00:01:02.100> get<00:01:02.340> two<00:01:02.730> strands<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.270> double-stranded

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
you get two strands of double-stranded

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.100 
you get two strands of double-stranded
DNA<00:01:04.049> made<00:01:04.979> from<00:01:05.400> every<00:01:06.180> strand<00:01:06.780> of

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
DNA made from every strand of

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.840 
DNA made from every strand of
double-stranded<00:01:07.710> DNA<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.280> was<00:01:08.369> present

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
double-stranded DNA that was present

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.120 
double-stranded DNA that was present
during<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.689> first<00:01:09.930> temperature<00:01:10.409> so

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
during the first temperature so

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.250 
during the first temperature so
hopefully<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.760> can<00:01:11.909> see<00:01:12.119> how<00:01:12.150> PCR<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.960> really

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
hopefully you can see how PCR is really

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.999 
hopefully you can see how PCR is really
effective<00:01:13.740> at<00:01:14.010> making<00:01:14.490> lots<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.090> copies<00:01:15.540> of

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
effective at making lots of copies of

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.950 
effective at making lots of copies of
double-stranded<00:01:17.009> DNA<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.600> fairly<00:01:18.840> short

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
double-stranded DNA in a fairly short

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.090 
double-stranded DNA in a fairly short
amount<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.560> time<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:21.140> prepare<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.439> DNA<00:01:22.860> made

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
amount of time to prepare the DNA made

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.859 
amount of time to prepare the DNA made
during<00:01:23.340> PCR<00:01:23.939> for<00:01:24.150> gel<00:01:24.330> electrophoresis

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
during PCR for gel electrophoresis

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.870 
during PCR for gel electrophoresis
something<00:01:25.680> called<00:01:25.890> restriction<00:01:26.250> enzymes<00:01:26.729> are

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
something called restriction enzymes are

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.179 
something called restriction enzymes are
added<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.570> DNA<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.710> restriction

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
added to the DNA and what restriction

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.039 
added to the DNA and what restriction
enzymes<00:01:29.549> do<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.880> recognize<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.540> particular

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
enzymes do is recognize that particular

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.719 
enzymes do is recognize that particular
nucleotide<00:01:31.619> sequence<00:01:32.070> called<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> restriction

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
nucleotide sequence called a restriction

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.120 
nucleotide sequence called a restriction
site<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.390> cut<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> DNA<00:01:34.229> at<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.770> restriction

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
site and cut the DNA at that restriction

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.370 
site and cut the DNA at that restriction
site<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.090> if<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.600> example<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
site so if for example we have a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.609 
site so if for example we have a
nucleotide<00:01:37.920> sequence<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.850> looks<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.329> this

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.609 

and<00:01:44.240> a<00:01:45.240> restriction<00:01:45.600> enzyme<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.290> recognizes

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
and a restriction enzyme that recognizes

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.580 
and a restriction enzyme that recognizes
the<00:01:47.040> sequence<00:01:47.399> TAC<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.970> restriction<00:01:48.509> site<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the sequence TAC is restriction site the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.649 
the sequence TAC is restriction site the
restriction<00:01:50.070> enzyme<00:01:50.220> will<00:01:50.610> cut<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.970> DNA<00:01:51.149> like

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
restriction enzyme will cut the DNA like

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.859 
restriction enzyme will cut the DNA like
this<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.640> what<00:01:53.640> happens<00:01:54.030> sometimes<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.810> that

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
this and what happens sometimes is that

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.859 
this and what happens sometimes is that
I'm<00:01:55.759> healthy<00:01:56.759> DNA<00:01:57.060> doesn't<00:01:57.689> have<00:01:57.840> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
I'm healthy DNA doesn't have a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.090 
I'm healthy DNA doesn't have a
restriction<00:01:58.320> site<00:01:58.619> for<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.860> particular

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
restriction site for a particular

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.510 
restriction site for a particular
restriction<00:01:59.759> enzyme<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:01.079> mutated<00:02:01.740> DNA<00:02:01.770> does

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
restriction enzyme but mutated DNA does

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.980 
restriction enzyme but mutated DNA does
because<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> mutation<00:02:03.509> changes<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
because a mutation changes the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.420 
because a mutation changes the
nucleotide<00:02:04.560> sequence<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.130> causes<00:02:05.369> a

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
nucleotide sequence and causes a

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.639 
nucleotide sequence and causes a
restriction<00:02:05.850> site<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.210> appear<00:02:06.540> for<00:02:07.229> example

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
restriction site to appear for example

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.290 
restriction site to appear for example
in<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:07.950> DNA<00:02:08.399> which<00:02:08.640> are<00:02:08.789> calling<00:02:09.000> healthy

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
in this DNA which are calling healthy

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.350 
in this DNA which are calling healthy
DNA<00:02:09.690> there's<00:02:10.289> no<00:02:10.560> TAC<00:02:11.099> restriction<00:02:11.879> site<00:02:12.090> so

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
DNA there's no TAC restriction site so

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.340 
DNA there's no TAC restriction site so
all<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.660> DNA

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
all the DNA

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.950 
all the DNA
remain<00:02:13.590> as<00:02:13.910> intact<00:02:14.910> as<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.180> string<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.720> eight

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
remain as intact as a string of eight

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.070 
remain as intact as a string of eight
nucleotides<00:02:16.590> but<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.820> DNA<00:02:18.330> which<00:02:18.900> we're

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
nucleotides but in this DNA which we're

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.890 
nucleotides but in this DNA which we're
calling<00:02:19.200> mutated<00:02:19.890> DNA<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.460> TAC<00:02:21.180> site<00:02:21.690> has

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
calling mutated DNA a TAC site has

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.230 
calling mutated DNA a TAC site has
appeared<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:22.830> restriction<00:02:23.370> enzyme<00:02:23.760> will<00:02:24.000> cut

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
appeared so restriction enzyme will cut

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.050 
appeared so restriction enzyme will cut
the<00:02:24.390> DNA<00:02:24.570> like<00:02:25.110> this<00:02:25.380> into<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.370> string<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.880> three

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
the DNA like this into a string of three

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.120 
the DNA like this into a string of three
nucleotides<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.290> string<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.650> five

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
nucleotides and a string of five

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.400 
nucleotides and a string of five
nucleotides<00:02:29.820> so<00:02:30.080> essentially<00:02:31.080> what<00:02:31.260> we'll

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
nucleotides so essentially what we'll

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.910 
nucleotides so essentially what we'll
have<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.540> bunch<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.660> strands<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.110> DNA<00:02:34.500> some

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
have is a bunch of strands of DNA some

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.380 
have is a bunch of strands of DNA some
of<00:02:35.010> them<00:02:35.130> will<00:02:35.280> be<00:02:35.370> eight<00:02:35.490> nucleotides<00:02:36.120> along

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
of them will be eight nucleotides along

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.780 
of them will be eight nucleotides along
the<00:02:36.990> healthy<00:02:37.320> strands<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.280> mutated<00:02:38.760> DNA

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
the healthy strands and the mutated DNA

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.300 
the healthy strands and the mutated DNA
will<00:02:39.300> be<00:02:39.390> either<00:02:39.510> three<00:02:39.990> nucleotides<00:02:40.890> long<00:02:40.980> or

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
will be either three nucleotides long or

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.660 
will be either three nucleotides long or
five<00:02:41.580> nucleotides<00:02:42.180> long<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.130> first<00:02:44.370> step

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
five nucleotides long so the first step

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.700 
five nucleotides long so the first step
of<00:02:44.820> gel<00:02:45.060> electrophoresis<00:02:45.630> is<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.350> we<00:02:46.470> put

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
of gel electrophoresis is that we put

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.590 
of gel electrophoresis is that we put
different<00:02:46.860> samples<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.550> DNA<00:02:47.910> into<00:02:48.150> different

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
different samples of DNA into different

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.540 
different samples of DNA into different
wells<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.080> gel<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:50.070> here<00:02:50.280> we<00:02:50.400> have

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
wells in the gel so here we have

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.280 
wells in the gel so here we have
reference<00:02:50.940> DNA<00:02:51.120> which<00:02:51.570> is<00:02:51.720> basically<00:02:51.990> just

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
reference DNA which is basically just

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.070 
reference DNA which is basically just
DNA<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:53.160> restriction<00:02:54.090> enzymes<00:02:54.450> have<00:02:54.660> cut<00:02:54.930> up

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
DNA that restriction enzymes have cut up

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.830 
DNA that restriction enzymes have cut up
into<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.440> bunch<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:55.980> different<00:02:56.880> segments<00:02:57.540> whose

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
into a bunch of different segments whose

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.140 
into a bunch of different segments whose
lengths<00:02:58.230> we<00:02:58.380> know<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.310> we<00:02:59.430> can<00:02:59.580> make<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.760> kind<00:02:59.970> of

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
lengths we know so we can make a kind of

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.470 
lengths we know so we can make a kind of
scale<00:03:01.010> here's<00:03:02.010> our<00:03:02.190> healthy<00:03:02.490> DNA<00:03:02.670> our<00:03:03.000> mutated

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
scale here's our healthy DNA our mutated

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.830 
scale here's our healthy DNA our mutated
DNA<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:04.050> DNA<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.650> we<00:03:04.800> don't<00:03:04.980> know<00:03:05.130> about<00:03:05.250> and

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
DNA and DNA that we don't know about and

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.480 
DNA and DNA that we don't know about and
then<00:03:06.840> we<00:03:07.290> turn<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:07.620> an<00:03:07.800> electric<00:03:08.310> current

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
then we turn on an electric current

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.280 
then we turn on an electric current
which<00:03:08.820> creates<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.300> negative<00:03:09.720> pole<00:03:09.900> up<00:03:10.050> here

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
which creates a negative pole up here

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.620 
which creates a negative pole up here
and<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.500> positive<00:03:10.950> pole<00:03:11.160> down<00:03:11.310> here<00:03:11.580> DNA<00:03:12.510> is

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
and a positive pole down here DNA is

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.300 
and a positive pole down here DNA is
negatively<00:03:12.840> charged<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.770> if<00:03:13.830> you<00:03:13.950> remember

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
negatively charged and if you remember

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.370 
negatively charged and if you remember
from<00:03:14.460> camon<00:03:14.910> physics<00:03:15.300> opposite<00:03:16.110> charges

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
from camon physics opposite charges

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.260 
from camon physics opposite charges
attract<00:03:16.770> so<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.130> DNA<00:03:17.370> will<00:03:17.610> be<00:03:17.730> attracted

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
attract so the DNA will be attracted

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.160 
attract so the DNA will be attracted
from<00:03:18.540> up<00:03:18.840> here<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.320> down<00:03:19.350> here<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:21.170> shorter

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
from up here to down here and shorter

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.400 
from up here to down here and shorter
fragments<00:03:22.640> move<00:03:23.640> through<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.120> gel<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:25.110> lot

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
fragments move through the gel a lot

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.910 
fragments move through the gel a lot
faster<00:03:26.010> than<00:03:26.510> longer<00:03:27.510> fragments<00:03:28.110> so<00:03:28.590> if<00:03:28.770> we

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
faster than longer fragments so if we

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.410 
faster than longer fragments so if we
turn<00:03:29.130> on<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.430> current<00:03:29.580> leave<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.180> for<00:03:30.240> a

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
turn on the current leave it on for a

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.620 
turn on the current leave it on for a
while<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.780> then<00:03:30.960> turn<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.350> off<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.970> DNA<00:03:33.390> will

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
while and then turn it off the DNA will

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.270 
while and then turn it off the DNA will
all<00:03:33.810> stop<00:03:34.170> at<00:03:34.410> different<00:03:34.770> locations

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
all stop at different locations

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.050 
all stop at different locations
according<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:36.060> their<00:03:36.660> lengths<00:03:37.580> so<00:03:38.580> all<00:03:38.850> the

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
according to their lengths so all the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.420 
according to their lengths so all the
fragments<00:03:39.600> of<00:03:39.720> DNA<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.380> given<00:03:40.770> band<00:03:41.100> that

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
fragments of DNA in a given band that

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.820 
fragments of DNA in a given band that
forms<00:03:41.910> all<00:03:42.420> have<00:03:42.960> the<00:03:43.110> same<00:03:43.350> length

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
forms all have the same length

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.810 
forms all have the same length
so<00:03:44.790> our<00:03:45.390> healthy<00:03:45.930> DNA<00:03:46.140> in<00:03:46.590> our<00:03:46.920> example<00:03:47.490> didn't

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
so our healthy DNA in our example didn't

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.250 
so our healthy DNA in our example didn't
have<00:03:47.910> any<00:03:48.090> restriction<00:03:48.570> sites<00:03:48.810> so<00:03:49.020> it<00:03:49.140> all

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
have any restriction sites so it all

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.690 
have any restriction sites so it all
stays<00:03:49.560> as<00:03:50.040> one<00:03:51.470> strand<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.950> thousand

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
stays as one strand of a thousand

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.150 
stays as one strand of a thousand
nucleotides<00:03:54.300> and<00:03:54.600> only<00:03:54.810> forms<00:03:55.110> one<00:03:55.320> band<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
nucleotides and only forms one band the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.420 
nucleotides and only forms one band the
mutated<00:03:56.640> DNA<00:03:56.670> did<00:03:57.540> have<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:58.230> restriction<00:03:59.040> site

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
mutated DNA did have a restriction site

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.750 
mutated DNA did have a restriction site
so<00:03:59.880> it<00:04:00.000> becomes<00:04:00.300> separated<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:01.080> makes<00:04:01.320> bands

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
so it becomes separated and makes bands

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.480 
so it becomes separated and makes bands
for<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.790> string<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.440> 600<00:04:04.440> nucleotides<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.250> a

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
for a string of 600 nucleotides and a

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.450 
for a string of 600 nucleotides and a
string<00:04:05.700> of<00:04:05.820> 400<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.570> then<00:04:07.290> we<00:04:07.560> can<00:04:07.740> see<00:04:07.950> that

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
string of 400 and then we can see that

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.670 
string of 400 and then we can see that
our<00:04:08.760> DNA<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.300> we<00:04:09.420> don't<00:04:09.600> know<00:04:09.780> about<00:04:09.930> form

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
our DNA that we don't know about form

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.740 
our DNA that we don't know about form
three<00:04:11.070> bands<00:04:11.310> one<00:04:11.730> at<00:04:11.970> a<00:04:12.000> thousand<00:04:12.570> base<00:04:12.720> pairs

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
three bands one at a thousand base pairs

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.490 
three bands one at a thousand base pairs
one<00:04:13.410> at<00:04:13.680> six<00:04:14.130> hundred<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.670> one<00:04:14.880> at<00:04:15.120> 400<00:04:15.930> so

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
one at six hundred and one at 400 so

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.620 
one at six hundred and one at 400 so
basically<00:04:16.830> what<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.280> tells<00:04:17.489> us<00:04:17.700> is<00:04:17.970> our<00:04:18.180> DNA

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
basically what that tells us is our DNA

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.660 
basically what that tells us is our DNA
was<00:04:18.989> mixed<00:04:19.440> some<00:04:19.739> of<00:04:19.859> it<00:04:19.950> was<00:04:20.070> healthy<00:04:20.460> which

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
was mixed some of it was healthy which

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.300 
was mixed some of it was healthy which
is<00:04:20.790> why<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:20.940> created<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.419> band<00:04:21.660> here<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.280> some<00:04:23.280> of

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
is why I created a band here and some of

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.520 
is why I created a band here and some of
it<00:04:23.520> was<00:04:23.700> not<00:04:23.729> which<00:04:24.510> is<00:04:24.690> why<00:04:24.720> restriction

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
it was not which is why restriction

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.190 
it was not which is why restriction
enzymes<00:04:25.860> were

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
enzymes were

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.100 
enzymes were
to<00:04:26.410> cut<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.620> and<00:04:26.950> cause<00:04:27.190> it<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.580> form<00:04:27.940> two<00:04:28.570> bands

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
to cut it and cause it to form two bands

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.020 
to cut it and cause it to form two bands
at<00:04:29.410> 600<00:04:30.220> base<00:04:30.370> pairs<00:04:30.640> and<00:04:30.760> 400<00:04:31.540> base<00:04:31.690> pairs<00:04:33.030> so

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
at 600 base pairs and 400 base pairs so

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.280 
at 600 base pairs and 400 base pairs so
the<00:04:34.150> last<00:04:34.300> thing<00:04:34.510> I'm<00:04:34.600> going<00:04:34.690> to<00:04:34.750> say<00:04:34.930> is<00:04:34.990> that

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
the last thing I'm going to say is that

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.930 
the last thing I'm going to say is that
the<00:04:35.380> previous<00:04:35.740> example<00:04:36.280> with<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.490> mutated

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
the previous example with the mutated

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.330 
the previous example with the mutated
DNA<00:04:36.970> and<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.420> healthy<00:04:37.720> DNA<00:04:38.010> explained<00:04:39.010> how

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
DNA and the healthy DNA explained how

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.010 
DNA and the healthy DNA explained how
gel<00:04:39.700> electrophoresis<00:04:40.120> can<00:04:40.540> be<00:04:40.660> used<00:04:40.810> in<00:04:40.960> a

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
gel electrophoresis can be used in a

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.750 
gel electrophoresis can be used in a
medical<00:04:41.380> context<00:04:41.920> but<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.190> can<00:04:42.280> also<00:04:42.400> be<00:04:42.610> used

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
medical context but it can also be used

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.400 
medical context but it can also be used
in<00:04:42.910> a<00:04:43.000> legal<00:04:43.330> context<00:04:43.750> as<00:04:43.870> part<00:04:44.080> of<00:04:44.140> a<00:04:44.230> crime

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
in a legal context as part of a crime

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.950 
in a legal context as part of a crime
scene<00:04:44.470> investigation<00:04:45.310> DNA<00:04:46.300> can<00:04:46.510> be<00:04:46.540> collected

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
scene investigation DNA can be collected

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.150 
scene investigation DNA can be collected
from<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.200> crime<00:04:47.320> scene<00:04:47.650> and<00:04:47.830> from<00:04:47.950> any

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
from the crime scene and from any

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.010 
from the crime scene and from any
suspects<00:04:48.790> and<00:04:49.240> all<00:04:49.390> of<00:04:49.510> its<00:04:49.660> mixed<00:04:49.930> with

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
suspects and all of its mixed with

suspects and all of its mixed with
restriction<00:04:50.470> enzymes<00:04:50.830> like<00:04:50.950> before<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.550> put

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
restriction enzymes like before and put

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.940 
restriction enzymes like before and put
the<00:04:51.820> gel<00:04:52.030> electrophoresis<00:04:52.450> all<00:04:53.140> the<00:04:53.530> DNA<00:04:53.830> is

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
the gel electrophoresis all the DNA is

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.010 
the gel electrophoresis all the DNA is
going<00:04:54.130> to<00:04:54.190> make<00:04:54.340> bands<00:04:54.640> and<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.600> suspect

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
going to make bands and the suspect

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.840 
going to make bands and the suspect
whose<00:04:56.170> DNA<00:04:56.530> makes<00:04:56.770> bands<00:04:57.070> at<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.310> same<00:04:57.580> places

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
whose DNA makes bands at the same places

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.670 
whose DNA makes bands at the same places
that<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.240> crime<00:04:58.450> scene<00:04:58.480> DNA<00:04:58.930> does<00:04:59.260> is<00:04:59.470> likely

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
that the crime scene DNA does is likely

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.860 
that the crime scene DNA does is likely
the<00:04:59.920> culprit<00:05:00.070> so<00:05:00.820> in<00:05:00.940> this<00:05:01.060> case<00:05:01.300> it's<00:05:01.480> suspect

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
the culprit so in this case it's suspect

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.930 
the culprit so in this case it's suspect
2<00:05:02.050> because<00:05:02.470> his<00:05:02.680> or<00:05:02.830> her<00:05:02.950> DNA<00:05:03.190> made<00:05:03.640> bands

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
2 because his or her DNA made bands

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.640 
2 because his or her DNA made bands
exactly<00:05:04.450> where<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:04.780> DNA<00:05:05.230> from<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:05.530> crime

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
exactly where the DNA from the crime

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.520 
exactly where the DNA from the crime
scene<00:05:06.010> did<00:05:06.220> and<00:05:06.520> that<00:05:07.150> tells<00:05:07.420> us<00:05:07.600> that<00:05:07.900> the<00:05:08.320> two

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
scene did and that tells us that the two

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.850 
scene did and that tells us that the two
DNA<00:05:09.310> samples<00:05:09.550> have<00:05:10.540> restriction<00:05:11.500> sites<00:05:11.710> at

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
DNA samples have restriction sites at

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.650 
DNA samples have restriction sites at
the<00:05:11.890> same<00:05:11.950> places<00:05:12.370> which<00:05:12.850> means<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.270> DNA

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
the same places which means the DNA

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.380 
the same places which means the DNA
sequences<00:05:14.290> are<00:05:14.590> probably<00:05:15.100> the<00:05:15.280> same<00:05:15.550> and<00:05:16.000> if

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
sequences are probably the same and if

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.090 
sequences are probably the same and if
the<00:05:16.540> DNA<00:05:16.840> sequences<00:05:17.350> are<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:17.560> same<00:05:17.770> they're

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
the DNA sequences are the same they're

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.000 
the DNA sequences are the same they're
from<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:18.400> same<00:05:18.580> person<00:05:19.020> so<00:05:20.020> I<00:05:20.530> hope<00:05:20.860> this

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
from the same person so I hope this

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.370 
from the same person so I hope this
video<00:05:21.190> was<00:05:21.430> helpful<00:05:22.180> to<00:05:22.210> you<00:05:22.270> guys<00:05:22.510> and<00:05:22.930> good

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
video was helpful to you guys and good

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.530 
video was helpful to you guys and good
