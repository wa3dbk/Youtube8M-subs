00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.630
 reindeer to tear is not true we're going to 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.759
 leave the burner and let's put 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.679
 our chilitos until now 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.659
 the chilito will start to inflate the skin 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.549
 we remove them as it is well roasted 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.709
 we keep all its sides in one 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.509
 bag we make a little nudity is formed 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.039
 wins for his day after we leave 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.929
 directly to the jet of water we remove 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.409
 seeds veins and skin and we make our 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.259
 races and we add them in this step 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.509
 that is sautéed in butter not what 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.819
 we bring to the blender please and what 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.429
 we are going to grind and that is fine with what 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:12.420
 let's grind with an egg I'm going 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.220
 adding while andy the egg 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.110
 because this is going to bake then 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.790
 I need to have several elements that I 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.640
 help the pasta stick 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.069
 perfectly correct and that and one of 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.629
 the elements to paste is exactly 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.489
 the egg that dropped a little bit of 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.489
 onion my table is clean nothing happens 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.200
 we add it very well now then as 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.629
 this is a thread that you have to 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.670
 see green at the time that I add the 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.099
 other ingredients poblano chile 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.810
 begins to lose tone no longer looks so 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.670
 green because I'm going to grab cream cheese 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.260
 because I'm going to add milk that I can 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.569
 make my thread keep seeing 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.390
 green with the flavor of the crayon poblano 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.220
 that no negatives in the tin bar what 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.530
 that we are going to add that although this 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.989
 spinach does not change the taste does not 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.780
 feels so much the taste of spinach and 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.160
 if it gives me a lot of color it could 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.959
 do it with some other herb and it's 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.609
 so for example I would not do it with 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.260
 epazote because I pass text not 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.160
 I would need a lot of t 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.140
 give the color 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.180
 but the taste will change me could 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.980
 be it maybe with parsley with parsley 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.130
 If I could do it but I would do what 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.080
 is much more would much that I can 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.000
 whiten do is arrange it give 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.860
 a pre-cook and then add run 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.730
 very well then now he added milk 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:28.580
 evaporated salt and pepper nothing more 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.019
 let's now add the sauce here and I 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.840
 help you with a little stick with this 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.640
 same with a miserable to start 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.409
 mix to mix and here raquel because 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.250
 this is not wasted and does not respond 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:43.160
 well to the one minute blender and with 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.110
 what we nothing else while I 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.269
 I have my oven ready because I put it on 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.500
 preheat then the first thing I did 180 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.360
 degrees 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.900
 we add a few hours and of 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.450
 step you cool and this is the third 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.519
 element that helps us unite the 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.250
 pasta then added is your cheese 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.480
 exactly and it is a manchego cheese can 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.579
 be any other cheese but 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.140
 We need that free and mix it 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:08.390
 well alright alright alright if we need a 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.769
 mold that is threaded my mold is 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.629
 this type of the and licona two are 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.940
 very easy to unmold are the 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.709
 plastas and leaves the library flying 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.229
 Maybe it's you but it happens they do not have 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.359
 these molds without need to grease 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.460
 but like this is a one but like this 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.620
 is a cake can you grease with a 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.600
 little butter put crushed bread 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.770
 we do the same in the same technique 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.590
 every day now well to all parties 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.030
 we perfectly remove all the excess and 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.410
 we add the pasta 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.650
 this paste once it is already in the 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.660
 mold we go to the oven at 180 degrees and 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.900
 we are going to leave approximately between 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.820
 25 and 30 minutes important sir 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.640
 barcelata and fat 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.610
 I will not unmold until in tibi a 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.200
 little when the lasagna if the pasta is 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.690
 they cut at the moment they leave the 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.460
 the oven is falling apart I'm a little bit 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.230
 cool a little bit nothing else I say 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.060
 can unmold come to the 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.760

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:16.950
 the court look and instead of presenting it 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.780
