00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
actually happen now two things I don't

think<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.829> great<00:00:37.950> idea<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:39.180> don't

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
think it's a great idea and I don't

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.389 
think it's a great idea and I don't
think<00:00:39.780> they<00:00:39.899> will<00:00:40.020> implement<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.739> long<00:00:41.160> and

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
think they will implement it long and

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.270 
think they will implement it long and
short<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.960> reasoning<00:00:42.960> being<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:43.950> EA

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
short of it reasoning being is if EA

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.389

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.620 
Ronaldo they might have ebro they might
have<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.399> know<00:01:44.430> Xavi<00:01:45.030> or<00:01:45.149> something<00:01:45.509> like

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
have you know Xavi or something like

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.840 
have you know Xavi or something like
that<00:01:45.689> as<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.320> progress<00:01:46.560> up<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.250> levels<00:01:47.640> in

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
that as you progress up your levels in

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.730 
that as you progress up your levels in
FIFA<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:48.990> what<00:01:49.170> I'm<00:01:49.259> thinking<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
FIFA so that's what I'm thinking the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.789 
FIFA so that's what I'm thinking the
only<00:01:49.979> way<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.670> EA<00:01:50.850> will<00:01:51.149> include<00:01:51.689> loans<00:01:52.380> in

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
only way that EA will include loans in

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.310 
only way that EA will include loans in
their<00:01:53.130> actual<00:01:53.610> game<00:01:53.970> mode<00:01:54.240> because<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.990> think

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
their actual game mode because I think

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.289 
their actual game mode because I think
it'll<00:01:55.439> really<00:01:55.799> kill<00:01:56.219> pack<00:01:56.520> sales<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:57.119> they

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
it'll really kill pack sales if they

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.569 
it'll really kill pack sales if they
fully<00:01:57.960> implement<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.770> into<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.219> game<00:01:59.399> where

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
fully implement it into the game where

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.370 
fully implement it into the game where
people<00:01:59.820> can<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.119> infinitely<00:02:00.750> loan<00:02:01.049> players

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
people can just infinitely loan players

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.319 
people can just infinitely loan players
to<00:02:01.680> each<00:02:01.829> other<00:02:02.070> don't<00:02:02.700> think<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.149> going<00:02:03.270> to

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
to each other don't think it's going to

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.850 
to each other don't think it's going to
