the<00:03:30.890> last<00:03:31.130> thing<00:03:31.400> to<00:03:31.430> do<00:03:31.730> is<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.300> make<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.480> cutout

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
the last thing to do is to make a cutout

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.980 
the last thing to do is to make a cutout
in<00:03:33.230> this<00:03:33.740> steering<00:03:34.040> wheel<00:03:34.340> cover<00:03:34.780> now<00:03:35.780> what

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
in this steering wheel cover now what

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.890 
in this steering wheel cover now what
I've<00:03:36.110> done<00:03:36.140> here<00:03:36.320> is<00:03:36.800> made<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.430> template<00:03:37.970> from

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
I've done here is made a template from

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.940 
I've done here is made a template from
the<00:03:39.020> donor<00:03:39.290> car<00:03:39.620> in<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.160> junkyard<00:03:41.950> transfer

the donor car in the junkyard transfer

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.520 
the donor car in the junkyard transfer
that<00:03:43.280> over<00:03:43.550> to<00:03:43.760> this<00:03:44.060> car<00:03:44.360> that<00:03:45.110> didn't<00:03:45.380> have

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
that over to this car that didn't have

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.100 
that over to this car that didn't have
the<00:03:45.710> cutout<00:03:48.100> that<00:03:49.100> I<00:03:49.130> used<00:03:49.430> a<00:03:49.610> small<00:03:50.110> coping

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
the cutout that I used a small coping

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:59.680 
the cutout that I used a small coping
saw<00:03:51.410> to<00:03:52.310> make<00:03:52.490> the<00:03:52.640> cut

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.810 

now<00:04:00.260> when<00:04:00.470> you<00:04:00.560> mount<00:04:00.770> the<00:04:00.920> switch<00:04:01.250> you'll

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
now when you mount the switch you'll

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.450 
now when you mount the switch you'll
find<00:04:02.210> the<00:04:02.710> electrical<00:04:03.710> connector<00:04:04.190> for<00:04:04.340> the

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
find the electrical connector for the

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.570 
find the electrical connector for the
switch<00:04:04.760> is<00:04:05.330> taped<00:04:05.900> to<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.320> wires<00:04:07.660> underneath

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
switch is taped to the wires underneath

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.850 
switch is taped to the wires underneath
the<00:04:10.580> steering<00:04:11.120> wheel

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.270 

clip<00:04:15.670> that<00:04:15.910> into<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.660> switch<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.799> can<00:04:17.980> only<00:04:18.070> go

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
clip that into the switch it can only go

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.580 
clip that into the switch it can only go
in<00:04:18.310> one<00:04:18.459> way

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.360 

then<00:04:22.160> you'll<00:04:22.340> find<00:04:22.700> that<00:04:23.030> there<00:04:23.720> are<00:04:23.870> two<00:04:24.410> pre

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
then you'll find that there are two pre

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.800 
then you'll find that there are two pre
tapped<00:04:25.639> holes<00:04:26.030> in<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:27.110> steering<00:04:27.530> wheel

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
tapped holes in the steering wheel

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.230 
tapped holes in the steering wheel
hopefully<00:04:29.810> you<00:04:30.500> remove<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.160> two<00:04:31.460> Phillips

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
hopefully you remove the two Phillips

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.300 
hopefully you remove the two Phillips
head<00:04:32.330> screws<00:04:32.480> from<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.380> dota<00:04:33.710> car<00:04:36.310> that's

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
head screws from the dota car that's

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.270 
head screws from the dota car that's
just<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.610> matter<00:04:37.850> of<00:04:38.680> installing<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:41.169> switch

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
just a matter of installing the switch

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:50.340 
just a matter of installing the switch
with<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.310> screws

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.900 

after<00:04:51.160> that<00:04:52.110> that<00:04:53.110> is<00:04:53.260> a<00:04:53.290> matter<00:04:53.650> of

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.510 

putting<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:57.000> airbag<00:04:57.480> on<00:04:57.750> and<00:04:58.190> hopefully<00:04:59.190> the

putting the airbag on and hopefully the

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.240 
putting the airbag on and hopefully the
system<00:04:59.940> works<00:05:00.210> now<00:05:00.620> if<00:05:01.620> it<00:05:01.740> doesn't<00:05:02.100> work

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
system works now if it doesn't work

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.850 
system works now if it doesn't work
