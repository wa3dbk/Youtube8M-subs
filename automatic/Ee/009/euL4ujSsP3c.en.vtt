want to show you a product it's been the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.850 
want to show you a product it's been the
secret<00:00:13.790> of<00:00:14.030> Auto<00:00:14.210> Detailers<00:00:14.780> for<00:00:15.080> years<00:00:15.320> the

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
secret of Auto Detailers for years the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.370 
secret of Auto Detailers for years the
cyclo<00:00:16.309> dual<00:00:16.610> headed<00:00:16.820> polisher<00:00:17.420> why<00:00:18.140> is<00:00:18.200> it

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
cyclo dual headed polisher why is it

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.350 
cyclo dual headed polisher why is it
such<00:00:18.529> a<00:00:18.560> great<00:00:18.740> tool<00:00:19.009> well<00:00:19.610> the<00:00:19.699> secret<00:00:20.119> is<00:00:20.180> in

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
such a great tool well the secret is in

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.390 
such a great tool well the secret is in
the<00:00:20.449> design<00:00:20.779> the<00:00:21.440> dual<00:00:21.680> orbiting<00:00:22.160> heads

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
the design the dual orbiting heads

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.370 
the design the dual orbiting heads
oscillate<00:00:23.000> in<00:00:23.119> unison<00:00:23.539> allowing<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.140> entire

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
oscillate in unison allowing the entire

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.870 
oscillate in unison allowing the entire
polishing<00:00:24.980> head<00:00:25.130> to<00:00:25.310> move<00:00:25.490> with<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:25.730> same

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
polishing head to move with the same

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.390 
polishing head to move with the same
velocity<00:00:25.939> and<00:00:26.779> this<00:00:27.380> action<00:00:27.740> removed<00:00:28.070> swirl

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
velocity and this action removed swirl

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.009 
velocity and this action removed swirl
marks<00:00:28.609> while<00:00:29.060> maintaining<00:00:29.269> a<00:00:29.570> low<00:00:29.750> surface

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
marks while maintaining a low surface

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.200 
marks while maintaining a low surface
temperature<00:00:30.619> making<00:00:31.250> it<00:00:31.340> very<00:00:31.580> difficult<00:00:31.730> to

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
temperature making it very difficult to

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.090 
temperature making it very difficult to
burn<00:00:32.419> through<00:00:32.599> the<00:00:32.720> paint<00:00:32.989> and<00:00:33.260> because<00:00:33.949> it's

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
burn through the paint and because it's

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.229 
burn through the paint and because it's
so<00:00:34.250> difficult<00:00:34.489> to<00:00:34.820> burn<00:00:34.970> through<00:00:35.210> that

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
so difficult to burn through that

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.060 
so difficult to burn through that
expensive<00:00:35.809> paint<00:00:36.050> job<00:00:36.260> you<00:00:36.500> will<00:00:36.830> have<00:00:36.949> the

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
expensive paint job you will have the

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.890 
expensive paint job you will have the
confidence<00:00:37.309> to<00:00:37.580> buff<00:00:37.850> your<00:00:38.030> car<00:00:38.269> knowing<00:00:38.780> it's

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
confidence to buff your car knowing it's

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.210 
confidence to buff your car knowing it's
going<00:00:39.050> to<00:00:39.170> look<00:00:39.290> great<00:00:39.440> when<00:00:39.739> you're<00:00:39.860> finished

I just bought the section of our Fox

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.509 
I just bought the section of our Fox
Body<00:00:42.080> Mustang<00:00:42.199> hood<00:00:42.710> to<00:00:42.890> show<00:00:43.010> you<00:00:43.070> how<00:00:43.250> easy

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
Body Mustang hood to show you how easy

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.189 
Body Mustang hood to show you how easy
it<00:00:43.670> is<00:00:43.790> to<00:00:43.970> use<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.150> cyclo<00:00:44.510> polisher

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
it is to use a cyclo polisher

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:46.750 
it is to use a cyclo polisher
we<00:00:45.500> use<00:00:45.620> a<00:00:45.680> few<00:00:45.860> different<00:00:45.979> polishing<00:00:46.549> pads

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
we use a few different polishing pads

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.460 
we use a few different polishing pads
some<00:00:46.970> aggressive<00:00:47.420> to<00:00:47.510> find<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:48.170> make<00:00:48.290> that

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
some aggressive to find to make that

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.810 
some aggressive to find to make that
section<00:00:48.799> of<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:48.920> hood<00:00:49.129> look<00:00:49.280> almost<00:00:49.489> new

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
section of the hood look almost new

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.460 
section of the hood look almost new
again<00:00:50.120> you'll<00:00:50.629> also<00:00:50.809> see<00:00:51.140> that<00:00:51.260> you<00:00:51.350> can

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
again you'll also see that you can

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.320 
again you'll also see that you can
operate<00:00:51.830> this<00:00:52.100> buffing<00:00:52.460> with<00:00:52.549> one<00:00:52.790> hand<00:00:53.120> and

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
operate this buffing with one hand and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.630 
operate this buffing with one hand and
I'll<00:00:53.900> even<00:00:54.019> hold<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:54.440> in<00:00:54.500> one<00:00:54.650> spot<00:00:54.710> on<00:00:55.280> a<00:00:55.369> ridge

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
I'll even hold it in one spot on a ridge

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.490 
I'll even hold it in one spot on a ridge
of<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.790> body<00:00:56.089> to<00:00:56.510> show<00:00:56.690> you<00:00:56.750> how<00:00:56.869> difficult<00:00:57.409> it

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
of the body to show you how difficult it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.410 
of the body to show you how difficult it
is<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:57.619> burn<00:00:57.890> through<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:58.220> paint<00:00:58.460> then<00:00:59.239> we'll

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
is to burn through the paint then we'll

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.329 
is to burn through the paint then we'll
compare<00:00:59.690> to<00:00:59.839> some<00:00:59.989> competition<00:01:00.650> let's<00:01:01.129> take<00:01:01.309> a

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
compare to some competition let's take a

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.690 
compare to some competition let's take a
look<00:01:01.580> at<00:01:01.670> how<00:01:01.760> we<00:01:01.820> made<00:01:02.150> this<00:01:02.360> shine
