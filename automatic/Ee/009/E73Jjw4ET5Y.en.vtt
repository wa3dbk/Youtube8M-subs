and you see the two deep I mean

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.730 
and you see the two deep I mean
literally<00:01:33.230> three<00:01:33.530> dressers<00:01:34.120> 12<00:01:35.120> and<00:01:35.780> I<00:01:36.410> guess

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
literally three dressers 12 and I guess

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.100

you could say for but I mean it's super

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.570 
you could say for but I mean it's super
fast<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.500> set<00:01:39.680> up<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:39.920> literally<00:01:40.130> takes<00:01:40.400> me

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
fast to set up it literally takes me

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.040 
fast to set up it literally takes me
here<00:01:40.970> let's<00:01:41.150> just<00:01:41.300> let's<00:01:41.480> just<00:01:41.540> count<00:01:41.810> how

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
here let's just let's just count how

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
slight protection so here we're going to

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.680 
slight protection so here we're going to
slide<00:02:16.790> protect<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.269> left<00:02:17.450> side<00:02:17.569> of<00:02:17.599> the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
slide protect to the left side of the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.199 
slide protect to the left side of the
screen<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.170> as<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.410> see<00:02:18.650> ya<00:02:19.340> maybe<00:02:19.670> maybe<00:02:20.030> it

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
screen and as you see ya maybe maybe it

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.850 
screen and as you see ya maybe maybe it
picks<00:02:20.420> up<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.720> left<00:02:21.170> side<00:02:21.319> pressure<00:02:21.530> but<00:02:21.769> the

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
picks up the left side pressure but the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.050 
picks up the left side pressure but the
right<00:02:22.010> side<00:02:22.220> still<00:02:22.460> comes<00:02:22.640> in<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:22.910> only

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
right side still comes in and the only

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.400 
right side still comes in and the only
reason<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.510> picked<00:02:23.720> up<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.050> left<00:02:24.260> side

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
reason it picked up the left side

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.440 
reason it picked up the left side
pressure<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:25.250> because<00:02:25.520> my<00:02:25.640> linebacker<00:02:25.880> moved

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
pressure it because my linebacker moved

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.400 
pressure it because my linebacker moved
to<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.750> inside<00:02:26.780> you

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
to the inside you

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.990 
to the inside you
he<00:02:27.560> moves<00:02:27.800> now<00:02:28.040> he's<00:02:28.220> back<00:02:28.430> where<00:02:28.610> he<00:02:28.670> should

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
he moves now he's back where he should

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.810 
he moves now he's back where he should
be<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.950> now<00:02:30.950> we're<00:02:31.100> ready<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.310> go<00:02:31.520> and
