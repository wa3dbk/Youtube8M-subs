00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 welcome back two new motto 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.160
 region this time around again 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.099
 harnik essay so I already have it 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.719
 made a video but that was just a stop 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.150
 bit without the right exaggerated 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.170
 shadow the gsl shader like and now 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.519
 I thought I had a few 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.929
 changed files 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.850
 and now we also have as I believe 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.560
 I do not know if I'm hardly one of those 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.180
 download offers with the hot water 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.830
 here with the slogan shader in it 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.029
 That's why I'm putting this murder to you 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.160
 today just before with my 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.900
 meditated files with my 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.900
 mediated files he so until 3 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.489
 So again the tipper in sonic at 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.140
 shader with already is lit 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.510
 exaggeratedly cool the reflection everything 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.239
 is there the cool water is there 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.110
 everything is just right 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.909
 As it should be 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.680
 at most signage version it is 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.210
 yes, in the meantime as you want them 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.320
 have me that the water is still normal 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.760
 because the people can not handle it 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.729
 that fix organic then I think 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.519
 just did it and you 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.540
 looks really bright and how can 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.519
 they play really cool 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.690
 Unfortunately, I have to tell you this time 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.670
 i will give you some files for you 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.159
 download download yes you have to 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.869
 you put yourselves together because of me 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.800
 This time I can give this unfortunately 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.509
 Do not give it to a few more 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.409
 things in the minecraft point minecraft 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.420
 to pack folders 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.330
 but from there on, it's cool 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.409
 I would say that and for further 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.060
 start here 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.490
 it 's relatively cool I started with that 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.119
 street vigorous bacon that's going right 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.830
 hot 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.330
 You also have to go for the custom colossus 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.259
 I have them here I can do them 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.009
 but show it off is it 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.600
 and yes you can see it all 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.890
 everything lights up the problem is here 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.300
 you have to have a nice text 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.940
 if you do not use shader 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.739
 use it like this and it will 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.229
 I probably none now even the 

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:50.629
 probably nobody would have to with one 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.030
 Use technology to customize these colors 

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:54.679
 for example, as a recipient of hollywood 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.629
 Show that they are not so tingling 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:00.890
 suitable because it has cool effects 

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:02.869
 but it's a bit like that 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.310
 you should not show up you can already see 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.750
 but now, if you can 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.759
 that's what you pay attention to about 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.910
 small water spots or if I am now 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.440
 a bit of 11 house rangehe 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.720
 simple it is relatively strong as 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.739
 if it had rained here otherwise 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.390
 actually looks cool with 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.129
 shader but if you look at this 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.830
 whole reflection looks then one thinks 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.780
 something different here for example 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.670
 up there reflects your departure 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.410
 the stone I was so wanted is that 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.000
 It looks and that's the way it is 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.220
 very cool with the hollywood texture pack 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.129
 or up here everything is wet to share 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.510
 from the faraway group back there 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.980
 so cool too 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.200
 I have to say with the svi it ​​works 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.780
 Simply the best and now 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.340
 for installation until now yes to 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.930
 installation as mentioned 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.760
 For this you need a few specific 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.120
 files first of all these files 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.000
 the in the points 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.799
 the minecraft year come for that thank you 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.860
 I just join you together where once 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:58.560
 the whole minecraft inschallah part 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.159
 there is something and something else 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.659
 I will show you soon 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.400
 that's all in the microsoft charlie 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.349
 meter m word do not forget between that 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.879
 motto then still works if so 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.140
 your best without murder or gambling because 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.569
 I think it was with me with modeling 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.579
 not so we go back one 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.140
 and here on this point 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.049
 minecraft folder and timo its folder 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.340
 with the shaders purely yes so so many 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.959
 files will be in there, I 'll give you everything 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.459
 Just pack it and then he just grabs it 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.530
 here all shaders folder in here 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.120
 and as I said in the point in this 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.140
 minecraft changed all that 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.049
 that was it already from 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.519
 installations this review and we 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.170
 See you again next time oh 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.730
 by the way, I have the place five stars 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.829
 because he just me no atmosphere 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.579
 ends 5 between friend of mine 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.579
 for this mod
