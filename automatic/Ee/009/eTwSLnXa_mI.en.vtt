by<00:02:08.349> then<00:02:08.560> but<00:02:09.310> then<00:02:09.459> people<00:02:09.670> will<00:02:09.910> start

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
by then but then people will start

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.790 
by then but then people will start
learning<00:02:10.270> who<00:02:10.539> he<00:02:10.660> is<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:11.050> think<00:02:11.080> they<00:02:11.349> if<00:02:11.620> he

learning who he is I think they if he
wants<00:02:12.280> he<00:02:12.340> fights<00:02:12.580> on<00:02:12.670> HBO<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.120> his<00:02:13.330> next
