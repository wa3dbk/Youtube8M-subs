00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
there to make one hole bigger and then

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.109 
there to make one hole bigger and then
clear<00:01:11.369> out<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.700> little<00:01:11.909> extra<00:01:12.950> pieces<00:01:14.119> take

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
your paper clip that you unfolded stick

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.460 
your paper clip that you unfolded stick
that<00:01:19.440> into<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.190> bigger<00:01:20.399> hole<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.290> twirl<00:01:22.290> it

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
that into the bigger hole and twirl it

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.680 
that into the bigger hole and twirl it
around<00:01:22.560> as<00:01:23.040> much<00:01:23.280> as<00:01:23.490> possible<00:01:23.759> basically

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
around as much as possible basically

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.800 
around as much as possible basically
you're<00:01:24.930> scrambling<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:26.610> egg<00:01:26.940> inside<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
you're scrambling the egg inside of the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.480 
you're scrambling the egg inside of the
shelf<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.649> the<00:01:28.979> yolk<00:01:29.460> will<00:01:29.700> come<00:01:29.940> out<00:01:30.119> easier

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
shelf so the yolk will come out easier

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.029 
shelf so the yolk will come out easier
then<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.820> take<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.300> which<00:01:33.690> is<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.899> baby<00:01:34.229> snot

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
then you take this which is a baby snot

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.580 
then you take this which is a baby snot
sucker<00:01:35.550> thingy<00:01:36.330> I<00:01:36.720> don't<00:01:36.899> really<00:01:37.200> know<00:01:37.410> what

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
sucker thingy I don't really know what

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.070 
sucker thingy I don't really know what
their<00:01:37.740> name<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.130> those<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.570> put<00:01:39.869> that

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
their name is on those but you put that

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.190 
their name is on those but you put that
so<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:40.860> over<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.550> smaller<00:01:42.149> end<00:01:42.539> of<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.840> egg

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
so it's over the smaller end of the egg

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.800 
so it's over the smaller end of the egg
and<00:01:43.820> shoot<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.060> air<00:01:45.300> through<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:47.810> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
and shoot the air through so that the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.660 
and shoot the air through so that the
egg<00:01:49.140> starts<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.830> come<00:01:50.399> out<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:53.369> then<00:01:53.490> you

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
egg starts to come out and then you

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.050 
egg starts to come out and then you
squeeze<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.570> air<00:01:54.750> through<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:56.610> smaller

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
squeeze the air through that smaller

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.979 
squeeze the air through that smaller
hole<00:01:57.739> until<00:01:58.739> the<00:01:58.860> egg<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.489> completely<00:01:59.789> empty

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:00.989 
hole until the egg is completely empty

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:03.859 
hole until the egg is completely empty
okay<00:02:01.649> then<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.099> put<00:02:02.459> some<00:02:02.640> water<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.569> it<00:02:03.660> once

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
okay then you put some water in it once

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.240 
okay then you put some water in it once
it's<00:02:04.080> completely<00:02:04.649> empty<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:06.860> squirt<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.099> air

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
it's completely empty and squirt the air

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.639 
it's completely empty and squirt the air
so<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.700> water<00:02:08.910> comes<00:02:09.300> out<00:02:09.479> basically<00:02:10.410> you

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
so the water comes out basically you

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.190 
so the water comes out basically you
want<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.009> get<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.000> egg<00:02:12.180> as<00:02:12.480> clean<00:02:12.930> as<00:02:13.170> possible

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
want to get the egg as clean as possible

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.570 
want to get the egg as clean as possible
on<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.099> inside<00:02:14.580> just<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.630> there's<00:02:15.840> no

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
on the inside just so there's no

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.510 
on the inside just so there's no
leftover<00:02:17.580> egg<00:02:18.060> gunk<00:02:18.720> or<00:02:18.959> anything<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:20.010> after
