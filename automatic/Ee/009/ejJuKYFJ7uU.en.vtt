lots<00:03:14.340> ha<00:03:14.820> maybe<00:03:15.269> I'll<00:03:15.480> figure<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.930> out<00:03:16.049> but

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
lots ha maybe I'll figure it out but

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.350 
lots ha maybe I'll figure it out but
that's<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.590> charger<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.130> guess<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.640> plugs<00:03:18.269> on

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
that's the charger I guess I plugs on

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.979 
that's the charger I guess I plugs on
the<00:03:18.420> wall<00:03:18.570> we<00:03:19.530> got<00:03:19.769> ourselves<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.610> USB<00:03:21.390> which

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
the wall we got ourselves the USB which

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.259 
the wall we got ourselves the USB which
I<00:03:22.290> believe<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.160> can<00:03:23.310> also<00:03:23.459> charged<00:03:23.850> with<00:03:23.940> this

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
I believe you can also charged with this

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.060 
I believe you can also charged with this
I<00:03:24.480> could<00:03:24.780> be<00:03:24.870> wrong<00:03:25.079> because<00:03:25.590> they<00:03:25.829> have<00:03:25.980> an

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
I could be wrong because they have an

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.979 
I could be wrong because they have an
outlet<00:03:26.400> for<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.670> charger<00:03:27.030> but<00:03:27.209> this<00:03:27.660> is<00:03:27.780> also

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
outlet for the charger but this is also

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.229 
outlet for the charger but this is also
for<00:03:28.440> data<00:03:29.010> transferring<00:03:29.640> if<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:29.940> would<00:03:30.090> like

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239

there's like a mess all the mess ah

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.009 
there's like a mess all the mess ah
let's<00:06:45.819> see<00:06:45.909> if<00:06:46.059> i<00:06:46.149> can<00:06:46.300> actually<00:06:46.629> get<00:06:46.719> a<00:06:46.779> little

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:47.019 
let's see if i can actually get a little

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:48.679 
let's see if i can actually get a little
walk<00:06:47.169> around<00:06:47.199> with<00:06:47.619> Heartland<00:06:48.039> with<00:06:48.249> this<00:06:48.399> um

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:48.689 
walk around with Heartland with this um

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:51.389 
walk around with Heartland with this um
but<00:06:49.689> besides<00:06:50.139> that<00:06:50.289> it<00:06:50.679> seems<00:06:50.949> pretty<00:06:51.129> cool<00:06:51.339> i

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:51.399 
but besides that it seems pretty cool i

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:52.799 
but besides that it seems pretty cool i
can<00:06:51.639> actually<00:06:51.939> probably<00:06:52.089> extend<00:06:52.509> this<00:06:52.569> to<00:06:52.629> go

00:06:52.799 --> 00:06:52.809 
can actually probably extend this to go

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:59.850 
can actually probably extend this to go
farther<00:06:53.199> maybe<00:06:53.679> or<00:06:54.389> closer<00:06:55.389> as<00:06:56.079> well<00:06:56.319> so
