00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:18.768
 Grommash plays an important part in the new expansion, and its appearance 

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:22.207
 it had to reflect this role. Players will love it. 

00:00:22.207 --> 00:00:25.467
 What stimulates me the most is allowing me to show 

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:28.385
 to our fans how an Orc is made up close. 

00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:31.430
 If he seems alive and ready to attack you, then we have reached our goal. 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.996
 He is an incredible character. Every time we make one of these projects for Blizzard 

00:00:34.996 --> 00:00:36.810
 in the end we are always proud of the result. 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.168
 Represents a sculptor's dream. 

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:49.090
 - We will never be slaves! 

00:00:49.972 --> 00:00:53.377
 Grommash has been present in the history of Warcraft for a long time. 

00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:58.439
 We must give this statue a truly epic appearance. 

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:01.546
 The first thing we do is build the maquette, the form model. 

00:01:01.546 --> 00:01:06.425
 It is a preliminary sculpture that shows the essence of the final product. 

00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:09.102
 Normally these are drafts, but sometimes they are completely complete, 

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:10.616
 as in the case of Grommash. 

00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:14.825
 We decided to use my maquette because 

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:18.304
 it is in a pose that seems to be screaming at you. 

00:01:18.304 --> 00:01:21.809
 I am very excited at the thought of Steve's work. 

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:28.577
 I'm Steve Wang and these are the Alliance Studios. 

00:01:28.577 --> 00:01:32.778
 We create concept art, 3D sculptures, printing and digital modeling ... 

00:01:32.778 --> 00:01:35.338
 the whole process to create statues for video game companies. 

00:01:35.338 --> 00:01:37.692
 We have been working with Blizzard for about 10 years. 

00:01:37.692 --> 00:01:40.920
 The first project for Blizzard that I made was Nova. 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.350
 Then there were Illidan, Kerrigan, Jim Raynor and Tyrael. 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.856
 The work of Steve Wang and his staff is superb. 

00:01:50.856 --> 00:01:53.143
 We have been working together for about 10 years. 

00:01:53.143 --> 00:01:57.818
 A different experience, with the same level of commitment and pursuit of quality, 

00:01:57.818 --> 00:02:01.365
 but now he has a fully equipped studio and is one of the best artists in the world. 

00:02:01.365 --> 00:02:04.569
 He started using a lot of 3D technology and now 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.504
 can work in the right environment, which guarantees a better result. 

00:02:07.504 --> 00:02:12.060
 We scanned the maquette, so Eddie processed it 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.396
 and we printed it with the right proportions 

00:02:14.396 --> 00:02:16.812
 to have a sort of physical reference in scale of the sculpture. 

00:02:16.983 --> 00:02:21.152
 Now we will build the armor, that is the skeleton of the sculpture. 

00:02:21.152 --> 00:02:23.603
 How long do you think it will take to build it? 

00:02:23.603 --> 00:02:25.778
 We have calculated about 4 months. 

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:29.681
 In the next two weeks we will have to study and create the internal framework. 

00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:31.573
 It will take another two weeks to start work. 

00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:34.053
 Hey, look how big it is! - It will be epic! 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.930
 Today let's look at the skeleton of Hellscream, 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.156
 full version and full size, 

00:02:43.156 --> 00:02:46.064
 to better understand the proportions and the height. 

00:02:46.064 --> 00:02:50.102
 We designed the skeleton in CAD and separated all the pieces, 

00:02:50.102 --> 00:02:52.486
 to create them individually and then weld them together. 

00:02:52.607 --> 00:02:56.032
 This is a good representation of what we are going to build. 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.930
 I don't want it to look too small. Initially I was worried 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.857
 because he was bent and seeing only the skeleton 

00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:05.270
 I didn't know the complete mass. 

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:08.784
 I want you to inspire a sense of command and not get lost in the crowd. 

00:03:08.784 --> 00:03:12.024
 I think people use it as a meeting place. 

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:16.666
 Looking at him, I think it's better to raise him a little. 

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:18.460
 Just to make it even more impressive. 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.060
 Here, I believe this is the ideal height. 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.776
 The thing that has always struck me most about Steve is that 

00:03:25.776 --> 00:03:28.654
 create these incredible sculptures and then I come and tell them: 

00:03:28.654 --> 00:03:31.382
 "Hey, we have to stretch this particular" and I expect him to react badly, saying: 

00:03:31.382 --> 00:03:33.432
 "What do you want me to do to my beautiful sculpture?!?" 

00:03:33.432 --> 00:03:36.662
 Instead he takes the knife and starts scratching the surface 

00:03:36.662 --> 00:03:39.634
 of an almost finished sculpture, and says: "I have to cut here and here ..." 

00:03:39.634 --> 00:03:41.432
 He is very professional in his work. 

00:03:41.432 --> 00:03:44.761
 He knows perfectly well that, to get the best result, there is no excuse: 

00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:45.795
 you do what you need to do. 

00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:49.488
 After working with Nick for 10 years and knowing his tastes, 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.414
 I know he cares about every little detail. 

00:03:52.985 --> 00:03:55.718
 We are ready. It will be a real challenge, 

00:03:55.718 --> 00:03:56.916
 but it will also be a lot of fun. 

00:04:02.568 --> 00:04:05.274
 The base is beautiful. 

00:04:05.406 --> 00:04:09.010
 It makes it even more impressive. You see the demon he killed, 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.031
 which tells the story of how the Orcs were enslaved. 

00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:15.159
 And now he is above the demon, as if declaring his superiority. 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.293
 It has been shrunk, isn't it? 

00:04:18.293 --> 00:04:23.029
 When we made the Mannoroth maquette it was torn to pieces. 

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:26.810
 shrunken and placed under Grommash's feet. I thought it wouldn't work 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.545
 because in the movie this part is not seen. 

00:04:28.545 --> 00:04:30.648
 There is only him who falls from above, but then the video is cut. 

00:04:33.934 --> 00:04:36.701
 There will be smoke coming out of the mouth, right? 

00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:39.702
 It will come out of the teeth. You'll see, it will be spectacular. 

00:04:39.702 --> 00:04:44.522
 An eye animation will give the idea that they are closing, as if they were dying. 

00:04:44.522 --> 00:04:45.371
 Oh, great! 

00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:47.949
 Yeah, very nice. - We will also work on that. 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.899
 It will be great to see each other! 

00:04:56.466 --> 00:04:59.368
 In a project like this there is a great deal of elements: 

00:04:59.368 --> 00:05:02.481
 pieces of armor, the ax that holds ... 

00:05:02.481 --> 00:05:05.218
 All these pieces are made individually 

00:05:05.218 --> 00:05:07.195
 and then they are taken and mounted on the final sculpture. 

00:05:07.195 --> 00:05:09.991
 It's about managing the timing. 

00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:13.885
 If you plan well in advance and all departments are ready at the same time, 

00:05:13.885 --> 00:05:16.473
 production is optimized. 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.272
 The progress that Steve and his team are making is incredible. 

00:05:22.272 --> 00:05:25.478
 The speed with which they are able to create products of this quality 

00:05:25.478 --> 00:05:27.173
 it's something you've never seen before. 

00:05:27.173 --> 00:05:28.641
 Oh God! 

00:05:28.641 --> 00:05:31.155
 There is a story behind every piece of armor, 

00:05:31.155 --> 00:05:34.613
 every clothing item: aging tells the story. 

00:05:34.613 --> 00:05:38.273
 I hope World of Warcraft fans can recognize all the stories 

00:05:38.273 --> 00:05:40.801
 who lived this character. It would be wonderful. 

00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:43.040
 How beautiful. Already! 

00:05:43.828 --> 00:05:45.795
 I can't wait for the world to admire it. 

00:05:45.795 --> 00:05:47.972
 When we show it at BlizzCon it will be a moment 

00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:49.284
 really special.
