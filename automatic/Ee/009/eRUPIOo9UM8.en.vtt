 as of your seriously 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.140
 you have to think everyone in the box will believe 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.670
 better when in the world almost almost 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.260

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.000
 the service of champions hard and dale 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.830
 hard and the injuries that go carry and 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.870
 we are the banks a blind 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.400
 that we just have to be there as 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.530
 nice kids you will say they are going to do all the 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.970
 work basically we are the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.650
 banks and the useless good for nothing 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.700
 initial from there or continue 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.260
 saying that they are going to get all the 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.180
 crisis and scouring and then what I say 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.650
 youtube these abuses always end 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.250
 giving the first blood and for some things 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.660
 extremely stupid as a child pictures 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.420
 about none my computer with its 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.670
 I really wanted to raise the ration but I 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.700
 he froze another his mental powers and post 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.230
 He killed me but you let him pass because I say 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.730
 we all make mistakes and it's also 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.140
 cannon when a child arrives and freezes you 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.360
 with his mental powers and take out the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.140
 laser beams and I do not know how many cochinadas 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.140
 plus 10 as of 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.410
 27 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.090
 just freeze a Chinese end if 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.580
 the game does not even spend five minutes with 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.500
 soccer when dying and it's like hey what 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.640
 that was sure is that I study a lot 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.440
 that I get a little advantage 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.140
 because if it would not be super easy and I would 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.580
 I would win everything simple here and then I say 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.290
 what fun is that is not a 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.610
 but we have to have fun then 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.460
 a little bit of challenges before the disadvantage 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.780
 to win and all because then what 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.610
 they kill again and the angry pipeline 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.230
 threatens that it will be affected that 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.690
 goes has the game have the same 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.010
 excuses of always two angry doing 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.990
 tantrums like a child three years 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.310
 the worst of all is that I've had to see 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.920
 people who effectively makes a 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.780
 high number like platinum or diamonds and 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.400
 who play for the dog it seems that 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.200
 I play with my legs and seriously sometimes 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.660
 you wonder what happens in their little heads 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.520
 because they take out every stupidity that sometimes 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.440
 it is difficult to ignore it is difficult to 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.930
 ignore human stupidity sometimes not 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.450
 has borders do not have limits thing 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.060
 I do not know where to buy it in your account or 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.700

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.640

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.640

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.709

 Couples that do but already talking in 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.739
 serious is annoying to meet this guy 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.180
 of people trying to impress 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.099
 the others that end up being about 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.109
 talkers at the moment when you 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.060

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.359
 good but most are extremely 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.519
 bad if it's like I do not know who cheated on us 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.680

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.599
