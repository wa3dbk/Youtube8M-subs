00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.180
 and if the theme of environmental protection we always find here at the great fair 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.149
 in the summer to the mi also and the ronchi also 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:16.349
 the strand of bar and bar the houses of or compatible sony we talk like and romina 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:21.250
 bar and of course the family's deus ex machina in the 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.400
 try to propose these new housing solutions 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.789
 Exactly we try to bring the culture of low energy houses 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.200
 the culture that natives the Nordic countries here in Italy but revisiting I have the 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.460
 buildings that are here in germany in aosta etc. there is giving them 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.400
 clothes that Italian and therefore we say the most beautiful eccotii 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.340
 and searching does not mean that it is sensitizing the population to 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.019
 environmental speech network 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.329
 created this all green stand behind you too you never have green but 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.439
 totalerg and dangerous that made you the night before will ask us if they saw it 

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:56.429
 to lose 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:58.420
 grass plants etc. 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.060
 yes, because we wanted to make people understand that we make them natural belcase 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.010
 home and church made with material that books nature so as if it was born 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 road the terrain e 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.899
 exact for the house now is no longer the home of twenty years ago not poop 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:19.360
 view 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.009
 a continuation of nature therefore a non-invasive element that does not consume 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.060
 too much fuel that here is no love generator 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.340
 you help this the reason why in addition to creating passive houses ttmenu 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.270
 they require heating and maintenance costs 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.600
 shoddy shipping damage nature because they require you to burn 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.860
 fuels tar us in we always want to cause some systems 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.409
 photovoltaic and solar systems on shit roofs 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.929
 exploiting the roof for cultivated silver meat also does not harm 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.859
 the environment here is therefore not only friends of nature but also this is a 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:55.979
 important possibility to save 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.659
 solaris change on energy in short 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.100
 have this possibility of being more and more self-sufficient autonomous 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.420
 without going to invasive steps towards the world around us 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.940
 you are just so the house has always been seen 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.590
 how is an object that one can afford to accidentally make me home 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.660
 who knows if we can keep it from the land register to be built in the ancients 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.349
 kind source of income 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.860
 I'm a friend, I'm at home, it doesn't cost me anything and moreover I take the 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:28.129
 incentives for the key of the significant plants here are some reserves 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.299
 in building these things, you can't do it easily in any 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.049
 area in whatever for her 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.860
 absolutely there are no constraints even there are provinces of italy 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.320
 unfortunately, not the province of Cuneo that gives economic incentives operates 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.290
 of the strong discounts on the hard organization that builds this 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.320
 type of structures 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.849
 and therefore besides being able to be placed territorial asshole 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.329
 at the same time and save build because you are there 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:58.659
 and then from then on when you pass by your back pass by barbara's stand 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.829
 you can't miss seeing it from that drink 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.479
 unmistakable 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:07.099
 you also apply this rule with 8 legs very naturally home
