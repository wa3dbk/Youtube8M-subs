at<00:00:53.579> other<00:00:53.699> places<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.739> lot<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:55.980> times

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
at other places I do this a lot of times

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.220 
at other places I do this a lot of times
where<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.789> assumed<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.600> know<00:00:57.719> chains<00:00:58.050> are

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
where I just assumed you know chains are

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.930 
where I just assumed you know chains are
gonna<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.500> cheaper<00:00:58.920> but<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.160> actually<00:00:59.370> went<00:00:59.699> to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
gonna be cheaper but I actually went to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.460 
gonna be cheaper but I actually went to
a<00:00:59.969> place<00:01:00.390> called<00:01:00.829> lll<00:01:01.829> reptile<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:03.080> San<00:01:04.080> Diego

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
a place called lll reptile in San Diego

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.280 
a place called lll reptile in San Diego
and<00:01:04.710> they<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> few<00:01:05.369> locations<00:01:06.290> but

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and they have a few locations but

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.440 
and they have a few locations but
they're<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> little<00:01:08.369> bit<00:01:08.580> smaller<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.240> know<00:01:09.420> I

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
they're a little bit smaller you know I

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.210 
they're a little bit smaller you know I
think<00:01:09.630> they're<00:01:09.900> franchised<00:01:10.409> out<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:10.979> they

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
think they're franchised out so they

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.070 
think they're franchised out so they
have<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> little<00:01:11.610> bit<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.939> room<00:01:12.510> as<00:01:12.720> far<00:01:12.930> as

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
have a little bit of room as far as

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.560 
have a little bit of room as far as
flexibility<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> price<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.330> ended

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
flexibility on the price and so I ended

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.260 
flexibility on the price and so I ended

really seems to like it so that helps
you<00:03:50.609> cut<00:03:50.910> down<00:03:51.060> on<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.329> hassle<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.750> crickets<00:03:52.079> a

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
you cut down on the hassle of crickets a

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.970 
you cut down on the hassle of crickets a
little<00:03:52.380> bit<00:03:53.269> other<00:03:54.269> things<00:03:54.799> that<00:03:55.799> I<00:03:55.829> would

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
little bit other things that I would

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.530 
little bit other things that I would
suggest<00:03:56.190> when<00:03:56.730> you're<00:03:56.880> first<00:03:57.150> setting<00:03:57.329> up

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
suggest when you're first setting up

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.569 
suggest when you're first setting up
your<00:03:57.660> tank<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.920> can<00:03:59.100> see<00:03:59.370> I<00:03:59.400> have<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.840> jellyfish

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
your tank you can see I have a jellyfish

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.460 
your tank you can see I have a jellyfish
wallpaper<00:04:02.579> design<00:04:03.090> on<00:04:03.329> this<00:04:03.989> side<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.380> the

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
wallpaper design on this side of the

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.650 
wallpaper design on this side of the
tank<00:04:04.650> as<00:04:04.799> well<00:04:04.859> as<00:04:05.489> this<00:04:06.000> side<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.450> tank

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
tank as well as this side of the tank

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.620 
tank as well as this side of the tank
and<00:04:07.579> although<00:04:08.579> it<00:04:08.700> looks<00:04:08.880> a<00:04:08.970> little<00:04:09.090> bit<00:04:09.269> weird

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
and although it looks a little bit weird

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.750 
and although it looks a little bit weird
it<00:04:09.780> really<00:04:10.019> helps<00:04:10.440> cut<00:04:10.799> down<00:04:10.829> on<00:04:11.310> the

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
it really helps cut down on the

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.150 
it really helps cut down on the
reflection<00:04:12.239> off<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.810> glass<00:04:13.049> that<00:04:13.470> your

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
reflection off the glass that your

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.130 
reflection off the glass that your
bearded<00:04:14.519> dragon<00:04:14.579> can<00:04:15.090> see<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.600> I<00:04:15.720> noticed

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
bearded dragon can see and I noticed

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.800 
bearded dragon can see and I noticed
when<00:04:17.100> I<00:04:17.160> first<00:04:17.519> put<00:04:17.850> her<00:04:18.000> in<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.239> tank<00:04:18.450> she<00:04:18.690> was

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
when I first put her in the tank she was

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.210 
when I first put her in the tank she was
getting<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.109> little<00:04:19.229> bit<00:04:19.440> nervous<00:04:19.739> of<00:04:20.100> her

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
getting a little bit nervous of her

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.969 
getting a little bit nervous of her
reflection<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.289> I<00:04:22.289> found<00:04:22.530> that<00:04:22.680> that's<00:04:22.800> a

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
reflection and I found that that's a

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.860 
reflection and I found that that's a
pretty<00:04:23.130> common<00:04:23.550> problem<00:04:23.760> I<00:04:24.090> saw<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.599> lot<00:04:24.840> of

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
pretty common problem I saw a lot of

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.360 
pretty common problem I saw a lot of
people<00:04:25.050> talking<00:04:25.409> about<00:04:25.560> it<00:04:25.710> on<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.010> Internet

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
people talking about it on the Internet

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.680 
people talking about it on the Internet
so<00:04:26.909> I<00:04:26.940> just<00:04:27.210> came<00:04:27.360> up<00:04:27.419> with

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
so I just came up with

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.410 
so I just came up with
simple<00:04:28.080> solution<00:04:28.530> I<00:04:28.740> would<00:04:29.340> say<00:04:29.670> just<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.120> fine

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
simple solution I would say just a fine

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.120 
simple solution I would say just a fine
this<00:04:30.810> is<00:04:30.930> actually<00:04:31.200> out<00:04:31.320> of<00:04:31.440> an<00:04:31.530> old<00:04:31.740> calendar

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
this is actually out of an old calendar

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.330 
this is actually out of an old calendar
so<00:04:33.090> you<00:04:33.120> can<00:04:33.300> just<00:04:33.660> cut<00:04:33.990> out<00:04:34.140> the<00:04:34.440> pages<00:04:35.130> that

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
so you can just cut out the pages that

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.360 
so you can just cut out the pages that
you<00:04:35.790> like<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.390> most<00:04:36.420> I<00:04:37.200> at<00:04:37.920> least<00:04:38.070> try<00:04:38.310> to

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
you like the most I at least try to

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.250 
you like the most I at least try to
match<00:04:38.640> it<00:04:38.670> so<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.090> got<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.510> two<00:04:39.660> jellyfish

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.540 

maybe<00:04:43.260> you'll<00:04:43.470> have<00:04:43.590> some<00:04:44.070> sort<00:04:44.310> of<00:04:44.370> better

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
maybe you'll have some sort of better

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.430 
maybe you'll have some sort of better
calendar<00:04:45.120> or<00:04:45.210> something<00:04:45.510> cooler<00:04:45.840> on<00:04:46.020> it<00:04:46.170> but

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
calendar or something cooler on it but

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.280 
calendar or something cooler on it but
it<00:04:46.920> works<00:04:47.130> really<00:04:47.340> well<00:04:47.610> I<00:04:48.480> noticed<00:04:49.110> that<00:04:49.200> when

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
it works really well I noticed that when

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.230 
it works really well I noticed that when
I<00:04:49.350> put<00:04:49.590> him<00:04:49.680> in<00:04:49.740> there<00:04:49.920> she<00:04:50.520> calmed<00:04:50.850> down<00:04:50.910> a<00:04:51.000> lot

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
I put him in there she calmed down a lot

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.620 
I put him in there she calmed down a lot
as<00:04:51.450> far<00:04:51.480> as<00:04:51.750> she<00:04:52.470> would<00:04:52.590> eat<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:53.100> lot<00:04:53.340> more

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
as far as she would eat a lot more

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.550 
as far as she would eat a lot more
confidently<00:04:54.630> and<00:04:55.400> she<00:04:56.400> didn't<00:04:56.640> really<00:04:56.880> ever

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
confidently and she didn't really ever

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.560 
confidently and she didn't really ever
second-guess<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.770> reflections<00:04:59.340> anymore<00:04:59.760> so

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
second-guess the reflections anymore so

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.440 
second-guess the reflections anymore so
that's<00:05:01.530> something<00:05:01.890> that<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:02.940> can<00:05:03.090> do<00:05:03.180> if<00:05:03.330> you

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
that's something that you can do if you

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.850 
that's something that you can do if you
notice<00:05:03.720> your<00:05:03.870> bearded<00:05:04.170> dragon<00:05:04.230> is<00:05:04.530> a<00:05:04.590> little

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
notice your bearded dragon is a little

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.740 
notice your bearded dragon is a little
bit<00:05:04.950> more<00:05:05.130> nervous<00:05:05.370> when<00:05:05.700> she<00:05:05.760> gets<00:05:06.030> into<00:05:06.240> or

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
bit more nervous when she gets into or

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.700 
bit more nervous when she gets into or
and<00:05:06.990> he<00:05:07.170> or<00:05:07.230> she<00:05:07.380> gets<00:05:07.530> into<00:05:07.770> her<00:05:08.160> new<00:05:08.430> setup

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
and he or she gets into her new setup

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.100 
and he or she gets into her new setup
other<00:05:10.710> than<00:05:10.980> that<00:05:11.100> I<00:05:11.130> would<00:05:11.310> just<00:05:11.520> say<00:05:12.110> when

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
other than that I would just say when

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.360 
other than that I would just say when
you<00:05:13.200> go<00:05:13.350> in<00:05:13.470> to<00:05:13.560> handle<00:05:13.890> your<00:05:14.040> bearded<00:05:14.310> dragon

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
you go in to handle your bearded dragon

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.490 
you go in to handle your bearded dragon
for<00:05:14.730> the<00:05:14.790> first<00:05:15.000> time<00:05:15.270> of<00:05:15.570> course<00:05:15.900> you<00:05:16.410> know

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
for the first time of course you know

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.800 
for the first time of course you know
give<00:05:16.890> her<00:05:17.010> her<00:05:17.580> him<00:05:17.880> a<00:05:17.910> couple<00:05:18.210> days<00:05:18.450> to<00:05:18.720> get

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
give her her him a couple days to get

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.540 
give her her him a couple days to get
used<00:05:19.050> to<00:05:19.170> the<00:05:19.320> setup<00:05:19.620> before<00:05:19.800> you<00:05:20.070> really<00:05:20.340> try

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
used to the setup before you really try

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.530 
used to the setup before you really try
to<00:05:20.610> poke<00:05:21.120> and<00:05:21.300> prod<00:05:21.510> at<00:05:21.780> her<00:05:22.940> but<00:05:23.940> after<00:05:24.120> a<00:05:24.330> few

days you can kind of feel it out certain

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.060

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.210 
start to get really stressed out you can
definitely<00:06:28.020> see<00:06:28.410> a<00:06:28.440> change<00:06:28.500> they'll<00:06:29.040> get

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
definitely see a change they'll get

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.970 
definitely see a change they'll get
really<00:06:29.430> black<00:06:29.880> and<00:06:30.180> they'll<00:06:30.960> develop<00:06:31.260> like<00:06:31.620> it

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980 
really black and they'll develop like it

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.680 
really black and they'll develop like it
looks<00:06:32.160> kind<00:06:32.400> of<00:06:32.430> like<00:06:32.550> a<00:06:32.580> quilted<00:06:33.150> pattern<00:06:33.419> on

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
looks kind of like a quilted pattern on

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.580 
looks kind of like a quilted pattern on
their<00:06:33.840> stomach<00:06:34.200> of<00:06:34.380> black<00:06:34.680> diamonds<00:06:35.610> and<00:06:36.590> when

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
their stomach of black diamonds and when

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.710 
their stomach of black diamonds and when
your<00:06:37.710> bearded<00:06:37.979> dragons<00:06:38.310> doing<00:06:38.550> that<00:06:38.729> she's

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
your bearded dragons doing that she's

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.000 
your bearded dragons doing that she's
probably<00:06:39.930> a<00:06:40.050> little<00:06:40.200> bit<00:06:40.320> stressed<00:06:40.590> out<00:06:40.770> and

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
probably a little bit stressed out and

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.510 
probably a little bit stressed out and
that's<00:06:41.220> some

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
that's some

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.100 
that's some
that<00:06:41.759> if<00:06:41.849> you<00:06:41.940> notice<00:06:42.150> happening<00:06:42.660> a<00:06:42.720> lot<00:06:42.900> when

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
that if you notice happening a lot when

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.749 
that if you notice happening a lot when
nothing's<00:06:43.440> really<00:06:43.590> going<00:06:43.710> on<00:06:44.069> that<00:06:44.370> might<00:06:44.550> be

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 
nothing's really going on that might be

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:47.240 
nothing's really going on that might be
because<00:06:44.910> of<00:06:45.120> the<00:06:45.240> tank<00:06:45.539> reflection<00:06:46.139> and<00:06:46.319> at

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
because of the tank reflection and at

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.189 
because of the tank reflection and at
that<00:06:47.400> point<00:06:47.669> I<00:06:47.759> would<00:06:47.819> say<00:06:47.910> you<00:06:48.810> might<00:06:48.960> want<00:06:49.139> to

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 
that point I would say you might want to

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.969 
that point I would say you might want to
put<00:06:49.430> some<00:06:50.430> sort<00:06:50.610> of<00:06:50.669> insert<00:06:51.030> on<00:06:51.210> the<00:06:51.240> inside

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:51.979 
put some sort of insert on the inside

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:53.600 
put some sort of insert on the inside
something<00:06:52.979> you<00:06:53.039> don't<00:06:53.159> really<00:06:53.250> care<00:06:53.520> about

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
something you don't really care about

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.920 
something you don't really care about
because<00:06:53.849> it<00:06:54.000> probably<00:06:54.120> will<00:06:54.360> get<00:06:54.509> dirty<00:06:54.690> and

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
because it probably will get dirty and

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.610 
because it probably will get dirty and
you<00:06:55.050> might<00:06:55.199> have<00:06:55.379> to<00:06:55.500> change<00:06:55.680> it<00:06:55.860> out<00:06:55.979> so<00:06:56.759> I

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
you might have to change it out so I

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.680 
you might have to change it out so I
guess<00:06:58.620> that's<00:06:58.770> pretty<00:06:59.009> much<00:06:59.129> it<00:06:59.400> if<00:07:00.270> you<00:07:00.569> have

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
guess that's pretty much it if you have

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.390 
guess that's pretty much it if you have
any<00:07:00.720> questions<00:07:01.259> feel<00:07:01.590> free<00:07:01.620> to<00:07:01.949> message<00:07:02.190> me

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
any questions feel free to message me

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.390 
any questions feel free to message me
otherwise<00:07:03.289> enjoy<00:07:04.289> your<00:07:04.530> first<00:07:04.800> bearded
