00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.029 
damn now watch out for that tornado that
reminds<00:00:21.210> me<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.510> Putin's<00:00:22.080> fatality<00:00:22.859> from

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
reminds me of Putin's fatality from

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.210 
reminds me of Putin's fatality from
Mortal<00:00:23.430> Kombat<00:00:23.760> 4<00:00:24.029> it's<00:00:25.019> very<00:00:25.170> devastating

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.519 

and<00:00:29.220> apparently<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.269> all<00:00:30.480> she<00:00:30.510> does<00:00:31.080> she

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
and apparently this is all she does she

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.010 
and apparently this is all she does she
just<00:00:31.560> danced<00:00:32.460> their<00:00:32.850> way<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.480> be<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.870> hitter

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
just danced their way to be the hitter

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.389 
just danced their way to be the hitter
then<00:00:34.500> she<00:00:34.680> turns<00:00:34.950> into<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.309> tornado<00:00:35.700> and

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
then she turns into this tornado and

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:46.450 
then she turns into this tornado and
that's<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:40.100> it<00:00:41.100> requires<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.059> patient

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.550 

but<00:00:47.460> there<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.060> rare<00:00:48.239> occasion<00:00:48.930> what<00:00:49.200> he

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
but there is the rare occasion what he

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.960 
but there is the rare occasion what he
will<00:00:49.829> hitch<00:00:50.220> she<00:00:50.730> will<00:00:50.910> hit<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:52.880> even<00:00:53.880> though

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
will hitch she will hit you even though

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.190 
will hitch she will hit you even though
it<00:00:54.090> doesn't<00:00:54.239> look<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.600> she's<00:00:54.809> doing

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
it doesn't look like she's doing

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.549 
it doesn't look like she's doing
anything<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:56.300> guess<00:00:57.300> didn't<00:00:57.629> bother<00:00:57.840> making<00:00:58.200> a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
anything I guess didn't bother making a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:06.040 
anything I guess didn't bother making a
proper<00:00:59.280> sprites<00:00:59.790> for<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.330> kind<00:01:00.540> of<00:01:00.570> action<00:01:00.870> I

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:13.370 

thought<00:01:07.050> that<00:01:07.110> laziness

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.360 

come<00:01:14.009> on<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:14.610> better<00:01:14.790> than<00:01:15.119> this

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.830 

what<00:01:19.970> time's<00:01:20.150> going<00:01:20.360> to<00:01:20.450> hit<00:01:20.660> her<00:01:20.750> anyway<00:01:21.170> like

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
what time's going to hit her anyway like

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.170 
what time's going to hit her anyway like
like<00:01:23.840> I've<00:01:24.020> seen<00:01:24.230> women<00:01:24.470> hit<00:01:25.040> a<00:01:25.250> lot<00:01:25.610> they

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
like I've seen women hit a lot they

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.740 
like I've seen women hit a lot they
don't<00:01:26.360> take<00:01:26.540> that<00:01:26.690> much<00:01:28.270> what<00:01:29.270> some<00:01:29.510> don't

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
don't take that much what some don't

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.640 
don't take that much what some don't
anyway<00:01:31.360> so<00:01:32.360> it<00:01:32.510> is<00:01:32.630> very<00:01:32.810> unfortunate<00:01:33.080> that

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
anyway so it is very unfortunate that

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.880 
anyway so it is very unfortunate that
women<00:01:34.010> get<00:01:34.160> abused<00:01:35.080> sad<00:01:36.080> but<00:01:36.650> it's<00:01:36.800> true

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
women get abused sad but it's true

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.590 
women get abused sad but it's true
that's<00:01:37.820> reality<00:01:38.120> we<00:01:38.510> live<00:01:38.690> in<00:01:40.390> some<00:01:41.390> guys

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
that's reality we live in some guys

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.810 
that's reality we live in some guys
really<00:01:41.840> need<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.080> go<00:01:42.170> off

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.910 

for<00:01:49.420> me<00:01:49.540> I<00:01:49.570> get<00:01:49.930> an<00:01:50.020> excuse<00:01:50.440> because<00:01:50.560> this<00:01:50.770> is<00:01:50.890> a

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
for me I get an excuse because this is a

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.649 
for me I get an excuse because this is a
video<00:01:51.310> game<00:01:51.610> that<00:01:51.909> doesn't<00:01:52.180> mean<00:01:52.360> I<00:01:52.390> actually

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
video game that doesn't mean I actually
