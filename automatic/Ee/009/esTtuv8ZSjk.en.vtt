we<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:36.839> the<00:00:37.230> new<00:00:37.499> moon<00:00:37.710> solar<00:00:37.980> eclipse<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.910> on

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:39.179 
we have the new moon solar eclipse is on

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:42.619 
we have the new moon solar eclipse is on
june<00:00:39.420> first<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.109> at<00:00:40.260> 503<00:00:40.949> p.m.<00:00:41.600> eastern<00:00:42.600> time

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
june first it's at 503 p.m. eastern time

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.299 
june first it's at 503 p.m. eastern time
and<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.679> 11<00:00:44.100> degrees<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.609> gemini<00:00:45.409> so<00:00:46.409> with

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and that is 11 degrees of gemini so with

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.750 
and that is 11 degrees of gemini so with
that<00:00:47.640> energy<00:00:47.969> again<00:00:48.620> once<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.980> energy<00:00:50.489> has

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
that energy again once this energy has

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.209 
that energy again once this energy has
culminated<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:52.460> 2250<00:00:53.460> 3<00:00:53.850> p.m.<00:00:54.289> we<00:00:55.289> are<00:00:55.620> at<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
culminated in 2250 3 p.m. we are at the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.689 
culminated in 2250 3 p.m. we are at the
dark<00:00:56.429> of<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.579> Moon<00:00:56.789> beforehand<00:00:57.479> and<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:59.489> is

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
dark of the Moon beforehand and so it is

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.610 
dark of the Moon beforehand and so it is
important<00:01:00.179> that<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.479> wait<00:01:00.629> until<00:01:01.019> the<00:01:01.170> moon<00:01:01.350> is

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
important that we wait until the moon is

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.280 
important that we wait until the moon is
new<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.639> has<00:01:02.909> started<00:01:03.300> her<00:01:03.420> waxing<00:01:03.809> process

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
new and has started her waxing process

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.670 
new and has started her waxing process
even<00:01:04.559> though<00:01:04.680> she's<00:01:04.920> stuck<00:01:05.190> alright<00:01:06.229> 48<00:01:07.229> hours

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
even though she's stuck alright 48 hours

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.280 
even though she's stuck alright 48 hours
to<00:01:08.009> work<00:01:08.579> through<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.540> things<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.079> want

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
to work through the things that we want

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.499 
to work through the things that we want
to<00:01:10.380> manifest<00:01:10.979> write<00:01:11.939> these<00:01:12.090> things<00:01:12.149> down

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
to manifest write these things down

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.600 
to manifest write these things down
we'll<00:01:13.110> get<00:01:13.259> to<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.469> time<00:01:13.680> at<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.070> very<00:01:14.280> end<00:01:14.460> of

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
we'll get to the time at the very end of

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.050 
we'll get to the time at the very end of
the<00:01:14.700> video<00:01:14.850> all<00:01:15.479> right<00:01:15.860> there<00:01:16.860> 48<00:01:17.250> hours<00:01:17.759> all

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the video all right there 48 hours all

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.080 
the video all right there 48 hours all
together<00:01:18.619> so<00:01:19.619> what<00:01:19.829> we<00:01:19.950> need<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.219> do<00:01:20.369> when

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
together so what we need to do when

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.850 
together so what we need to do when
we're<00:01:21.390> working<00:01:21.600> with<00:01:22.079> a<00:01:22.439> gemini<00:01:23.280> new<00:01:24.210> moon

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
we're working with a gemini new moon

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.649 
we're working with a gemini new moon
which<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.009> also<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> solar<00:01:26.640> eclipse<00:01:26.820> eclipses

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
which is also a solar eclipse eclipses

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.810 
which is also a solar eclipse eclipses
are<00:01:27.780> very<00:01:28.439> powerful<00:01:28.979> because<00:01:29.100> they<00:01:29.369> propel<00:01:29.789> us

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
are very powerful because they propel us

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.700 
are very powerful because they propel us
and<00:01:30.119> move<00:01:30.270> us<00:01:30.390> forward<00:01:30.630> really<00:01:31.140> quickly

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
and move us forward really quickly

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.459 
and move us forward really quickly
faster<00:01:32.670> than<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:32.939> ever<00:01:33.149> expected<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:34.109> we're

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
faster than we ever expected and we're

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.139 
faster than we ever expected and we're
going<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.619> look<00:01:34.770> at<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.100> gemini<00:01:35.549> energy<00:01:35.969> and

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
going to look at the gemini energy and

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.880 
going to look at the gemini energy and
that<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.359> all<00:01:36.539> about<00:01:36.750> communications<00:01:37.649> that's

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
that is all about communications that's

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.190 
that is all about communications that's
about<00:01:38.130> writing<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.539> this<00:01:39.960> type<00:01:40.170> of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
about writing it is this type of

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.050 
about writing it is this type of
communication<00:01:40.439> as<00:01:41.130> well<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.729> know<00:01:41.850> through

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
communication as well you know through

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.389 
communication as well you know through
video<00:01:43.310> skype<00:01:44.310> emails<00:01:45.149> all<00:01:45.420> kinds<00:01:46.140> of

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
video skype emails all kinds of

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.429 
video skype emails all kinds of
communication<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:48.179> we<00:01:48.359> can<00:01:48.509> maybe<00:01:48.750> expect

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
communication so we can maybe expect

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.459 
communication so we can maybe expect
some<00:01:49.710> advances<00:01:50.399> globally<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.469> our

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
some advances globally in our

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.240 
some advances globally in our
communication<00:01:53.310> technologies<00:01:54.200> on<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.259> personal

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
communication technologies on a personal

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.130 
communication technologies on a personal
level<00:01:56.310> we<00:01:56.939> can<00:01:57.119> expect<00:01:57.539> some<00:01:57.780> sort<00:01:58.079> of

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
level we can expect some sort of

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.910 
level we can expect some sort of
communication<00:01:59.149> issue<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.749> come<00:02:00.960> up<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.710> we're

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
communication issue to come up so we're

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.550 
communication issue to come up so we're
able<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.340> work<00:02:02.670> through<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.210> handle<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.259> so

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.650 
intertwined aspect to Saturn and that is
in<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.770> sign<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.010> Libra<00:02:16.700> still<00:02:17.120> retrograde

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
in the sign of Libra still retrograde

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.320 
in the sign of Libra still retrograde
but<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.170> point<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:18.680> is<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:20.060> know<00:02:20.150> we're

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
but the point is is that you know we're

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.960 
but the point is is that you know we're
really<00:02:20.570> able<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:21.290> communicate<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.370> see<00:02:22.730> now

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
really able to communicate and see now

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.940 
really able to communicate and see now
since<00:02:23.330> s<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:23.810> saturn<00:02:24.140> has<00:02:24.170> been<00:02:24.350> retrograde

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
since s and saturn has been retrograde

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.230 
since s and saturn has been retrograde
for<00:02:25.100> such<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.280> long<00:02:25.520> time<00:02:25.580> we<00:02:25.880> should<00:02:25.910> be<00:02:26.150> able

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
for such a long time we should be able

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.300 
for such a long time we should be able
to<00:02:26.420> see<00:02:26.600> what's<00:02:27.170> left<00:02:27.440> of<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.680> Foundation's

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
to see what's left of the Foundation's

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.400 
to see what's left of the Foundation's
within<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.850> relationships<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.720> actually

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
within the relationships that actually

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.140 
within the relationships that actually
have<00:02:30.560> survived<00:02:31.010> over<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.580> last<00:02:31.760> six<00:02:32.030> months

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
have survived over the last six months

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.340 
have survived over the last six months
and<00:02:32.630> were<00:02:33.560> able<00:02:33.740> to<00:02:34.040> build<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.240> rebuild<00:02:35.480> new

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
and were able to build and rebuild new

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.560 
and were able to build and rebuild new
foundations<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.100> communication<00:02:37.910> in<00:02:38.120> that

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
foundations of communication in that

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.080 
foundations of communication in that
regard<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:39.320> is<00:02:39.560> in<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.310> nutshell<00:02:40.520> to<00:02:40.910> me

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
regard and that is in a nutshell to me

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.510 
regard and that is in a nutshell to me
how<00:02:41.240> i<00:02:41.270> see<00:02:41.600> what<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:41.900> eclipse<00:02:42.290> is<00:02:42.650> about<00:02:43.010> to

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
how i see what this eclipse is about to

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.180 
how i see what this eclipse is about to
rebuilding<00:02:44.120> relationships<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.650> rebuilding

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
rebuilding relationships and rebuilding

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.190 
rebuilding relationships and rebuilding
our<00:02:46.310> communication<00:02:47.030> skills<00:02:47.360> with<00:02:47.600> those<00:02:47.840> that

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
our communication skills with those that

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.440 
our communication skills with those that
are<00:02:48.440> important<00:02:49.430> in<00:02:49.550> our<00:02:49.670> lives<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.209> whether

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
are important in our lives and whether

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.420 
are important in our lives and whether
it's<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.900> one-to-one<00:02:51.530> relationship<00:02:52.250> with

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
it's a one-to-one relationship with

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.340 
it's a one-to-one relationship with
somebody<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:52.820> you<00:02:53.120> know<00:02:53.150> whether<00:02:54.050> it's<00:02:54.230> your

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
somebody that you know whether it's your

spouse or a close friend or on the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.199 
spouse or a close friend or on the
global<00:02:57.650> level<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.250> could<00:02:58.490> be<00:02:58.610> between<00:02:58.880> nations

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
global level it could be between nations

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.480 
global level it could be between nations
so<00:03:00.200> we're<00:03:00.380> actually<00:03:00.560> looking<00:03:00.920> at<00:03:01.250> this

so we're actually looking at this

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.810 
so we're actually looking at this
eclipse<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.030> be<00:03:02.150> very<00:03:02.360> very<00:03:02.540> helpful<00:03:02.810> in

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
eclipse to be very very helpful in

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.840 
eclipse to be very very helpful in
opening<00:03:04.820> dialogue<00:03:05.090> back<00:03:05.930> up<00:03:06.430> alright<00:03:07.430> so<00:03:07.640> on

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.410 
the personal level though let's take a
peek<00:03:09.410> at<00:03:09.980> what<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.520> kind<00:03:10.910> of<00:03:10.970> things<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.330> we

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
peek at what the kind of things that we

as to what you're going to write down

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.720 
as to what you're going to write down
because<00:03:22.580> manifesting<00:03:23.209> is<00:03:23.330> really<00:03:23.810> quick<00:03:24.140> now

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
because manifesting is really quick now

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.340

like<00:05:33.050> this<00:05:33.080> or<00:05:33.500> you<00:05:33.889> know<00:05:33.979> focus<00:05:34.310> on<00:05:34.460> the<00:05:34.580> moon

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.640 
like this or you know focus on the moon
it's<00:05:35.270> great<00:05:35.479> not<00:05:35.630> to<00:05:35.810> do<00:05:35.960> anything<00:05:36.259> when<00:05:36.560> the

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
it's great not to do anything when the

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.980 
it's great not to do anything when the
moon<00:05:36.800> is<00:05:36.830> void<00:05:37.160> of<00:05:37.280> course<00:05:37.610> other<00:05:38.360> times<00:05:38.690> it

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599 
works but not in this instance so we

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.140 
works but not in this instance so we
have<00:05:41.810> 48<00:05:42.380> hours<00:05:42.410> to<00:05:43.009> write<00:05:43.490> out<00:05:43.669> our<00:05:43.699> new<00:05:43.970> moon
