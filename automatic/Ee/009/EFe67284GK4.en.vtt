00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 all three were added here 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.680
 commenting again and I bring you a new 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.420
 tutorial in this case where we're going to 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.519
 learn how to make a watermark in 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.320
 our videos without the need to use 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.170
 programs like the after effects that 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.449
 many people do not have the 4d cinema or the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.939
 sound case simply if we are 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.039
 windows users we will use the windows 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.390
 very unique that we live today 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.950
 practically all because it comes in 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.990
 serious 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.300
 and it's going to be very meaningful I've already achieved that 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.980
 let's see for example a video which 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.210
 we want to edit in this case I have 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.000
 caught a short so you see 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.440
 I just have uploaded and we're going to 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.700
 apply on the right button to open with 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.470
 windows live movie maker 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.510
 this is important if you do not find there 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.970
 the program you are just going to go 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.410
 here and I'm going to apply on windows that is 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.290
 in looking for vais to put windows in the 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.210
 Start bar 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.460
 and you set free too if you want 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.160
 good to subscribe 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.590
 you put there windows live the series of the month 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.760
 in the photo gallery and also 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.210
 We will leave the windows live movie 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.530
 maker that is no problem why 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.700
 good as making the brand water is very 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.770
 very simple simply 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.530
 what we are going to do is we leave in 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.960
 description is valid and we are going to put the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.729
 text that we want for example I use what 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.480
 use when I used watermark that did not 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.800
 it's always just put that 93 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.320
 all of 93 so I think it's fine 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.300
 and we are going to fix on a source of study 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.910
 as you want but I usually use 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.590
 a fountain I did not love or it's worth something 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.350
 A) Yes 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.860
 you can use the one you want, you know 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.170
 and what I do is now what we do 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.090
 reduce saving the square forgiveness to 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.670
 a size I intend without needing 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.290
 reduce it more the time here to reduce was 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.270
 something I do not even know how to reduce source 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.930
 and for example in this case we are going to 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.000
 put up here I recommend also 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.670
 depends what you want it will be 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.630
 see is true by the way so they look 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.630
 all the video just 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.690
 rich and the seconds you see the video 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.690
 by 699 directly that's fair 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.530
 so I forgot a step so it's not 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.990
 so on top of the paragraph liza 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.580
 transparent to transparency and you can 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.290
 adjust it worth it since it looks very 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.030
 a little bit until it 's 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.069
 completely opaque 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.170
 and leave it there for example worth 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.069
 he tells me to clean it and now more when 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.079
 let's save the video 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.299
 the last advice I give you is that 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.549
 It depends how you want it to look like it's worth 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.010
 example if your video in all the 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.870
 left part during the whole video 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.030
 it's practically going to have a black background 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.670
 the watermark is going to look more like 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.549
 You see, it's not difficult at any time 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.989
 see it or distinguish it if you want it to be 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.260
 see less so that it is less chanting 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.129
 example we can put it here 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.840
 and as you see that as you can see there is more 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:06.160
 camouflaged between the bars of 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.200
 swing 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.760
 although it is also singing as 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.070
 good as you want you can put it 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.440
 here also that is also quite 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.820
 comfortable even now you put it here in the 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.960
 light if I do not have to be in a 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.960
 corner although it looks nicer 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.860
 and that obviously also in addition to the 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.510
 font you can change the color by 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.270
 example we can put it in red for 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.220
 that you see - the truth the colors that 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.890
 more you see are black and white depends on 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.130
 they already use it but so good too 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.900
 we would have a watermark entered and already 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.860
 I tell you if you want for example to be 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.470
 well do not put that war of 93 and you have 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.740
 a mark 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.130
 in a double sense what's that called 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.500
 22 rows 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.720
 or if you want another font style then 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.720
 you can have a problem just 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:09.620
 just one thing has been done 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.879
 but you have your watermark like that 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.069
 when there is health now you know how to save 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.750
 movies for screen you have it 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.920
 for high definition screen 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.609
 recommended as you want 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.989
 why 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.910
 as for the guard 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.760
 you are going to have now I am not going to keep it 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.670
 because it takes 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.900
 but come on, there's no problem and 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.790
 good up here the tutorial today 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.950
 I may do a tutorial on how 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.590
 make a signature for example as those that 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.960
 you see some channels an animated signature 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.000
 that is pretty cool the truth is 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.830
 say with your logo turning like this in 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.420
 a corner of the video but for that 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.520
 we will need to use after effects 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.460
 so we'll see nothing next video 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.090
 and zamora the tutorial comment give it what 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.090
 what do you want 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.850
 this soon
