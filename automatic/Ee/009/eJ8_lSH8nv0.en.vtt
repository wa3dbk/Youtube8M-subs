your existing tap have isolating valves

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.800 
your existing tap have isolating valves
you<00:00:17.100> can<00:00:17.250> simply<00:00:17.670> turn<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.000> water<00:00:18.150> off<00:00:18.330> by

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
you can simply turn the water off by

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.019 
you can simply turn the water off by
turning<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.320> screw<00:00:19.350> head<00:00:19.830> or<00:00:20.010> handle<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:20.910> the

turning the screw head or handle on the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.150 
turning the screw head or handle on the
valve<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.660> at<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.869> right<00:00:22.260> angle<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
valve so it's at a right angle to the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.550 
valve so it's at a right angle to the
flow<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.490> pipe<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:24.410> parallel<00:00:25.410> position

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
these are compression fittings so we'll

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.690 
these are compression fittings so we'll
use<00:03:01.639> adjustable<00:03:02.209> wrenches<00:03:02.599> to<00:03:02.930> undo<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.349> nuts

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
next we need to loosen the clips that

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.150 
next we need to loosen the clips that
hold<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.120> sink<00:03:15.420> in<00:03:15.540> place<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:16.710> clips<00:03:17.010> are

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
right up under the worktop so it's

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.200 
right up under the worktop so it's
usually<00:03:19.260> easier<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:19.950> line<00:03:20.160> your<00:03:20.340> back<00:03:20.580> so<00:03:21.030> that

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
suitable waterproof sealant so the work

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.500 
suitable waterproof sealant so the work
