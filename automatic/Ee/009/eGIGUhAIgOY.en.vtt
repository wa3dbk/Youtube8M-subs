00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
cut on both sides just cut in all the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.689 
cut on both sides just cut in all the
way<00:00:57.809> around<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.649> then<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.010> flip<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.370> over<00:00:59.520> and

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
way around and then you flip it over and

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.760 
way around and then you flip it over and
you<00:00:59.850> cut<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> other<00:01:00.449> side<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.109> before<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.530> move

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
you cut the other side but before I move

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.740 
you cut the other side but before I move
the<00:01:01.949> ruler<00:01:02.129> I'm<00:01:02.460> going<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.120> cut<00:01:03.359> these

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the ruler I'm going to cut these

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.320 
the ruler I'm going to cut these
sections<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.559> are<00:01:04.619> going<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.070> be<00:01:05.220> woven<00:01:05.460> by

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
sections that are going to be woven by

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.910 
sections that are going to be woven by
placing<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> blade<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:08.460> cuts<00:01:08.820> every<00:01:09.360> inch

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
placing the blade and it cuts every inch

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.190 
placing the blade and it cuts every inch
so<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.640> very<00:01:12.570> quickly<00:01:13.020> and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
so you can do this very quickly and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.560 
so you can do this very quickly and
after<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.680> cut<00:01:13.920> one<00:01:14.130> side<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.210> flip<00:01:15.450> it

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
after you cut one side then you flip it

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.859 
after you cut one side then you flip it
over<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.430> identical<00:01:17.430> parallel<00:01:18.420> cuts

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
over so you have identical parallel cuts

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.350 
over so you have identical parallel cuts
cut<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> other<00:01:20.040> side<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.549> do<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.670> same<00:01:20.820> thing

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
cut the other side and do the same thing

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.039 
cut the other side and do the same thing
with<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.500> slots<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.310> weaving<00:01:23.759> area<00:01:24.119> then

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
with the slots for the weaving area then

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.399 
with the slots for the weaving area then
with<00:01:25.350> grosgrain<00:01:25.860> or<00:01:26.130> satin<00:01:26.549> ribbon<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.720> a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
bodkin have a tail at the end and then

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.999 
bodkin have a tail at the end and then
weave<00:01:33.630> every<00:01:34.290> other<00:01:35.360> section<00:01:36.619> just<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.860> we

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
weave every other section just like we

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.760 
weave every other section just like we
learned<00:01:38.220> how<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.400> do<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> long<00:01:38.909> time<00:01:39.180> ago<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.160 
learned how to do a long time ago and
keep<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:40.950> weaving<00:01:41.549> all<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.030> way<00:01:42.150> up<00:01:42.329> at<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
keep on weaving all the way up at the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.670 
keep on weaving all the way up at the
end<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> finished<00:01:44.820> edge

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
end so that you have a finished edge

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.969 
end so that you have a finished edge

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.950 
scarf you
see<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.610> could<00:02:14.940> have<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.540> ribbon

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
shorter than the fleece fabric so it

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.500 
shorter than the fleece fabric so it
