00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
me the power of a network and I've

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.680 
me the power of a network and I've
always<00:01:48.190> helped<00:01:48.430> people<00:01:48.490> you're<00:01:49.270> only<00:01:49.479> as

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
the viewers out there sure so one of the

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.490 
the viewers out there sure so one of the
main<00:04:18.239> reasons<00:04:18.599> we<00:04:18.719> love<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.109> Vanderbilt

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
main reasons we love the Vanderbilt

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.899 
main reasons we love the Vanderbilt
football<00:04:19.620> team<00:04:20.039> is<00:04:20.190> because<00:04:20.459> we<00:04:20.579> have<00:04:20.669> so<00:04:20.820> many

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
football team is because we have so many

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.580 
football team is because we have so many
fond<00:04:21.239> memories<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:21.719> tailgating

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
fond memories of tailgating

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.250 
fond memories of tailgating
for<00:04:23.180> Vanderbilt<00:04:24.180> football<00:04:24.300> games<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:25.050> back

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
for Vanderbilt football games and back

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.170 
for Vanderbilt football games and back
then<00:04:25.530> you<00:04:25.770> know<00:04:25.980> the<00:04:26.250> team<00:04:26.460> wasn't<00:04:26.790> very<00:04:26.880> good

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
then you know the team wasn't very good

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.120 
then you know the team wasn't very good
so<00:04:27.449> we<00:04:27.480> really<00:04:28.020> sometimes<00:04:28.260> never<00:04:28.800> even<00:04:28.949> went

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
so we really sometimes never even went

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.250 
so we really sometimes never even went
to<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.250> game<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:30.510> we<00:04:30.630> just<00:04:30.840> tailgate<00:04:31.169> of

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
to the game and so we just tailgate of

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.409 
to the game and so we just tailgate of
the<00:04:31.290> entire<00:04:31.620> day<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:32.190> I<00:04:32.310> think<00:04:32.610> those<00:04:33.389> are

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
the entire day and I think those are

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.629 
the entire day and I think those are
some<00:04:34.020> of<00:04:34.110> my<00:04:34.139> best<00:04:34.229> memories<00:04:34.949> from<00:04:35.100> Kent<00:04:35.400> from

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
some of my best memories from Kent from

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.719 
some of my best memories from Kent from
college<00:04:36.090> is<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:37.110> football<00:04:37.800> game<00:04:38.160> experience

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
college is the football game experience

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.030 
college is the football game experience
so<00:04:39.060> tailgating<00:04:40.050> maybe<00:04:40.290> stopping<00:04:40.560> by<00:04:40.770> for<00:04:40.800> a

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
so tailgating maybe stopping by for a

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.950 
so tailgating maybe stopping by for a
quarter<00:04:41.430> than<00:04:41.669> going<00:04:41.970> -<00:04:42.150> I<00:04:42.180> don't<00:04:42.449> know<00:04:42.600> PF

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960
