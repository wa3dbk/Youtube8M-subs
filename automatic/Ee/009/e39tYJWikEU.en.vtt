00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
ripping off the consumers is say you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.470

definitely there for gamestop which is
why<00:02:26.980> i<00:02:27.010> think<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:27.370> whole<00:02:27.520> thing<00:02:27.580> still<00:02:28.360> goes

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
why i think this whole thing still goes

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.240 
why i think this whole thing still goes
on<00:02:28.660> as<00:02:28.780> often<00:02:29.020> as<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.230> does<00:02:29.260> last<00:02:29.980> but

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
on as often as it does last but

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.010 
on as often as it does last but
certainly<00:02:30.280> not<00:02:30.610> least<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:31.180> main<00:02:31.450> reason<00:02:31.900> why

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
certainly not least the main reason why

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.990 
certainly not least the main reason why
I<00:02:32.050> do<00:02:32.380> not<00:02:32.650> support<00:02:33.010> gamestop's<00:02:33.580> use<00:02:33.850> game

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.180 
face it there a little bit cheaper but I
would<00:02:49.540> rather<00:02:49.660> spend<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.080> extra<00:02:50.260> ten<00:02:50.740> twenty

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
would rather spend the extra ten twenty

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.670 
would rather spend the extra ten twenty
dollars<00:02:51.520> on<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.730> game<00:02:52.360> that's<00:02:52.540> brand<00:02:52.900> new<00:02:52.990> if<00:02:53.260> it

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
dollars on a game that's brand new if it

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.230 
dollars on a game that's brand new if it
meant<00:02:53.890> that<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.220> money<00:02:54.460> was<00:02:54.700> going<00:02:55.000> towards

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
meant that the money was going towards

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.850 
meant that the money was going towards
the<00:02:55.330> publisher<00:02:55.720> because<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.320> publisher<00:02:56.740> made

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
the publisher because the publisher made

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.440 
the publisher because the publisher made
the<00:02:57.010> game<00:02:57.130> so<00:02:57.460> therefore<00:02:57.880> if<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.150> want<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.360> buy

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
the game so therefore if you want to buy

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.240 
the game so therefore if you want to buy
the<00:02:58.510> game<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:59.140> publisher<00:02:59.590> kind<00:02:59.890> of<00:02:59.950> deserves

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
the game the publisher kind of deserves

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.590 
the game the publisher kind of deserves
your<00:03:00.370> money<00:03:00.550> because<00:03:00.730> let's<00:03:01.120> face<00:03:01.210> it<00:03:01.510> they
