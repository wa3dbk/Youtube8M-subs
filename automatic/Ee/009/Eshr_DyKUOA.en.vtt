series involves common faults and cures

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.879 
series involves common faults and cures
the<00:00:09.599> first<00:00:09.900> fault<00:00:10.200> we're<00:00:10.349> going<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.650> take<00:00:10.830> a

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
the first fault we're going to take a

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.910 
the first fault we're going to take a
look<00:00:11.160> at<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.639> slice<00:00:12.389> have<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.349> ever<00:00:13.530> sliced

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
look at is a slice have you ever sliced

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.099 
look at is a slice have you ever sliced
the<00:00:14.099> ball<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.089> went<00:00:15.240> so<00:00:15.509> far<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.839> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
the ball that it went so far to the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.480 
the ball that it went so far to the
right<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.560> right<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.039> right<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.310> the

right to the right to the right to the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.970 
right to the right to the right to the
right<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.940> actually<00:00:18.390> came<00:00:18.900> back<00:00:19.170> almost<00:00:19.770> hit

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
right it actually came back almost hit

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.650 
right it actually came back almost hit
you<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> head<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.670> had<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> duck<00:00:21.150> no

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
you in a head and you had a duck no

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.769 
you in a head and you had a duck no
that's<00:00:22.439> good<00:00:22.710> news<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.760> slice<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> weak

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
that's good news but a slice is a weak

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.740 
that's good news but a slice is a weak
shot<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.380> shot<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.890> we<00:00:25.980> don't<00:00:26.160> want<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.519> hit

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
shot a shot that we don't want to hit

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.140 
shot a shot that we don't want to hit
the<00:00:27.750> reasonable<00:00:28.410> slices<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.310> because<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the reasonable slices is because of the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.910 
the reasonable slices is because of the
curve<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:31.230> spin<00:00:31.650> if<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.880> ball<00:00:33.149> spins<00:00:33.920> clockwise

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
curve the spin if a ball spins clockwise

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.959 
curve the spin if a ball spins clockwise
it<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.420> going<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.960> curve<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.590> way<00:00:37.860> if<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.700> ball

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
it is going to curve that way if a ball

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.470 
it is going to curve that way if a ball
spins<00:00:39.899> counterclockwise<00:00:40.850> it's<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:42.270> to

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
spins counterclockwise it's going to

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.529 
spins counterclockwise it's going to
curve<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.440> way<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.969> why<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> ball

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
curve that way so that is why a ball

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.740 
curve that way so that is why a ball
slices<00:00:46.110> because<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.460> spin<00:00:47.820> then<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
slices because of the spin then the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.590 
slices because of the spin then the
question<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.410> will<00:00:49.950> what<00:00:50.370> makes<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.090> spin

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
question is will what makes it spin

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.750 
question is will what makes it spin
clockwise<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:53.340> spins<00:00:54.300> clockwise<00:00:54.890> because<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
clockwise it spins clockwise because the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.920 
clockwise it spins clockwise because the
club<00:00:57.120> head<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.420> moving<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:59.219> direction

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
club head is moving in one direction

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.920 
club head is moving in one direction
with<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> clubface<00:01:02.000> facing<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.210> another

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
with the clubface facing in another

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.880 
with the clubface facing in another
direction<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.640> could<00:01:05.820> see<00:01:06.020> that<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.439> going

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
direction as you could see that is going

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.240 
direction as you could see that is going
to<00:01:08.130> put<00:01:10.220> clockwise<00:01:11.220> spin<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.780> ball<00:01:13.250> now

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
to put clockwise spin on that ball now

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.219 
to put clockwise spin on that ball now
to<00:01:14.310> get<00:01:14.700> rid<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.060> slice<00:01:15.420> let's<00:01:15.780> go<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
to get rid of a slice let's go in the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.039 
to get rid of a slice let's go in the
other<00:01:16.350> direction<00:01:16.820> we<00:01:17.820> want<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.210> hook<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.869> ball

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
other direction we want to hook the ball

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.550 
other direction we want to hook the ball
to<00:01:19.650> do<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.640> put

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
to do that we have to put

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.990 
to do that we have to put
counterclockwise<00:01:22.560> spin<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.610> direction

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
counterclockwise spin in that direction

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.880 
counterclockwise spin in that direction
and<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.140> we're<00:01:25.380> going<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> put<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
and to do that we're going to put the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.249 
and to do that we're going to put the
triple<00:01:26.310> whammy<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.000> ball<00:01:27.210> number<00:01:28.049> one

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
triple whammy on the ball number one

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.990 
triple whammy on the ball number one
we're<00:01:28.979> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.369> start<00:01:29.640> out<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
we're going to start out with the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.109 
we're going to start out with the
clubface<00:01:30.659> aiming<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> left<00:01:31.890> number<00:01:32.850> two

clubface aiming to the left number two

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.050 
clubface aiming to the left number two
we're<00:01:33.960> going<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.409> swing<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.950> club<00:01:35.369> head<00:01:35.610> out

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
we're going to swing that club head out

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.710 
we're going to swing that club head out
to<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.020> right<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.680> number<00:01:38.310> three<00:01:38.850> we're<00:01:39.570> even

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
to the right and number three we're even

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.249 
to the right and number three we're even
going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.170> put<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> little<00:01:40.650> wrist<00:01:41.840> release<00:01:42.840> a

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
going to put a little wrist release a

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.550 
going to put a little wrist release a
hand<00:01:44.250> turn<00:01:44.729> before<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:45.840> get<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> ball

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
hand turn before we get to the ball

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.340 
hand turn before we get to the ball
that's<00:01:47.159> what<00:01:47.399> i<00:01:47.430> call<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.939> triple<00:01:48.329> whammy<00:01:48.540> so

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
that's what i call the triple whammy so

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.039 
that's what i call the triple whammy so
a<00:01:49.649> ball<00:01:50.430> slices<00:01:51.180> because<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.320> spins<00:01:52.770> clockwise

couldn't<00:02:17.070> figure<00:02:17.250> out<00:02:17.430> why<00:02:17.850> he<00:02:18.120> was<00:02:18.240> slicing

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
couldn't figure out why he was slicing

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.470 
couldn't figure out why he was slicing
so<00:02:19.860> he<00:02:20.010> went<00:02:20.130> into<00:02:20.310> science<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:21.060> don't<00:02:21.300> know<00:02:21.390> if

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
so he went into science I don't know if

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.610 
so he went into science I don't know if
that's<00:02:21.660> true<00:02:21.750> it's<00:02:22.020> just<00:02:22.230> what<00:02:22.380> his<00:02:22.440> mother

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
that's true it's just what his mother

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.620 
that's true it's just what his mother
said<00:02:22.980> we're<00:02:23.910> going<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.120> get<00:02:24.270> rid<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.450> that

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
said we're going to get rid of that

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.300 
said we're going to get rid of that
slice<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.260> we're<00:02:25.590> going<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.800> start<00:02:26.100> hooking

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
slice and we're going to start hooking

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.350 
slice and we're going to start hooking

out<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> right<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.230> release<00:02:31.920> those<00:02:32.220> hands

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
out to the right and release those hands

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.280 
out to the right and release those hands
and<00:02:32.880> you'll<00:02:33.000> be<00:02:33.150> hooking<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.690> get<00:02:34.140> rid<00:02:34.260> of

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
and you'll be hooking and get rid of

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.010 
and you'll be hooking and get rid of
