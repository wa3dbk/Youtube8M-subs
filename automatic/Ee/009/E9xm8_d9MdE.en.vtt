we<00:00:51.239> already<00:00:51.360> anticipated<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.410> can't

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
we already anticipated that you can't

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.439 
we already anticipated that you can't
get<00:00:53.160> more<00:00:53.370> water<00:00:53.670> without<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.090> little<00:00:54.210> bit<00:00:54.360> of

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
get more water without a little bit of

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.639 
get more water without a little bit of
water<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:54.960> brought<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.199> little<00:00:55.469> bit<00:00:55.559> of

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
water so we brought a little bit of

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.760 
water so we brought a little bit of
water<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:56.010> us<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.670> put<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:56.969> into<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> pump

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
water with us to put it into the pump

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.450 
water with us to put it into the pump
there's<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.859> little<00:00:59.100> bit<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.219> water<00:00:59.399> right

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.670 
there's a little bit of water right
there<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.320> going<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:01.559> is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
there so what that is going to do is

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.959 
there so what that is going to do is
he's<00:01:01.949> going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.129> put<00:01:02.250> into<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.579> suction<00:01:02.940> valve

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
he's going to put into the suction valve

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.630 
he's going to put into the suction valve
to<00:01:03.719> draw<00:01:03.899> more<00:01:04.110> water<00:01:04.350> out<00:01:04.439> very<00:01:05.189> slowly

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
to draw more water out very slowly

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.789 
to draw more water out very slowly
this<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.210> technique<00:01:06.570> okay<00:01:06.930> because<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.680> got

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
to pump and pour at the right precise

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.260 
to pump and pour at the right precise
moment<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:10.799> NASA<00:01:11.040> technology
