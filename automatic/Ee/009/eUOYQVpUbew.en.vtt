snowfall<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.160> was<00:00:17.550> hearing<00:00:17.760> from<00:00:17.850> one<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.119> my

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
snowfall I was hearing from one of my

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.790 
snowfall I was hearing from one of my
friends<00:00:18.359> on<00:00:18.600> Facebook<00:00:19.320> talking<00:00:19.619> about<00:00:19.740> the

snow<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.100> Innisfil<00:00:20.699> earlier<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:21.930> have

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
snow and Innisfil earlier so we have

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.929 
snow and Innisfil earlier so we have
been<00:00:22.470> seeing<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.920> mixing<00:00:23.279> already<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.760> is

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
have the we think the better chance of

have the we think the better chance of
seeing<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.399> mixing<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.969> rain<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.450> snow<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.719> can

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
could be some higher totals due to the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.660 
could be some higher totals due to the

for<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> long<00:01:16.500> time<00:01:16.939> we<00:01:17.939> have<00:01:18.060> high<00:01:18.210> pressure<00:01:18.240> in

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
for a long time we have high pressure in

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.359 
for a long time we have high pressure in
place<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.590> know<00:01:19.619> what<00:01:19.860> if<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.130> just

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
place but it you know what if you just

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.440 
place but it you know what if you just
we<00:01:21.180> just<00:01:21.360> don't<00:01:21.509> often<00:01:21.780> get<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.500> see<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.979> fog

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
we just don't often get to see that fog

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.330 
we just don't often get to see that fog
lifting<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.570> most<00:01:24.780> areas<00:01:25.110> we've<00:01:26.070> seen<00:01:26.310> a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
lifting in most areas we've seen a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.039 
lifting in most areas we've seen a
little<00:01:26.880> bit<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.090> an<00:01:27.210> improvement<00:01:27.330> at<00:01:27.780> times

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
little bit of an improvement at times

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.770 
little bit of an improvement at times
but<00:01:28.439> overall<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.430> pattern<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.939> changing<00:01:30.540> for

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
but overall the pattern is changing for

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.170 
but overall the pattern is changing for
the<00:01:30.930> west<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.920> what<00:01:32.490> will<00:01:32.700> change<00:01:32.729> it

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
the west and this is what will change it

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.969 
the west and this is what will change it
this<00:01:33.360> low<00:01:33.509> pressure<00:01:33.720> system<00:01:34.200> which<00:01:34.619> starts

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
this low pressure system which starts

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.039 
this low pressure system which starts
off<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.280> Yukon<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.729> Alaska<00:01:35.790> comes<00:01:36.630> up<00:01:36.780> over

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
off in Yukon and Alaska comes up over

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.510 
off in Yukon and Alaska comes up over
the<00:01:37.140> ridge<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.439> high<00:01:37.560> pressure<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.159> then

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the ridge of high pressure and then

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.130 
the ridge of high pressure and then
sinks<00:01:38.909> down<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.420> we're<00:01:39.509> actually<00:01:39.780> set<00:01:39.930> up<00:01:39.960> some

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
sinks down so we're actually set up some

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.170 
sinks down so we're actually set up some
colder<00:01:40.470> air<00:01:40.500> sinking<00:01:41.009> into<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.369> interior<00:01:41.790> BC

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
colder air sinking into the interior BC
