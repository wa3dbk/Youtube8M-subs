00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.160 
but what I did find with windows 7 i'll
run<00:03:57.500> 64-bit<00:03:58.040> I<00:03:58.190> think<00:03:58.430> it's<00:03:58.520> the<00:03:58.550> same<00:03:58.730> 30<00:03:59.180> but

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
run 64-bit I think it's the same 30 but

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.320 
run 64-bit I think it's the same 30 but
you<00:04:00.770> will<00:04:00.920> find<00:04:01.220> that<00:04:02.650> it's<00:04:03.650> going<00:04:04.010> to<00:04:04.330> not

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
on this phone and even is so much easier

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.560

when<00:05:20.370> i'm<00:05:20.520> texting<00:05:21.030> you<00:05:21.090> know<00:05:21.390> i<00:05:21.420> think

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
when i'm texting you know i think

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.990

definitely<00:05:22.130> these<00:05:23.130> touch<00:05:23.400> screens<00:05:23.430> of<00:05:23.910> the

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
definitely these touch screens of the

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.240 
definitely these touch screens of the
wave<00:05:24.150> way<00:05:24.930> forward<00:05:25.350> really<00:05:25.650> can't<00:05:25.980> see<00:05:26.160> the

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
wave way forward really can't see the

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.370 
wave way forward really can't see the
point<00:05:26.400> of<00:05:26.550> buns<00:05:26.790> at<00:05:26.970> all<00:05:27.150> normal<00:05:28.020> standards

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
look buttons but i think we're just get

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.030 
look buttons but i think we're just get
into<00:05:32.220> a<00:05:32.250> settings<00:05:32.640> tab<00:05:32.880> just<00:05:33.150> coughing<00:05:33.420> it

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
into a settings tab just coughing it

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.800 
into a settings tab just coughing it
basically<00:05:35.040> set<00:05:35.310> into<00:05:35.520> profiles<00:05:36.060> display<00:05:36.570> like

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
basically set into profiles display like

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.620 
basically set into profiles display like
time<00:05:37.170> and<00:05:37.200> date<00:05:37.620> blah<00:05:37.860> blah<00:05:38.040> blah<00:05:38.070> i<00:05:38.640> think

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
time and date blah blah blah i think

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.060 
time and date blah blah blah i think
that's<00:05:39.780> it<00:05:39.930> you<00:05:40.140> know<00:05:40.230> don't<00:05:40.410> memory<00:05:40.860> settings

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
that's it you know don't memory settings

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.990 
that's it you know don't memory settings
alright<00:05:41.910> looks<00:05:42.120> out<00:05:42.300> of<00:05:42.360> added<00:05:42.720> a<00:05:43.100> a<00:05:44.100> new<00:05:44.670> card

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
so so if i go into memory settings this

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.080 
so so if i go into memory settings this
you<00:05:48.840> can<00:05:48.990> clear<00:05:49.200> that<00:05:49.350> memory<00:05:49.740> or<00:05:49.950> it<00:05:50.910> can<00:05:51.060> be

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
you can clear that memory or it can be

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.660 
you can clear that memory or it can be
