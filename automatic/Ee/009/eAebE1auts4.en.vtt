00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello to all today we're going 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.429
 make a clip- on envelope 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.410
 standard size envelope you can 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.750
 change obviously I left on 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.809
 a 10 15 format and eclipse why so 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.340
 I thought tiny form of arrows 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.960
 Who is gonna come 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.300
 close your envelope as we 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.840
 can see it here the wrap does not want 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.750
 not smile 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.480
 you really have to tear the little one 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.630
 shut up in there that's pulling him to the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.369
 up so arrow shaped with a 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.450
 small mistake 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.760
 I want to show in a few steps 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.620
 how to get your eclipse envelope 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.899
 so we'll need a little bit of 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.300
 material as always a cutter of the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.239
 double- sided tape a criterium is a 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.500
 rule so to start on a 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.180
 sheet a3 we will trace our platform 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.379
 cutting 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.539
 so no I went on a base 10 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.870
 So we will do a little bit more 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.550
 great 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.989
 we will make a first rectangle of 11 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.730
 by 15 we will repeat just below 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.270
 so we will see 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:09.740
 11 11 and 15 wide small paws 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:14.250
 collages on the sides of about 2 cm 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:18.299
 width is very good a flap of 3 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.009
 cm tall that will be the the part of the 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.229
 top of our envelope is a form of 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.210
 arrows an arrowhead that will be 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.130
 so this famous clip that will serve to close 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.380
 your envelope 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.049
 so once you have your your 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.060
 diagram we can start designing 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.610
 so envelope to get the cutter 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:42.960
 the back of the whore to mark our prices 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:45.840
 and the rule everything would have swum the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:52.079
 first floor which is under the arrow of 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:57.000
 second settings here and then from 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:59.399
 side setting for pasta 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.509
 collage times for households are 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.509
 marked we can go to the cut 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.869
 so we can directly on our dream 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.459
 you can use rules if you 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.000
 always want to pay attention to 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.000
 do not cut yourself 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:30.250
 see who will be our little brother me 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:45.490
 on the bone and elano once we have 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.000
 the team and our envelope we get 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.590
 found with this form there we 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.360
 remains a small business cut that will 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.290
 the little notch to be able precisely 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.620
 inserted our our clipse so you the 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.210
 obviously place height so if you 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.740
 have put three or four centimeters or 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.810
 like me four enemies and well you 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.520
 put exactly the same height here 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.560
 so we will fall well pile hair for 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.950
 to be able to close our envelope for 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.050
 we notice it's still you 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.800
 Directly advises the brand a 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.700
 little bit with your finger like that for 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.200
 true that there are a topic which 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.940
 it will be easier to insert 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.230
 the arrow just now we're going 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.600
 now put the glue on the 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.990
 flat gluing and of course all the 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.470
 height 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.470
 finally 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.550
 and it's good 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.150
 all the choices fold down do not look like 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.150
 not 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.360
 the top of the envelope 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.709
 so that's almost done 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.110
 stay now insert your message 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.190
 you can to reinsert them by the 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.530
 high as a traditional envelope 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.630
 and then when you finish link 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.069
 fuqua take the arrow what I you 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.560
 advise is to score a little bit 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.180
 on one side it will be easier to 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.250
 back and then 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.799
 here we move other arrows to 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.049
 inside the notch and once 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.220
 to eclipse as you can see the 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.280
 envelopes can no longer suffer 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.840
