00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:00.490 
with squad cover on and then they are
control<00:04:58.520> with<00:04:58.729> no<00:04:58.909> perks<00:04:59.120> at<00:04:59.300> all<00:04:59.419> it<00:05:00.349> almost

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
control with no perks at all it almost

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.379 
control with no perks at all it almost
you<00:05:01.430> know<00:05:01.550> I<00:05:01.580> guess<00:05:01.789> it's<00:05:01.940> a<00:05:02.030> little<00:05:02.270> bit

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
you know I guess it's a little bit

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.370 
you know I guess it's a little bit
better<00:05:02.569> there<00:05:02.840> but<00:05:03.620> uh<00:05:03.650> I<00:05:04.810> guess<00:05:05.810> maybe<00:05:06.050> there

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
better there but uh I guess maybe there

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.899 
better there but uh I guess maybe there
I'd<00:05:06.620> have<00:05:06.650> to<00:05:06.919> result<00:05:07.159> I'd<00:05:07.430> have<00:05:07.610> to<00:05:07.759> say

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
I'd have to result I'd have to say

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:09.460 
I'd have to result I'd have to say
certainly<00:05:08.360> and<00:05:08.569> his<00:05:08.720> squad<00:05:08.900> cover<00:05:09.169> helps<00:05:09.409> a

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
certainly and his squad cover helps a

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.890 
certainly and his squad cover helps a
little<00:05:09.560> bit<00:05:09.680> with<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:09.949> importer<00:05:10.250> 17<00:05:10.720> now<00:05:11.720> this

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
little bit with the importer 17 now this

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.290 
little bit with the importer 17 now this
last<00:05:12.050> clip<00:05:12.380> is<00:05:12.560> hit<00:05:13.159> with<00:05:13.310> squad<00:05:13.639> suppression

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
last clip is hit with squad suppression

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.939 
last clip is hit with squad suppression
and<00:05:14.449> meet<00:05:14.630> with<00:05:14.659> squad<00:05:15.050> cover<00:05:15.349> is<00:05:15.590> they<00:05:15.889> should

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:15.949 
and meet with squad cover is they should

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.399 
and meet with squad cover is they should
negate<00:05:16.400> themselves<00:05:17.030> and<00:05:17.210> I<00:05:18.050> didn't<00:05:18.199> want<00:05:18.319> to

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:18.409 
negate themselves and I didn't want to

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:20.020 
negate themselves and I didn't want to
do<00:05:18.530> two<00:05:18.710> stills<00:05:19.009> here<00:05:19.190> i<00:05:19.280> just<00:05:19.490> i<00:05:19.610> just<00:05:19.669> showed

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
do two stills here i just i just showed

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.939 
do two stills here i just i just showed

because<00:05:22.159> i<00:05:22.250> think<00:05:22.310> they<00:05:22.550> negate<00:05:22.819> each<00:05:22.880> other

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
because i think they negate each other

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.459 
because i think they negate each other
again<00:05:24.909> here<00:05:25.909> this<00:05:26.150> is<00:05:26.180> original<00:05:26.539> clip<00:05:27.020> here<00:05:27.319> of
