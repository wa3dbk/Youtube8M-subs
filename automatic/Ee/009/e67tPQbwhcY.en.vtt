00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.130
 Welcome friends to go towards more guides 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.200
 today I bring you a boxing 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:39.190
 time that we did not see ourselves opening a 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.080
 device or taking out a contraption of your 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.960
 box and so today is the day today has 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.570
 touched many you will have seen that in my 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.600
 latest videos has appeared with some 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.750
 helmets in the ears helmets 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.370
 mobile to be more exact we have had 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.140
 that go down the budget and 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.220
 adjusting to what we had to the 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.589
 means that we had given that our 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.860
 7.1 that we had wireless we had 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.690
 that sell them get rid of them for 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.990
 to be able to renew the generation of consoles 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.820
 It has been expensive but we have achieved it 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.760
 we have a pair of helmets again 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.340
 I 'll tell you that I really wanted to 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.550
 other helmets but my great friend to roland 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.430
 has convinced me to stop me from 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.600
 so many filigree from so much beautiful that 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.790
 Sometimes companies sell us 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.400
 and that I focus more on the quality of 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.550
 audio as you know I like it 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.270
 let me advise for him I have taken these 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:44.930
 helmets of some creative in which 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.180
 Suppose we say they are personalized 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.260
 a little more for the audio and maybe 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.690
 less the one for the talks and others that in 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.780
 Sometimes it is what you 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.900
 kills this type of helmets and so on 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.460
 we are looking for good audio helmets and 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.640
 in the end we ended up buying some 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.800
 good helmets for a point console 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.800
 whether playstation 3 playstation 4 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.920
 teams one or xbox 360 in this case not 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.140
 this is a device intended simply 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.080
 to get the highest audio quality 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.590
 I've looked a lot for forums both roland 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.660
 as I have been guided a lot in the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.480
 comments from users 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.370
 positive from both an appliance and 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.110
 another and the truth that I have to say that 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.970
 many people 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.040
 those that I was going to catch in the beginning 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.080
 Many people criticized them. 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:41.330
 give birth and yet very on the contrary 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.580
 these popular that we are going to be able 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.290
 enjoy everyone put them by 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.320
 the clouds all over the world has it well 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.090
 them and well then after all the 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.650
 The boss is the one who pays and the one who pays 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.350
 it's the user 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.610
 we will open first this every time 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.620
 we have in the bag 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.190
 nothing because I wanted to show you 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.100
 what do we have 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.760
 and with what we are going to work 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.260
 so you can see it gradually 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.060
 we are taking a small step too 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.170
 logically it is for my own enjoyment 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.210
 as it is evident this is my passion and 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.790
 Well, here we have an extension that 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:25.020
 a cable will come very well to us 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.650
 does a little extension and then the 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:33.570
 peg also I do not know what I know this 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.700
 is the 3.5 and this I do not know what the 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.410
 called as such 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.450
 but let's go is the peg 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.720
 big that is supposed to also the 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.720
 can 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.260
 dock here and transform into 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.810
 in the chubby in case someone has a 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.870
 amplifier I will use the amplifier 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.940
 to record to record and to take the 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.430
 audio of all the consoles and all the 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.500
 machines and the pc by directly from 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.989
 this time I will not have a problem 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.790
 because directly the audio I take it out 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:10.709
 of the amplifier and how is this way 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.019
 I do not have to limit myself to any helmet 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.989
 tell me this is exclusive for 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.630
 clusive playstation for microsoft no 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.229
 but any helmet or any 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:25.560
 holder would be worth it without any problem 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:27.210
 They are pretty nice but what is not 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.240
 what we are really looking for is not that they are 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.160
 nice but comfortable good as you can 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.160
 appreciate we have the adjustable pin on 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.840
 aluminum and I 'm good I think it's 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.810
 universal for all helmets all 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.479
 the heads likewise we have in the part 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.310
 Padded upper is not as frequent 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.500
 but it is appreciated because when you take 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.330
 several hours of game that comes 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.980
 padded this area is quite comfortable 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.200
 then we can also 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.660
 have a little twist in the part which 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.100
 more friction sometimes exerts 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:03.220
 Helmets when you turn your head and thank you 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.470
 this little this little turn for 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.810
 avoid that then the helmet then in a 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.780
 future is broken not as it is evident then 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:14.840
 padded also the speaker part 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:18.139
 Well the cable is not bad 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.780
 length and likewise then we can use it 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.870
 with the extensible you already know that you can 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:27.080
 also dock it with various systems 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.449
 that exist to be able to then take it to 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.800
 your command or your device with the 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.440
 that you are using the audio of yours 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.720
 console and also be able to say it 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.720
 turn into a hybrid to be able 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.130
 Listen and talk through helmets 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.820
 but it is not the case because we 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.610
 we have the wave 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.220
 in the cabbage with which we have already recorded 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.650
 other videos practically all of the 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.720
 channel except the first ones and with that 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.420
 Well honestly I'm very happy 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.160
 record the sound perfectly and now of 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.150
 what it is is to get a good 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.120
 sound 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.400
 the receiver so nothing this is the one 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.660
 boxing I hope you liked it 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.190
 leave me your comments that is what 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.860
 important of your video 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.690
 comments so you see what you think of the 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.450
 respect or if it's worth spending 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.000
 the barbarities that ask in some to 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.040
 regular as 150 euros for a pair of helmets 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.930
 that maybe they are worse or if they really 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.200
 it's worth going a little bit 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.180
 more economical but not intended 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.850
 to throw her nothing else mates 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.070
 we see in the following video with some 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.500
 boxing more cabral not much because the 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.260
 thing is very bad but 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:38.210
 of video games there will be many, so 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.210
 nothing more friends until the next
