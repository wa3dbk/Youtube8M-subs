00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
candlestick holders like that so let's

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.600 
candlestick holders like that so let's
start<00:02:41.160> by<00:02:41.810> binding<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.709> glass<00:02:44.010> pieces

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
start by binding the glass pieces

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.080 
start by binding the glass pieces
together<00:02:44.790> we'll<00:02:45.270> do<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.630> first<00:02:45.930> level<00:02:50.090> little

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
together we'll do the first level little

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.479 
together we'll do the first level little
bit<00:02:51.420> through<00:02:52.050> two<00:02:52.260> solutions<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.280> come

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
bit through two solutions that come

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.090 
bit through two solutions that come
