00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 well hello to each and all of these 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.410
 abuses are found today for 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.060
 a new video 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.350
 I will go very quickly this video 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.330
 it's about dragon ball niche people 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.030
 on pc it works on all 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.920
 platforms including ps3 x360 the xbox slave 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.450
 live and that's the goal is to reap the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.070
 dragon ball relay so first 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.470
 you have to create a team so in the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.460
 first part of the city of tokyo which 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.779
 then went to recruit pnj then 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.070
 this step is not mandatory but 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.650
 it is to facilitate the task so you 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.059
 take two pretty powerful pnj as 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.800
 for example I'm going to take a level 50 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.920
 and a level 110 that is right 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.600
 behind and the goal is going to be from farm all 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.890
 time the same mission actually and 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.829
 this mission there that she knows the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.660
 mission 15 so to three stars for 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.329
 get it you have to go see without guen 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.890
 which is on the side of the shops 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.449
 seung wan little wanted to talk he'll you 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.110
 to say to make this mission a first 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:59.760
 Once you take it, you launch it 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.949
 take your own person 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.629
 whatever person I would add 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.519
 some small details for what he 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.750
 is about the masters and everything is in the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.750
 description so do not hesitate 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.119
 Czechs and then you start to 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.220
 you fight against freezer so 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.590
 you and the mini freezer accelerate 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.960
 all this the fight is the fight is going to be 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.030
 on my side I put a little bit of 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.670
 time to do it I did not explain 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.880
 to do it too fast as noted 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.229
 that by putting a little bit of time 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.150
 it's more you have more luck in this 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.310
 than what a servant after 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.900
 appear if you too you the torch 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.430
 is too fast freezer ben it will put 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.049
 victory late and then there will be pierced to 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.470
 to say nothing nothing that will happen after 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.350
 so here I am ko currently so 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.329
 I am going to strike and the up 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.850
 so you see the fight lasted pretty much 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.890
 close three minutes two minutes by which 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.960
 a little over two minutes it lasted and 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.520
 so there is the famous servant who 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.250
 the servant arrives him 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.929
 while the fight is very fast and 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.479
 you will see that the servant 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.799
 gives a material is right after one 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.210
 gave a key object so he can 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.850
 give two materials a single material 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.519
 but it is he who is this servant 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.349
 halak who gave me the most items 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.030
 keys at least so an objective it's 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.280
 what is it just a ball of 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.780
 crystal so we're going to see it right 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.129
 right here 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.870
 so the crystal ball is going to be well 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.980
 in my inventory it was the ball to 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.330
 three stars I think I won 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.590
 so I have four balls now at 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.970
 total without back thought of course and 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.750
 so here you just have to farm that 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.390
 like that it allows you to xp if the video 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.380
