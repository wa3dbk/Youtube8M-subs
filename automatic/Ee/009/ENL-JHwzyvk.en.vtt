piece<00:02:27.020> of<00:02:27.050> plastic<00:02:27.560> that's<00:02:27.740> empty<00:02:28.510> okay<00:02:29.510> so

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
piece of plastic that's empty okay so

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.040 
piece of plastic that's empty okay so
when<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.230> flip<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.800> SSD<00:02:31.550> over<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.660> old

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
when you flip the SSD over the old

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.120 
when you flip the SSD over the old
housing<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.940> can<00:02:35.120> see<00:02:35.390> there's<00:02:35.750> screw<00:02:36.740> mounts

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
housing you can see there's screw mounts

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.880 
housing you can see there's screw mounts
on<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.490> side<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.090> on<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.930> bottom<00:02:39.200> there<00:02:39.650> or

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
on the side and on the bottom there or

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.190 
on the side and on the bottom there or
top<00:02:40.400> in<00:02:40.640> this<00:02:40.790> case<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:43.340> yeah<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:44.200> housing

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
top in this case so yeah the housing

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.560 
top in this case so yeah the housing
that<00:02:45.470> came<00:02:45.710> off<00:02:45.740> of<00:02:45.920> my<00:02:46.220> old<00:02:46.370> hard<00:02:46.580> drive<00:02:46.790> the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
that came off of my old hard drive the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.510 
that came off of my old hard drive the
screws<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.500> everything<00:02:49.100> it's<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.340> pretty

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
screws and everything it's a pretty

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.030 
screws and everything it's a pretty
standard<00:02:50.000> mount<00:02:50.210> so<00:02:50.510> again<00:02:51.320> I<00:02:51.530> don't<00:02:51.830> know<00:02:51.980> if

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
standard mount so again I don't know if

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.590 
standard mount so again I don't know if
I<00:02:52.100> mentioned<00:02:52.160> it<00:02:52.520> but<00:02:52.610> this<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:52.880> a<00:02:52.910> sony<00:02:53.210> vaio

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
I mentioned it but this is a sony vaio

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.850 
I mentioned it but this is a sony vaio
f-series<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:55.540> think<00:02:56.540> it's<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.960> what<00:02:57.410> is<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.680> f

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
f-series I think it's the what is it f

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.350 
f-series I think it's the what is it f
or<00:02:58.190> VPC<00:02:59.180> f<00:02:59.210> 22<00:02:59.930> b<00:03:00.350> FX<00:03:00.740> is<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.100> exact<00:03:01.850> model

gigabytes<00:03:08.720> of<00:03:09.200> RAM<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:10.130> I<00:03:11.120> know<00:03:11.300> that<00:03:11.870> the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
gigabytes of RAM and I know that the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.350 
gigabytes of RAM and I know that the
major<00:03:12.710> bottleneck<00:03:13.460> in<00:03:13.610> this<00:03:13.790> case<00:03:14.030> was<00:03:14.300> the

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
major bottleneck in this case was the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.630 
major bottleneck in this case was the
old<00:03:14.810> hard<00:03:15.050> drive<00:03:15.230> because<00:03:15.530> it<00:03:15.680> was<00:03:15.770> it<00:03:16.070> was<00:03:16.400> the

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
old hard drive because it was it was the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.620 
old hard drive because it was it was the
own<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:17.360> old<00:03:17.680> 540<00:03:18.680> rpm<00:03:19.580> all<00:03:20.090> right<00:03:20.240> so<00:03:20.420> I<00:03:20.450> got

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
own the old 540 rpm all right so I got

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.870 
own the old 540 rpm all right so I got
this<00:03:20.810> thing<00:03:21.050> screwed<00:03:21.380> back<00:03:21.440> in<00:03:21.890> plugged<00:03:22.610> in

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
this thing screwed back in plugged in

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.700 
this thing screwed back in plugged in
the<00:03:23.750> two<00:03:24.020> mounting<00:03:24.620> screws<00:03:24.890> right<00:03:25.490> there<00:03:25.820> are

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
the two mounting screws right there are

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:33.100 
the two mounting screws right there are
nice<00:03:27.710> and<00:03:28.070> snug<00:03:30.760> basically<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:32.600> connection

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
nice and snug basically the connection

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.280 
nice and snug basically the connection
here<00:03:33.380> is<00:03:33.410> you<00:03:34.400> know<00:03:34.550> it's<00:03:34.940> just<00:03:35.240> plug<00:03:35.690> in<00:03:35.900> so

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
here is you know it's just plug in so

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.530 
here is you know it's just plug in so
all<00:03:36.920> you<00:03:37.250> gotta<00:03:37.490> do<00:03:37.640> is<00:03:37.670> really<00:03:38.000> just<00:03:38.270> kind<00:03:38.480> of

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
wiggle it in there you don't want to

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.420 
wiggle it in there you don't want to
force<00:03:40.850> anything<00:03:41.350> just<00:03:42.350> slide<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:42.770> in<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.070> it

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
force anything just slide it in and it

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.980 
force anything just slide it in and it
should<00:03:43.640> slide<00:03:43.850> in<00:03:44.060> very<00:03:44.360> easy<00:03:44.630> once

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
should slide in very easy once

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.470 
should slide in very easy once
everything's<00:03:45.410> lined<00:03:45.680> up<00:03:45.860> so<00:03:46.300> if<00:03:47.300> you're

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
swapped out that toshiba stock hard

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.600 
swapped out that toshiba stock hard
drive<00:04:23.390> that<00:04:23.570> you<00:04:23.600> saw

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
drive that you saw

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.170 
drive that you saw
out<00:04:24.669> of<00:04:24.789> my<00:04:24.879> sony<00:04:25.360> vaio<00:04:25.599> f-series<00:04:26.169> and<00:04:27.180> it

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
out of my sony vaio f-series and it

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.869 
out of my sony vaio f-series and it
actually<00:04:28.389> turned<00:04:28.780> out<00:04:28.900> really<00:04:29.169> good<00:04:29.439> I<00:04:30.099> was

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:30.879 
actually turned out really good I was

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:32.550 
actually turned out really good I was
hoping<00:04:30.939> for<00:04:31.300> a<00:04:31.509> big<00:04:31.750> improvement<00:04:32.110> in

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
hoping for a big improvement in

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.240 
hoping for a big improvement in
performance<00:04:33.400> which<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.479> totally<00:04:34.870> got<00:04:35.259> this

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
performance which I totally got this

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.089 
performance which I totally got this
thing<00:04:36.490> boots<00:04:36.729> up<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.240> I<00:04:37.360> mean<00:04:37.659> a<00:04:37.900> tenth<00:04:38.770> of<00:04:38.979> the

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
thing boots up and I mean a tenth of the

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.670 
thing boots up and I mean a tenth of the
time<00:04:39.280> that<00:04:39.490> it<00:04:39.520> used<00:04:39.610> to<00:04:40.000> every<00:04:40.960> program<00:04:41.439> i'm

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
time that it used to every program i'm

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.390 
time that it used to every program i'm
using<00:04:41.710> is<00:04:42.310> much<00:04:42.879> more<00:04:43.150> snappy<00:04:44.069> even<00:04:45.069> the

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
using is much more snappy even the

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.320 
using is much more snappy even the
internet<00:04:45.759> oddly<00:04:46.659> enough<00:04:47.550> it<00:04:48.550> just<00:04:48.729> seems<00:04:49.030> like

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
internet oddly enough it just seems like

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.379 
internet oddly enough it just seems like
everything<00:04:50.080> is<00:04:50.550> being<00:04:51.550> used<00:04:51.819> a<00:04:52.060> lot<00:04:52.180> more

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
everything is being used a lot more

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.619 
everything is being used a lot more
efficiently<00:04:52.930> I<00:04:53.620> was<00:04:53.949> hoping<00:04:54.129> because<00:04:54.819> of<00:04:55.419> the

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:55.629 
efficiently I was hoping because of the

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:59.969 
efficiently I was hoping because of the
spinning<00:04:56.289> disks<00:04:56.710> on<00:04:56.889> the<00:04:57.069> regular<00:04:57.610> HDD<00:04:58.979> versus

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
spinning disks on the regular HDD versus

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.890 
spinning disks on the regular HDD versus
the<00:05:00.189> solid-state<00:05:00.990> drive<00:05:01.990> I<00:05:02.289> was<00:05:03.189> hoping<00:05:03.520> that

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
the solid-state drive I was hoping that

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.510 
the solid-state drive I was hoping that
it'd<00:05:04.900> save<00:05:05.289> a<00:05:05.319> little<00:05:05.590> bit<00:05:05.710> on<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:05.949> battery<00:05:06.310> I

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
it'd save a little bit on the battery I

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.589 
it'd save a little bit on the battery I
am<00:05:07.240> seeing<00:05:07.539> a<00:05:07.840> small<00:05:08.770> bit<00:05:09.159> of<00:05:09.389> battery<00:05:10.389> life

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
am seeing a small bit of battery life

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.200 
am seeing a small bit of battery life
saving<00:05:11.050> but<00:05:11.349> overall<00:05:12.039> it's<00:05:12.610> not<00:05:12.909> really

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
saving but overall it's not really

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.820 
saving but overall it's not really
anything<00:05:13.569> to<00:05:13.930> notice<00:05:15.779> well<00:05:16.779> guys<00:05:17.020> as<00:05:17.319> you<00:05:17.379> can
