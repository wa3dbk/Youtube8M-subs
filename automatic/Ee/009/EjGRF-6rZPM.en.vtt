00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:16.109 
for a pig anyway so if i press f it will

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.169 
for a pig anyway so if i press f it will
shoot<00:01:16.409> now<00:01:16.859> there<00:01:17.069> isn't<00:01:17.429> very<00:01:17.549> good<00:01:17.759> graphics

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179

shoot now there isn't very good graphics
and<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.479> shooting<00:01:19.469> mechanism<00:01:20.009> isn't<00:01:20.189> really

00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:20.459 
and the shooting mechanism isn't really

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:23.120 
and the shooting mechanism isn't really
that<00:01:20.549> good<00:01:20.759> because<00:01:20.939> i<00:01:21.029> can<00:01:21.149> take<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.859> and<00:01:22.859> i

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that good because i can take that and i

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.620 
that good because i can take that and i
shoot<00:01:23.399> but<00:01:23.609> you<00:01:23.700> can't<00:01:23.909> see<00:01:24.090> any<00:01:24.209> bullets<00:01:24.509> or

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
shoot but you can't see any bullets or

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.239 
shoot but you can't see any bullets or
anything<00:01:24.929> and<00:01:25.319> it's<00:01:25.499> actually<00:01:25.709> quite<00:01:25.799> hard<00:01:26.069> to

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:26.249 
anything and it's actually quite hard to

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:28.819 
anything and it's actually quite hard to
hit<00:01:26.429> the<00:01:26.579> other<00:01:26.700> animal<00:01:26.999> soon<00:01:27.740> kissing<00:01:28.740> him

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
from here I don't know why if I take

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.949 
from here I don't know why if I take
myself<00:01:35.429> off<00:01:35.700> game<00:01:36.450> mode<00:01:36.659> 1<00:01:36.929> maybe<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.289> can<00:01:37.439> him

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:38.959

go<00:01:43.739> I've<00:01:44.009> killed<00:01:44.310> him<00:01:44.429> so<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.479> actually

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
go I've killed him so it's actually

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:47.510 
go I've killed him so it's actually
quite<00:01:45.810> difficult<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.560> manage<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.009> hit<00:01:47.340> other

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
quite difficult to manage to hit other

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.760 
quite difficult to manage to hit other
people<00:01:48.649> maybe<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.919> girl<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:51.349> don't<00:01:52.349> know

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
people maybe it's the girl I don't know

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.629 
people maybe it's the girl I don't know
because<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.729> can't<00:01:53.939> seem<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.239> hear<00:01:54.419> I<00:01:55.549> think<00:01:56.549> it

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:56.639 
because I can't seem to hear I think it

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:58.729 
because I can't seem to hear I think it
might<00:01:56.789> be<00:01:56.819> this<00:01:56.999> grass<00:01:57.299> going<00:01:57.599> in<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.749> way<00:01:57.840> so

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:58.739 
might be this grass going in the way so

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:02.929 
might be this grass going in the way so
you<00:01:59.069> can<00:01:59.249> make<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.459> pig<00:01:59.700> job<00:02:01.039> there<00:02:02.039> we<00:02:02.130> go<00:02:02.309> so

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
you can make the pig job there we go so

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.969 
you can make the pig job there we go so
it<00:02:03.209> is<00:02:03.329> quite<00:02:03.539> difficult<00:02:03.630> because<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.709> grass

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
it is quite difficult because this grass

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.319 
it is quite difficult because this grass
is<00:02:05.009> getting<00:02:05.249> in<00:02:05.429> the<00:02:05.520> way<00:02:05.639> which<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.059> wasn't

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
is getting in the way which I wasn't

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.399 
is getting in the way which I wasn't
planning<00:02:06.509> on<00:02:06.809> happening<00:02:07.349> and<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:09.409> gun

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:10.409 
planning on happening and a gun

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:11.630 
planning on happening and a gun
mechanism<00:02:10.829> it<00:02:10.950> never<00:02:11.129> seems<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.430> work<00:02:11.519> very

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
mechanism it never seems to work very

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.959 
mechanism it never seems to work very
well<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.060> be<00:02:12.150> honest<00:02:13.400> but<00:02:14.400> yeah<00:02:14.549> if<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.790> press

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:14.969 
well to be honest but yeah if you press

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:21.199 
well to be honest but yeah if you press
F<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.480> cowlick<00:02:15.870> spin<00:02:16.110> around<00:02:17.360> shoot<00:02:20.090> so<00:02:21.090> this

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
F that cowlick spin around shoot so this

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:28.729 
F that cowlick spin around shoot so this
is<00:02:21.329> basically<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.810> normal<00:02:22.379> combat<00:02:27.620> there<00:02:28.620> we

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
is basically the normal combat there we

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.429 
is basically the normal combat there we
go<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:28.890> gone<00:02:29.129> it's<00:02:29.700> harder<00:02:30.420> than<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.599> looks<00:02:30.659> now

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
go I gone it's harder than it looks now

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.990 
go I gone it's harder than it looks now
the<00:02:31.500> pigs<00:02:31.799> running<00:02:31.950> too<00:02:32.189> slow<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.519> can<00:02:32.670> him

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
the pigs running too slow you can him

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.190 
the pigs running too slow you can him
and<00:02:33.439> he<00:02:34.439> will<00:02:34.590> run<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.799> bit<00:02:34.950> faster<00:02:36.200> I'm

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
and he will run a bit faster I'm

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.509 
and he will run a bit faster I'm
guessing<00:02:37.560> that's<00:02:37.680> just<00:02:37.890> because<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.189> like<00:02:38.219> the

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
guessing that's just because of like the

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.949 
guessing that's just because of like the
normal<00:02:38.790> way<00:02:39.060> how<00:02:39.209> minecraft<00:02:39.569> works<00:02:39.750> if<00:02:39.900> you

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
normal way how minecraft works if you

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.270 
normal way how minecraft works if you
hit<00:02:40.140> pig<00:02:40.379> it<00:02:40.500> will<00:02:40.620> speed<00:02:40.859> up<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.099> run<00:02:41.189> around

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
hit pig it will speed up and run around

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.160 
hit pig it will speed up and run around
screaming<00:02:41.579> but<00:02:42.209> this<00:02:42.299> time<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.569> can<00:02:42.719> control

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
screaming but this time you can control

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.750 
screaming but this time you can control
which<00:02:43.319> way<00:02:43.469> it<00:02:43.530> works<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.430> don't<00:02:44.609> know<00:02:44.700> if

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
which way it works so I don't know if

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.270 
which way it works so I don't know if
the<00:02:44.849> mod<00:02:45.120> developer<00:02:45.959> actually<00:02:46.200> put<00:02:46.319> them<00:02:46.469> or

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
the mod developer actually put them or

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.929 
the mod developer actually put them or
whether<00:02:47.459> that's<00:02:47.760> just<00:02:48.349> natural<00:02:49.349> as<00:02:49.939> minecraft

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
whether that's just natural as minecraft

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.660 
whether that's just natural as minecraft
usually<00:02:51.209> runs<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:52.379> this<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.560> just<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.280> combat

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
usually runs so this is just the combat

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.539 
usually runs so this is just the combat
pig<00:02:53.909> so<00:02:54.269> I<00:02:54.480> can<00:02:54.750> get<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:55.049> there<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.349> I<00:02:56.219> can<00:02:56.400> run

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.020 
guy's tactic is if you press f it drops
that<00:04:04.659> mine<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.319> it<00:04:05.739> sounds<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.099> bit<00:04:06.219> like<00:04:06.280> sonar

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
that mine and it sounds a bit like sonar

that mine and it sounds a bit like sonar
to<00:04:07.209> me<00:04:07.359> and<00:04:07.599> if<00:04:08.109> you<00:04:08.230> walk<00:04:08.560> over<00:04:08.590> it<00:04:08.889> with<00:04:08.980> your

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
to me and if you walk over it with your

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.770 
to me and if you walk over it with your
peg<00:04:09.280> nothing<00:04:09.609> will<00:04:09.730> happen<00:04:10.030> he's<00:04:10.629> actually

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780

peg nothing will happen he's actually
drop<00:04:11.079> three<00:04:11.319> lines<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:11.769> you<00:04:11.799> can<00:04:11.980> push<00:04:12.549> them

drop three lines and you can push them

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.759 
drop three lines and you can push them
all<00:04:12.879> in<00:04:13.000> different<00:04:13.180> directions<00:04:13.560> so<00:04:14.560> you<00:04:14.650> can

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
ever get new your base unless it want to

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.440 
ever get new your base unless it want to
die

guy's<00:05:37.330> a<00:05:37.600> lot<00:05:38.230> paler<00:05:38.530> than<00:05:38.740> the<00:05:38.980> other<00:05:39.100> one

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
guy's a lot paler than the other one

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.000 
guy's a lot paler than the other one
they're<00:05:40.600> all<00:05:41.020> different<00:05:41.170> shades<00:05:41.530> of<00:05:41.680> colors

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
they're all different shades of colors

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.280 
they're all different shades of colors
as<00:05:42.190> the<00:05:42.610> normal<00:05:42.940> pig<00:05:43.180> which<00:05:43.390> is<00:05:43.570> would<00:05:44.050> sorry

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
as the normal pig which is would sorry

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.990 
as the normal pig which is would sorry
the<00:05:44.470> normal<00:05:44.920> combat<00:05:45.250> pig<00:05:45.460> which<00:05:45.640> is<00:05:45.760> normal

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
the normal combat pig which is normal

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.570 
the normal combat pig which is normal
Pig<00:05:46.180> color<00:05:46.420> are<00:05:46.870> the<00:05:47.350> 80<00:05:47.530> pig<00:05:47.860> is<00:05:48.010> darker<00:05:48.460> and

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
Pig color are the 80 pig is darker and

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.670 
Pig color are the 80 pig is darker and
this<00:05:48.760> one<00:05:48.910> is<00:05:49.000> lighter<00:05:49.270> so<00:05:50.260> that<00:05:50.440> I<00:05:50.470> think

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
this one is lighter so that I think

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.380 
this one is lighter so that I think
that's<00:05:50.830> a<00:05:51.010> bit<00:05:51.160> more<00:05:51.310> interesting<00:05:51.490> Jesus<00:05:51.940> than

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
that's a bit more interesting Jesus than

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.700 
that's a bit more interesting Jesus than
just<00:05:52.600> having<00:05:52.780> them<00:05:52.960> all<00:05:53.110> exactly<00:05:53.320> the<00:05:53.650> same

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
just having them all exactly the same

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.120 
just having them all exactly the same
color<00:05:54.460> now<00:05:55.210> as<00:05:55.450> you<00:05:55.630> can<00:05:55.750> tell<00:05:55.810> this<00:05:56.200> one<00:05:56.500> you

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
color now as you can tell this one you

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.630 
color now as you can tell this one you
can<00:05:57.160> actually<00:05:57.430> fly<00:05:58.890> it<00:05:59.890> overpowered<00:06:00.430> maybe

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
can actually fly it overpowered maybe

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.730 
can actually fly it overpowered maybe
and<00:06:00.910> when<00:06:01.360> you<00:06:01.480> let<00:06:01.780> go<00:06:01.810> he<00:06:02.170> will<00:06:02.260> just<00:06:02.440> slide

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
and when you let go he will just slide

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.490 
and when you let go he will just slide
slowly<00:06:03.400> down<00:06:03.820> so<00:06:04.720> it's<00:06:04.840> good<00:06:05.020> programming

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
slowly down so it's good programming

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.530 
slowly down so it's good programming
it's<00:06:05.740> like<00:06:05.890> having<00:06:06.190> a<00:06:06.250> parachute<00:06:06.730> except<00:06:07.450> the

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
it's like having a parachute except the

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.380 
it's like having a parachute except the
pig<00:06:07.780> can<00:06:08.020> fly<00:06:08.290> I'm<00:06:08.560> not<00:06:08.740> sure<00:06:08.980> um<00:06:09.490> how<00:06:10.180> that

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.390 
pig can fly I'm not sure um how that

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.850 
pig can fly I'm not sure um how that
comes<00:06:10.600> into<00:06:10.840> the<00:06:10.990> storyline<00:06:11.290> at<00:06:11.500> all<00:06:11.620> because

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
comes into the storyline at all because

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.130 
comes into the storyline at all because
maybe<00:06:12.490> I'm<00:06:13.030> thinking<00:06:13.660> this<00:06:13.750> is<00:06:13.900> a<00:06:13.930> bit

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
maybe I'm thinking this is a bit

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.630 
maybe I'm thinking this is a bit
overpowered<00:06:14.560> but<00:06:14.830> you<00:06:14.890> also<00:06:15.040> has<00:06:15.280> the<00:06:15.460> mini

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.640 
overpowered but you also has the mini

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.720 
overpowered but you also has the mini
guns<00:06:16.350> which<00:06:17.350> means<00:06:17.770> you<00:06:17.920> can<00:06:18.070> try<00:06:18.250> and<00:06:18.400> shoot

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
guns which means you can try and shoot

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.060 
guns which means you can try and shoot
people<00:06:18.880> from<00:06:19.270> the<00:06:19.360> sky<00:06:19.570> if<00:06:20.080> there's<00:06:20.890> anything

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
people from the sky if there's anything

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.130 
people from the sky if there's anything
to<00:06:21.280> shoot<00:06:21.550> there's<00:06:22.390> some<00:06:22.510> pigs<00:06:22.780> over<00:06:22.960> there

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.140 
to shoot there's some pigs over there

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.020 
to shoot there's some pigs over there
I'm<00:06:23.350> not<00:06:23.920> meant<00:06:24.160> to<00:06:24.190> kill<00:06:24.430> pigs<00:06:24.640> because<00:06:24.850> I'm

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
I'm not meant to kill pigs because I'm

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.000 
I'm not meant to kill pigs because I'm

I'm a pic friend but I'm gonna kill them

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.970 
I'm a pic friend but I'm gonna kill them
anyway<00:06:27.130> oh<00:06:27.780> there's<00:06:28.780> another<00:06:28.870> attack<00:06:29.440> pig<00:06:29.770> and

go

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:44.879 
go
you<00:06:38.150> can<00:06:39.150> see<00:06:39.300> I'm<00:06:39.389> about<00:06:39.950> cut<00:06:40.950> the<00:06:41.070> grass

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:44.889 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:48.209 

come<00:06:45.430> on<00:06:45.550> I<00:06:45.759> can<00:06:46.030> take<00:06:46.210> you<00:06:46.650> oops<00:06:47.650> i<00:06:47.919> just<00:06:47.979> hit

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.679 

think<00:06:54.460> you<00:06:54.669> should<00:06:54.789> have<00:06:54.849> a<00:06:54.909> whip<00:06:55.150> so<00:06:55.509> rather

00:06:55.679 --> 00:06:55.689 
think you should have a whip so rather

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:57.779 
think you should have a whip so rather
than<00:06:55.749> just<00:06:56.020> hitting<00:06:56.199> the<00:06:56.319> pig<00:06:56.590> and<00:06:56.770> he<00:06:57.639> goes

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:57.789 
than just hitting the pig and he goes

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:00.510 
than just hitting the pig and he goes
faster<00:06:58.210> you<00:06:58.300> have<00:06:58.479> to<00:06:58.569> with<00:06:58.749> him<00:06:59.099> so<00:07:00.099> I<00:07:00.159> don't

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
faster you have to with him so I don't

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.379 
faster you have to with him so I don't
know<00:07:00.580> if<00:07:00.610> you<00:07:00.699> can<00:07:00.759> actually<00:07:00.879> hear<00:07:01.150> me<00:07:01.270> when

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.389 
know if you can actually hear me when

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:07.219 
know if you can actually hear me when
the<00:07:01.509> skies<00:07:01.719> on<00:07:01.960> making<00:07:02.529> the<00:07:02.620> minigun<00:07:02.949> noise

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229

to you enough out I think maybe you

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.129 
to you enough out I think maybe you
should<00:07:12.939> go<00:07:13.060> and<00:07:13.150> try<00:07:13.330> alex<00:07:13.629> is<00:07:13.719> really<00:07:13.960> cool

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:14.139 
should go and try alex is really cool
