00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:19.320
 to see them run for weeks five or 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.320
 six because a question 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.050
 80 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:48.539
 how many days per week correct 55 worth 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:52.199
 how many days do you run per week 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.199
 how many days per week 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.730
 how many days per week do you train 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.220
 rain snow make cold or whatever 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.190
 it's a very complicated day 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:31.289
 the good weather is going to be fine not 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.289
 import 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.750
 train because it rains because it's cold 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.750
 because it's windy and I'm not asking 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.650
 with some plan 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:56.130
 the largest circulation, so what more 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.130
 10,000 if you were 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.140
 that's it 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.819
 if you have discomfort 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.819
 somewhere knees ankles 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.980
 today I have because I've been four days 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.099
 I've come on a trip and I have the 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:44.440
 legs like boots but neither do you 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:46.450
 you stay at home because all good but 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.720
 a discomfort that is withdrawn makes no 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.720
 go out running or if you go out good 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.420
 and that will not run 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.770
 you run with annoyances I was not always 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.770
 unemployed 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.230
 nuisance or run is always 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:20.019
 superbly good 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:20.019
 and keeps coming out when you suffer 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:37.290
 and if they have to run it is cowardly or 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.120
 do you think to run to that are 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.120
 brave the second 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.990
 but it's clear but thank you very much 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:10.020
 but I think it's more thanks 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.630
 to see how it is this we stick 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.640
 tremendous early mornings to train or 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.370
 we sacrifice the time of the meal 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.530
 years at night at odd hours 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.080
 we do not care if it rains if it thunders 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.880
 It snows if ice offers a chicharrera 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.220
 how are you doing today that we 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.140
 we catch the caps we usually run 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.170
 with all kinds of ailments in knees 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.120
 in feet ankles hips back and all 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.520
 body parts but we keep trotting 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.800
 and then they tell us that running is 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.050
 cowards running not only is not 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.590
 cowards but to run you have to 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.590
 be a brave
