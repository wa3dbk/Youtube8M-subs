like one of my favorite trick but really

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:26.880 
like one of my favorite trick but really
not<00:00:13.509> hard<00:00:23.429> not<00:00:24.429> really<00:00:24.730> ill<00:00:24.820> I<00:00:25.470> know<00:00:26.470> some

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
not hard not really ill I know some

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.460 
not hard not really ill I know some
people<00:00:26.920> put<00:00:27.429> it<00:00:27.580> like<00:00:27.759> that<00:00:27.789> like<00:00:28.269> I<00:00:29.199> thrive

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470

people put it like that like I thrive
here<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:35.710> put<00:00:35.980> mine<00:00:36.160> over<00:00:36.190> here<00:00:36.550> because<00:00:37.000> you

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
here I put mine over here because you

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.850 
here I put mine over here because you
have<00:00:37.600> to<00:00:37.720> get<00:00:37.870> only<00:00:38.050> a<00:00:38.170> half<00:00:38.530> for<00:00:39.340> like<00:00:39.790> a<00:00:39.820> for

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
have to get only a half for like a for

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.750 
have to get only a half for like a for
rotation<00:00:41.860> and<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:43.270> you<00:00:43.330> barely<00:00:43.750> flick<00:00:44.200> it<00:00:44.380> all

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
rotation and so you barely flick it all

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.120 
rotation and so you barely flick it all
and<00:00:45.760> so<00:00:46.120> it's<00:00:46.570> like<00:00:46.900> your<00:00:47.470> back<00:00:47.650> foot<00:00:47.920> like

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
and so it's like your back foot like

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.580 
and so it's like your back foot like
wherever<00:00:48.910> you<00:00:49.330> want<00:00:49.630> I

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
wherever you want I

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.970 
wherever you want I
you<00:00:52.070> want<00:00:52.250> pop<00:00:52.600> and<00:00:53.600> then<00:00:54.020> you<00:00:54.170> click<00:00:54.650> like<00:00:54.920> a

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
you want pop and then you click like a

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.360 
you want pop and then you click like a
little<00:00:55.340> bit<00:00:55.900> like<00:00:56.900> that<00:00:57.140> did<00:00:57.830> you<00:00:58.010> get<00:00:58.190> either

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
little bit like that did you get either

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.850 
little bit like that did you get either
halfway<00:00:59.000> or<00:00:59.239> fourth<00:00:59.630> and<00:00:59.870> I'm<00:00:59.960> not<00:01:00.590> finding

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
halfway or fourth and I'm not finding

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.890 
halfway or fourth and I'm not finding
easier<00:01:01.430> to<00:01:01.610> get<00:01:01.760> it<00:01:04.330> because<00:01:05.330> it<00:01:05.479> gets<00:01:05.630> like

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
easier to get it because it gets like

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.109 
easier to get it because it gets like
like<00:01:06.530> Billy<00:01:06.740> vertical<00:01:07.280> like<00:01:07.430> up<00:01:07.580> here<00:01:07.610> that

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
like Billy vertical like up here that

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.240 
like Billy vertical like up here that
might<00:01:08.270> be<00:01:08.390> hard<00:01:08.600> for<00:01:08.720> you<00:01:08.900> and<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:09.979> it's

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
might be hard for you and so it's

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.859 
might be hard for you and so it's
usually<00:01:10.670> you<00:01:10.729> get<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:11.000> a<00:01:11.030> fourth<00:01:13.479> so<00:01:14.479> what<00:01:14.750> you

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
usually you get it a fourth so what you

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.690 
usually you get it a fourth so what you
need<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.050> do<00:01:15.290> is<00:01:16.210> again<00:01:17.210> you<00:01:17.479> pop<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:18.530> once<00:01:19.520> and

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
need to do is again you pop and once and

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.090 
need to do is again you pop and once and
see<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:19.970> halfway<00:01:20.180> or<00:01:20.600> fourth<00:01:20.930> if<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.800> fourth

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
see the halfway or fourth if the fourth

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.780 
see the halfway or fourth if the fourth
um<00:01:22.840> scoop<00:01:23.840> downward<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:24.649> the<00:01:24.680> side<00:01:25.040> so<00:01:25.520> just

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
um scoop downward to the side so just

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.420 
um scoop downward to the side so just
let<00:01:26.450> them<00:01:26.600> speak<00:01:26.810> like<00:01:27.020> that<00:01:27.050> and<00:01:27.530> go<00:01:27.649> in<00:01:27.770> 30<00:01:28.070> so

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
let them speak like that and go in 30 so

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.320 
let them speak like that and go in 30 so
it<00:01:29.060> like<00:01:30.040> goes<00:01:31.040> down<00:01:31.399> but<00:01:31.790> if<00:01:31.910> you<00:01:32.030> get<00:01:32.149> it

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
it like goes down but if you get it

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.450 
it like goes down but if you get it
halfway<00:01:33.340> um<00:01:34.690> you<00:01:35.690> just<00:01:35.720> um

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
halfway um you just um

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.469 
halfway um you just um
scooped<00:01:37.790> up<00:01:37.970> words<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:38.630> side<00:01:38.900> like<00:01:39.320> that

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
scooped up words to the side like that

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:47.010 
scooped up words to the side like that
and<00:01:43.240> really<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.570> only<00:01:44.600> common<00:01:45.380> problem

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
and really the only common problem

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.210 
and really the only common problem
that's<00:01:48.020> probably<00:01:48.470> going<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.770> happen<00:01:49.100> to

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
that's probably going to happen to

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.600 
that's probably going to happen to
everyone<00:01:49.550> is<00:01:50.509> on<00:01:50.960> it's<00:01:51.710> just<00:01:51.920> like<00:01:52.040> landing

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
everyone is on it's just like landing

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.520 
everyone is on it's just like landing
with<00:01:52.759> one<00:01:53.030> foot<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.630> it's<00:01:53.900> probably<00:01:54.110> going<00:01:54.470> to

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
with one foot and it's probably going to

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.469 
with one foot and it's probably going to
be<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.830> Trump<00:01:55.250> that<00:01:55.490> lands<00:01:55.729> on<00:01:55.940> board<00:01:56.240> can<00:01:56.390> you

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
be the Trump that lands on board can you

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.100 
be the Trump that lands on board can you
do<00:01:56.600> a<00:01:56.630> whole<00:01:56.869> trip<00:01:57.080> with<00:01:57.290> your<00:01:57.440> consort<00:01:57.950> and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
do a whole trip with your consort and

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.780 
do a whole trip with your consort and
and<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.350> reason<00:02:00.770> your<00:02:00.920> back<00:02:01.100> foot<00:02:01.369> doesn't<00:02:01.520> go

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
and the reason your back foot doesn't go

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.240 
and the reason your back foot doesn't go
on<00:02:01.970> is<00:02:02.180> because<00:02:02.600> like<00:02:02.840> you're<00:02:03.440> not<00:02:03.619> used<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.130> it

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
on is because like you're not used to it

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.490 
on is because like you're not used to it
just<00:02:04.460> like<00:02:04.580> just<00:02:05.450> like<00:02:05.570> waiting<00:02:05.960> there<00:02:06.200> in<00:02:06.350> the

just like just like waiting there in the

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.810 
just like just like waiting there in the
air<00:02:06.680> while<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.190> do<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.520> trick<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.119> so<00:02:09.050> on<00:02:09.820> why

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
air while you do the trick and so on why

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.790 
air while you do the trick and so on why
do<00:02:10.880> you<00:02:11.000> do<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:13.700> won't<00:02:13.970> try<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.510> get<00:02:14.870> you

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
do you do that you won't try to get you

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.590 
do you do that you won't try to get you
try<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.100> just<00:02:16.340> do<00:02:16.519> the<00:02:16.670> trick<00:02:16.970> as<00:02:17.150> soon<00:02:17.450> as

possible so so you're back to decide to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.780 
possible so so you're back to decide to
wait<00:02:21.769> that<00:02:21.980> long<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:22.400> once<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:22.640> get

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
comfortable doing it like it's not going

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.400 
comfortable doing it like it's not going
to<00:02:25.310> be<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.459> much<00:02:25.610> of<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:26.030> hassle<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.720> one

that then you have to do that in like a
downward<00:02:54.950> motion<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.850> gets<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.269> board<00:02:57.140> to

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
downward motion so it gets the board to

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.680 
downward motion so it gets the board to
UM<00:02:57.650> they<00:02:58.370> go<00:02:58.549> back
