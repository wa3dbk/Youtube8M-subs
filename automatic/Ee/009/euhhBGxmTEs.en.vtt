00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.609
 some animals that through their evolution have developed claws 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.749
 teeth pesuÃ±as casco hornos de cervera 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.499
 for your protection defense or attack 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:29.549
 the same nature endowed them with certain gestures and signals 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.620
 that neutralize the attacks 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.580
 between the congeners of the same species 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.790
 otherwise they would have been extinguished 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.550
 in the specific case of the horse 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.360
 You have several ways to show your submission 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.330
 not to be attacked or to indicate its leader there were other members of the 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
 herd that is lower on the hierarchical scale 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.770
 in this semi-wild pack we are seeing 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.230
 we observe the arrival of the leader ogesa the group and immediately observe 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.530
 like a foal 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.710
 make it a submission gesture with your mouth 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.570
 this gesture can be done until the 2 hotels approximately 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.980
 because then the lower jaw and physics and they can no longer 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.740
 do it more 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.580
 in that case they are expelled from the pack to live in with the singles groups 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 this only happens with the males 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.680
 when we work in the circular corral to tame a colt or just to 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.910
 get the leadership of a horse 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.470
 if they consider their objective leader 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.470
 will not show your submission in a different way 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.380
 the first signal is observed when we stop it 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.800
 standing behind us 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.370
 and the second sign of submission is made with the mouth as its shell 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.070
 something 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.070
 as we could observe earlier in the field 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.449
 The third sign is made by lowering the head 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.049
 as if the fa that will do something on the floor 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:32.429
 the fourth sign is that the height of your head should be lower than ours 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.939
 and the fifth sign of submission is the follow-up which is to follow 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.839
 from behind when we walk 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:54.249
 I show this and explained it 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:58.949
 as a result of which a well-known tolosa has said that the horse does not have signals 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:00.039
 of your mission 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:03.319
 as you can see the images speak for themselves 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.659
 thank you
