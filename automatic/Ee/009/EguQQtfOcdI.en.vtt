 or welcome to the kitchen for all 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.120
 today we will make lemon slush 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.320
 ingredients that we will need are 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:14.460
 the following 150 grams of sugar 200 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.490
 milliliters of water the juice of 4 lemons 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.230
 squeezed and well strained the first thing that 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.430
 we have to do is put the water in a 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.070
 saucepan we add the sugar we put it to 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.199
 strong fire and we will go up the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.050
 pasta list completely dissolved the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.570
 sugar and water and sugar begin to 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.149
 boil once the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.910
 boiling let's lower the fire to 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.180
 medium-high and let's leave it for 2 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.190
 minutes with a few small boils one 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.379
 once two minutes have passed in what 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.930
 that you have small errors you are seeing 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.110
 right now we put out the fire what 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.420
 we remove and we're going to let the syrup 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.910
 cool down once our syrup has 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.900
 to be totally cold we will add 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.680
 the lemon juice 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.660
 and let's mix it well we already have this 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.430
 well mixed and we also have here in 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.200
 the container in which we are going to put 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.690
 in a mold that is used to make 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.190
 plum cake but you can use any 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.840
 mold that you have at home that is 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.890
 rectangular 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.890
 so let's add it 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.470
 and we're going to put it in the freezer 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.180
 45 minutes have passed 45 minutes and now 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.580
 we have taken our preparation of the 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.950
 freezer as you can see has this 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.479
 aspect that is a bit frozen but 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.640
 it's still a little liquid 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.280
 be yours a stay at 45 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.140
 minutes leave it a little more time already 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.240
 let's move on to grate it with the help of 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.080
 a fork being careful not to scratch 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.080
 the container 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.100
 once our organized either 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.980
 well scratched let's put it in the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.200
 freezer about two hours in those two 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.970
 we'll take it out every half hour and 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.380
 we will repeat the procedure that 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.810
 we just did that with a 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.670
 grate the grate 'we have and so on 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.320

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.480
 been scratching it every half hour 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:14.730
