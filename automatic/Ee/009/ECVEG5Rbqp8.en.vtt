00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
just to prevent flaking because

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.230 
just to prevent flaking because
sometimes<00:01:37.439> mascaras<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.220> flick<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.549> my<00:01:39.090> lower

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240

i<00:01:49.350> notice<00:01:49.770> like<00:01:50.100> clumping<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.060> not<00:01:51.210> like

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
i notice like clumping but it's not like

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.450 
i notice like clumping but it's not like
a<00:01:51.360> lot<00:01:51.630> for<00:01:51.840> me<00:01:51.930> i<00:01:51.960> don't<00:01:52.500> really<00:01:52.619> mind<00:01:52.950> comping

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
a lot for me i don't really mind comping

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.429 
a lot for me i don't really mind comping
because<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.180> kind<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.450> makes<00:01:54.630> my<00:01:54.840> eyelashes

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
because it kind of makes my eyelashes

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.420 
because it kind of makes my eyelashes
look<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.649> little<00:01:55.770> bit<00:01:55.920> thicker<00:01:56.100> than<00:01:56.310> I

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
look a little bit thicker than I

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.130 
look a little bit thicker than I
actually<00:01:56.549> are<00:01:56.880> what<00:01:57.240> formula<00:01:57.659> but<00:01:57.869> when<00:01:58.020> it

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
actually are what formula but when it

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.929 
actually are what formula but when it
dries<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.409> becomes<00:01:58.680> like<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.189> waxy<00:01:59.579> texture

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
dries it becomes like that waxy texture

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.639 
dries it becomes like that waxy texture
like<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.240> said<00:02:00.390> before<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.110> kind<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.500> what

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
like I said before it is kind of what

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.810 
like I said before it is kind of what
though<00:02:01.799> when<00:02:01.979> you're<00:02:02.100> applying<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.729> have

though when you're applying so you have

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.069 
though when you're applying so you have
to<00:02:02.909> be<00:02:02.969> careful<00:02:03.119> or<00:02:03.360> else<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.600> get<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:04.049> your

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
I've besides like the minor things like

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.890 
I've besides like the minor things like
it<00:02:15.510> flakes<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.840> little<00:02:16.020> bit<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:17.900> apologize

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.630 
it flakes a little bit and I apologize
for<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.110> lighting<00:02:19.350> um<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:20.280> only<00:02:20.310> bad<00:02:20.610> thing

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
for the lighting um the only bad thing

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.490 
for the lighting um the only bad thing
is<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.300> flakes<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.630> little<00:02:21.870> bit<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.230> it's

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
is that it flakes a little bit and it's

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.440 
is that it flakes a little bit and it's
kind<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:23.100> little<00:02:23.490> too<00:02:23.670> wet<00:02:23.850> maybe<00:02:24.090> after<00:02:24.420> I

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
kind of a little too wet maybe after I

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.540 
kind of a little too wet maybe after I
use<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.720> for<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.870> while<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.530> know<00:02:25.680> maybe<00:02:26.370> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
use it for a while you know maybe the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.830 
use it for a while you know maybe the
formula<00:02:26.910> will<00:02:27.030> dry<00:02:27.180> up<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:27.420> little<00:02:27.630> bit<00:02:27.720> and

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
formula will dry up a little bit and

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.410 
formula will dry up a little bit and
maybe<00:02:27.960> it'll<00:02:28.290> be<00:02:28.320> easier<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.770> work<00:02:28.920> with<00:02:28.980> um

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
maybe it'll be easier to work with um

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.850 
maybe it'll be easier to work with um
and<00:02:30.420> there's<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.780> slight<00:02:31.230> amount<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.560> clumping

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
and there's a slight amount of clumping

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.530 
and there's a slight amount of clumping
but<00:02:32.040> other<00:02:32.160> than<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.370> like<00:02:32.640> those<00:02:33.000> are<00:02:33.180> minor

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
but other than that like those are minor

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.000 
but other than that like those are minor
things<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.080> don't<00:02:34.260> really<00:02:34.320> bother<00:02:34.650> me<00:02:34.770> if
