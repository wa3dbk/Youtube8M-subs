00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
buying a great world cup a tea a trade I

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.550 
buying a great world cup a tea a trade I
think<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.480> lot<00:02:21.600> of<00:02:21.630> his<00:02:21.810> stats<00:02:22.050> are<00:02:22.200> going<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.410> go

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
think a lot of his stats are going to go

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.440 
think a lot of his stats are going to go
up<00:02:22.590> as<00:02:22.830> well<00:02:22.950> game<00:02:23.220> with<00:02:23.370> plus<00:02:23.610> one<00:02:23.880> plus<00:02:24.120> twos

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
up as well game with plus one plus twos

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.470 
up as well game with plus one plus twos
on<00:02:24.630> most<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.230> them<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.560> yet<00:02:26.400> Manuel<00:02:26.910> no<00:02:27.090> again

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.940 
on most of them and yet Manuel no again
