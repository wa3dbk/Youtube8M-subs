00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.490
 for a day 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.340
 about 100 students use the 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.810
 chance the profession of a soldier 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.790
 to experience practically 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.500
 which girl has ever been 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.760
 possibility of the command over one 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.500
 to take over armor with 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.180
 to work at night vision devices and 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.970
 to solve complicated tasks 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.250
 we accompany eva anna lena and kerstin 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.340
 a day in reconnaissance distribution 8 in 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.600
 Bavarian Freyung first task the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.600
 Command the game to command the clinic 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:52.110
 the ride is hardly finished 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:01:03.239
 the girls with their group leader 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:06.810
 the questions will definitely be dealt with 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.720
 Your colleague must now have advantages 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.729
 not true and that exactly the same 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.869
 Hand then does the same thing as a work 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.150
 have to do a lot 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.229
 in the same step it goes on to 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.060
 next station 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.520
 here the girls must be in the dark 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.100
 working with the night vision device lucy 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.020
 but the device has its pitfalls the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.430
 view is limited and makes the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.820
 easiest exercise to one 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.820
 Challenge 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:40.670
 12 o'clock lunch break in the barracks 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.740
 canteen strengthening need 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.390
 also the next and the students 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.270
 last task still requires them 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.710
 once everything is off fitness skill 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.030
 and quick thinking are here 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:56.590
 orienteering critical of 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:02.060
 court and now is 105 times schÃ¼tte 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.850
 establishment of the new thrown compass 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.680
 shows the direction is right in the other 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.440
 post the girls need good now 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.430
 eyes and full concentration we are looking for 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.280
 now after objects the world where 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.720
 time is running out 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.720
 now it has to be fast 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:51.130
 that's exactly how it went, that was well described 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:52.540
 Unfamiliar feeling I find that women 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.410
 have the same opportunities as men 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.060
 Bundeswehr and that they are the women too 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.250
 to give opportunities in the field of 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.860
 family in the Bundeswehr a 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.720
 okay that was very nice there were very 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.880
 have done many different things 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.310
 We also do things ourselves 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.960
 that was not great either 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.330
 you just have a little better 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.160
 insight into the Bundeswehr get that way 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.340
 I actually found the day very much 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.990
 enriching on the girls day also shows 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.000
 again this year the diversity of 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.450
 job opportunities for young women in 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.450
 the Bundeswehr
