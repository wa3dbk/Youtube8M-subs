00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.540
 I will show you how everything 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.240
 simply clean his controller 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.610
 playstation 3 so the video will be all 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.710
 simple but hey she will be effective 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.449
 so you need some gel alcohol +6 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:26.369
 and not so that it evaporates too much 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:29.670
 quickly to coronthie toothpicks and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:34.079
 a sopalin so we will start everything 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:39.780
 first with the sopalin so we folded 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.640
 in four we will add a little bit of 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.280
 the alcohol 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:51.300
 we will answer on the evening to avoid 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:56.010
 to damage so you do not have to stay 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.809
 too long wiped the controller so 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.989
 the low alcohol it will allow you to 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.170
 clean the the joystick and the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.350
 disinfect so that's very important 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.970
 the right bottom joystick that is coming in 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.680
 second position after the phone 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.890
 like when we call it 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:22.860
 like like the thing that contaminates the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:27.409
 more evil man the modern man to 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.320
 diseases etc. fevers and diarrhea 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.020
 so it cleans well as everything must be 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.780
 the joystick 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.540
 So there was a cleaner case 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.450
 than at the beginning so it's not over 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.560
 takes the cotton swab 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.000
 so we finished the handkerchief for 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:53.090
 the moment we take the cotton stalk we go 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.159
 the bib and slightly alcohol like this 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:01.079
 can answer the alcohol 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:06.990
 and we'll clean the edges of the 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:17.390
 joystick which are for my part shielded from 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:21.060
 dust the cotton allow good the 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:26.190
 to remove the dust in too much 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:30.810
 davis here we are already grime well 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:41.370
 others so do not hesitate to add 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:45.420
 a little bit of alcohol like this so 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.599
 assure you that the plan is that a 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.599
 living room 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:59.840
 and here like this that is so 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:03.870
 now we will go to the edges two 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.569
 giants time already just put over 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.799
 brightness 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:15.209
 we will move to the edges when I you 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:17.880
 said no more their edge it's going to be his 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.910
 sides there the person's slits so 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.720
 reached there is a lot of grime 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.720
 we use the toothpick 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.410
 and we can see all the grace that 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.830
 so integrate that it's due to the 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:41.879
 sweating and all that goes away 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:49.950
 do not hesitate to blow up so we 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:54.750
 will iron after alcohol then then 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.430
 I will take you back so here I have I 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.860
 got rid of all the dirt 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.840
 who they were in the slots so 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.410
 there is an unimaginable number of dirt 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:08.790
 for for a joystick only so we 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:12.690
 will iron with the towel like 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:16.229
 used it just before the sopalin we go 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:20.700
 iron even handle with alcohol especially 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:23.190
 at the level of the slits or where the dirt there 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:31.169
 was to remove the residue that is at 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:40.169
 tour of France so here do not forget 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:43.440
 not the keys for analogs 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.789
 so from time to time because everything 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.919
 like me, I bring them to me 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.419
 so there is not one in a while we have 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.610
 a white wax that form here in 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.710
 do this because of a host that is 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.790
 actually consume with them with the 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:02.400
 contours of the bay of lemons 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:12.420
 we just fold the paper towels and the following 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:14.180
 the robot simply this last 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.700
 advice to give you 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.630
 past the same tooth cure that actually 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.910
 next to the micro usb port 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:28.380
 there is also dirt 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:29.880
 so here it was a small account a 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.250
 little demonstration to show you 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.070
 how to clean effectively it's up to 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.790
 say for against alcohol is against 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.810
 sorry against bacteria and 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:44.760
 aesthetically we will say that on appeal 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.320
 like that for the so the hygiene of the 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.970
 controller 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:52.190
 So, thanks to all of you for seeing me 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.190
 this video here we say ah the next
