I clean my melting sensors so this is um
I<00:00:09.410> don't<00:00:10.410> know<00:00:10.559> which<00:00:10.679> ones<00:00:10.889> which<00:00:11.130> but<00:00:11.160> bank<00:00:11.969> 1

got sandpaper this is a you can use any
sandpaper<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:40.460> bell<00:00:41.460> sandpaper<00:00:41.960> for

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
sandpaper this is a bell sandpaper for

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.610 
sandpaper this is a bell sandpaper for
the<00:00:43.170> belt

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the belt

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.190 
the belt
but<00:00:43.800> um<00:00:45.800> you<00:00:46.800> P<00:00:46.980> use<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.930> wet<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.110> dry

but um you P use on a wet and dry

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.799 
but um you P use on a wet and dry
sandpaper<00:00:50.750> I'll<00:00:51.750> say<00:00:52.260> use<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.809> seven

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
sandpaper I'll say use like a seven

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.830 
sandpaper I'll say use like a seven
hundred<00:00:54.930> grit<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:58.129> my<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.160> use<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.820> bright<00:01:00.570> tuna

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
hundred grit and my I use on bright tuna

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.070 
hundred grit and my I use on bright tuna
so<00:01:03.840> pretty<00:01:04.260> much<00:01:04.470> what<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> do<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.479> do

so pretty much what I do the what I do

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.609 
so pretty much what I do the what I do
with<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> brake<00:01:07.530> cleaner<00:01:07.860> as<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.820> see

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
with the brake cleaner as you can see

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.609 
with the brake cleaner as you can see
there's<00:01:10.619> holes<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.040> here<00:01:12.229> see<00:01:13.229> how<00:01:13.380> there's

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
there's holes in here see how there's

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.899 
there's holes in here see how there's
holes<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.010> there<00:01:15.049> so<00:01:16.159> when<00:01:17.159> I'm<00:01:17.280> set<00:01:17.549> when<00:01:17.790> I'm

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
holes in there so when I'm set when I'm

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.780 
holes in there so when I'm set when I'm
standing<00:01:18.390> all<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:19.590> muck<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.229> build<00:01:22.229> up<00:01:22.790> I'm

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
standing all this muck and build up I'm

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.670 
standing all this muck and build up I'm
pretty<00:01:24.030> sure<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:24.960> I'm<00:01:25.110> standing<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
pretty sure that when I'm standing the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.859 
pretty sure that when I'm standing the
the<00:01:26.100> dust<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.729> all<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> other<00:01:27.150> particles

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
the dust and all the other particles

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.130 
the dust and all the other particles
inside<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.229> Dalton<00:01:29.009> sensor<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.600> pretty<00:01:30.990> much

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
inside the Dalton sensor so pretty much

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.120 
inside the Dalton sensor so pretty much
what<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:31.650> do<00:01:31.890> I'll<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:32.729> grab<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:34.130> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
what I just do I'll just grab the the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.249 
what I just do I'll just grab the the
chemical<00:01:35.670> notes<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.060> spray<00:01:36.420> inside<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.110> get

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
chemical notes the spray inside you get

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.149 
chemical notes the spray inside you get
it<00:01:37.409> all<00:01:37.560> nice<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.200> wet<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.470> get<00:01:40.619> all<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.890> dust

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
it all nice and wet to get all that dust

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.810 
it all nice and wet to get all that dust
out<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.549> there<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.560> then<00:01:43.560> I'll<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.610> continue

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
out of there and then I'll just continue

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.560 
out of there and then I'll just continue
sanding<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.659> some<00:01:46.439> more<00:01:46.640> to<00:01:47.640> give<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.030> that

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
sanding it some more to give it that

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.760 
sanding it some more to give it that
nice<00:01:48.780> look<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:50.310> when<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.750> hires<00:01:52.140> reading

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
nice look so when the the hires reading

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.740 
nice look so when the the hires reading
through<00:01:53.009> here<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.880> higher<00:01:54.060> going<00:01:54.540> through

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
through here the higher going through

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.780 
through here the higher going through
here<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.020> having<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> next<00:01:55.590> reading<00:01:55.829> whoa

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
here and having the next reading whoa

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.600 
here and having the next reading whoa
with<00:01:57.540> all<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.780> particle<00:01:58.259> build<00:01:58.409> over<00:01:58.710> here

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
with all this particle build over here

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.670 
with all this particle build over here
we'll<00:02:00.180> give<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.570> better<00:02:00.750> reading<00:02:01.200> if<00:02:01.470> you

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
we'll give it a better reading if you

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.950 
we'll give it a better reading if you
have<00:02:01.830> your<00:02:02.010> open<00:02:02.430> Center<00:02:02.640> scheme<00:02:03.000> then<00:02:03.810> all

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
have your open Center scheme then all

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.460 
have your open Center scheme then all
this<00:02:04.140> build-up<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.800> dirtiness<00:02:05.480> and<00:02:06.480> on<00:02:07.260> when

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
this build-up and dirtiness and on when

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.400 
this build-up and dirtiness and on when
I'm<00:02:07.620> done<00:02:07.830> when<00:02:08.490> I'm<00:02:08.580> done<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.410> what

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
I'm done when I'm done with this what

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.510 
I'm done when I'm done with this what
I'll<00:02:10.530> end<00:02:10.619> up<00:02:10.770> getting<00:02:11.130> to<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:12.480> make<00:02:12.660> sure

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
I'll end up getting to just to make sure

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.060 
I'll end up getting to just to make sure
I'll<00:02:14.520> grab<00:02:14.760> my<00:02:14.790> air<00:02:15.090> gun<00:02:15.530> Connect<00:02:16.530> air<00:02:16.800> hose

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
I'll grab my air gun Connect air hose

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.140 
I'll grab my air gun Connect air hose
and<00:02:17.430> now<00:02:18.120> blow<00:02:18.420> blow<00:02:19.080> out<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:20.120> dough<00:02:21.120> to

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
and now blow blow out the dough to

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.200 
and now blow blow out the dough to
sensor<00:02:21.780> from<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.110> inside<00:02:22.530> just<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.610> make<00:02:24.000> sure

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
sensor from the inside just to make sure

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.480 
sensor from the inside just to make sure
I<00:02:24.240> don't<00:02:24.480> know<00:02:25.160> dust<00:02:26.160> inside<00:02:26.520> there<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.530> mean

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
I don't know dust inside there so I mean
