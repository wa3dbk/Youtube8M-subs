00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
they're fruitcakes like me which use a

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.200 
they're fruitcakes like me which use a
ghost<00:01:22.259> pro<00:01:22.560> I'm<00:01:23.159> not<00:01:23.400> proud<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.610> using<00:01:24.000> ghost

but<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> only<00:01:24.990> way<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> could<00:01:25.740> get<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
but it's the only way I could get a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.100 
but it's the only way I could get a
decent<00:01:27.450> game<00:01:27.840> play<00:01:28.110> with<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> gun<00:01:29.340> with<00:01:30.079> such<00:01:31.079> a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
decent game play with a gun with such a

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.179 
decent game play with a gun with such a
disadvantage<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.460> uh<00:01:33.770> it's<00:01:34.770> not<00:01:34.950> good

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
disadvantage like this uh it's not good

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.640 
disadvantage like this uh it's not good
at<00:01:35.310> short<00:01:35.610> short<00:01:36.329> range<00:01:36.869> at<00:01:37.020> all<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.380> short

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
at short short range at all that short

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.109 
at short short range at all that short
range<00:01:37.829> you're<00:01:38.009> better<00:01:38.189> off<00:01:38.250> hip<00:01:38.549> firing<00:01:38.820> like

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
range you're better off hip firing like

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.440 
range you're better off hip firing like
I<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.299> did<00:01:39.600> because<00:01:40.470> um<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:41.369> takes<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.210> long

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
I just did because um it takes so long

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.319 
I just did because um it takes so long
to<00:01:42.509> actually<00:01:42.960> spot<00:01:43.590> um<00:01:43.770> enter<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.850> scope<00:01:45.180> and

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
to actually spot um enter the scope and

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.929 
to actually spot um enter the scope and
shoot<00:01:45.600> someone<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.619> um<00:01:46.950> you're<00:01:47.430> much<00:01:47.579> better

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
shoot someone that um you're much better

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.569 
shoot someone that um you're much better
off<00:01:48.000> hip<00:01:48.299> firing<00:01:48.649> but<00:01:49.649> what<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.040> good<00:01:50.280> at<00:01:50.399> is

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
off hip firing but what it is good at is

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.670 
off hip firing but what it is good at is
it's<00:01:50.759> good<00:01:51.000> at<00:01:51.149> long<00:01:51.810> range<00:01:52.110> encounters

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
it's good at long range encounters

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.429 
it's good at long range encounters
hour-long<00:01:53.570> mid-range<00:01:54.570> encounters<00:01:55.079> because

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
hour-long mid-range encounters because

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.800 
hour-long mid-range encounters because
you<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> advantage<00:01:56.729> with<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.390> extra

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
you have the advantage with the extra

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.870 
you have the advantage with the extra
range<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.829> also<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.700> advantage

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
range and also you have the advantage

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.910 
range and also you have the advantage
because<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.840> could<00:02:01.049> be<00:02:01.170> more<00:02:01.380> accurate<00:02:01.590> with

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
because you could be more accurate with

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.840 
because you could be more accurate with
the<00:02:02.100> added<00:02:02.670> um<00:02:03.439> with<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.560> added<00:02:04.950> range<00:02:05.340> wow<00:02:05.579> I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the added um with the added range wow I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.210 
the added um with the added range wow I
sound<00:02:06.180> repetitive<00:02:06.570> if<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.960> sound<00:02:07.200> stupid<00:02:07.380> okay

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
sound repetitive if I sound stupid okay

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.570 
sound repetitive if I sound stupid okay
so<00:02:08.720> also<00:02:09.720> with<00:02:10.319> these<00:02:10.500> Willie<00:02:10.860> Pete's<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.430> this

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
so also with these Willie Pete's in this

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.550 
so also with these Willie Pete's in this
room<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.300> would<00:02:12.690> have<00:02:12.810> been<00:02:12.989> pretty

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
room it I would have been pretty

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.990 
room it I would have been pretty
to<00:02:13.830> stay<00:02:14.099> in<00:02:14.130> there<00:02:14.400> because<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.730> would<00:02:14.910> have

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
to stay in there because I would have

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.270 
to stay in there because I would have
spotted<00:02:15.270> them<00:02:15.540> using<00:02:15.840> infrared<00:02:16.110> but<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.770> I

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
spotted them using infrared but I I

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.490 
spotted them using infrared but I I
don't<00:02:17.819> know<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.120> guess<00:02:18.180> instinct<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.110> don't<00:02:19.380> I

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
don't know I guess instinct I don't I

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.400 
don't know I guess instinct I don't I
like<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:20.040> be<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.090> clear<00:02:21.510> room<00:02:21.870> because

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
like to be in a clear room because

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.050 
like to be in a clear room because
usually<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.800> don't<00:02:22.890> use<00:02:23.250> guns<00:02:23.489> with<00:02:24.030> the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
usually I don't use guns with the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.520 
usually I don't use guns with the
infrared<00:02:24.360> scope<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.940> as<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.270> just<00:02:27.510> saw<00:02:27.780> it's

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
infrared scope and as you just saw it's

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.640 
infrared scope and as you just saw it's
quite<00:02:29.370> easy<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.970> lose<00:02:30.360> gunfights<00:02:30.959> using<00:02:31.500> this

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
quite easy to lose gunfights using this

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.210 
quite easy to lose gunfights using this
attachment<00:02:32.510> because<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.959> really<00:02:34.590> decreases

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
attachment because it really decreases

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.240 
attachment because it really decreases
your<00:02:35.340> firepower<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.510> decreases<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.200> UM<00:02:37.410> the

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
your firepower it decreases the UM the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.120 
your firepower it decreases the UM the
speed<00:02:38.610> at<00:02:38.760> which<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.970> can<00:02:39.330> move<00:02:40.019> while<00:02:40.739> aiming

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
speed at which you can move while aiming

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.300 
speed at which you can move while aiming
down<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.519> sights<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:43.800> just<00:02:43.980> knife

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
down the sights and so and just knife

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.270 
down the sights and so and just knife
that<00:02:44.519> guy<00:02:44.670> in<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.849> back<00:02:45.060> but<00:02:45.739> of<00:02:46.739> course<00:02:46.830> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
that guy in the back but of course the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.729 
that guy in the back but of course the
added<00:02:47.850> visibility<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.630> plus<00:02:48.989> but<00:02:49.319> besides

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
added visibility is a plus but besides

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.940 
added visibility is a plus but besides
that<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.610> has<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:50.970> lot<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:51.269> cons<00:02:51.569> because<00:02:51.950> ghost

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
that it has a lot of cons because ghost

which is an absolute must if you want to
do<00:03:22.440> good<00:03:22.709> with<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.130> infrared<00:03:23.400> scope<00:03:23.940> see<00:03:24.810> what

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
do good with the infrared scope see what

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.259 
do good with the infrared scope see what
the<00:03:25.109> infrared<00:03:25.560> scope<00:03:25.859> does<00:03:26.160> is<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.609> lowers

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
the infrared scope does is it lowers

the infrared scope does is it lowers
your<00:03:27.299> abs<00:03:28.049> um<00:03:28.410> time<00:03:28.980> ABS<00:03:29.549> standing<00:03:30.090> for<00:03:30.299> of

your abs um time ABS standing for of

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.330 
your abs um time ABS standing for of
course<00:03:30.630> aim<00:03:30.870> down<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.109> sights<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:32.130> it's<00:03:32.250> going

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
course aim down the sights so it's going

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.280 
course aim down the sights so it's going
to<00:03:32.430> take<00:03:32.640> you<00:03:32.819> extra<00:03:33.329> long<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.780> aim<00:03:34.019> down<00:03:34.230> the

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
to take you extra long to aim down the

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.559 
to take you extra long to aim down the
sights<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.920> in<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:35.910> case<00:03:36.150> you're<00:03:36.390> probably

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
sights and in that case you're probably

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.120 
sights and in that case you're probably
going<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:36.840> lose<00:03:36.989> gunfights<00:03:37.530> but<00:03:37.769> with<00:03:37.890> sleight

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
going to lose gunfights but with sleight

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.630 
going to lose gunfights but with sleight
of<00:03:38.160> hand<00:03:38.430> you<00:03:39.299> can<00:03:39.799> pretty<00:03:40.799> much<00:03:40.890> counter<00:03:41.519> out

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
of hand you can pretty much counter out

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.020 
of hand you can pretty much counter out
counter<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:43.139> effects<00:03:43.859> of<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:44.220> infrared<00:03:44.880> aim

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
counter the effects of the infrared aim

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.879 
counter the effects of the infrared aim
down<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.239> sights<00:03:45.389> and<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:46.079> brings<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.709> back<00:03:46.739> to
