00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.719
 that one has a clear goal to do that 

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:10.849
 Eyes can not be fooled 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.320
 from mistakes but just keep going 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.320
 working towards it 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.990
 my name is carolin adelhardt me 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.920
 make an education 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.050
 commercial specialist at aldi sÃ¼d 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.050
 I'm currently in my third year and 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.939
 also active as daily representation 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.130
 So the coolest thing I think 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.399
 that there is never a standstill there is 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.460
 always something to do you have practically always 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.870
 Variety is never boring and you 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.720
 just always try the best 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.610
 yourself from the team and practical 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.260
 then also from the branch out to the 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.379
 I enjoy working most of the time 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.570
 Trainee and be aware that you 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.530
 yes in the short time has already reached 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.530
 also pass on 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.640
 the biggest challenge probably 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.140
 then to the retailer if you want 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.090
 then really alone for the first time 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.340
 loading has responsibility and then 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.080
 Really it shows what's on it 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.110
 when you are completely on your own 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.110
 is 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.520
 as aldi south is a very well known 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.920
 food discounter and my job 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.060
 it's practically in the team together 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.520
 and work behind the scenes 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.520
 so that the customer an appealing 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.510
 loading find yes so the 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.760
 main activities are actually the 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.740
 activities with the scales speak the 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.020
 true provision of the refill and 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.650
 of course, a great value 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.620
 But then they were disposition and 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.090
 also the wall presentation others 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.370
 activities such as the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.910
 cash or even the 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.220
 office work now and then you have sometimes 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.320
 of course, I am there now 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.060
 even new apprentices with learning 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.430
 So were dispositions is the 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.780
 order and there are of course 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.150
 different areas that 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.100
 dry assortment the cooling deep-freezing 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.470
 and you have to settle these too 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.870
 order accordingly that it 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.410
 then enough for the next few days and 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.190
 Of course it must also take care when 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.959
 we order from, for example for 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.180
 Of course, the weekend has to be different 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.640
 we order at the beginning of the week 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.709
 and there are many factors on the 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.300
 So you have to be careful in the first one 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.959
 Year makes me the education 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.640
 First go to retailers and there 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.320
 you just learn the basics 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.120
 For example , we now know that 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.739
 collect the dealings with the customers 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:36.410
 always important the scales presented and 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:39.140
 Everyday stuff in the second year 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.610
 Will you be so much more in the 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.620
 taken responsibility because I then 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.090
 already the possibility had day 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.050
 to become representation and me under 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.480
 evidence 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.350
 if it goes then even times 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.580
 to have the responsibility in the shop 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.709
 in the second year I have then also 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.420
 my instructor sham filed thus 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.000
 can you even get the apprentices? 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.700
 to teach something and in the third year 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.380
 where I am right now 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.130
 one then the final exam for 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.030
 trade specialist and more 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.030
 successively get more responsibility 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.150
 After my high school graduation, I was after 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.060
 an alternative to study 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.070
 and just got the model at aldi south 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.160
 discovered to the commercial specialist that lasts 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.770
 three years and there just had fast 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.500
 a career entry a lot of practice 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.830
 possibilities and comes quickly 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.830
 responsibility 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.210
 if one then representation only in the 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.770
 moment the responsibility in the shop has 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.300
 of course you have to join the team as well 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.760
 organize accordingly and 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.000
 create smooth processes and 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.000
 proceed in a structured way
