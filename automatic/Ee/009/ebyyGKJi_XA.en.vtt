00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.900
 Hello in this video I want you 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.530
 show how to 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.910
 fragmented 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.680
 what about the whole defragmentation 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:24.080
 and then show it like that 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.540
 in windows there is because there is one 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.250
 own defragmentation program with 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.980
 which one can easily make the 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.329
 and in connection a second very 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.489
 imagine a nice free program 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.469
 that is suitable for all windows versions 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.030
 but I now begin only once 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:46.210
 to explain why it almost 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.699
 fragmented hard drive ever goes 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.399
 you see a table this table 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.079
 I have some green cells here 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.230
 marked and red cells 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:02.210
 that should be two programs as one 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.159
 sees is green are the files now 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.170
 not related but if that 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.690
 now your hard drive would be the 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.750
 green and tirol 3 here across the 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.550
 hard disk distributed 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.440
 that is now did not give many users 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.630
 but that makes windows itself 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.030
 because when it calls the files 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.119
 always describe something 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.710
 must rewrite must be so that 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.140
 a file that is beautiful in the beginning 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.890
 standing in a row is just like that 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.200
 the problem is tattered 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.390
 following if your program 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.759
 normal that green it now a photo 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.020
 program is called then leads the 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:44.149
 read head here he tries the files 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.039
 which must be together then find 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.930
 in between where always looking for where to go 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.939
 It continues here then then 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.899
 he seeks again and son until he then 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:57.409
 just all files together has costs 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.750
 time for them because over and over again 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.210
 jump and search must be where is that 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.549
 important file from the program 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.969
 in a de fragmented hard disk 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.039
 it is so that the files of the 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.960
 defragmentation program easy again 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.040
 clean in a row on the hard disk 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.500
 to be written 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.840
 that is if now the read head that 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.000
 green program so for example photo 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.080
 program starts you find everything clean 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.340
 in a row in the 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.100
 Do not jump anymore and get through it 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.780
 a whole corner faster is just like that 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.700
 it now here at the red file the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.800
 They now also clean in a row 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.450
 Of course it can also be faster 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.450
 be called and edited 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.650
 yes it is of course so with windows 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.540
 then not just two files 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.030
 somehow distributed on the hard disk 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.680
 but we're talking about 50,000 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.790
 100,000 and you can then do that 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.720
 imagine chaos that arises there 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.570
 That's why I want you in the next 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.070
 step show how to use the files 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.050
 with a very simple and the 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:03.080
 Rearrange fragmentation program 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:05.060
 come even if you now have a hard disk 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.510
 defrag with windows how are you 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.570
 actually quite simply you open the 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.060
 explorer with the windows button and then 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.670
 he comes here 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.370
 You click on a drive I click 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:24.200
 company on system 10 make right click 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:27.739
 and choose the option properties there 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.380
 you then the rider tools and here 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.850
 it needs the point defragmentation there 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.610
 I now just the button now 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:39.320
 click fragmentate and it opens 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.940
 then the program around the hard disk 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.209
 I actually have to defragment 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.250
 just click on a hard disk then have 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.230
 I down there the option disk 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.959
 analyze 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.570
 He shows me then how strong 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.200
 the plate fragmented really give 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.340
 Defragment volume on this 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.050
 you really just have to 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.989
 press this button and catch the 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.700
 defragmentation 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.380
 but you must also remember that way 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.209
 defragmentation takes a long time 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.830
 can depending on how big your hard drive 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.510
 it can be one 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.320
 quarter of an hour or even one and a half 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:18.979
 or two hours to finish the plate 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.540
 again perfectly clean order 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.820
 I do not do that here now 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.820
 But you can just defragment 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.300
 also stop again at any time or 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.220
 Exhibit nothing bad happens 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.870
 with the files that's all right 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.670
 so 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.150
 notes that the programs are in between 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:39.610
 then you can do it slowly 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.320
 not or I do that for example 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.260
 that I always when I am before me 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.120
 stop with the computer just once 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.910
 let fragment then can you 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.110
 to shake a calm by 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.550
 yes it does not bother me at work 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.760
 next, I wanted you one more 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:01.020
 imagine a nice free program 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:04.630
 the same for all windows versions 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.750
 the hard disk defragments that 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.970
 program is called disc.de ask it 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.340
 There is free and like a swimming pool 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:16.120
 I can download the ship for example 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.920
 link still under the video post what 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.260
 the program is beautiful it is to 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.270
 a whole corner clearer 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.270
 and also has more features 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.320
 You see, for example, there is 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.140
 a color legend so the red files 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.460
 will now be on system z 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.340
 fragmented files and they do that 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.980
 is right and distributes the green 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.930
 files are written clean and 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.490
 are not defragmented so here will be 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.890
 not fragmentation already 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.380
 be worth 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.970
 you just need that 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.250
 drive click that one 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.100
 wants to defragment here too 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.080
 different options how to get the 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.390
 fragmented the normal 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.910
 Defragment would just reach 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.980
 you just see it too much 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.170
 more beautiful than the windows own 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.460
 program and also has one here 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:10.840
 option the pc after the defragmentation 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.420
 turn it off if you click that 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.390
 for example if you have the 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.920
 defragmentation in the end then makes 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.340
 you can just stand the computer 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.440
 to let 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.790
 he shakes in silence for one and a half hours 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.750
 and then turns off automatically 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:28.000
 In addition, you have a whole corner 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.010
 Show more and I have that too 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.160
 impression that the program itself 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:35.490
 a bit cleaner defragmented than 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.469
 the windows own program 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:42.969
 What's more, there's just that 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:45.729
 Program also an addition where you 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:47.559
 to pull the whole thing on the usb-stick 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:48.999
 that means if you have multiple computers 

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:51.789
 you do not have to open the program 

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:53.889
 create all computers but pulls 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:56.319
 there is a version on the usb-stick 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:58.300
 and then you can do that at all 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:59.399
 computers simply plug in the mahd 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.740
 and apply 

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:04.839
 yes, and I would still today 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.610
 personally in Velen with the two 

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:09.430
 options so the windows 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.589
 defragmentation program and that can 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.419
 you actually get his hard drive again 

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:14.459
 pretty clean and also pretty fast 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:17.349
 get 

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:19.719
 I'm with my tips for that 

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:21.219
 defragment in the end and wish you 

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:23.909
 have fun with a faster one 

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:23.909
 hard disk
