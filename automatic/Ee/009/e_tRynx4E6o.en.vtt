 Hello, our today's soft 

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:11.769
 digest will be devoted to three applications 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:16.180
 from Yandex we will begin with the popular program 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:18.220
 Yandex Metro think many of you 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.890
 known this service and most likely you 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.080
 use it with either your computers 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:28.330
 mobile version of Yandex or others 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:32.649
 ways for what is the Yandex Metro 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:36.270
 you choose the starting point the end 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.800
 point and the program builds you a route 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.250
 I wonder what the application requests 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.840
 access to gps data and so with 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.539
 can easily determine the closest to 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.780
 you metro station after building 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:53.050
 route you can see how it is marked 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:58.390
 if you wish, you can see on the map 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:06.880
