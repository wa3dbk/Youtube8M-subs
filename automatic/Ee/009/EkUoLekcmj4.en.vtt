two<00:02:22.209> features<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:23.020> think<00:02:23.140> really<00:02:23.980> you

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
two features that I think really you

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.030 
two features that I think really you
know<00:02:24.520> stand<00:02:24.910> out<00:02:25.150> with<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.450> sawzall<00:02:25.959> I'd<00:02:26.260> be

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
know stand out with the sawzall I'd be

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.800 
know stand out with the sawzall I'd be
remiss<00:02:27.250> if<00:02:27.459> I<00:02:27.700> just<00:02:27.910> didn't<00:02:28.240> say<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.569> power

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
remiss if I just didn't say the power

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.210 
remiss if I just didn't say the power
it's<00:02:29.230> overwhelming

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
it's overwhelming

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.730 
it's overwhelming
this<00:02:30.400> thing<00:02:30.670> just<00:02:30.700> blows<00:02:31.480> me<00:02:31.720> away<00:02:31.810> at<00:02:32.500> the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
this thing just blows me away at the

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.500 
this thing just blows me away at the
power<00:02:33.010> that<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.430> produces<00:02:33.910> in<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.209> cordless

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
power that it produces in the cordless

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.660 
power that it produces in the cordless
platform<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.680> secondly<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.190> think<00:02:36.250> it's<00:02:36.550> the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
platform and secondly I think it's the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.150 
platform and secondly I think it's the
quality<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.270> tool<00:02:37.540> from<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.260> overmold<00:02:38.800> to

the heavy duty metal rafter hook the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.660 
the heavy duty metal rafter hook the

of like you can't push a mule past its

speaking<00:04:05.440> of<00:04:05.500> mules<00:04:05.739> let's<00:04:06.489> head<00:04:06.640> up<00:04:06.760> to

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
speaking of mules let's head up to

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.970 
speaking of mules let's head up to
Concord<00:04:07.570> Massachusetts<00:04:07.750> and<00:04:08.440> find<00:04:08.739> out<00:04:08.860> what

Rob Robillard is tearing up today the

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.350 
Rob Robillard is tearing up today the
thing<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:11.709> like<00:04:11.860> about<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:12.250> Milwaukee<00:04:12.430> fuel<00:04:13.090> is

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
thing I like about the Milwaukee fuel is

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.509 
thing I like about the Milwaukee fuel is
first<00:04:14.350> of<00:04:14.470> all<00:04:14.500> it's<00:04:14.650> got<00:04:14.769> incredible<00:04:15.280> power

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
first of all it's got incredible power

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.030 
first of all it's got incredible power
and<00:04:15.730> great<00:04:16.209> runtime<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:16.989> I<00:04:17.560> like<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:17.859> fact

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
and great runtime and I like the fact

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.710 
and great runtime and I like the fact
that<00:04:18.160> I<00:04:18.310> do<00:04:18.370> not<00:04:18.580> have<00:04:18.760> to<00:04:18.910> drag<00:04:19.120> a<00:04:19.150> cord<00:04:19.510> up

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
that I do not have to drag a cord up

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.630 
that I do not have to drag a cord up
here<00:04:20.049> it's<00:04:20.500> already<00:04:20.769> uncomfortable<00:04:21.100> and

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
here it's already uncomfortable and

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.100 
here it's already uncomfortable and
inconvenient<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.240> be<00:04:22.360> up<00:04:22.479> on<00:04:22.600> a<00:04:22.690> roof<00:04:22.870> of<00:04:23.050> a

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
inconvenient to be up on a roof of a

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.590 
inconvenient to be up on a roof of a
stage<00:04:23.350> and<00:04:23.620> to<00:04:23.770> begin<00:04:24.070> with<00:04:24.419> up<00:04:25.419> until

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
stage and to begin with up until

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.380 
stage and to begin with up until
probably<00:04:26.050> now<00:04:26.560> I<00:04:26.950> wasn't<00:04:27.550> a<00:04:27.700> big<00:04:27.880> fan<00:04:28.180> of

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
probably now I wasn't a big fan of

probably now I wasn't a big fan of
cordless<00:04:28.870> sawzalls<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:30.400> Milwaukee<00:04:30.760> fuel

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
cordless sawzalls the Milwaukee fuel

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.060 
cordless sawzalls the Milwaukee fuel
changed<00:04:31.510> my<00:04:31.630> perspective<00:04:32.140> on<00:04:32.500> that<00:04:32.560> it<00:04:32.800> really

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
changed my perspective on that it really

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.770 
changed my perspective on that it really
does<00:04:33.310> have<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.610> power<00:04:33.820> of<00:04:33.910> a<00:04:34.000> corded<00:04:34.330> tool<00:04:34.510> and

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
does have the power of a corded tool and

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.010 
does have the power of a corded tool and
with<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:35.740> hook<00:04:36.000> it's<00:04:37.000> just<00:04:37.210> nice<00:04:37.390> I<00:04:37.570> can<00:04:37.720> I<00:04:37.840> can

with the hook it's just nice I can I can

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.630 
with the hook it's just nice I can I can
hang<00:04:38.530> it<00:04:38.680> right<00:04:38.770> out<00:04:38.919> of<00:04:38.950> the<00:04:39.070> way<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.220> can<00:04:39.520> do

real nice tool I've used a lot of rips I

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.690 
real nice tool I've used a lot of rips I
was<00:04:44.200> over<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.470> years<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:45.070> probably<00:04:45.310> been

was over the years and probably been

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.430 
was over the years and probably been
equally<00:04:46.090> frustrated<00:04:46.690> by<00:04:46.780> all<00:04:46.810> of<00:04:47.110> them<00:04:47.260> your

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
corded saws will go all day long but

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.270

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
let's face it cords are a real pain in

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.070 
let's face it cords are a real pain in
the<00:04:51.370> butt

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
the butt

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.290 
the butt
cordless<00:04:53.080> saws<00:04:53.530> on<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:53.950> other<00:04:54.070> hand

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
cordless saws on the other hand

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.480 
cordless saws on the other hand
a<00:04:55.330> lot<00:04:56.139> of<00:04:56.259> them<00:04:56.349> can't<00:04:56.710> hack<00:04:56.889> the<00:04:57.069> tough<00:04:57.280> stuff

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
a lot of them can't hack the tough stuff

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.010 
a lot of them can't hack the tough stuff
and<00:04:57.729> even<00:04:57.909> those<00:04:58.030> that<00:04:58.060> can<00:04:58.419> can<00:04:58.659> only<00:04:58.780> do<00:04:58.930> it

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
and even those that can can only do it

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.719 
and even those that can can only do it
for<00:04:59.169> a<00:04:59.229> short<00:04:59.409> time<00:04:59.710> and<00:05:00.039> then<00:05:00.129> you've<00:05:00.340> gotta

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
for a short time and then you've gotta

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.059 
for a short time and then you've gotta
stop<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:01.210> change<00:05:01.389> the<00:05:01.599> battery<00:05:01.900> well<00:05:02.860> I<00:05:02.919> think

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
stop and change the battery well I think

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.330 
stop and change the battery well I think
