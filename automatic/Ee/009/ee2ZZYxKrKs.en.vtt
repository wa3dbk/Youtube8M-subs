it's<00:00:11.080> not<00:00:11.199> really<00:00:11.440> great<00:00:11.949> because<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:13.750> whole

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
it's not really great because the whole

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.660 
it's not really great because the whole
point<00:00:14.109> is<00:00:14.289> to

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
point is to

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.129 
point is to
so<00:00:14.760> much<00:00:14.880> rather<00:00:15.060> put<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.330> can<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.810> transfer

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
so much rather put you can and transfer

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.930 
so much rather put you can and transfer
all<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.290> power<00:00:16.560> from<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:16.770> runner<00:00:17.040> into

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
all the power from that runner into

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.600 
all the power from that runner into
getting<00:00:18.300> light<00:00:18.800> and<00:00:19.800> going<00:00:20.040> sideways<00:00:20.279> into

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
getting light and going sideways into

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.490 
getting light and going sideways into
their<00:00:20.850> rings<00:00:21.630> motion<00:00:21.900> around<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.140> side<00:00:22.290> which

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
their rings motion around the side which

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.410 
their rings motion around the side which
helps<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.830> twist<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.849> doesn't<00:00:24.119> help<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.360> a

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
helps the twist that doesn't help that a

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.470 
helps the twist that doesn't help that a
height<00:00:24.770> so<00:00:25.770> I<00:00:25.950> don't<00:00:26.189> see<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.490> once<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.210> nice

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
height so I don't see that once is nice

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.030 
height so I don't see that once is nice
straight<00:00:27.810> off<00:00:28.200> where<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.410> go<00:00:28.560> into<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.890> in

disposition<00:00:46.199> to<00:00:46.550> this<00:00:47.550> open<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:47.969> petition

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
disposition to this open this petition

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.380 
disposition to this open this petition
or<00:00:48.540> low<00:00:48.780> down<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.170> floor<00:00:50.239> you<00:00:51.239> have

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
or low down on the floor you have

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.060 
or low down on the floor you have
incomes<00:00:51.930> pioneers<00:00:52.710> not<00:00:53.430> faster<00:00:54.739> smaller<00:00:55.739> back

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
incomes pioneers not faster smaller back

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.270 
incomes pioneers not faster smaller back
on<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.339> floor

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.450 
on the floor
so<00:01:00.650> another<00:01:01.650> thing<00:01:01.740> I<00:01:01.950> often<00:01:02.190> see<00:01:02.430> people

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
so another thing I often see people

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.000 
so another thing I often see people
doing<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.970> reach<00:01:03.120> miles<00:01:03.450> alone<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.620> what<00:01:04.920> you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
doing is reach miles alone so what you

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.560 
doing is reach miles alone so what you
don't<00:01:05.190> want<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.370> do<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.519> around<00:01:05.730> like<00:01:05.940> this<00:01:08.570> it

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
don't want to do it around like this it

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.000 
don't want to do it around like this it
loses<00:01:09.900> power<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.410> don't<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:10.860> much

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
