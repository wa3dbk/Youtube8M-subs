00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.270
 hello today I come to talk to you about the load 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:10.360
 electric to be able to understand the load 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:14.400
 electrical remember an atom that is 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:19.449
 constituted an atom I'm going to draw here 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.720
 five elements that will represent me 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.180
 the five protons in the nucleus of a 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.590
 atom 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.590
 and five other elements 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.890
 that represent 5 neutrons in the 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:40.490
 nucleus of an atom of the atomic number 5 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:45.790
 I'm going to draw around then 1 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:48.970
 2 3 4 and 5 elements of negative charge 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.610
 what are the electrons these electrons 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:57.140
 remember they are traveling around 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.750
 of the nucleus forming different clouds of 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:05.900
 Energy 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:09.260
 in this case this atom is charged 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.700
 forgiveness is not charged is neutral 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:17.300
 because it has 5 charge electrons 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.240
 negative and 5 positive charge protons 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.120
 both the electron and the proton have 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.080
 the same magnitude of the load are 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:31.550
 scalar quantities only have their 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.710
 magnitude when an atom like this that 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.830
 have a property to win or lose 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.820
 electrons loses an electron let's say 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.190
 that this electron travels to another atom 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.770
 then this atoms the screenwriter 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.320
 it is positively charged because it remains with 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.190
 more protons than electrons becomes 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.520
 in union 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:58.730
 I'm going to take it so that you understand it better 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.730
 a balloon a balloon to decorate meetings 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:13.310
 I'm going to say hello and I'm going to take 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:16.340
 besides this balloon a daily a 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.019
 daily like this I'm going to take some 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.019
 scissors I'm going to 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.590
 to cut some pieces 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.280
 this diary 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:35.220
 and here were the pieces of the newspaper 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:37.830
 then I'm going to rub this balloon is 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.480
 on 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.030
 on 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.330
 my clothes 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.780
 I'm encouraging that they transfer 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.470
 electrons from one place to another and I'm 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.770
 loading this balloon 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:01.830
 then this balloon approached that already 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:06.210
 is loaded to these pieces of 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.450
 diary I cut then I'm going to 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:12.739
 observe what 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:17.240
 they will generate forces of attraction 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:22.750
 this balloon that has been loaded 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.750
 generates forces of attraction with 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:33.670
 atoms 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:35.450
 what does this have these pieces of 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.300
 Newspaper 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.950
 So, I just finished 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.010
 show how you can load any 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.930
 element nature is surrounded by 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.750
 elements that all the time are being 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.090
 loading all the time we are surrounded 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.190
 of different charges because the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.380
 electrons have the property of traveling 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.970
 from some atoms to others flow from ones 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.459
 atoms to others we 're going to call 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.440
 electrical power later on you 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.450
 I will explain then how these are formed 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.020
 forces as we call these forces 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:10.470
 like charles jude or 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.940
 enunciated the law that allows to determine 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.420
 these forces 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.040
 I hope that I have served you 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.380
 visit continues visiting our channel 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.530
 physical for all and that you have a great 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.530
 day
