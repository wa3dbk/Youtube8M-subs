got Ryan working on a tire right now can
you<00:01:11.970> tell<00:01:12.149> me<00:01:12.299> what<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.600> he<00:01:12.720> up<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.869> at<00:01:13.140> this

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
you tell me what is he up to at this

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.380 
you tell me what is he up to at this
first<00:01:13.500> station<00:01:13.920> here<00:01:14.070> okay<00:01:14.579> the<00:01:14.970> very<00:01:15.180> first

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
first station here okay the very first

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.630 
first station here okay the very first
step<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.899> do<00:01:16.079> is<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:16.860> call<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.159> NDT

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
step we do is what we call the NDT

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.459 
step we do is what we call the NDT
machine<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.390> that's<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.689> non-destructive

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:19.469 
machine and that's a non-destructive

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:21.289 
machine and that's a non-destructive
test<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.399> what<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.700> do<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.909> we're<00:01:21.060> checking

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
test so what we do is we're checking

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.910 
test so what we do is we're checking
every<00:01:21.719> single<00:01:21.750> tire<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.439> comes<00:01:22.649> through<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
every single tire that comes through the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.069 
every single tire that comes through the
plant<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.240> initial<00:01:24.390> inspection

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
plant so this is the initial inspection

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.380 
plant so this is the initial inspection
station<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.219> the<00:01:26.340> doesn't<00:01:26.610> pass<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.969> station

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
station so the doesn't pass this station

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.620 
station so the doesn't pass this station
goes<00:01:28.200> back<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.560> customer<00:01:29.450> with<00:01:30.450> with

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
goes back to the customer with with

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.300 
goes back to the customer with with

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
read away let's stick to it so Kirk I

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.840 
read away let's stick to it so Kirk I
couldn't<00:02:02.710> help<00:02:02.770> but<00:02:02.860> notice<00:02:03.280> that<00:02:03.340> this<00:02:03.610> looks

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
couldn't help but notice that this looks

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.529 
couldn't help but notice that this looks
a<00:02:04.030> little<00:02:04.179> bit<00:02:04.329> like<00:02:04.570> a<00:02:04.630> meat<00:02:05.049> locker<00:02:05.350> with

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
a little bit like a meat locker with

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.180 
a little bit like a meat locker with
hunks<00:02:07.539> of<00:02:07.689> beef<00:02:08.019> hanging<00:02:08.380> on<00:02:08.709> it<00:02:08.890> but<00:02:09.069> I'm

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
hunks of beef hanging on it but I'm

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.830 
hunks of beef hanging on it but I'm
guessing<00:02:09.519> that's<00:02:09.819> not<00:02:09.970> what<00:02:10.300> it<00:02:10.420> is<00:02:10.450> what's

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
guessing that's not what it is what's

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.300 
guessing that's not what it is what's
happening<00:02:11.200> here<00:02:11.260> so<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:11.860> don't<00:02:12.010> want<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.250> be

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
happening here so you don't want to be

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.650 
happening here so you don't want to be
eaten<00:02:12.459> any<00:02:12.550> of<00:02:12.610> this<00:02:12.700> when<00:02:12.910> we're<00:02:13.060> done<00:02:13.180> this

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
eaten any of this when we're done this

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.300 
eaten any of this when we're done this
is<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.870> repair<00:02:14.200> center<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.739> what<00:02:14.860> happens<00:02:15.190> now

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
is a repair center so what happens now

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.850 
is a repair center so what happens now
is<00:02:15.519> every<00:02:15.760> tire<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.300> was<00:02:16.360> just<00:02:16.750> buff<00:02:16.959> comes

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
is every tire that was just buff comes

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.140 
is every tire that was just buff comes
over<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.250> for<00:02:18.459> another<00:02:18.640> quick<00:02:18.940> inspection

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
over and for another quick inspection

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.449 
over and for another quick inspection
and<00:02:19.720> if<00:02:20.019> there's<00:02:20.200> small<00:02:20.410> imperfections<00:02:20.769> in<00:02:21.340> it

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
and if there's small imperfections in it

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.190 
and if there's small imperfections in it
they'll<00:02:21.879> buff<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.269> out<00:02:22.420> take<00:02:22.599> out<00:02:22.780> any<00:02:22.959> dirt

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
they'll buff it out take out any dirt

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.440 
they'll buff it out take out any dirt
any<00:02:23.470> rust<00:02:23.890> all<00:02:24.610> right<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:24.910> now<00:02:25.030> we've<00:02:25.180> made<00:02:25.330> our

down on it so how does anybody take one
and<00:03:20.290> is<00:03:20.470> good<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:22.600> then<00:03:22.840> it'll<00:03:23.049> be<00:03:23.170> held<00:03:23.350> in

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
and is good and then it'll be held in

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.569 
and is good and then it'll be held in
with<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.739> plungers<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:24.190> that'll<00:03:24.489> be

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
with the plungers and that'll be

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.190 
with the plungers and that'll be
stitched<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.269> then<00:03:25.540> it's<00:03:25.690> on<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:25.959> next

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
stitched and then it's on to the next

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.610 
stitched and then it's on to the next
step

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
step

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.349 
step
alright<00:03:27.250> now<00:03:27.400> we're<00:03:27.549> at<00:03:27.609> the<00:03:27.790> scanning

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
alright now we're at the scanning

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.090 
alright now we're at the scanning
station<00:03:28.989> and<00:03:29.139> the<00:03:29.200> same<00:03:29.350> can<00:03:29.560> track<00:03:29.769> it<00:03:29.950> all

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
station and the same can track it all

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.650 
station and the same can track it all
the<00:03:30.190> way<00:03:30.280> through<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.549> process<00:03:30.760> every<00:03:31.329> single

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
the way through the process every single

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.210 
the way through the process every single
tire<00:03:31.989> that<00:03:32.170> comes<00:03:32.410> in<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.590> plant<00:03:32.829> gets<00:03:33.100> its

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
tire that comes in the plant gets its

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.280 
tire that comes in the plant gets its
own<00:03:33.310> barcode<00:03:33.819> and<00:03:34.209> we<00:03:34.299> can<00:03:34.450> track<00:03:34.630> it<00:03:34.810> all<00:03:34.959> the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
own barcode and we can track it all the

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.580 
own barcode and we can track it all the
way<00:03:35.410> through<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.680> whole<00:03:35.829> plant

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
way through the whole plant

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.460 
way through the whole plant
now<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:38.520> just<00:03:38.730> looks<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.180> sound<00:03:39.540> scary<00:03:40.110> what

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
now this just looks and sound scary what

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.750 
now this just looks and sound scary what
are<00:03:40.530> we<00:03:40.650> looking<00:03:40.980> at<00:03:41.099> what<00:03:41.370> we're<00:03:41.489> doing<00:03:41.640> right

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
are we looking at what we're doing right

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.729 
are we looking at what we're doing right
now<00:03:41.819> is<00:03:42.180> every<00:03:42.480> time<00:03:42.660> prior<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:43.230> being<00:03:43.380> cured

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
now is every time prior to being cured

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.199 
now is every time prior to being cured
has<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.160> win<00:03:44.340> an<00:03:44.459> envelope

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
has to win an envelope

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.449 
has to win an envelope
this<00:03:45.569> envelope<00:03:45.780> will<00:03:46.200> assure<00:03:46.500> even<00:03:47.250> pressure

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
this envelope will assure even pressure

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.070 
this envelope will assure even pressure
all<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.790> way<00:03:47.880> around<00:03:48.180> as<00:03:48.390> it's<00:03:48.630> being<00:03:48.840> cooked

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
all the way around as it's being cooked

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.550 
all the way around as it's being cooked
so<00:03:49.620> it's<00:03:49.739> called<00:03:49.980> an<00:03:50.580> EPS<00:03:51.000> system<00:03:51.300> on<00:03:52.260> vault

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
so it's called an EPS system on vault

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.589 
so it's called an EPS system on vault
pressurized<00:03:53.069> system<00:03:53.459> what<00:03:54.150> that'll<00:03:54.420> do<00:03:54.569> is

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
pressurized system what that'll do is

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.270 
pressurized system what that'll do is
you'll<00:03:55.019> see<00:03:55.200> it's<00:03:55.319> gonna<00:03:55.440> put<00:03:55.680> a<00:03:55.709> lock<00:03:55.890> ring<00:03:56.130> on

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
you'll see it's gonna put a lock ring on

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.800 
you'll see it's gonna put a lock ring on
there<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:56.970> then<00:03:57.090> he's<00:03:57.209> gonna<00:03:57.300> suck<00:03:57.599> all<00:03:57.750> the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
there and then he's gonna suck all the

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.360 
there and then he's gonna suck all the
air<00:03:57.989> out<00:03:58.019> of<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.380> that's<00:03:58.680> they're<00:03:58.950> sure<00:03:59.130> that

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
air out of it that's they're sure that

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.559 
air out of it that's they're sure that
when<00:03:59.519> it<00:03:59.550> goes<00:03:59.790> into<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.060> system<00:04:00.450> that

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
when it goes into the system that

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.059 
when it goes into the system that
there's<00:04:00.720> no<00:04:00.810> holes<00:04:01.050> in<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.410> bag<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:01.860> this<00:04:01.980> is

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
there's no holes in that bag so this is

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.850 
there's no holes in that bag so this is
a<00:04:02.099> pretest<00:04:02.610> prior<00:04:03.300> to<00:04:03.569> things<00:04:04.319> put<00:04:04.530> into<00:04:04.769> the

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
a pretest prior to things put into the

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.309 
a pretest prior to things put into the
oven<00:04:05.099> so<00:04:05.540> now<00:04:06.540> he's<00:04:06.750> hooking<00:04:06.840> up<00:04:07.050> a<00:04:07.140> vacuum

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
oven so now he's hooking up a vacuum

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.870 
oven so now he's hooking up a vacuum
he's<00:04:07.680> actually<00:04:07.800> taking<00:04:08.220> all<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.550> air<00:04:08.670> that's

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
he's actually taking all the air that's

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.030 
he's actually taking all the air that's
in<00:04:09.060> there<00:04:09.239> out<00:04:09.600> of<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:09.900> which<00:04:10.350> is<00:04:10.470> exactly<00:04:10.830> what

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
in there out of it which is exactly what

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.070 
in there out of it which is exactly what
it's<00:04:11.160> gonna<00:04:11.250> have<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.549> same<00:04:12.000> process<00:04:12.630> when

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
it's gonna have the same process when

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.800 
it's gonna have the same process when
it's<00:04:13.230> inside<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.620> chamber<00:04:14.549> being<00:04:14.700> secured<00:04:15.180> we

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
it's inside the chamber being secured we

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.870 
it's inside the chamber being secured we
want<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:16.019> make<00:04:16.109> sure<00:04:16.139> there's<00:04:16.470> no<00:04:16.650> no<00:04:17.250> holes<00:04:17.609> on

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
want to make sure there's no no holes on

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.729 
want to make sure there's no no holes on
this<00:04:17.970> envelope<00:04:18.269> so<00:04:18.930> we<00:04:19.049> have<00:04:19.169> even<00:04:19.380> pressure

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
this envelope so we have even pressure

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.280 
this envelope so we have even pressure
in<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.489> system<00:04:20.850> and<00:04:21.239> now<00:04:21.570> we've<00:04:21.720> moved<00:04:21.900> on<00:04:22.169> to

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
in the system and now we've moved on to

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.320 
in the system and now we've moved on to
Hansel<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:23.280> Gretel's<00:04:23.550> house<00:04:23.729> we're<00:04:24.000> about<00:04:24.150> to

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
Hansel and Gretel's house we're about to

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.540 
Hansel and Gretel's house we're about to
get<00:04:24.450> in<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.690> giant<00:04:25.110> oven<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.650> what's<00:04:26.370> about

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
get in the giant oven and what's about

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.770 
get in the giant oven and what's about
to<00:04:26.610> happen<00:04:26.760> here<00:04:27.090> this<00:04:27.360> is<00:04:27.479> it<00:04:27.600> you<00:04:27.720> don't

into this chamber here the other two

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.670 
into this chamber here the other two
chambers<00:04:32.580> are<00:04:33.030> capable<00:04:33.300> of<00:04:33.570> doing<00:04:34.050> 23<00:04:34.560> at<00:04:34.650> a

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
chambers are capable of doing 23 at a

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.460 
chambers are capable of doing 23 at a
time<00:04:35.479> we're<00:04:36.479> going<00:04:36.660> to<00:04:36.900> each<00:04:37.050> one<00:04:37.260> of<00:04:37.380> these
