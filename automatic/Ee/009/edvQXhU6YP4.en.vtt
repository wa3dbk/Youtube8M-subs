00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
talked about extensively to reiterate my

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.270 
talked about extensively to reiterate my
theory<00:04:11.049> is<00:04:11.079> that<00:04:11.290> when<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.650> meter<00:04:11.829> isn't

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
depending on how far the meter is

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.860

however<00:04:20.019> my<00:04:20.650> theory<00:04:21.039> is<00:04:21.070> that<00:04:21.160> Little<00:04:21.489> Mac

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
however my theory is that Little Mac

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.790 
however my theory is that Little Mac
will<00:04:21.849> perform<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.419> one<00:04:22.780> hit<00:04:22.990> KO<00:04:23.229> uppercut
