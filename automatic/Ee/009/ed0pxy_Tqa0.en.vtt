it's<00:00:38.040> kind<00:00:38.310> of<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:39.030> can't<00:00:39.420> really<00:00:39.540> explain

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
it's kind of like I can't really explain

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.440 
it's kind of like I can't really explain
it<00:00:40.070> it's<00:00:41.070> like<00:00:41.190> you're<00:00:41.280> bending<00:00:41.580> almost<00:00:42.060> every

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
it it's like you're bending almost every

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.810 
it it's like you're bending almost every
single<00:00:42.750> note<00:00:42.930> like<00:00:43.230> not<00:00:43.620> even<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.950> half<00:00:44.130> not

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
single note like not even a half not

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.700 
single note like not even a half not
even<00:00:45.000> flat<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.300> like<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> quarter<00:00:46.200> or<00:00:46.440> even

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
even flat it's like a quarter or even

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.690 
even flat it's like a quarter or even
less<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.370> bend

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.220 

you<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.360> kind<00:00:54.540> of<00:00:54.630> rubber-banding<00:00:55.170> it

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
you have kind of rubber-banding it

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.200 
you have kind of rubber-banding it
sounds<00:00:55.560> it's<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:55.770> Ruth<00:00:56.040> I<00:00:56.460> can't<00:00:56.790> explain<00:00:57.000> it

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
sounds it's like Ruth I can't explain it

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.730 
sounds it's like Ruth I can't explain it
but<00:00:57.240> that's<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.960> vibe<00:00:58.110> I<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.290> whenever<00:00:58.590> I

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:58.740 
but that's the vibe I get whenever I

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.760 
but that's the vibe I get whenever I
hear<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:58.950> part<00:01:00.200> you<00:01:01.200> want<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.410> play<00:01:01.530> kind<00:01:01.680> of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
hear that part you want to play kind of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:33.539 
hear that part you want to play kind of
straight<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.400> notes<00:01:02.580> are<00:01:06.590> typical<00:01:07.590> D<00:01:08.390> minor

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:42.609 

nextpart<00:01:34.549> you're<00:01:35.060> in<00:01:35.180> G<00:01:35.450> now<00:01:41.259> two<00:01:42.259> ways<00:01:42.439> to

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
nextpart you're in G now two ways to

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:43.959 
nextpart you're in G now two ways to
play<00:01:42.770> this<00:01:42.920> as<00:01:43.130> well<00:01:43.159> I<00:01:43.310> don't<00:01:43.640> know<00:01:43.700> which<00:01:43.820> way

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
play this as well I don't know which way

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.700 
play this as well I don't know which way
is<00:01:44.149> right<00:01:44.360> I<00:01:44.600> guess<00:01:44.840> it<00:01:44.990> depends<00:01:45.289> on<00:01:45.409> what<00:01:45.469> you

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
is right I guess it depends on what you

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.529 
is right I guess it depends on what you
wanted<00:01:45.979> how<00:01:46.159> into<00:01:46.729> it<00:01:46.820> you<00:01:46.909> want<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.149> get<00:01:47.329> how

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
wanted how into it you want to get how

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.090 
wanted how into it you want to get how
anal<00:01:47.780> you<00:01:48.020> want<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.289> be<00:01:48.409> so<00:01:49.189> you<00:01:49.250> got<00:01:51.100> nothing

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
anal you want to be so you got nothing

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.080 
anal you want to be so you got nothing
new<00:01:52.399> we've<00:01:52.549> done<00:01:52.670> it<00:01:52.759> before

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.429 

I<00:01:55.149> was<00:01:55.960> going<00:01:56.320> like<00:01:56.350> this

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.420 

so<00:02:00.439> it's<00:02:00.590> cleaned<00:02:00.860> out<00:02:00.950> here

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
so it's cleaned out here

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.110 
so it's cleaned out here
first<00:02:03.430> and<00:02:03.520> second<00:02:03.900> on<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:06.280> string<00:02:06.670> and

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
first and second on the a string and

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.750 
first and second on the a string and
then<00:02:07.979> open<00:02:08.979> G

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.770 

neither<00:02:13.760> easier<00:02:14.120> way<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.300> play<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.600> and

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
neither easier way to play it and

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.520 
neither easier way to play it and
probably<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.260> right<00:02:15.410> way

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:27.179 

and<00:02:20.530> just<00:02:20.830> going

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.380 

and<00:02:27.970> it's<00:02:28.299> just<00:02:28.510> um<00:02:28.720> yeah<00:02:29.849> seven<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:31.000> six<00:02:31.209> on

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
and it's just um yeah seven and six on

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.759 
and it's just um yeah seven and six on
your<00:02:31.420> hot<00:02:31.900> loi<00:02:36.269> move<00:02:37.269> everything<00:02:37.540> up<00:02:37.769> full

your hot loi move everything up full

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.020 
your hot loi move everything up full
step

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:52.860 

the<00:02:43.840> Immaculate<00:02:43.990> song

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.089 

two<00:02:53.870> ways<00:02:54.020> to<00:02:54.140> play<00:02:54.260> that<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.709> don't<00:02:54.860> know<00:02:54.950> which

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
two ways to play that I don't know which

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.620 
two ways to play that I don't know which
way<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.489> is<00:02:55.670> actually<00:02:56.000> three<00:02:56.270> that<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:56.480> can

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
way it is actually three that I can

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:04.900 
way it is actually three that I can
think<00:02:56.750> of<00:02:57.520> so<00:02:58.520> let's<00:02:58.849> just<00:02:59.030> try<00:02:59.239> one<00:03:03.790> could<00:03:04.790> be

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
think of so let's just try one could be

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:12.990 
think of so let's just try one could be
that<00:03:05.260> you're<00:03:06.260> in<00:03:06.290> your<00:03:06.530> high<00:03:07.069> a<00:03:07.459> pentatonic

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:26.410 

that<00:03:14.000> could<00:03:14.209> be<00:03:14.300> it

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.920 

now<00:03:27.420> is<00:03:27.480> all<00:03:27.660> bins<00:03:27.870> or<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.290> can<00:03:28.440> finger<00:03:28.830> it

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.450 

very<00:03:33.930> hard<00:03:34.230> that's<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.770> very<00:03:34.950> hard<00:03:35.130> look<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.310> do

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
very hard that's a very hard look to do

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.270 
very hard that's a very hard look to do
and<00:03:35.610> keep<00:03:35.730> clean<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.330> really<00:03:36.570> is<00:03:36.980> if<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.160> were

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
and keep clean it really is if I were

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.360 
and keep clean it really is if I were
doing<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.550> I<00:03:38.730> would<00:03:38.850> probably<00:03:39.030> just<00:03:39.180> go<00:03:43.370> and

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
doing it I would probably just go and

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:52.140 
doing it I would probably just go and
instead<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.060> doing<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.360> here

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:00.970 

then<00:03:53.150> you're<00:03:53.299> back<00:03:53.420> on<00:03:53.720> move<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:59.709> and<00:04:00.709> that's

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
then you're back on move it and that's

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.710 
then you're back on move it and that's
just<00:04:01.220> your<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:02.239> know<00:04:02.390> your<00:04:04.180> your<00:04:05.180> pentatonic

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
just your you know your your pentatonic

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.140 
just your you know your your pentatonic
area<00:04:05.989> and<00:04:06.260> you

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.260 

hold<00:04:11.150> that<00:04:11.210> note<00:04:11.450> there<00:04:12.700> good<00:04:13.700> that<00:04:13.910> one<00:04:14.090> hit

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
hold that note there good that one hit

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:28.930 
hold that note there good that one hit
him<00:04:14.360> both

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:37.830 

I<00:04:29.470> just<00:04:30.470> takes<00:04:30.980> an<00:04:31.130> amino<00:04:32.380> bins<00:04:33.380> 2g

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.689 

I<00:04:37.900> don't<00:04:38.560> know<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.860> messes<00:04:39.130> with<00:04:39.160> the<00:04:39.370> wing<00:04:39.520> bar

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
I don't know it messes with the wing bar

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:46.690
