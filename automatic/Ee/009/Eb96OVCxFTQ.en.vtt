support your infantry so to set this up
we'll<00:01:39.329> assume<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.689> your<00:01:40.049> unit<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.500> inside

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
we'll assume that your unit is inside

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.160 
we'll assume that your unit is inside
the<00:01:40.979> transport<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:42.000> transport<00:01:42.509> drives<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.049> new

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
the transport the transport drives a new

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.950 
the transport the transport drives a new
position<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.890> offload<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.090> unit<00:01:45.360> inside<00:01:45.630> to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
position to offload the unit inside to

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.690 
position to offload the unit inside to
take<00:01:46.140> an<00:01:46.259> initial<00:01:46.470> volley<00:01:46.890> at<00:01:47.220> an<00:01:47.430> enemy

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
take an initial volley at an enemy

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:56.180 
take an initial volley at an enemy
target

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.800 

so<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.310> right<00:01:57.520> over<00:01:57.730> advances<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.390> unit<00:01:58.630> pops

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
so the right over advances the unit pops

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:08.430 
so the right over advances the unit pops
out<00:01:59.050> and<00:01:59.350> opens<00:01:59.740> up<00:01:59.860> with<00:02:00.040> a<00:02:00.070> volley<00:02:07.440> and

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
out and opens up with a volley and

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.050 
out and opens up with a volley and
that's<00:02:08.680> the<00:02:08.890> things<00:02:09.160> they<00:02:09.369> say<00:02:09.610> because<00:02:10.030> of

that's the things they say because of

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.830 
that's the things they say because of
their<00:02:10.240> chaos<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:12.700> then<00:02:12.880> now<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.060> take<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.390> shot

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840
