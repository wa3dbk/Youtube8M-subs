00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.560
 be on the targets 2 we continue on 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.090
 the losing streak and good I will name 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.800
 and explain a little each one and see 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.540
 what seems to me nothing else is a good play 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.310
 quite simple and good I hope that what 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.890
 enjoy the first streak of 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.869
 low that is the rs x that they thought not 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.070
 put what is the cost of the chosen and 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.419
 well you know what the 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.829
 normal liquid and current that has 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.920
 explosives and that 's it does not have any more 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.980
 then we have the place the place that is 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.440
 logically the spy plane is worth 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.590
 see the enemies that are 365 points 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.789
 then we have the small paper plane 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.800
 that was seen in some video that 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.559
 they launched and such that it was like a 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.149
 kind of small plane that kills me 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.640
 closest friend is worth 400 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.379
 450 points we have a package 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.429
 help that can help you anything 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.659
 then with 475 points we have control 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.789
 that the braking is mounted for 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.550
 disable the enemy map that we do not 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:09.250
 see logically the most curious thing has 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.020
 called attention is this advantage this 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.479
 advantage this streak forgiveness that is for 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.040
 500 points that is a turret that stuns 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.720
 the enemy harms him while he is called 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.880
 the guard nut is pretty good 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.799
 for 500 points 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.000
 It is a good package but little is 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.409
 pretty good by 525 points a missile a 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.539
 missile that the cndh hasbun as a 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.369
 predictor I say seemed more or less 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.320
 that spears of air to earth is worth and this 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.380
 you control it and a little more that 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.430
 we know logically 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.060
 then for 550 points the other the winds 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.770
 16 550 is like a bombardment is worth a 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.750
 logically bombing another helicopter 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.659
 that in several places bomb with 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.250
 endorsements of various missile attacks and 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.439
 then other disadvantages that are driving 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.240
 the attention is the death machine 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.770
 good the death machine who am 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.689
 alive to put of albortón thousand that calls 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.840
 quite the attention for the have put and 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.289
 good 600 points then with 625 points 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.509
 but not 650 points a sentinel robbery 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.830
 better you handle it like you have 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.500
 also norm we want from these powerful 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.209
 let's go to the handsome then we have 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.000
 also in our dearest 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.140
 grenades of war machine or 700 points that 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.760
 is what I said that there is also 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.260
 a lot of attention that is kind of like 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:26.880
 of shotgun then our dearest 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.980
 mondragón files by them of 725 points 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.350
 which is like a plane that goes with a 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.040
 machine gun also light then we have 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.140
 the agr is called with 800 points which is 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.360
 as our liveliest robot of the 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.980
 models plus 3 that is like a wali and the 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.320
 it's quite pretty well 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.190
 if you control that all of that then a 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.050
 helicopter 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.800
 that is not seen in the sea with the booster 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.340
 existed worth 850 points then 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.590
 we have like the pm that is to see good 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.180
 pm do not forgive that is to block the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.160
 electronic but as the black bird that 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.690
 I was wrong that is to be able to know 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.550
 where are the enemies the direction to 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.950
 that they go a white a verbal black and for 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.170
 cvm blackbird then for a thousand dots 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.600
 we have another well cited from an airplane 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.950
 Normal current escort then 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.620
 we have because they have put enough 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.860
 airplanes of which it is then 2025 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.480
 another plane in the dragoncito either 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.409
 have much much more then if we have 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.360
 the mp mp or the pm as I said it by 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.950
 1,050 points and I know what I said 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.709
 that these electronic lives 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.670
 advance add I had gone and good 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.480
 then we have by 1,150 points in what 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.780
 to be 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.330
 what is a missile that liquid earthquake 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.489
 does not have much more then our 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.629
 beloved former artilleryman of 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.909
 explain he called me because he is 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.409
 basically in helicopter that you 're going to 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.000
 handle the military as a gunner of 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.220
 crystal is very similar and resist 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.440
 old they have repeated then they call it 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.390
 them unit here 9 which is the dogs 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.910
 dogs bark their next dogs is 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.349
 the same enough and then the maximum 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:06.190
 of maximum moment is the side of 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:08.020
 people thousand 275 points with planes 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.000
 that destroy and logically disgusted 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.680
 enemies that move around the map are 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.630
 they call is more they call them the sea they are 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.730
 1200 points 0 maximum right now they have 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.440
 position is good about my opinion like that a 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.209
 little above exteriors in this 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.010
 video that the truth that has appeared to me 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.290
 some spells of casualties have taken me 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.820
 until the attention between them the turret 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.320
 guardian that I found are 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.420
 spectacular it seems to me we have in de 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.670
 spectacular the death machine has 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.220
 seemed also quite spectacular 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.770
 the some paper whistle that moves and 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.110
 well, well, you see, thank you very much, 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.300
 repeated or cane practically 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.530
 like any of them and the truth is 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.000
 that there are things that are being 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.980
 healing quite as it says in a way 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.660
 multiplayer and I tell you I have to do 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.160
 another video to tell you how 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.470
 campaign that nobody thinks has spoken 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.090
 nothing of always this is a short video 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.380
 to stretch a little the gusts of 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.000
 low and see what they catch and the truth that 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.590
 I like enough but nothing many 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.670
 thank you all and see you next 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.670
 goodbye video
