00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
do the ground pound uh I think it should

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.020

think it should be beside you and in

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.240 
think it should be beside you and in
front<00:02:28.040> of<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.489> like<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.970> half<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.629> circle
