00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 Hi, how are you, I'm Mariana and in this 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.830
 I am going to talk to you about a book 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.290
 I read a couple of weeks ago and it's 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.570
 aristóteles and dante discover the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.170
 secrets of the universe Aristotle is 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.090
 introvert and shy dante is 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.310
 transparent and expressive for reasons 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.820
 curious of the universe the two are 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.060
 they find the two they know each other and the two 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.160
 they form a very, very nice friendship 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.619
 there are many things to discover in this 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.940
 immense universe aristóteles and dante 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.460
 they are at that stage where they still do not 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.590
 you know what's going on with your life you're at a 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.930
 step from the adult but at the same 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.870
 time do not feel prepared have 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.449
 that adapt to a society which 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.199
 is not ready yet I have to confess that 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:55.059
 I was very afraid to read it but still 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.760
 from the first page 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.730
 conquered my heart Aristotle is a 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.970
 boy a little apathetic or antisocial but 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.379
 he's too sensitive a guy and I want 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.300
 learn nothing so during the 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.430
 summer I decided to go to a hostel there is 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.950
 when he meets a person 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.259
 curious to aristóteles a person 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.690
 completely different aristóteles the is 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:20.380
 funny radiates a security in itself 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.720
 same and that's when everyone clicks and 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.610
 begins his friendship as in life he 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.649
 They present different types of 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.979
 situations in which aristóteles and 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.170
 they have to face certain things 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.440
 sometimes together sometimes separate say 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.179
 which is a book where the characters are 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.280
 they are discovering what they want 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.670
 in life what is it that really 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.120
 feel is a book that makes you feel 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.090
 million million sensations 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:52.410
 millions is indescribable what this 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.060
 book reaches a certain sense in reality 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.040
 I have no words 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.770
 it's too emotional a book too 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.670
 sensitive as it is aristóteles 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.250
 too sensitive touches very fibers 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.580
 delicate characters are incredible 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.400
 both Aristotle and Dante and the dads 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.700
 of each of them are people 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.350
 extraordinary sincerely mom's 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:24.190
 Aristotle is that beautiful is is a 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.190
 character 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:32.350
 dante's dad is a 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.020
 beautiful net or no no no 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.620
 is incredible 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.210
 how the characters face the 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.510
 situations 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.610
 and how are they discovering things 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.210
 exactly sometimes one wonders 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.540
 what kind of person acts in a certain way and 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.420
 it's because he has a story behind something 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.030
 what happened to him and that's why he's the person 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.280
 which is now maybe it's a better 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.560
 person maybe now it 's a worse 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.450
 person I do not think you become a 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.500
 worse person you simply become 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.850
 in a cold person 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.569
 and like trying to take care of yourself a little or 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:18.590
 you close then 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.959
 it's amazing the development that 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.959
 who gets each of the characters 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.450
 in this story I already knew 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:29.450
 unfortunately I ruined myself alone 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.140
 really curious about 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.410
 certain way was a spoiler that did not 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.680
 it affected so much 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.140
 in me and I'm sure that neither in 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.510
 if you already know what it 's about 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.170
 this book what is your end not so much your 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.060
 final but the plot twist let's say 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.480
 say let's say it in a certain way the 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.319
 way of writing of benjamin that is the 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.569
