00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
but what I haven't considered when I

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.950 
but what I haven't considered when I
bought<00:01:36.280> it<00:01:36.340> is<00:01:36.760> it<00:01:37.090> pretty<00:01:37.330> much<00:01:37.510> only<00:01:37.720> looks

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
bought it is it pretty much only looks

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.710 
bought it is it pretty much only looks
cool<00:01:38.700> or<00:01:39.700> a<00:01:39.760> little<00:01:40.060> bit<00:01:40.240> different<00:01:40.600> when

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
cool or a little bit different when

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.600 
cool or a little bit different when
you've<00:01:40.840> got<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:40.990> goggles<00:01:41.350> on<00:01:41.500> I<00:01:41.710> tried<00:01:42.400> it<00:01:42.520> for

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
you've got the goggles on I tried it for

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.340 
you've got the goggles on I tried it for
a<00:01:42.700> day<00:01:42.820> or<00:01:42.970> two<00:01:43.000> with<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.300> goggles<00:01:43.450> on<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:43.990> it

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
a day or two with the goggles on and it

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.500 
a day or two with the goggles on and it
just<00:01:44.590> ruins<00:01:44.830> your<00:01:45.100> peripheral<00:01:45.580> vision<00:01:45.610> in<00:01:46.060> as

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
just ruins your peripheral vision in as

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.000 
just ruins your peripheral vision in as
much<00:01:46.660> as<00:01:46.900> you<00:01:47.050> don't<00:01:47.200> have<00:01:47.350> any<00:01:47.500> left<00:01:47.740> you

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
much as you don't have any left you

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.250 
much as you don't have any left you
can't<00:01:48.190> see<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.369> damn<00:01:48.580> thing<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.869> I<00:01:50.080> don't

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
can't see a damn thing and I don't

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.290 
can't see a damn thing and I don't
particularly<00:01:50.560> like<00:01:50.860> it<00:01:51.160> without<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.940> goggles

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
particularly like it without the goggles

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.650 
particularly like it without the goggles
on<00:01:52.479> so<00:01:52.780> with<00:01:52.930> just<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.420> visor

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
on so with just the just the visor

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.570 
on so with just the just the visor
because<00:01:56.229> it's<00:01:56.500> basically<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.979> sharp<00:01:57.340> vision

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
because it's basically a sharp vision

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.210 
because it's basically a sharp vision
are<00:01:57.850> in<00:01:58.300> carbon<00:01:59.020> fiber<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.979> that<00:02:03.130> was

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
are in carbon fiber so that was

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.050 
are in carbon fiber so that was
disappointing<00:02:04.080> anyway<00:02:05.080> so<00:02:05.640> I'm<00:02:06.640> now<00:02:06.820> back<00:02:07.000> up

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
disappointing anyway so I'm now back up

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.800 
disappointing anyway so I'm now back up
