00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
to make it a thicker Soaker and with

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.200 
to make it a thicker Soaker and with
crocheting<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:35.070> helps<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.520> lot<00:00:35.640> sometimes

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
project now I've created 30 chain

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.840 
project now I've created 30 chain
foundation<00:00:59.660> so<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:01.340> what<00:01:02.340> you've<00:01:02.520> got<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
foundation so that what you've got is a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.990 
foundation so that what you've got is a
nice<00:01:03.090> thick<00:01:04.250> foundation<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.519> your<00:01:05.640> soaker

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
nice thick foundation for your soaker

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.469 
nice thick foundation for your soaker
the<00:01:06.380> first<00:01:07.380> step<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:08.310> create<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:08.939> leg<00:01:09.149> will

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the first step to create your leg will

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.929 
the first step to create your leg will
start<00:01:09.810> by<00:01:09.990> creating<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.619> legs<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.520> create

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
start by creating the legs is to create

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.380 
start by creating the legs is to create
lay<00:01:12.810> tube<00:01:13.500> for<00:01:14.100> each<00:01:14.280> legs<00:01:14.610> we'll<00:01:14.880> make<00:01:15.090> two<00:01:15.360> of

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
lay tube for each legs we'll make two of

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.219 
lay tube for each legs we'll make two of
these<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.740> again<00:01:17.070> 30<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.600> foundation

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
these so again 30 of the foundation

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.240 
these so again 30 of the foundation
chain<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:20.520> will<00:01:20.760> join<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:22.049> chain<00:01:22.409> with

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
chain and we will join the chain with

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.100 
chain and we will join the chain with
the<00:01:23.490> very<00:01:23.729> beginning<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> work<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.870> create

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
the very beginning of the work to create

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.340 
the very beginning of the work to create
the<00:01:25.200> tube<00:01:25.530> for<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> leg<00:01:26.159> now<00:01:27.120> to<00:01:27.990> join<00:01:28.320> a

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the tube for the leg now to join a

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.810 
the tube for the leg now to join a
foundation<00:01:29.280> chain<00:01:29.810> once<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.110> have<00:01:31.440> found

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
foundation chain once I have found

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.600 
foundation chain once I have found
because<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> thicker<00:01:33.840> chain<00:01:34.340> wider<00:01:35.340> as

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
because it is a thicker chain wider as

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.250 
because it is a thicker chain wider as
you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.119> can't<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.690> slip<00:01:36.930> stitch

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
you can see you can't just slip stitch

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.990 
you can see you can't just slip stitch
it<00:01:37.440> to<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> beginning<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.250> doesn't<00:01:38.580> work<00:01:38.760> as

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
it to the beginning it doesn't work as

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.100 
it to the beginning it doesn't work as
well<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.990> incorporate<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.909> bottom<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
well so I incorporate the bottom and the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.160 
well so I incorporate the bottom and the
top<00:01:43.140> together<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:44.130> last<00:01:44.340> stitch<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.689> we<00:01:45.720> go

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
top together in the last stitch so we go

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.920 
top together in the last stitch so we go
this<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.280> my<00:01:47.310> very<00:01:47.700> last<00:01:47.939> stitch<00:01:48.360> we've<00:01:48.720> done

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
this is my very last stitch we've done

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.710 
this is my very last stitch we've done
30<00:01:49.260> this<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.740> sort<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.010> a<00:01:50.130> joining<00:01:50.640> stitch<00:01:51.030> so

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
30 this is sort of a joining stitch so

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.230 
30 this is sort of a joining stitch so
we<00:01:51.750> go<00:01:51.960> into<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.500> loop<00:01:53.369> that's<00:01:53.670> farthest

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
we go into that loop that's farthest

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.830 
we go into that loop that's farthest
away<00:01:54.479> from<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.080> chain<00:01:55.640> grab<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.970> to<00:01:57.330> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
away from the chain grab on to the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.980 
away from the chain grab on to the
bottom<00:01:58.320> loop<00:01:59.220> of<00:01:59.490> our<00:01:59.670> foundation<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.869> can

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
bottom loop of our foundation you can

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.539 
bottom loop of our foundation you can
see<00:02:01.170> I'm<00:02:01.320> making<00:02:01.500> sure<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.310> all<00:02:02.460> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
see I'm making sure that it's all the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.700 
see I'm making sure that it's all the
same<00:02:03.390> way<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.840> not<00:02:03.990> twisted<00:02:04.259> if<00:02:04.590> you're

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
same way and not twisted if you're

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.310 
same way and not twisted if you're
twisted<00:02:05.130> you've<00:02:05.280> got<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> problem<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.290> pull<00:02:07.290> it

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
twisted you've got a problem so pull it

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.780 
twisted you've got a problem so pull it
through<00:02:07.680> two<00:02:07.950> loops<00:02:08.539> then<00:02:09.539> finish<00:02:10.049> off<00:02:10.259> a

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
through two loops then finish off a

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.890 
through two loops then finish off a
foundation<00:02:11.790> chain<00:02:11.819> by<00:02:12.239> pulling<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.720> through

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
foundation chain by pulling it through

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.920 
foundation chain by pulling it through
the<00:02:13.019> last<00:02:13.230> two<00:02:13.680> loops<00:02:14.090> now<00:02:15.090> what<00:02:15.450> you'll<00:02:15.689> see

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
the last two loops now what you'll see

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.250 
the last two loops now what you'll see
is<00:02:16.200> I'm<00:02:16.470> going<00:02:16.769> to<00:02:16.980> join<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.870> like<00:02:18.870> we<00:02:19.019> do<00:02:19.140> at

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
is I'm going to join it like we do at

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.910 
is I'm going to join it like we do at
the<00:02:19.379> end<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.769> row<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.810> first<00:02:22.110> stitch<00:02:22.530> and

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
the end of a row to the first stitch and

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.210 
the end of a row to the first stitch and
we<00:02:23.400> will<00:02:23.580> do<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> slip<00:02:24.090> stitch

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
we will do a slip stitch

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.300 
we will do a slip stitch
which<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:25.460> wrapping<00:02:26.150> your<00:02:26.360> yarn<00:02:27.160> pulling<00:02:28.160> it

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
which is wrapping your yarn pulling it

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.900 
which is wrapping your yarn pulling it
through<00:02:28.780> both<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:30.500> loop<00:02:30.740> and<00:02:30.980> what<00:02:31.520> is<00:02:31.670> on
