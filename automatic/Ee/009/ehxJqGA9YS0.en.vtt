vehicles one disappointing factor is

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.209 
vehicles one disappointing factor is
that<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.020> wii<00:00:58.140> version<00:00:58.379> does<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:58.859> include

if you're buying this on the weave you
can<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.510> look<00:01:09.630> past<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.350> zombie

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
can you can look past that the zombie

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.090 
can you can look past that the zombie
mode<00:01:10.830> isn't<00:01:11.040> too<00:01:11.460> special<00:01:11.970> but<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:13.470> was<00:01:14.070> a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
mode isn't too special but it was a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.730 
mode isn't too special but it was a
shame<00:01:14.400> not<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.180> there<00:01:15.439> overall<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
shame not to see it in there overall the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.130 
shame not to see it in there overall the
story<00:01:17.040> mimics<00:01:17.490> exactly<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> same<00:01:18.390> things<00:01:18.720> as

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
story mimics exactly the same things as

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.450 
story mimics exactly the same things as
the<00:01:19.680> 360<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.670> ps3<00:01:21.030> version<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:22.920> does<00:01:23.310> it

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the 360 and ps3 version and it does it

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.660 
the 360 and ps3 version and it does it
extremely<00:01:23.729> well<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:25.560> controls<00:01:26.009> are<00:01:26.310> great

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
extremely well the controls are great

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.390 
extremely well the controls are great
except<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.810> few<00:01:28.110> gripes<00:01:28.710> here<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.250> there

well with the wiimote now they work

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.690 
well with the wiimote now they work
somewhat<00:01:35.640> well<00:01:35.820> when<00:01:36.210> you're<00:01:36.360> using<00:01:36.570> no<00:01:37.259> scope

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
somewhat well when you're using no scope

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.390 
somewhat well when you're using no scope
but<00:01:38.720> when<00:01:39.720> you're<00:01:39.840> using<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.140> scope<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.829> you're

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
but when you're using a scope you you're

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.580 
but when you're using a scope you you're
going<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.939> choose<00:01:42.240> between<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.720> huge

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
going to have to choose between a huge

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.990 
going to have to choose between a huge
decision<00:01:44.390> alright<00:01:45.860> either<00:01:46.860> preciseness<00:01:47.549> or

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
decision alright either preciseness or

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.780 
decision alright either preciseness or
speed<00:01:48.509> because<00:01:49.140> there<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> way<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.579> more

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
speed because there is a way to be more

the motion control but you will

the motion control but you will
sacrifice<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.780> lot<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.939> speed<00:02:03.259> one<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.350> the
