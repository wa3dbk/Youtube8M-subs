00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:58.870 

some<00:03:50.450> reason<00:03:50.900> for<00:03:51.560> that<00:03:51.700> 5.0<00:03:52.700> and<00:03:57.610> unless<00:03:58.610> they

some reason for that 5.0 and unless they

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.510 
some reason for that 5.0 and unless they

but<00:04:05.150> frankly<00:04:05.510> I<00:04:05.540> think<00:04:05.660> that's<00:04:05.960> just<00:04:06.320> as<00:04:06.470> hard

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
but frankly I think that's just as hard

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.620 
but frankly I think that's just as hard
as<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:06.920> others<00:04:07.160> because<00:04:07.460> it<00:04:07.610> is<00:04:07.790> not<00:04:08.210> does<00:04:08.450> not

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
as the others because it is not does not

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.700 
as the others because it is not does not
