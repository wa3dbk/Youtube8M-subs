this is a normal procedure you turn the

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.520 
this is a normal procedure you turn the
radio<00:02:35.400> on<00:02:35.430> first<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.300> then<00:02:36.420> plug<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.349> battery

on the plane and so that's no different

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.660 
on the plane and so that's no different
that's<00:02:42.120> not<00:02:42.450> much<00:02:42.720> different<00:02:43.310> no<00:02:44.310> I'm<00:02:44.489> gonna
