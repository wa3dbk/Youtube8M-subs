00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.460
 to those questions that came with a note 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.050

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.180
 I did not see if you have recommendations 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.910
 then leave them down in the comments 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.410
 by the way not this instagram people found out 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.399
 that i have a tattoo those people 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.500
 who do not know that I have 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.360
 the tattoo here it is actually here on 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.160
 this hand and more close up you 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.690
 You can see it from the photo in Instagram and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.610
 the link to which I will leave down in 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.020
 description of the next long viewing 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.629
 came on skype one some kind 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.129
 It looks like Ulyana will talk about your plans for 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.020
 the future for example after studying at 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.760
 University and the second question of Ulyana 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.120
 what are your goals otherwise what you see 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.710
 myself in 5 7 years actually in it 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.869
 it is very difficult to answer these now 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.520
 questions you know there like 20 years too 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.490
 should know what you do with your 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.310
 life is all that kind of thing but i realized that 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.110
 after university the first six months exactly 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.850
 Is this for sure I will take on a clear 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.500
 awareness of where I want to go 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.020
 Further in what direction I want 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.000
 move on because university 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.350
 despite the fact that I had some 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.600
 ideas about what I want 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.220
 engage before him completely turned over 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.470
 but life and I have new 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.979
 interests new ideas and some new 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.020
 goals and even plans and desires and i'm not very 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.140
 I want to share it all honestly 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.540
 Now the video because you know how to 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.100
 dreams if you made a wish then 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.290
 disciples not to tell otherwise 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.460
 come true and stuff like that so I 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.020
 keep quiet 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.850
 just say there are some 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.340
 representations but above all these 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.259
 representation still need to want to work and 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.450
 think out because hurry somewhere 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.880
 Now it is clear from the magistracy and if only 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.780
 I have no desire to want 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.810
 to think 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.579
 realize everything and go 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.380
 to the place that will help me 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.970
 develop as a person develop 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.459
 the value that you would like further 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.010
 work and and so on and probably still 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.630
 one question which is related to the question 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.730
 how to like to read which is also sometimes 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.319
 I get VKontakte groups and 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.980
 In principle, I receive such mail 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.810
 messages 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.569
 how do you feel about people who are not 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.510
 read the book because it is wrong to begin 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.910
 from what I do not think that I read 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.280
 books basically this is wrong people 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.370
 can receive both knowledge and some 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.590
 moral satisfaction and entertainment 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.480
 from other sources so I don't consider 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.190
 what is wrong but how I feel 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.620
 people who don't read books again 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.200
 ok i'm totally okay them 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.390
 words it's their business me too in some 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.130
 periods of her life sometimes did not read 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.019
 I now have such moments 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.599
 when I just don't want to read now 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.590
 I know completely and completely 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.420
 I do not want the opposite situation 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.680
 I want to read constantly read 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.870
 because reading is not for me 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.760
 the last is helpful 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.410
 a form of procrastination when not necessary 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.810
 do important things like now for example 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.329
 write a diploma I read a lot I 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.250
 the bug read 23 books this year and 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.480
 yes this is a consequence of useful parkour 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.910
 situations when you don't want at all 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.950
 write a diploma but I will write in any 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.570
 case so i'm calm and on 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.090
 one more question how to read right i am 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.190
 answer so try just try and 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.530
 read what you think you can 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.780
 like it if you don't like it 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.359
 or try to look for something 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.030
 you will find another at the final moment here 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:34.040
 not u which will make you turn your 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.380
 life is kind of and dust and read 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.780
 feel this happiness again when you 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.760
 you close the book and you understand that you 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.040
 happy that you met 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.780
 this book with this author me so 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.760
 Books became Flemish board arturo 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.980
 re-reverse for me such a book became 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.350
 canterbury stories hungry chaucer 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.299
 Games Suzanne Collins and 3 books that 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.340
 to me which market has changed we no longer and 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.980
 pilat and stars throne odd joined 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.359
 with him afterwards you are sure to 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.150
 visit a book that will force you 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.650
 love to read again make up from 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.620
 too loud that just 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.030
 will give you the opportunity to read me 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.130
 one such pronounced 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.260
 go for it don't try 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.079
 force yourself to love reading because 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.269
 what do you think that all the people around 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.040
 expect you to read 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.530
 and you will love to read 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.300
 do what you want in that order 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.540
 at the pace at which it will be you 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.970
 convenient reading is purely your personal 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.250
 the case and if you don't want the moment 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.070
 do not consider reading time forcing 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.660
 yourself do something you only gain 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.700
 some negative points which 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.740
 will be associated with this proper 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.990
 process of days process of reading well 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.970
 Of course, if from reading and love to him not 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.700
