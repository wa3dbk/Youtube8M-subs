00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
it's give you a look at the packaging

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.070 
it's give you a look at the packaging
first<00:00:48.220> of<00:00:48.430> all<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:49.300> then<00:00:49.420> round<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.690> back<00:00:49.870> i

first of all and then round the back i

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.580 
first of all and then round the back i
mentioned<00:00:50.710> d3o<00:00:51.670> technology<00:00:52.660> this<00:00:53.200> is<00:00:53.260> really

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
mentioned d3o technology this is really

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.760 
mentioned d3o technology this is really
exciting<00:00:53.770> I've<00:00:54.280> seen<00:00:54.520> this<00:00:54.670> on<00:00:54.910> television

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
exciting I've seen this on television

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.230 
exciting I've seen this on television
and<00:00:56.770> what<00:00:57.100> it<00:00:57.190> is<00:00:57.400> is<00:00:57.579> basically<00:00:57.730> these

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240 
and what it is is basically these

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.440 
and what it is is basically these
molecules<00:00:58.720> within<00:00:59.260> the<00:01:00.070> material<00:01:00.850> that's

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
molecules within the material that's

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.439 
molecules within the material that's
used<00:01:01.570> in<00:01:01.960> this<00:01:02.110> case<00:01:02.380> and<00:01:02.940> they're<00:01:03.940> soft<00:01:04.299> and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
used in this case and they're soft and

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.359 
used in this case and they're soft and
flexible<00:01:04.720> when<00:01:05.199> you<00:01:05.290> just<00:01:05.530> sort<00:01:06.070> of<00:01:06.130> touch

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
flexible when you just sort of touch

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.300 
flexible when you just sort of touch
them<00:01:06.729> gently<00:01:07.240> but<00:01:08.020> when<00:01:08.259> they<00:01:08.619> receive<00:01:09.100> like

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
them gently but when they receive like

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.240 
them gently but when they receive like
an<00:01:09.460> impact<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:10.869> molecules<00:01:11.590> actually<00:01:12.040> lock

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
an impact the molecules actually lock

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.980 
an impact the molecules actually lock
together<00:01:12.460> we've<00:01:12.790> got<00:01:12.939> some<00:01:13.119> diagrams<00:01:13.479> here<00:01:13.720> to

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
together we've got some diagrams here to

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.660 
together we've got some diagrams here to
try<00:01:14.229> and<00:01:14.259> sort<00:01:14.530> of<00:01:14.560> explain<00:01:14.619> it<00:01:15.189> to<00:01:15.310> you<00:01:15.430> and

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
try and sort of explain it to you and

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.750 
try and sort of explain it to you and
this<00:01:16.540> means<00:01:16.780> that<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:17.050> case<00:01:17.500> or<00:01:17.770> hardens<00:01:18.460> or

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
this means that the case or hardens or

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.630 
this means that the case or hardens or
strengthens<00:01:19.510> upon<00:01:20.409> impact<00:01:20.979> so<00:01:21.250> that<00:01:21.400> should

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
strengthens upon impact so that should

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.050 
strengthens upon impact so that should
mean<00:01:21.850> that<00:01:21.909> we<00:01:22.210> get<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:22.890> fantastic<00:01:23.890> amount<00:01:24.580> of

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
mean that we get a fantastic amount of

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.810 
mean that we get a fantastic amount of
protection<00:01:25.240> from<00:01:25.780> this<00:01:26.050> case<00:01:26.610> now<00:01:27.610> I'm<00:01:27.729> going

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
protection from this case now I'm going

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.390 
protection from this case now I'm going
to<00:01:27.909> open<00:01:28.030> this<00:01:28.210> and<00:01:28.570> show<00:01:28.930> you<00:01:28.990> on<00:01:29.260> my<00:01:29.409> iphone<00:01:29.950> 4

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.920 
that it's white and that's really cool
now<00:02:14.569> it<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:14.870> quite<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.319> rigid<00:02:16.010> material<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:17.810> can

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
now it is quite a rigid material you can

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.890 
now it is quite a rigid material you can
hear<00:02:18.260> as<00:02:18.440> I<00:02:19.280> move<00:02:19.550> is<00:02:19.819> saw<00:02:20.510> cause<00:02:20.720> some

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
hear as I move is saw cause some

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.900 
hear as I move is saw cause some
rigidness<00:02:21.319> to<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.310> if<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:22.550> look<00:02:22.730> inside

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
rigidness to it and if you look inside

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.110 
rigidness to it and if you look inside
the<00:02:23.450> case<00:02:23.660> here<00:02:24.020> you<00:02:24.800> can<00:02:24.980> see<00:02:25.190> these<00:02:25.400> ants<00:02:25.790> or

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
the case here you can see these ants or

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.780 
the case here you can see these ants or
beams<00:02:26.600> along<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.080> side<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.190> would<00:02:28.400> imagine

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
beams along the side and I would imagine

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
beams along the side and I would imagine
that<00:02:29.300> this<00:02:30.020> is<00:02:30.080> where<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.709> d3o<00:02:31.310> technology<00:02:32.150> is

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
that this is where the d3o technology is

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.390 
that this is where the d3o technology is
embedded<00:02:33.500> into<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.830> case<00:02:34.010> there's<00:02:34.250> like<00:02:34.370> a

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
embedded into the case there's like a

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.880 
embedded into the case there's like a
little<00:02:34.670> piece<00:02:34.850> up<00:02:35.060> in<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.300> corner<00:02:35.720> here<00:02:35.890> along

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
little piece up in the corner here along

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.270 
little piece up in the corner here along
this<00:02:37.100> side<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.959> all<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.200> way<00:02:39.350> along<00:02:39.890> this

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
this side and all the way along this

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.820 
this side and all the way along this
edge<00:02:40.519> and<00:02:40.850> then<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.420> back<00:02:41.600> is<00:02:41.870> perforated<00:02:42.320> so

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
edge and then the back is perforated so

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.949 
edge and then the back is perforated so
at<00:02:42.920> least<00:02:43.040> that's<00:02:43.280> going<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.670> allow<00:02:44.239> any<00:02:44.630> sort

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
at least that's going to allow any sort

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.479 
at least that's going to allow any sort
of<00:02:44.989> heat<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.350> dissipate<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.040> adds<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.370> the

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
of heat to dissipate and it adds to the

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.220 
of heat to dissipate and it adds to the
design<00:02:46.880> as<00:02:47.180> well<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.950> let's<00:02:49.100> put<00:02:49.280> my<00:02:49.519> iphone<00:02:50.480> 4

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.830

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
side first on these cases I'm just going

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.350 
side first on these cases I'm just going
to<00:02:56.870> pop<00:02:57.080> it<00:02:57.260> along<00:02:57.410> this<00:02:57.560> edge<00:02:58.000> there<00:02:59.000> we<00:02:59.180> go

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
to pop it along this edge there we go

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.069 
to pop it along this edge there we go
very<00:03:00.290> very<00:03:00.530> nice<00:03:00.800> fit<00:03:01.390> quick<00:03:02.390> tour<00:03:02.660> around<00:03:02.690> the
