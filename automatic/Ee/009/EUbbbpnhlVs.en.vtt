grill and when Stenhouse attempted to do
that<00:01:40.210> it<00:01:40.660> looked<00:01:40.990> as<00:01:41.170> though<00:01:41.200> maybe<00:01:41.860> Logano

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
that it looked as though maybe Logano

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.160 
that it looked as though maybe Logano
didn't<00:01:42.730> get<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.030> message<00:01:43.420> and<00:01:43.600> raced<00:01:43.870> him<00:01:44.110> a

didn't get the message and raced him a

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.560 
didn't get the message and raced him a
little<00:01:44.410> bit<00:01:44.500> too<00:01:44.740> hard<00:01:45.040> and<00:01:45.370> they<00:01:46.090> mentioned

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
little bit too hard and they mentioned

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.090 
little bit too hard and they mentioned
that<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:46.900> Ricky<00:01:47.140> and<00:01:47.440> then<00:01:47.710> shortly

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
that to Ricky and then shortly

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.160 
that to Ricky and then shortly
thereafter<00:01:48.220> that<00:01:48.910> the<00:01:49.330> accident<00:01:49.930> took<00:01:50.110> place

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
thereafter that the accident took place

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.500 
thereafter that the accident took place
so<00:01:50.890> maybe<00:01:51.100> some<00:01:51.430> miscommunication<00:01:52.390> between

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510
