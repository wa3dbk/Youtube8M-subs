clumping<00:03:03.239> just<00:03:03.510> depends<00:03:04.230> on<00:03:04.349> the<00:03:04.500> way<00:03:04.680> you

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
clumping just depends on the way you

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.550 
clumping just depends on the way you
apply<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.609> maybe<00:03:06.540> because<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:07.319> first

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
apply it and maybe because the first

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.429 
apply it and maybe because the first
time<00:03:07.829> that<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.129> apply<00:03:08.400> this<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.879> that<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.359> put<00:03:10.290> on

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
time that I apply this is that I put on

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.789 
time that I apply this is that I put on
way<00:03:10.709> too<00:03:10.769> much<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.489> is<00:03:11.790> why<00:03:12.329> it<00:03:12.629> clumped<00:03:13.109> but

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
way too much that is why it clumped but

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.059 
way too much that is why it clumped but
I<00:03:14.310> figured<00:03:15.030> that<00:03:15.299> when<00:03:15.569> you<00:03:15.930> apply<00:03:16.349> it<00:03:16.379> in<00:03:16.680> the

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
I figured that when you apply it in the

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.259 
I figured that when you apply it in the
correct<00:03:17.579> way<00:03:17.989> like<00:03:18.989> when<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.409> wiggle<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.269> like

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
correct way like when you wiggle it like

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.280 
correct way like when you wiggle it like
some<00:03:21.629> other<00:03:21.840> way<00:03:22.139> it<00:03:22.620> wouldn't<00:03:23.220> plump<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:24.290> it

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
some other way it wouldn't plump and it

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.879 
some other way it wouldn't plump and it
would<00:03:25.709> give<00:03:25.950> that<00:03:26.250> really<00:03:26.790> really<00:03:27.120> full

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
would give that really really full

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.789 
would give that really really full
lengthy<00:03:28.889> finish<00:03:29.819> and<00:03:30.269> this<00:03:31.169> is<00:03:31.349> how<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.769> looks

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
lengthy finish and this is how it looks

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.520 
lengthy finish and this is how it looks
like

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.680 

so<00:03:36.100> it<00:03:36.370> looks<00:03:36.400> just<00:03:36.940> like<00:03:37.120> those<00:03:37.330> other

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
so it looks just like those other

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.500 
so it looks just like those other
mascaras<00:03:38.350> out<00:03:38.560> there<00:03:38.830> but<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.520> guess<00:03:39.790> this<00:03:40.180> one

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.450 
these and these are the retro pink and
if<00:04:39.220> I<00:04:39.460> am<00:04:39.520> not<00:04:39.610> mistaken<00:04:39.820> I<00:04:40.979> don't<00:04:41.979> know<00:04:42.070> the

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
if I am not mistaken I don't know the

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.460 
if I am not mistaken I don't know the
other<00:04:42.490> one<00:04:42.940> I<00:04:43.090> forgot<00:04:43.450> the<00:04:43.720> name<00:04:44.169> with<00:04:44.380> the

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
other one I forgot the name with the

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.650 
other one I forgot the name with the
other<00:04:44.620> one<00:04:44.860> but<00:04:45.040> this<00:04:45.250> is<00:04:45.430> definitely<00:04:45.660> the

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
other one but this is definitely the

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.940 
other one but this is definitely the
retro<00:04:47.020> pink<00:04:47.290> one<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:47.890> this<00:04:48.729> is<00:04:48.910> some<00:04:49.120> shade<00:04:49.419> of

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
retro pink one and this is some shade of

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.310 
retro pink one and this is some shade of
copper<00:04:50.950> if<00:04:51.100> i'm<00:04:51.250> not<00:04:51.400> mistaken<00:04:51.900> so<00:04:52.900> basically

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
copper if i'm not mistaken so basically

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.630 
copper if i'm not mistaken so basically
these<00:04:53.680> lipsticks<00:04:54.310> last<00:04:55.210> a<00:04:55.539> long<00:04:56.050> time<00:04:56.640> like

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
these lipsticks last a long time like

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.730 
these lipsticks last a long time like
when<00:04:57.850> I<00:04:57.880> in<00:04:58.000> school<00:04:58.390> I<00:04:58.690> go<00:04:59.020> to<00:04:59.050> school<00:04:59.410> for<00:04:59.560> like

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
when I in school I go to school for like

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.430 
when I in school I go to school for like
four<00:05:00.010> hours<00:05:00.039> and<00:05:00.640> if<00:05:01.120> we<00:05:01.300> have<00:05:01.479> practices<00:05:02.169> I

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
four hours and if we have practices I

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.070 
four hours and if we have practices I
stay<00:05:02.800> for<00:05:02.860> like<00:05:03.310> an<00:05:03.520> additional<00:05:04.330> two<00:05:04.539> hours<00:05:04.570> or

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
stay for like an additional two hours or

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.399 
stay for like an additional two hours or
so

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:06.409 
so

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.269 
so
I<00:05:06.759> just<00:05:07.759> cannot<00:05:08.029> emphasize<00:05:08.659> how<00:05:08.689> good<00:05:09.409> the

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:10.279 
I just cannot emphasize how good the

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:14.070 
I just cannot emphasize how good the
lasting<00:05:11.089> power<00:05:11.119> of<00:05:11.449> these<00:05:11.929> lipsticks<00:05:12.469> are<00:05:12.769> and

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
lasting power of these lipsticks are and

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.879 
lasting power of these lipsticks are and
they<00:05:15.080> do<00:05:15.139> not<00:05:15.529> easily<00:05:15.830> smudge<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:17.649> I<00:05:18.649> just

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
they do not easily smudge and I just

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.399 
they do not easily smudge and I just
like<00:05:19.129> how<00:05:19.429> they<00:05:19.729> I<00:05:20.089> just<00:05:20.719> like<00:05:20.899> the<00:05:21.019> colors

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
like how they I just like the colors

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:24.249 
like how they I just like the colors
especially<00:05:21.739> this<00:05:22.399> one<00:05:22.639> even<00:05:23.569> this<00:05:23.809> one<00:05:24.050> but

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
especially this one even this one but

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:28.899 
especially this one even this one but
this<00:05:24.469> one<00:05:24.969> might<00:05:25.969> look<00:05:26.330> a<00:05:26.389> bit<00:05:26.569> too<00:05:27.519> purple<00:05:28.519> for

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
this one might look a bit too purple for

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.149 
this one might look a bit too purple for
other<00:05:29.089> people<00:05:29.539> so<00:05:29.569> I<00:05:29.839> guess<00:05:30.229> it<00:05:30.469> is<00:05:30.619> not<00:05:30.830> safe

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159 
other people so I guess it is not safe

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:33.519 
other people so I guess it is not safe
to<00:05:31.369> use<00:05:31.399> it<00:05:31.849> in<00:05:31.999> school<00:05:32.360> but<00:05:32.959> this<00:05:33.139> call<00:05:33.379> is

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:33.529 
to use it in school but this call is

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:39.399 
to use it in school but this call is
definitely<00:05:34.099> in<00:05:34.779> for<00:05:35.779> school<00:05:36.199> looks<00:05:38.050> so<00:05:39.050> those

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
definitely in for school looks so those

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.479 
definitely in for school looks so those
are<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:40.629> Wet<00:05:41.629> n<00:05:41.659> Wild<00:05:41.839> silk<00:05:42.439> finish<00:05:42.860> lipsticks

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:43.489 
are the Wet n Wild silk finish lipsticks

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:45.999 
are the Wet n Wild silk finish lipsticks
I'm<00:05:44.029> going<00:05:44.539> to<00:05:44.689> make<00:05:44.899> a<00:05:44.929> separate<00:05:45.439> review<00:05:45.679> on

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009 
I'm going to make a separate review on

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:48.579 
I'm going to make a separate review on
this<00:05:46.189> so<00:05:46.429> better<00:05:46.610> watch<00:05:46.849> out<00:05:47.089> for<00:05:47.119> that<00:05:47.559> so<00:05:48.559> I

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:48.589 
this so better watch out for that so I

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:50.559 
this so better watch out for that so I
guess<00:05:49.009> that's<00:05:49.249> it<00:05:49.610> for<00:05:49.669> my<00:05:50.059> februari
