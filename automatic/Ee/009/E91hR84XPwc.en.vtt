00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.039 
him in the flap we could get a few yards
out<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.740> which<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.180> nice<00:01:45.390> for<00:01:45.659> fourth

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
out of that which can be nice for fourth

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.020 
out of that which can be nice for fourth
and<00:01:46.170> ones<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.619> stuff<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.040> what<00:01:47.939> we

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
and ones and stuff like that what we

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.420 
and ones and stuff like that what we
could<00:01:48.180> also<00:01:48.299> do<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.689> put<00:01:48.930> him<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.710> zig<00:01:50.159> route

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
could also do is put him on a zig route

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.580 
could also do is put him on a zig route
and<00:01:50.759> then<00:01:51.420> if<00:01:51.509> there's<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.720> linebacker<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.439> them

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
and then if there's a linebacker on them

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.350 
and then if there's a linebacker on them
and<00:01:53.040> we<00:01:53.220> get<00:01:53.430> some<00:01:53.610> good<00:01:53.729> position<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
and we get some good position on the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.480 
and we get some good position on the
outside<00:01:54.780> also<00:01:55.740> another<00:01:55.860> thing<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.159> could<00:01:56.369> do

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
outside also another thing you could do

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.340 
outside also another thing you could do
which<00:01:56.759> sometimes<00:01:56.969> works<00:01:57.360> again<00:01:57.630> zone<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.110> put

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
which sometimes works again zone is put

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.010 
which sometimes works again zone is put
when<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.950> put<00:01:59.159> him<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> zig<00:01:59.700> route<00:01:59.939> hit<00:02:00.899> them

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
when you put him on a zig route hit them

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.990 
when you put him on a zig route hit them
with<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.619> little<00:02:01.649> quick<00:02:01.950> pass<00:02:02.189> when<00:02:02.759> he's<00:02:02.850> on

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
with a little quick pass when he's on

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.840 
with a little quick pass when he's on
the<00:02:03.119> end<00:02:03.360> part<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.259> zig<00:02:04.500> route<00:02:04.850> another

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the end part of the zig route another

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.880 
the end part of the zig route another
thing<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.090> could<00:02:06.270> do<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.479> if<00:02:07.049> we<00:02:07.320> look<00:02:07.530> at<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
thing you could do is if we look at the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.859 
thing you could do is if we look at the
fade<00:02:08.190> route<00:02:08.429> done<00:02:08.670> by<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.910> B<00:02:09.119> receiver<00:02:09.539> on<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
fade route done by the B receiver on the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.930 
fade route done by the B receiver on the
right<00:02:10.050> side<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.470> screen<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:11.489> will<00:02:11.700> not

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
right side of the screen that will not

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.280 
right side of the screen that will not
get<00:02:12.180> bumped

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
get bumped

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.559 
get bumped
so<00:02:13.379> once<00:02:13.950> he<00:02:13.980> gets<00:02:14.189> to<00:02:14.250> about<00:02:14.400> 10<00:02:14.730> yards<00:02:14.939> you

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
so once he gets to about 10 yards you

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.509 
so once he gets to about 10 yards you
can<00:02:15.719> just<00:02:15.840> bullet<00:02:16.170> pass<00:02:16.349> it<00:02:16.590> click<00:02:16.950> on<00:02:16.980> and

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
can just bullet pass it click on and

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.970 
can just bullet pass it click on and
it's<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.480> pretty<00:02:18.870> high<00:02:19.049> percentage<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.709> be<00:02:19.799> able

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
it's a pretty high percentage to be able

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.500 
it's a pretty high percentage to be able
to<00:02:20.040> catch<00:02:20.219> that<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.549> do<00:02:20.849> have<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.120> click<00:02:21.329> on

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
to catch that you do have to click on

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.300 
to catch that you do have to click on
and<00:02:21.810> then<00:02:21.989> run<00:02:22.409> to<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.650> inside<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.950> little<00:02:23.189> bit

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
and then run to the inside a little bit

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.220 
and then run to the inside a little bit
and<00:02:23.370> user<00:02:23.519> catch<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.239> if<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:24.989> don't<00:02:25.140> like

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
and user catch it and if you don't like

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.660 
and user catch it and if you don't like
to<00:02:25.349> do<00:02:25.469> that<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.890> could<00:02:26.040> just<00:02:26.099> put<00:02:26.430> them<00:02:26.549> on<00:02:26.640> a

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
to do that you could just put them on a

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.970 
to do that you could just put them on a
deep<00:02:26.909> out<00:02:27.090> route<00:02:27.359> and<00:02:27.629> if<00:02:28.379> you're<00:02:28.530> not<00:02:28.680> worried

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980
