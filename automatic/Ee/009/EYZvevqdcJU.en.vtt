whenever you undertake an effort that

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.360 
whenever you undertake an effort that
anyone<00:00:03.720> else<00:00:03.870> in<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.259> world<00:00:04.500> has<00:00:04.799> ever<00:00:05.009> tried

anyone else in the world has ever tried
you<00:00:05.730> essentially<00:00:06.390> open<00:00:06.629> yourself<00:00:06.960> up<00:00:07.109> to

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
you essentially open yourself up to

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.990 
you essentially open yourself up to
criticism<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:09.050> I<00:00:10.050> know<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.280> lot<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.550> people<00:00:11.670> go

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
criticism and I know a lot of people go

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.759 
criticism and I know a lot of people go
through<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:13.080> know<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.469> I've<00:00:13.559> gone

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
through it and I know that I've gone

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.670 
through it and I know that I've gone
through<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.599> so<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.199> video<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.529> want

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
through it and so in this video I want

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.870 
through it and so in this video I want
to<00:00:16.770> talk<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.980> little<00:00:17.190> bit<00:00:17.460> about<00:00:17.910> ways<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.830> to

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
to talk a little bit about ways to to

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.580 
to talk a little bit about ways to to
hear<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.240> cope<00:00:21.449> with<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.960> understand<00:00:22.439> it

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
hear it to cope with it to understand it

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.490 
hear it to cope with it to understand it
and<00:00:22.800> then<00:00:22.859> hopefully<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.640> give<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.320> more

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
and then hopefully to give it in a more

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.009 
and then hopefully to give it in a more
productive<00:00:25.769> way<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.550> try<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.880> clean<00:00:27.150> up<00:00:27.330> at

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
productive way and try to clean up at

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.230 
productive way and try to clean up at
least<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.890> community<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.609> am<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> part

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
least in the community that I am a part

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.240 
least in the community that I am a part
of<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:31.050> way<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.320> people<00:00:31.349> approach<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
of the way that people approach this and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.310 
of the way that people approach this and
so<00:00:32.880> first<00:00:33.149> I'll<00:00:33.300> talk<00:00:33.450> really<00:00:33.690> briefly<00:00:33.719> about

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
so first I'll talk really briefly about

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.410 
so first I'll talk really briefly about
the<00:00:34.380> workout<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.370> was<00:00:35.850> doing<00:00:35.969> some<00:00:36.120> more

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the workout I was doing some more

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.910 
the workout I was doing some more
technique<00:00:36.960> work<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> flat<00:00:37.620> footed

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
technique work with the flat footed

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.660 
technique work with the flat footed
pressing<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:39.239> just<00:00:40.170> every<00:00:40.920> bit<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.190> me<00:00:41.399> wants

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
pressing this just every bit of me wants

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.190 
pressing this just every bit of me wants
to<00:00:41.700> go<00:00:41.879> back<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.270> tuck<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.960> will

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
to go back to the tuck and I will

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.110 
to go back to the tuck and I will
eventually<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.370> feel<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
eventually but I feel like this is a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.060 
eventually but I feel like this is a
weakness<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.500> opportunity<00:00:47.039> to

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
weakness that I have the opportunity to

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.880 
weakness that I have the opportunity to
fix<00:00:47.340> now<00:00:47.640> because<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.270> some<00:00:48.480> time<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.930> i

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
fix now because I have some time and i

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.799 
fix now because I have some time and i
think<00:00:50.219> i<00:00:50.340> will<00:00:50.520> only<00:00:50.700> benefit<00:00:51.210> from<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
think i will only benefit from it in the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.600 
think i will only benefit from it in the
long<00:00:51.989> run<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:53.070> see<00:00:53.250> some<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.430> that

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
long run so you see some of that

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.569 
long run so you see some of that
actually<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.390> third<00:00:54.719> dress<00:00:55.530> at<00:00:55.710> 335<00:00:56.340> was

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
actually that third dress at 335 was

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.549 
actually that third dress at 335 was
probably<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.960> better<00:00:58.140> feeling

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
probably the one of the better feeling

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.139 
probably the one of the better feeling
flat-footed<00:00:59.070> bench<00:00:59.370> presses<00:00:59.699> I've<00:00:59.820> done<00:01:00.000> in

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
flat-footed bench presses I've done in

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.959 
flat-footed bench presses I've done in
recent<00:01:00.300> history<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.320> feel<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.489> things<00:01:02.820> are

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
recent history so I feel like things are

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.859 
recent history so I feel like things are
coming<00:01:03.210> along<00:01:03.890> also<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.920> switched<00:01:05.369> out<00:01:05.610> my<00:01:05.939> sets

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
coming along also I switched out my sets

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.450 
coming along also I switched out my sets
of<00:01:07.049> five<00:01:08.330> for<00:01:09.330> my<00:01:09.450> squats<00:01:09.810> today<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.619> made

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
of five for my squats today and made

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.730 
of five for my squats today and made
them<00:01:11.640> sets<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.030> 10<00:01:12.270> at<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> same<00:01:12.810> way<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.020> 405

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
them sets of 10 at the same way so 405

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.660 
them sets of 10 at the same way so 405
for<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:15.000> I'm<00:01:15.119> three<00:01:15.390> sets<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.750> ten<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.670> just

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
for this I'm three sets of ten and just

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.160 
for this I'm three sets of ten and just
to<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.119> introduce<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.630> little<00:01:18.900> bit<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.110> a

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
to just introduce a little bit of a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.539 
to just introduce a little bit of a
different<00:01:19.200> stimulus<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:20.009> little<00:01:20.250> bit<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
different stimulus a little bit of a

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.840 
different stimulus a little bit of a
different<00:01:21.890> way<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.920> feel<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.520> volume

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
different way to feel that volume

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.160 
different way to feel that volume
because<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.390> around<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.840> same<00:01:25.020> amount

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
because this is around the same amount

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.080 
because this is around the same amount
of<00:01:25.380> reps<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:25.920> generally<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:26.970> this

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
of reps that I do generally in this

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.840 
of reps that I do generally in this
workout<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:28.380> putting<00:01:29.100> them<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.310> three<00:01:29.640> sets

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
workout but putting them in three sets

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.289 
workout but putting them in three sets
instead<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.360> five<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.189> five<00:01:32.700> or<00:01:32.729> six<00:01:33.030> is

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
instead of five is is it five or six is

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.530 
instead of five is is it five or six is
a<00:01:33.329> different<00:01:33.900> ball<00:01:34.170> game<00:01:34.229> entirely<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.790> did

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
a different ball game entirely so did

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.780 
a different ball game entirely so did
that<00:01:36.720> did<00:01:37.290> some<00:01:37.560> close<00:01:37.920> grip<00:01:38.130> bench<00:01:38.159> Inge<00:01:38.579> and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
that did some close grip bench Inge and

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.260 
that did some close grip bench Inge and
then<00:01:39.360> did<00:01:39.570> some<00:01:39.600> other<00:01:39.869> accessory<00:01:40.409> movements

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
then did some other accessory movements

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.300 
then did some other accessory movements
some<00:01:42.270> pull<00:01:42.479> ups<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.840> push<00:01:42.960> downs<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.500> things

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
some pull ups and push downs and things

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.360 
some pull ups and push downs and things
that

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
that

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.610 
that
I<00:01:45.430> like<00:01:46.120> that<00:01:46.270> put<00:01:47.100> about<00:01:48.100> about<00:01:48.520> criticism

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
I like that put about about criticism

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.020 
I like that put about about criticism
it's<00:01:50.620> you're<00:01:50.950> going<00:01:51.160> to<00:01:51.310> get<00:01:51.400> it<00:01:51.580> if<00:01:51.760> you<00:01:52.000> ever

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
it's you're going to get it if you ever
