quite a bit down all the way down to the
or<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> 34<00:01:26.060> so<00:01:27.290> it<00:01:28.290> cuts<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.860> time<00:01:29.130> that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
or is it the 34 so it cuts the time that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.289 
or is it the 34 so it cuts the time that
you<00:01:29.369> need<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.790> dig<00:01:29.939> down<00:01:30.299> by<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.290> little<00:01:31.530> bit<00:01:31.680> I

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
you need to dig down by a little bit I

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.219 
you need to dig down by a little bit I
that's<00:01:33.299> your<00:01:33.420> digging<00:01:33.570> straight<00:01:33.900> down<00:01:34.079> in

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
that's your digging straight down in

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.410 
that's your digging straight down in
which<00:01:34.320> case<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.680> might<00:01:34.880> might<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:36.030> probably

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
which case you might might have probably

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.039 
which case you might might have probably
quicker<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:36.900> stick<00:01:37.200> straight<00:01:37.500> down

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
quicker to just stick straight down

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.630 
quicker to just stick straight down
anyways<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.770> pretty<00:01:40.979> much<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.460> this

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
anyways that is pretty much it for this

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.569 
anyways that is pretty much it for this
