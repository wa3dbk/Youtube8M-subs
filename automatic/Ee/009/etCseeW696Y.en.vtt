00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
up look your EMP is all the way back to

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.680 
up look your EMP is all the way back to
normal<00:03:58.730> take<00:03:59.730> note<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.150> just<00:04:00.330> have<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.540> shoot

normal take note you just have to shoot

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.360 
normal take note you just have to shoot
all<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.840> lights<00:04:00.990> out<00:04:01.140> again<00:04:01.440> repeat<00:04:02.250> exactly

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
all the lights out again repeat exactly

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.330 
all the lights out again repeat exactly
what<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.090> didn't<00:04:03.360> wait<00:04:03.480> 15<00:04:03.960> and<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.950> will<00:04:05.160> be

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
what you didn't wait 15 and you will be

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.720 
what you didn't wait 15 and you will be
pretty<00:04:05.940> much<00:04:06.060> golden<00:04:06.650> there's<00:04:07.650> no<00:04:07.800> way<00:04:08.010> you

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
pretty much golden there's no way you

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.600 
pretty much golden there's no way you
should<00:04:08.760> be<00:04:09.060> losing<00:04:09.420> at<00:04:09.510> last<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:10.550> using<00:04:11.550> this

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
should be losing at last and using this

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.200 
should be losing at last and using this
method<00:04:12.030> makes<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:12.900> very<00:04:13.050> easy<00:04:13.820> so<00:04:14.820> on<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.150> the

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
method makes it very easy so on to the

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.690 
method makes it very easy so on to the
next<00:04:15.390> level
