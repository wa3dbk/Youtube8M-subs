 hi youtube again and xd after 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.230
 one or two months without uploading anything I brought them 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.960
 a gift as thanks from the 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.329
 3000 subscribers are all games 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.730
 of pokémon good all the possible of 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.129
 play on the pc so if you're here 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.320
 to play the pokemon xo el yo 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.390
 any of the 3ds can leave here 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.610
 because unfortunately there is no 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.620
 console emulator already named good 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.510
 continuing with the video are the 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.759
 Pokémon games from the game point 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.890
 until those of joining all the games are 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.289
 for emulator that is everyone has to 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.149
 work with your respective emulator not 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:12.560
 worry because I also leave the 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.289
 links of the emulators in the 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.759
 description separate them by console like this 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.009
 You can find the one you want more 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.950
 how they work fast because the 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.140
 very easy emulators keep the game on 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.539
 where they want for example a folder 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.149
 then they open the emulator and click on 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.369
 open they look where they saved the game and 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.050
 ready that's all by the way there's very 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.270
 a few games that did not come out 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.850
 Spanish that is, they never left japan 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.770
 but there are two or three only those 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.909
 they are in another language all the others in 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.069
 Spanish too 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.329
 I will leave some games that I found 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.999

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.890
