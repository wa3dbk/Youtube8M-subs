00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
 what is that 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.650
 I found myself emerald 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.660
 I already know why I'm wadding farc we're going 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.390
 to continue for a while because yes I have to 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.550
 go for something to drink that my voice can 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.550
 follow but without water 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:46.160
 but I can not talk 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:51.380
 I need something that fell like bob 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.150
 sponge now I'm alone but it does not dry 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.460
 it's good that once I saw it it came out 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.850
 with a fish tank I create a fish tank in the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.850
 head 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.400
 Christ is serious let's continue 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.990
 much but to go something through the tree 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.850
 take not I think it smells and we can 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.020
 take a break we met and not 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.240
 I think we 're going a long time 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.170
 He ordered an hour and a half 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.960
 is nothing 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.890
 I gray nothing else costs to transport you 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.220
 to see what I 'm seeing by the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.220
 black 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.659
 I do not know why there are pokemons where 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.970
 I'm but I'm scared they're pokemon 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.860
 any other bit bad not any 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.220
 I think that they got into the portal 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.220
 Fools 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.880
 but I do not think it's a fortress because 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.880
 there's never 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.920
 It is one of the domains of humanity 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.710
 in contrast one of the domains here 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.050

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.480

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.040

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.540
 this passion crisis this time 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.540
 and they make children 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.870
 I'm afraid 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.890
 remove the music 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.620
 I can not die 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.790
 Emerald also do not know how how 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.260
 see the pebble to be able to evolve and 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.260
 a gray because I see pure emerald 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.400
 and I do not hate you gray 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.280
 I almost almost fell the lava because I was 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.259
 flying I was watching to see if 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.270
 I found something there is a little god that 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:28.270
 everything beautiful is finally going to punish you 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.629
