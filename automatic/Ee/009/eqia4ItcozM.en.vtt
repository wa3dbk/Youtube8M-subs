enough<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.000> those<00:02:03.329> tanks<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.710> gets<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.009> scarab

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
enough to those tanks it gets a scarab

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.310 
enough to those tanks it gets a scarab
on<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.700> stb<00:02:06.030> but<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.210> SUV<00:02:06.540> survives<00:02:07.020> the

Scarab zealot dropped on top of the SUV

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.730 
Scarab zealot dropped on top of the SUV
so<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.450> was<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.599> zealot<00:02:13.020> bomb<00:02:13.260> on

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
so that was a zealot bomb on

fairly<00:03:55.320> quickly<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:56.510> far<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.600> looks<00:03:57.630> like

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
fairly quickly so far it looks like

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.020 
fairly quickly so far it looks like
fancy<00:03:58.260> is<00:03:58.350> establishing<00:03:58.800> a<00:03:58.980> nice<00:03:59.130> line<00:03:59.820> of

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
fancy is establishing a nice line of

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.490 
fancy is establishing a nice line of
Tanks<00:04:00.360> always<00:04:00.630> scans<00:04:00.930> gets<00:04:01.200> rid<00:04:01.380> of<00:04:01.440> the

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
Tanks always scans gets rid of the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.590 
Tanks always scans gets rid of the
observer<00:04:01.950> with<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.760> Marines<00:04:03.090> out<00:04:03.300> front

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
observer with the Marines out front

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.420 
observer with the Marines out front
that's<00:04:04.170> kind<00:04:04.380> of<00:04:04.410> good<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.680> speed<00:04:05.070> shuttles

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
that's kind of good to speed shuttles

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.490 
that's kind of good to speed shuttles
coming<00:04:05.550> in<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.910> drop<00:04:06.150> on<00:04:06.330> top<00:04:06.810> of<00:04:06.990> these<00:04:07.110> tags

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.370 
coming in the drop on top of these tags
the<00:04:07.890> Reavers<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.310> drop<00:04:08.820> right<00:04:09.270> there<00:04:09.300> both<00:04:10.050> go

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
the Reavers a drop right there both go

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.150 
the Reavers a drop right there both go
down<00:04:10.410> as<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.700> bit<00:04:12.240> too<00:04:12.570> risky<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.440> admire<00:04:14.130> his

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
down as a bit too risky I admire his

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.880 
down as a bit too risky I admire his
spirits<00:04:14.940> but<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:16.049> think<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:16.440> was<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.560> bit<00:04:16.770> too

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
spirits but I think it was a bit too

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.060 
spirits but I think it was a bit too
risky<00:04:17.130> play<00:04:17.280> mine<00:04:17.549> direct<00:04:17.940> almost<00:04:18.870> a<00:04:19.109> huge

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
mine taken down that you could see that

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.659 
mine taken down that you could see that
fancy<00:04:22.410> was<00:04:22.710> kind<00:04:22.830> of<00:04:22.860> panicking<00:04:23.310> there<00:04:23.460> for<00:04:23.640> a

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
fancy was kind of panicking there for a

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.940 
fancy was kind of panicking there for a
second<00:04:23.910> he<00:04:23.970> Snipes<00:04:24.360> his<00:04:24.600> own<00:04:24.810> mind

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
second he Snipes his own mind

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.160 
second he Snipes his own mind
to<00:04:26.070> protect<00:04:26.190> himself<00:04:26.580> is<00:04:27.180> like<00:04:27.750> okay<00:04:27.990> I<00:04:28.020> don't

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
to protect himself is like okay I don't

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.450 
to protect himself is like okay I don't
want<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.620> happen<00:04:28.650> again<00:04:28.920> that<00:04:29.220> was<00:04:29.310> kind

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
want that to happen again that was kind

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.610 
want that to happen again that was kind
of<00:04:29.490> scary<00:04:29.760> so<00:04:30.570> that<00:04:30.930> was<00:04:31.080> almost<00:04:31.260> a

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
of scary so that was almost a

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.560 
of scary so that was almost a
devastating<00:04:32.520> mine<00:04:32.760> it<00:04:33.210> would<00:04:33.450> have<00:04:33.540> just

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
devastating mine it would have just

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.780 
devastating mine it would have just
destroyed<00:04:34.050> probably<00:04:34.740> six<00:04:35.100> or<00:04:35.220> seven<00:04:35.550> tanks

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
destroyed probably six or seven tanks

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.790 
destroyed probably six or seven tanks
that<00:04:36.450> were<00:04:36.600> all<00:04:36.750> clumped<00:04:37.170> up<00:04:37.260> in<00:04:37.440> that<00:04:37.590> one

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
that were all clumped up in that one

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.530 
that were all clumped up in that one
spot<00:04:39.230> so<00:04:40.230> that's<00:04:41.100> kind<00:04:41.640> of<00:04:41.670> a<00:04:41.790> ridiculous<00:04:42.330> game

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
spot so that's kind of a ridiculous game

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.290 
spot so that's kind of a ridiculous game
already<00:04:42.870> and<00:04:43.370> I<00:04:44.370> really<00:04:44.730> like<00:04:44.910> Minnie's

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
going to make it more difficult for

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.290

these<00:06:21.420> tanks<00:06:21.900> yet<00:06:22.050> the<00:06:22.380> zealous<00:06:22.680> just<00:06:22.890> can't

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160
