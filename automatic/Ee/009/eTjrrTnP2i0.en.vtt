of<00:00:02.429> all<00:00:02.550> your<00:00:02.730> thoughts<00:00:02.909> on<00:00:03.389> today's<00:00:03.629> game<00:00:03.959> I

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
of all your thoughts on today's game I

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.050 
of all your thoughts on today's game I
think<00:00:04.680> was<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:04.890> good<00:00:05.130> performance<00:00:05.520> from<00:00:05.910> the

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
think was a good performance from the

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.120 
think was a good performance from the
team<00:00:06.240> I<00:00:06.600> think<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.200> first<00:00:07.410> half<00:00:07.560> was<00:00:07.770> all<00:00:07.919> for

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
team I think the first half was all for

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.160 
team I think the first half was all for
for<00:00:08.460> us<00:00:08.580> we<00:00:09.150> played<00:00:09.330> really<00:00:09.480> well<00:00:09.599> defended

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
for us we played really well defended

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.620 
for us we played really well defended
really<00:00:10.769> well<00:00:10.950> second<00:00:11.730> half<00:00:11.910> but<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.450> know<00:00:12.570> to

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
really well second half but you know to

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.780 
really well second half but you know to
free<00:00:13.320> clear<00:00:13.679> chance<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.429> know<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.670> those

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
free clear chance and you know in those

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.400 
free clear chance and you know in those
kind<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.120> game<00:00:15.330> if<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.570> don't<00:00:15.809> kill<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.230> game

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
kind of game if you don't kill the game

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.380 
kind of game if you don't kill the game
you<00:00:16.619> always<00:00:16.949> at<00:00:17.070> risk<00:00:17.100> against<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.880> know<00:00:17.970> sila

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
you always at risk against you know sila

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.480 
you always at risk against you know sila
cast<00:00:18.600> not<00:00:18.750> away<00:00:18.900> from<00:00:19.140> home<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.920> consider<00:00:20.279> gore

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
cast not away from home to consider gore

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.240 
cast not away from home to consider gore
so<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.210> think<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:21.539> played<00:00:22.050> well<00:00:22.230> other<00:00:22.920> than<00:00:23.100> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
so I think we played well other than the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.730 
so I think we played well other than the
goal<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.490> didn't<00:00:23.820> have<00:00:23.970> clear<00:00:24.960> chances<00:00:25.410> so

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
goal that didn't have clear chances so

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.910 
goal that didn't have clear chances so
we<00:00:26.670> can<00:00:26.820> be<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> bit<00:00:27.150> down<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.990> lose<00:00:28.230> two<00:00:28.560> points

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
we can be a bit down to lose two points

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.650 
we can be a bit down to lose two points
today<00:00:29.039> because<00:00:29.490> we<00:00:29.670> felt<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.000> at<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.449> need

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
today because we felt that at one need

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.229 
today because we felt that at one need
we<00:00:31.260> could<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.529> won<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> game<00:00:31.940> we<00:00:32.940> did<00:00:33.090> then

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
we could have won the game we did then

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.979 
we could have won the game we did then
so<00:00:33.480> yeah<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.950> 50-50<00:00:35.579> feeling<00:00:36.480> because<00:00:36.690> you

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
so yeah it's a 50-50 feeling because you

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.100 
so yeah it's a 50-50 feeling because you
know<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.290> know<00:00:37.440> free<00:00:37.800> points<00:00:38.690> we're<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:39.870> to

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
know we know free points we're going to

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.459 
know we know free points we're going to
was<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.860> give<00:00:41.010> us<00:00:41.129> more<00:00:41.760> belief<00:00:42.379> but<00:00:43.379> we

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
was going to give us more belief but we

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.020 
was going to give us more belief but we

know they're going to have a moment and

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.210 
know they're going to have a moment and
period<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> game<00:01:04.260> where<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.739> will<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.040> to

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
period in a game where you will have to

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.800 
period in a game where you will have to
be<00:01:05.309> strong<00:01:05.549> because<00:01:05.729> they<00:01:06.000> they<00:01:06.450> are<00:01:06.540> going<00:01:06.720> to

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
be strong because they they are going to

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.960 
be strong because they they are going to
push<00:01:07.500> forward<00:01:07.799> that's<00:01:08.400> what<00:01:08.520> they<00:01:08.610> did<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
push forward that's what they did and

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.660 
push forward that's what they did and
like<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.150> said<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.479> think<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.290> chance<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.680> had<00:01:10.830> in

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
like I said I think the chance we had in

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.700 
like I said I think the chance we had in
the<00:01:11.760> second<00:01:12.030> half<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.479> know<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:13.170> take<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
the second half you know if you take the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.320 
the second half you know if you take the
game<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> toenail<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.000> different

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
game to a toenail it's a different

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.570 
game to a toenail it's a different
different<00:01:15.780> story<00:01:16.049> we<00:01:16.619> didn't<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.130> paid

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
different story we didn't and we paid

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.310 
different story we didn't and we paid
the<00:01:17.700> price<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.360> like<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.049> said

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the price for this but like like I said

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.350 
the price for this but like like I said
again<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.799> think<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.280> played<00:01:20.520> well<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.000> was<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
again I think we played well I was a

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.660 
again I think we played well I was a
good<00:01:21.570> performance<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.830> keep<00:01:23.520> on

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
going until the end of the season

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.740 
going until the end of the season
Chelsea<00:01:25.850> dropping<00:01:26.850> points<00:01:27.180> today<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:27.600> could

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
Chelsea dropping points today we could

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.359 
Chelsea dropping points today we could
have<00:01:27.840> gone<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.049> top<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:28.470> as<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.799> stay<00:01:29.040> still

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
hopefully and it's been a big wake of

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.580 
hopefully and it's been a big wake of
course<00:02:02.969> with<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.570> win<00:02:03.719> at<00:02:03.810> Old<00:02:03.960> Trafford<00:02:04.079> and

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
on top of them and second half well you

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.030
