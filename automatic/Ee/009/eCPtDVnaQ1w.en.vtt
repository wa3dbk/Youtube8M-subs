reason<00:00:52.649> really<00:00:52.980> honestly<00:00:53.610> these<00:00:53.850> sheep<00:00:54.090> are

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
reason really honestly these sheep are

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.540 
reason really honestly these sheep are
more<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.649> scientific<00:00:55.649> proof<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.039> concept

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
more like a scientific proof of concept

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.490 
more like a scientific proof of concept
but<00:00:56.699> there<00:00:56.850> are<00:00:56.969> other<00:00:57.210> animals<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:58.320> it

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
but there are other animals that have it

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500 
but there are other animals that have it
for<00:00:58.949> reasons<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.730> these<00:00:59.940> marmosets

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
for reasons like these marmosets

the<00:01:03.629> jellyfish<00:01:04.080> gene<00:01:04.409> directly<00:01:05.220> into<00:01:05.610> monkeys

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the jellyfish gene directly into monkeys

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.780 
the jellyfish gene directly into monkeys
as<00:01:06.210> embryos<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.320> then<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> virus<00:01:08.040> mutated

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
as embryos and then the virus mutated

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.510 
as embryos and then the virus mutated
their<00:01:08.970> DNA<00:01:09.360> they<00:01:09.570> actually<00:01:10.049> pass<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.979> GFP

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
their DNA they actually pass the GFP

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.700 
their DNA they actually pass the GFP
peptide<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.810> their<00:01:12.930> offspring<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.590> these

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
peptide on to their offspring so these

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.730 
peptide on to their offspring so these
monkeys<00:01:14.100> are<00:01:14.130> used<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.790> labs<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.390> research

to glowing kittens and the scientists

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.649 
to glowing kittens and the scientists
can<00:02:04.740> actually<00:02:05.009> watch<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.850> glowing<00:02:06.060> proteins

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
can actually watch the glowing proteins

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.270 
can actually watch the glowing proteins
and<00:02:06.899> see<00:02:07.409> if<00:02:07.500> they<00:02:07.619> were<00:02:07.680> effectively

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
and see if they were effectively

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.790 
and see if they were effectively
fighting<00:02:08.700> off<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.970> virus<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.539> they<00:02:10.110> were<00:02:10.170> so

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
fighting off the virus and they were so

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.710 
fighting off the virus and they were so
thanks<00:02:11.280> glowing<00:02:11.670> animals<00:02:12.060> because<00:02:12.450> that

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
thanks glowing animals because that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.250 
thanks glowing animals because that
stuff

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
stuff

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.860 
stuff
maybe<00:02:13.650> relevant<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.400> human<00:02:14.879> AIDS<00:02:15.090> research<00:02:15.360> in

maybe relevant to human AIDS research in

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.869 
maybe relevant to human AIDS research in
all<00:02:16.080> these<00:02:16.260> cases<00:02:16.769> it<00:02:16.980> doesn't<00:02:17.280> seem<00:02:17.610> like<00:02:17.790> the

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
all these cases it doesn't seem like the

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.850 
all these cases it doesn't seem like the
GFP<00:02:18.299> causes<00:02:18.750> any<00:02:18.900> change<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.439> the<00:02:19.470> animal

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
GFP causes any change to the animal

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.710 
GFP causes any change to the animal
other<00:02:20.069> than<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.370> glow<00:02:20.579> which<00:02:20.849> yeah<00:02:21.269> it's<00:02:21.540> a

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
other than the glow which yeah it's a

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.020 
other than the glow which yeah it's a
pretty<00:02:21.959> noticeable<00:02:22.260> change<00:02:22.769> but<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:23.519> terms<00:02:23.819> of

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
pretty noticeable change but in terms of

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.850 
pretty noticeable change but in terms of
health<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.390> behavior<00:02:24.870> they<00:02:25.409> seem<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.769> be

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
health and behavior they seem to be

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.699 
health and behavior they seem to be
exactly<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.430> same<00:02:26.459> you<00:02:27.239> know<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.390> was<00:02:27.569> thinking

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
exactly the same you know I was thinking

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.770 
exactly the same you know I was thinking
so<00:02:28.709> far<00:02:29.040> all<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.400> these<00:02:29.760> animals<00:02:30.269> were<00:02:30.629> created

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
so far all of these animals were created

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.259 
so far all of these animals were created
for<00:02:31.319> scientific<00:02:32.099> purposes<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.579> have<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.970> wonder

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
for scientific purposes I have to wonder

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.089 
for scientific purposes I have to wonder
now<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.989> somebody's<00:02:34.290> kick<00:02:34.530> started<00:02:34.890> glowing

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
now that somebody's kick started glowing

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.580 
now that somebody's kick started glowing
plant<00:02:35.579> for<00:02:35.849> everyone<00:02:36.239> how<00:02:36.569> long<00:02:36.840> until<00:02:37.049> we<00:02:37.230> see

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
plant for everyone how long until we see

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.339 
plant for everyone how long until we see
Designer<00:02:38.549> glowing<00:02:39.150> pets<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.870> how<00:02:40.109> would<00:02:40.170> you

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
Designer glowing pets and how would you

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.690 
Designer glowing pets and how would you
feel<00:02:40.470> if<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.650> happened<00:02:40.950> let<00:02:41.370> me<00:02:41.459> know<00:02:41.549> down

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
feel if that happened let me know down

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.580

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
actually would not mind a glowing hand
