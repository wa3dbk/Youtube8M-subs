00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
hey there guys I'm just gonna try a

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.900 
hey there guys I'm just gonna try a
crops<00:00:16.279> test<00:00:16.550> with<00:00:16.789> the<00:00:16.910> deus<00:00:17.330> ex<00:00:17.570> now<00:00:17.840> and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.660 

and<00:00:24.240> hopefully<00:00:25.240> it<00:00:26.110> runs<00:00:26.320> good<00:00:26.560> but<00:00:26.980> normally

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
and hopefully it runs good but normally

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.210 
and hopefully it runs good but normally
it<00:00:27.760> doesn't<00:00:28.560> because<00:00:29.560> it's<00:00:29.939> very<00:00:30.939> optimized

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
it doesn't because it's very optimized

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
it doesn't because it's very optimized
but<00:00:33.220> uh

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.240 
but uh

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.430 
but uh
that<00:00:35.870> is<00:00:35.990> quite<00:00:36.320> a<00:00:36.440> bit<00:00:36.620> and<00:00:36.770> randomness

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
that is quite a bit and randomness

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.500 
that is quite a bit and randomness
but<00:00:39.890> yeah
