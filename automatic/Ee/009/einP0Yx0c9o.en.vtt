have the specs as far as device goes and
it's<00:00:17.010> an<00:00:17.160> interesting<00:00:17.460> one<00:00:17.850> so<00:00:18.029> let's<00:00:18.180> get

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
water and dust resistance which is a

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.450 
water and dust resistance which is a
waterproof<00:00:29.820> down<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.720> 50<00:00:30.990> feet<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.410> some<00:00:31.679> level

of<00:00:32.520> dust<00:00:32.790> resistance<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.809> don't<00:00:34.230> know<00:00:34.290> why

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
of dust resistance on I don't know why

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.260 
of dust resistance on I don't know why
you<00:00:34.559> need<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.100> guess<00:00:35.309> if<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.640> if<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.059> drop

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
you need that I guess if you if you drop

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.270 
you need that I guess if you if you drop
your<00:00:36.480> device<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> lot<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> ground<00:00:37.500> maybe

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
your device a lot on the ground maybe

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.340 
your device a lot on the ground maybe
dust<00:00:38.579> as<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> problem<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.300> don't<00:00:39.540> know<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.840> think

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
dust as a problem I don't know I think

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.600 
dust as a problem I don't know I think
it's<00:00:40.440> more<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:40.770> shock<00:00:41.010> resistance<00:00:41.520> and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
it's more like shock resistance and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.729 
it's more like shock resistance and
things<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.000> as<00:00:42.329> well<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.200> big<00:00:43.500> deal

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
things like that as well it's a big deal

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.200 
things like that as well it's a big deal
that<00:00:44.550> way<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.700> don't<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.120> your

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
that way you don't have to have your

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.180 
that way you don't have to have your
otterbox<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.870> top<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.110> your<00:00:46.200> phone<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.950> makes

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
otterbox on top of your phone just makes

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.410 
otterbox on top of your phone just makes
it<00:00:47.309> big<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.550> bulky<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:48.030> things<00:00:48.239> get

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
it big and bulky this things get

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.880 
it big and bulky this things get
everything<00:00:48.690> built<00:00:48.870> into<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> outer<00:00:49.590> layer<00:00:49.860> of

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
everything built into the outer layer of

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.189 
everything built into the outer layer of
the<00:00:50.190> device<00:00:50.430> making<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.390> very<00:00:51.539> well-made
