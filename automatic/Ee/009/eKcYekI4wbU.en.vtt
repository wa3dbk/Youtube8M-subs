00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.309
 and so what we know about uk 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.889
 as one comrade from the film said 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.320
 big kush but fish chips tea length and yes 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.570
 the weather is even worse mary love and poppins 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.640
 London but that's not talking about the whole country and 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.470
 only about london but feature tagged 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.850
 and besides that we know that he 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.070
 his time was extremely 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.260
 perverted classification of light tanks 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.330
 nimble cardboard cruising tanks and 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.340
 heavy thick-skinned mastodons in the form of 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.750
 infantry tanks however the result is a 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.270
 World War II and further trends 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.980
 world tank building forced to admit 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.629
 that such a concept does not work and 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.280
 the British wanted to build themselves 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.320
 main battle tank to be like 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.140
 centurion is only even cooler and more powerful 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.329
 because in 1956 was created 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.800
 technical task for the car which 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.050
 could simultaneously replace and 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.329
 centurion and conqueror creation 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.280
 started in a year immediately arose 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.730
 the sharp question is whether the new car 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.010
 armor 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.870
 the question appeared not just because 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.940
 continent at this time was going joint 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.489
 development of a new European tank from 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.710
 which then grow leopard and mx 30 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.960
 and when creating the Germans and the French decided 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.180
 that armor is not necessary because it does not save but 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.640
 but you need a powerful tool and mobility 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.049
 the inhabitants of the same foggy which is albion with 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.390
 this concept did not agree 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.130
 they rightly reasoned that up against 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.290
 some ammunition and armor 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.720
 will not hold but nobody canceled 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.580
 ordinary shells mines and other shelupon 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.140
 especially if it was not about war with 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.299
 equal adversary 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.950
 for example the papuans plus they had 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.200
 extensive experience in the use of centurions 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.299
 brown and not only where they showed themselves 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.070
 relatively protected by a robust machine 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.740
 so the British designers decided 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.409
 give armor to the leader now the question of 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.090
 armed at the time you already 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.310
 developed mx 30 and leopard already 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.159
 existing centurion and appearing in 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.200
 the late 50s m60 was used 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.390
 105 millimeter gun 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.219
 a gun good for tea lovers decided 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.170
 put something more powerful because 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.119
 believed that the likely opponent in the face 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.670
 soviet union obviously singer something 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.369
 new on the tracks biting armored 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.409
 and they were not mistaken in the quality of weapons 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.619
 120 mm rifle was chosen 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.349
 cannon or 1 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.330
 powerful and penetrating weapon besides good 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.190
 armor of excellent weapons planned 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.620
 also make a tank enough shuster 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.840
 at the level of the same leopards and mx 30 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.299
 however, itâ€™s not really about that 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.340
 will be told later 1 pure 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.129
 still experienced young and naive tank 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.989
 was created in 1960, then he 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.650
 there were two years of finishing tests 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.640
 file and bring to mind and in 1963 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.620
 year with hooting 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.440
 and waving flags with union jack 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.120
 chiften was put into service 1 why 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.859
 should go this defense 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.810
 if you compare it with the armor that 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.599
 bashful trying to hide behind a leopard 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.400
 im their 30 japanese type 61 then she is quite and 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.440
 very not bad however there is also 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.660
 some problems if you look at 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.730
 wikipedia or any other publicly available 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.430
 the site you will find there that she is cheat 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.959
 has a thickness of 120 millimeters problem 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.650
 that this information is not exactly 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.659
 reliably 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.329
 these 120 millimeters tank only has 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.819
 at the junction of wld and nld, most of it 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.970
 top sheet 85 millimeters angled 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.859
 72 degrees is certainly not 388 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.019
 millimeters of reduced armor what was 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.030
 in the case when chiften all wld was 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.799
 would be 120 millimeters but it gives us 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.410
 two hundred seventy five millimeters under 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.480
 quite ricochet us angle especially nld 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.180
 nothing to say 76 millimeters at an angle 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.730
 in 45 degrees combinations are not the smallest 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.290
 dimensions about the armor of the tower she 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.269
 its thickest part has a hundred 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.069
 ninety five millimeters and given her 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.049
 forms in many ways resembling forms 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.449
 Soviet towers covered it worthy 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.220
 firepower is great here 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:41.739
 as mentioned earlier the machine is equipped 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.510
 e120 millimeter gun l-11 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.769
 historical ammunition purely on 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.590
 included armor piercing 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.780
 shells and hash shells gun corners 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.239
 also eat down 10 degrees and up 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.340
 20 but one of the main advantages of the gun 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.859
 This rate of fire is comparable to that 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.269
 at 105 millimeter guns average 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.280
 value of 8 rounds per minute 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.859
 maximum reached in the first minute 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.419
 shooting 10 shots per minute also 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.129
 there is a very interesting figure that 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.840
 one of the chef tones are transmitted to the us for 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.940
 tests using the dock soldering and 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.349
 various rituals record was reached 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.410
 12 shots per minute 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.180
 however, it may be a bike, please note that 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.280
 for mobility, then not everything is so 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.229
 rainbow primarily pumped up chassis 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.459
 it is similar to spring balance 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.680
 running standing next 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.699
 inside it was for that time already 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.530
 he is still archaism 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.970
 and not allowed to develop pure big 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.430
 speed she was cruel and merciless 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.819
 limited also cheat it was equipped 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.919
 diesel or 60 585 horsepower 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:37.870
 forces in mark2 modification power 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.199
 the engine has been brought up to 650 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:45.160
 horsepower that a straight 753 tons gives 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:47.080
 us 13.7 horsepower per ton friends 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.509
 the first part comes to an end in the second you 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.610
 will learn on the modifications chiften machines 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:54.310
 at its base and its combat and not very 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.289
