00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
pretty powerful somehow he's the Riddick

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.149 
pretty powerful somehow he's the Riddick
in<00:01:13.030> damage<00:01:13.720> I<00:01:13.840> don't<00:01:14.020> know<00:01:14.080> how<00:01:14.290> I<00:01:14.619> think<00:01:15.070> they

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
in damage I don't know how I think they

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.460 
in damage I don't know how I think they
just<00:01:15.189> said<00:01:15.610> giving<00:01:15.939> him<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:16.180> suburb<00:01:16.659> I<00:01:16.990> know

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
just said giving him the suburb I know

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.560 
just said giving him the suburb I know
he's<00:01:18.130> actually<00:01:18.520> receiving<00:01:18.790> damage<00:01:19.030> without

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
he's actually receiving damage without

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.980 
he's actually receiving damage without
even<00:01:19.990> wow<00:01:20.770> he's<00:01:21.490> really<00:01:22.119> far<00:01:22.540> away<00:01:22.630> from<00:01:22.750> him

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
even wow he's really far away from him

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.200 
even wow he's really far away from him
so<00:01:23.020> he<00:01:23.590> is<00:01:24.250> actually<00:01:24.369> working<00:01:24.640> with<00:01:24.880> damage

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
so he is actually working with damage

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.730 
so he is actually working with damage
and<00:01:25.420> I'm<00:01:25.720> pretty<00:01:25.960> sure<00:01:26.049> if<00:01:26.259> they<00:01:26.409> could<00:01:26.470> like

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
and I'm pretty sure if they could like

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.319 
and I'm pretty sure if they could like
probably<00:01:27.100> squeeze<00:01:27.700> him<00:01:27.909> into<00:01:28.119> a<00:01:28.150> corner

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
probably squeeze him into a corner

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:29.730 
probably squeeze him into a corner
something<00:01:28.659> like<00:01:28.750> that<00:01:28.899> and<00:01:29.049> he's<00:01:29.229> gonna<00:01:29.470> die

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
something like that and he's gonna die

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.980 
something like that and he's gonna die
so<00:01:30.070> freaking<00:01:30.430> fast<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:31.479> image<00:01:31.810> they're

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
so freaking fast and image they're

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.550 
so freaking fast and image they're
really<00:01:32.259> powerful<00:01:32.409> and

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
really powerful and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.530 
really powerful and
