00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.110 

the<00:00:03.600> relationship<00:00:04.589> that<00:00:04.859> Stratos<00:00:05.640> has<00:00:05.819> with

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
the relationship that Stratos has with

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.680 
the relationship that Stratos has with
Optima<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.859> really<00:00:08.280> fun<00:00:08.580> venture<00:00:09.059> of

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
Optima is a really fun venture of

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.259 
Optima is a really fun venture of
marrying<00:00:10.170> two<00:00:10.380> technologies<00:00:11.099> together<00:00:11.339> to

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
marrying two technologies together to

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.350 
marrying two technologies together to
actually<00:00:12.839> bring<00:00:13.679> smart<00:00:14.459> tools<00:00:14.789> and<00:00:15.089> smart

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
actually bring smart tools and smart

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.410 
actually bring smart tools and smart
parts<00:00:15.749> to<00:00:15.990> life<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.950> the<00:00:17.100> Optima<00:00:17.550> k--<00:00:17.580> aerosol

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
parts to life so the Optima k-- aerosol

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.370 
parts to life so the Optima k-- aerosol
jet<00:00:18.630> process<00:00:19.110> is<00:00:19.290> a<00:00:19.710> very<00:00:20.060> enabling<00:00:21.060> one<00:00:21.960> one

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
jet process is a very enabling one one

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.930 
jet process is a very enabling one one
feature<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.250> has<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> very<00:00:23.790> large

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 
feature is that it has a very large

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.500 
feature is that it has a very large
standoff<00:00:24.540> distance<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.800> we<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.070> print<00:00:26.310> on

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
standoff distance so so we can print on

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.180 
standoff distance so so we can print on
surfaces<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.570> are<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.350> are<00:00:28.410> curved<00:00:28.860> and

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 
surfaces that are that are curved and

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.330 
surfaces that are that are curved and
and<00:00:29.520> have<00:00:29.940> very<00:00:30.630> complex<00:00:31.080> geometry<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
and have very complex geometry and

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.069 
and have very complex geometry and
that's<00:00:32.610> because<00:00:32.940> our<00:00:33.120> print<00:00:33.690> head<00:00:33.809> section

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
that's because our print head section

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.200 
that's because our print head section
never<00:00:34.440> touched<00:00:34.740> the<00:00:34.950> surface<00:00:35.130> they<00:00:35.610> they

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
never touched the surface they they

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.130 
never touched the surface they they
literally<00:00:37.700> create<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> jet<00:00:39.060> of<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
literally create a jet of the of the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.200 
literally create a jet of the of the
material<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.130> a<00:00:41.250> jet<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.640> material<00:00:41.670> that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
material and it's a jet of material that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.720 
material and it's a jet of material that
gets<00:00:42.300> jetted<00:00:42.720> down<00:00:42.840> onto<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.260> surface<00:00:43.730> really

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
gets jetted down onto the surface really

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.490 
gets jetted down onto the surface really
opens<00:00:45.180> up<00:00:45.360> all<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.780> possibilities<00:00:45.810> of

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
opens up all the possibilities of

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.060 
opens up all the possibilities of
printing<00:00:46.950> at<00:00:47.070> three<00:00:47.250> dimensions<00:00:47.820> we<00:00:48.690> can

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
printing at three dimensions we can

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.470 
printing at three dimensions we can
electronics<00:00:50.070> onto<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:51.060> can<00:00:51.239> give<00:00:51.450> it

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
electronics onto it you can give it

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.440 
electronics onto it you can give it
intelligence<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.470> that<00:00:52.680> has<00:00:53.489> not<00:00:53.910> been<00:00:54.210> done

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
intelligence and that has not been done

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.790 
intelligence and that has not been done
to<00:00:54.630> date<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.989> that's<00:00:55.140> what's<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.710> exciting

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
to date and that's what's so exciting

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.440 
to date and that's what's so exciting
about<00:00:56.250> marrying<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.970> two<00:00:57.090> technologies

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
about marrying the two technologies

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.510 
about marrying the two technologies
together<00:00:57.899> these<00:00:58.559> are<00:00:58.739> both<00:00:58.920> additive

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
together these are both additive

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.160 
together these are both additive
manufacturing<00:00:59.870> technologies<00:01:00.870> you're<00:01:01.020> only

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
manufacturing technologies you're only

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.290 
manufacturing technologies you're only
putting<00:01:01.500> material<00:01:02.219> where<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.489> need<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:02.940> so

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
putting material where you need it so

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.749 
putting material where you need it so
there's<00:01:03.930> not<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.110> lot<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.379> waste<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
there's not a lot of waste so in the

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.149 
there's not a lot of waste so in the
aerospace<00:01:06.409> applications<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.620> really<00:01:07.920> neat

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
aerospace applications it's really neat

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.550 
aerospace applications it's really neat
as<00:01:08.310> well<00:01:08.580> from<00:01:08.820> my<00:01:08.970> perspective<00:01:09.270> what<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.380> did

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
as well from my perspective what we did

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.890 
as well from my perspective what we did
there<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.460> right<00:01:12.120> now<00:01:12.330> with<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> US

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
there is that right now with the US

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.050 
there is that right now with the US
military<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:14.400> even<00:01:14.520> commercial

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
military and even commercial

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.390 
military and even commercial
applications<00:01:15.870> for<00:01:16.080> unmanned<00:01:16.560> air<00:01:16.830> vehicles

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
applications for unmanned air vehicles

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.570 
applications for unmanned air vehicles
or<00:01:17.670> drones<00:01:18.260> when<00:01:19.260> you<00:01:19.380> start<00:01:19.619> looking<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
or drones when you start looking at the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.390 
or drones when you start looking at the
little<00:01:20.790> helicopters<00:01:21.510> or<00:01:22.040> UAVs<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.070> are

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
little helicopters or UAVs that are

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.270 
little helicopters or UAVs that are
flying<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.970> airspace<00:01:24.450> they<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:24.930> wings<00:01:25.280> now

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
flying in airspace they have wings now

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.880 
flying in airspace they have wings now
with<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:27.420> two<00:01:27.570> technologies<00:01:28.290> combined<00:01:28.710> we

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
with the two technologies combined we

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.520 
with the two technologies combined we
can<00:01:29.040> actually<00:01:29.369> print<00:01:29.640> onto<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.659> wing<00:01:31.260> of<00:01:31.439> an

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
can actually print onto a wing of an

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.920 
can actually print onto a wing of an
airplane<00:01:31.710> an<00:01:32.130> antenna<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.939> power<00:01:33.240> circuit

well<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> UAV<00:01:35.070> project<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.760> really<00:01:36.450> cool<00:01:36.689> one

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
well the UAV project is really cool one

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.140 
well the UAV project is really cool one
of<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.500> enabling<00:01:38.040> features<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> combined

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
of the enabling features of the combined

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.960 
of the enabling features of the combined
technology<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.170> now<00:01:40.350> we<00:01:40.409> can<00:01:40.650> make<00:01:40.970> you

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
technology so that now we can make you

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.719 
technology so that now we can make you
AVS<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.960> are<00:01:43.080> much<00:01:43.229> lighter<00:01:43.530> with<00:01:44.340> much<00:01:44.549> more

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
AVS that are much lighter with much more

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.490 
AVS that are much lighter with much more
functionality<00:01:45.270> than<00:01:45.689> what's<00:01:45.900> available<00:01:46.170> now

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
functionality than what's available now

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.940 
functionality than what's available now
and<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> idea<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.479> embedding<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
and so the idea of embedding the the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.560 
and so the idea of embedding the the
sensors<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.060> electrical

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
sensors and the the electrical

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.100 
sensors and the the electrical
components<00:01:51.720> into<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:52.680> structure<00:01:54.110> that

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
components into the structure that

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.170 
components into the structure that
removes<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.770> lot<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:57.119> know

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
removes a lot of the you know

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.880 
removes a lot of the you know
stand-alone<00:01:57.840> components<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.439> would<00:01:58.560> would

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
stand-alone components that would would

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.990 
stand-alone components that would would
be<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.180> UAV<00:02:00.570> otherwise
