00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hey guys how you guys doing this is Ray

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.100 
hey guys how you guys doing this is Ray
and<00:00:02.520> in<00:00:02.610> this<00:00:02.730> video<00:00:02.939> I<00:00:03.360> want<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.720> discuss

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
and in this video I want to discuss

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.740 
and in this video I want to discuss
zero<00:00:04.620> latency<00:00:04.799> direct<00:00:05.609> monitoring<00:00:06.029> somebody

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
zero latency direct monitoring somebody

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.970 
zero latency direct monitoring somebody
asked<00:00:06.990> me<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.200> thing<00:00:07.410> isn't<00:00:07.859> really

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
asked me the thing isn't really

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.000 
asked me the thing isn't really
important<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.719> told<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.809> person<00:00:10.139> absolutely<00:00:10.590> and

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
important I told a person absolutely and

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.100 
important I told a person absolutely and
then<00:00:11.219> they<00:00:11.370> asked<00:00:11.580> how<00:00:11.849> do<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.450> set<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:12.750> up<00:00:12.870> and

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
then they asked how do you set it up and

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.600 
then they asked how do you set it up and
it<00:00:13.349> all<00:00:13.469> depends<00:00:13.830> on<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:13.980> hardware<00:00:14.400> if<00:00:14.490> you're

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
it all depends on the hardware if you're

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.269 
it all depends on the hardware if you're
using<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.880> Pro<00:00:15.030> Tools<00:00:15.059> HD<00:00:15.360> setup<00:00:15.960> then<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:16.770> not

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
using a Pro Tools HD setup then it's not

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.700 
using a Pro Tools HD setup then it's not
a<00:00:17.340> problem<00:00:17.609> at<00:00:17.820> all<00:00:17.850> or<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.210> native<00:00:18.600> system<00:00:18.779> but

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
a problem at all or a native system but

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.769 
a problem at all or a native system but
if<00:00:19.800> you're<00:00:19.890> using<00:00:20.039> like<00:00:20.340> an<00:00:20.850> M<00:00:21.029> box<00:00:21.240> or<00:00:21.750> a

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
if you're using like an M box or a

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.439 
if you're using like an M box or a
project<00:00:22.199> mix<00:00:22.650> IO<00:00:22.800> there's<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.760> little<00:00:24.029> option

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
project mix IO there's a little option

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.509 
project mix IO there's a little option
on<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:25.199> would<00:00:25.470> allow<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.890> use<00:00:26.099> direct

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
on it that would allow you to use direct

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.160 
on it that would allow you to use direct
monitoring<00:00:26.910> which<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.390> pretty<00:00:27.570> cool<00:00:27.810> on<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
monitoring which is pretty cool on the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.439 
monitoring which is pretty cool on the
end<00:00:28.320> box<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.740> used<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.130> come<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:29.670> our<00:00:29.910> mix

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
end box it used to come with our mix

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.060 
end box it used to come with our mix
knob<00:00:30.660> I'm<00:00:30.929> not<00:00:31.230> really<00:00:31.470> sure<00:00:31.619> about<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> new

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
knob I'm not really sure about the new

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.910 
knob I'm not really sure about the new
end<00:00:32.340> boxes<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.969> know<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:34.050> has<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.440> option<00:00:34.829> I

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
end boxes I know it has the option I

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.229 
end boxes I know it has the option I
just<00:00:35.100> don't<00:00:35.250> know<00:00:35.309> how<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.579> works<00:00:35.730> I've<00:00:35.969> never

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
just don't know how it works I've never

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.900 
just don't know how it works I've never
used<00:00:36.510> one<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.840> new<00:00:36.930> wine<00:00:37.050> boxes<00:00:37.820> now<00:00:38.820> in

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
used one of the new wine boxes now in

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.270 
used one of the new wine boxes now in
the<00:00:39.000> project<00:00:39.210> mix<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.960> has<00:00:40.260> maybe<00:00:40.559> button<00:00:41.160> on

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
the project mix it has maybe button on

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.580 
the project mix it has maybe button on
it<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:42.120> could<00:00:42.329> set<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.750> up<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:43.469> direct

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
it and I could set that up for direct

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.010 
it and I could set that up for direct
monitoring<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.910> let's<00:00:45.120> say<00:00:45.270> your<00:00:45.480> car<00:00:45.660> did<00:00:45.989> not

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
monitoring so let's say your car did not

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.110 
monitoring so let's say your car did not
have<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.530> rec<00:00:46.800> monitoring<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:47.969> what

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
have that rec monitoring this is what

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.610 
have that rec monitoring this is what
you<00:00:48.239> would<00:00:48.390> normally<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.870> your<00:00:49.050> setup

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
you would normally do your setup

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.520 
you would normally do your setup
playback<00:00:50.070> engine<00:00:50.309> your<00:00:50.969> buffer<00:00:51.329> size<00:00:51.570> bring

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
playback engine your buffer size bring

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.130 
playback engine your buffer size bring
it<00:00:52.649> as<00:00:52.800> low<00:00:53.100> as<00:00:53.430> possible<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.899> case

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
it as low as possible and in this case

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.229 
it as low as possible and in this case
my<00:00:55.350> system<00:00:55.649> zone<00:00:55.829> only<00:00:56.219> able<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.550> go<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> 64

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
my system zone only able to go to 64

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.630 
my system zone only able to go to 64
samples<00:00:57.530> but<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> problem<00:00:58.980> with<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.430> on

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
samples but the problem with this is on

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.939 
samples but the problem with this is on
some<00:01:00.000> systems<00:01:00.510> depending<00:01:01.320> how<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.500> system<00:01:01.859> is

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
some systems depending how the system is

some systems depending how the system is
set<00:01:02.129> up<00:01:02.190> if<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.930> lot<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.140> things<00:01:04.350> going

power in order to continue you have to

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.080 
power in order to continue you have to
increase<00:01:12.840> your<00:01:12.960> buffer<00:01:13.890> settings<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:15.000> you

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
increase your buffer settings so you

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.580 
increase your buffer settings so you
would<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.900> let's<00:01:16.080> say<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.259> end<00:01:16.470> up

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
would do that and let's say you end up

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.520 
would do that and let's say you end up
at<00:01:16.710> 1024<00:01:17.430> samples<00:01:17.990> problem<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.229> you're

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
at 1024 samples problem with that you're

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.010 
at 1024 samples problem with that you're
introducing<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.610> much<00:01:20.820> delay<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.479> imagine

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
introducing so much delay so imagine

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.590 
introducing so much delay so imagine
talking<00:01:22.200> into<00:01:22.500> your<00:01:22.619> microphone<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.600> not

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
talking into your microphone and not

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.789 
talking into your microphone and not
hearing<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.020> right<00:01:25.170> away<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.500> your<00:01:25.619> headphones

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
hearing it right away on your headphones

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.590 
hearing it right away on your headphones
that's<00:01:26.280> basically<00:01:26.729> what's<00:01:27.030> happening<00:01:27.390> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that's basically what's happening and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.690 
that's basically what's happening and
it's<00:01:28.380> impossible<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:29.100> work<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.460> that

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
it's impossible to work like that

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.240 
it's impossible to work like that
that's<00:01:30.600> why<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.900> want<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.140> look<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.470> an<00:01:31.740> audio

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
that's why you want to look for an audio

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.600 
that's why you want to look for an audio
interface<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.880> has<00:01:33.090> direct<00:01:33.299> monitoring<00:01:34.610> now

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.480 
interface that has direct monitoring now
I<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:37.200> what<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.829> will<00:01:37.950> do<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.369> would

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
I have it on so what I will do I would

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.819 
I have it on so what I will do I would
new<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.060> track<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.750> would<00:01:39.990> start<00:01:40.320> recording

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
new to track and I would start recording

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.460 
new to track and I would start recording
and<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.090> way<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.119> won't<00:01:42.360> have<00:01:42.659> any<00:01:42.960> problems

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
and that way I won't have any problems

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.289 
and that way I won't have any problems
with<00:01:43.560> latency<00:01:44.009> if<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.640> didn't<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.149> that

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
with latency if I didn't have that

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.149 
with latency if I didn't have that
option<00:01:45.509> then<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.470> will<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.799> all<00:01:47.100> that

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
option then you will have all that

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.660 
option then you will have all that
latency<00:01:47.880> issue<00:01:48.030> if<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:49.320> don't<00:01:49.500> have<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.430> rec

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
latency issue if you don't have that rec

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.819

your settings out and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.500 
your settings out and
see<00:02:13.799> if<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.010> supports<00:02:14.129> it<00:02:14.609> I<00:02:14.790> can<00:02:15.180> make<00:02:15.299> a<00:02:15.329> video
