00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.139
 my name is bunny i am 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.390
 master gardener and do ours 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.310
 horticulture never lied here houses 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.430
 operation is characterized by the fact that 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.080
 we plant high unit volumes and 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.660
 consistent quality on the spot 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.430
 Correctly correct, especially proud 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.189
 I'm here in operation Christa Platzer that 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.190
 We quickly large quantities of large orders 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.280
 can implement because we just 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.290
 have made it through our system 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.770
 really work really fast too 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.890
 can 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.690
 I always work in the company 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.520
 So I do every job with it 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.500
 somewhere and if it really is 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.840
 so if we do not enjoy something 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.160
 then we just leave that machine 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.930
 that's what I think is important 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.940
 point is you there yourself and is 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.630
 notices and sees where it hooks and where you are 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.280
 what can do 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.440
 I think to a good one 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.270
 Corporate governance belongs above all 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.250
 Do the good with each other 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.920
 employees that are with each other 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.329
 understand well and that too is done 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.040
 with staff well understand the 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.590
 is a group i hold it for 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.659
 important that the staff are taken 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.509
 they will always be informed 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.859
 what happens in the operation so everyone is like that 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.140
 a bit with us too 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:21.909
 feels and also interested in the end 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.259
 it is to drive that forward 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.060
 customer satisfaction 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.090
 I am very satisfied right now 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.350
 because with us almost every one in one 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.869
 other turns to me simply fun 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.030
 because I see people with one 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.389
 Developing other things 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.729
 we also communicate independently 

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:41.499
 everything down to the point that brings the 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.490
 is a great success for me and there 

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:44.350
 I am very pleased 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.829
 who worked with us he did 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.829
 likes to do that 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.730
 + platz is actually one for me 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.230
 merger of operated the 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.150
 Joint try a brand too 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.220
 create where your strengths after 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.080
 put forward the common 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.720
 brand appearance at plus planz is 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.550
 very important because we are 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.740
 We have different products 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.960
 also deliver all over the year 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.520
 if one has the product has the 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.640
 others just the other and we can 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.580
 we think it's great because 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.720
 we also do things together 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.970
 develop because we are among colleagues and 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.980
 say whatever you are there you are good and there 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.380
 are you bad and that's how we motivate you 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.870
 to make each other better 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.590
 to push things forward 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.990
 to improve 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.970
 to actually be more flexible for it 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.650
 plus plans singly positively occupied me 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.840
 I can understand that 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.640
 I want to fix a plus fans 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.750
 because then he will smile 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.750
 over my face is as expected 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.120
 i see it as a big challenge 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.690
 to satisfy the wishes of our customers 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.110
 become 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.670
 Quality is indeed a requirement 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.590
 I actually believe in horticulture needs 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.630
 you have to do a lot very much 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.120
 you always have to stay on the ball 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.620
 a product moderately technical you have to with 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.780
 communicate to the customer 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.850
 and in fact if you can do it all 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.240
 so do because then it can be good 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.370
 go 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.240
 then you can also horticulture and future 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.240
 operate successfully
