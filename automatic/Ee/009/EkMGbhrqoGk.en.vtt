00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:11.620
 that gives us an audio that does not even go 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.190
 to insert here that sends us your mail 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.960
 your podcast comment but then it 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.750
 go novel because instead of a text 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.640
 an audio clip sends us an audio clip 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.560
 I think it would be the first one we received 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.750
 in all the history of the podcast is 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.110
 normally from the first second and 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.060
 third this season this is what 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.920
 first we receive a comment 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.200

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.429

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:04.049

 hello antimatter friends podcast me 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.640
 I call joan and I'm the listener who's 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.030
 they referred in episode 45 of the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.770
 third season and good listening to the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.119
 episode from Barcelona listening to the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.910
 good episode I heard that argel asked 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:44.130
 more feedback more more feedback 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.970
 with the listeners and well I decided 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.360
 send this this audio nothing wanted 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.670
 comment that I always listen to them and 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.119
 It's true what I say I do not know 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.369
 if it was Carlos or angel and well I know 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.979
 Alonso commented that the first or second 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.720
 antimatter season I do not know if the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.489
 first or second they used a program 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.070
 to compress the audio so that it does not 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.320
 there were blank spaces and I 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.450
 it was very disturbing very very 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.480
 agonizing and the truth is that I stopped 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.540
 listen to it I remember that a while 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.750
 then on a radio station here 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.360
 that I listened to because they also used it 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.270
 in a report of several minutes and 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.280
 then they compressed it and there was also 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.650
 very distressing could not not not 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.410
 listen to this good on the other hand I am 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.050
 one of the listeners who had carlos and 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.940
 alonso of antimatter the truth is that 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.510
 it was one of the programs like me 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.640
 I really liked the podcast what I remember 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.260
 is that I did not discover it by pin podcasting myself 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.350
 I think I looked for it as a humor podcast 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.010
 somewhere and were not heard 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.380
 many programs but hey I was 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.080
 very very well 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.240
 and good 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.250
 I try to listen to all the programs 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.310
 antimatter but the truth is that it 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.420
 they are accumulating 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.060
 gra vice many hours a week two 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.890
 programs of two and three hours and good 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.800
 I the truth is that I am a listener of many 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.620
 podcast and I can not listen to all 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.349
 I'm accumulating good if you 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.880
 take a vacation for a while then I 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.800
 I'll be updating and if not then well 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.610
 it continues to accumulate I do not want 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.510
 delete them for now 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.070
 Finally I wish you a happy 2013 year at 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.030
 program team and all listeners 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:43.300
 and continue antimatter health 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:47.260
 Well, there you have it, thank you very much 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.180
 for this by this audio micro joan what 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.540
 good that you like the podcast that we 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.360
 listened to for a long time and that 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.420
 you liked this one I do not know if they want 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:03.220
 comment something else and I think muddy critter 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:07.540
 regarding minute 1 with 36 seconds no 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.340
 the truth I do not have the angels and good not 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.400
 I know if I want to add something alonso is the 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.750
 who knows him if alonso is talking 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.150
 is not some help and if it is joan 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.410
 I had moved a bit away from the podcast but 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.610
 so he tells us this one has already returned 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.919
 it's an antimatter issue and it's 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.140
 matching hopefully when 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.150
 antimatter finish this one is already divine 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:36.390
 the stream with all the episodes that 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:40.550
 that it was missing 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:43.860
 he is all a fan of collar podcast 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.230
 if the goal of Spain is that if 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.900
 they took this podcasting seriously or 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.390
 follow and follow the podcast eo strong as 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.510
 says the place in the audio if a podcast 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.780
 erra opens another podcast and it's pretty 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.480
 done he also sent me an email 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.760
 this one with what happened there in the event 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.010
 that is in them they make days of 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.510
 podcasting if the imminent do events 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:11.820
 here 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:14.160
 we do not even make a special congress 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.700
 but because we're not even going to eat in 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:21.960
 one side all 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:25.770
 something not very traditional Monterrey 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:30.060
 but at least to get together people 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:33.420
 of two miserable podcasts but good yes 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.750
 but how many how many podcast 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.800
 commercial or non-institutional you know 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.020
 you 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:46.949
 with which we can associate them with the 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:49.190
 only we are unique and fat there must be 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:51.560
 out there but let's be 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.860
 I do not know why there are so are in contact and 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:58.660
 here do not look what matters is that Jesus 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.640
 in your city where you live that are like a 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.270
 municipality stays Barcelona that 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.880
 flame vilanova I think 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.980
 and they are for the self and other people did 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.370
 a congress with a day of 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.470
 podcasting and gathered 80 people without 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:18.820
 do a lot of publicity means that 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:21.030
 really 80 is a number that is more 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.360
 that very acceptable 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.580
 and this we eat them suggests us also 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.960
 what would happen to the questions what will happen 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.080
 if here we did with 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.140
 advertising is a bit stronger for 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.270
 an antimatter conference no good that what 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:39.140
 He said in another email we would feel very 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.140
 disappointed
