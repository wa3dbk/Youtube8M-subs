is going to be another texture pack that

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.160 
is going to be another texture pack that
we<00:00:21.740> are<00:00:21.890> soon<00:00:22.189> to<00:00:22.340> be<00:00:22.610> seeing<00:00:22.910> on<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:23.689> console

dangler went ahead and tweeted them and
said<00:00:57.440> what<00:00:57.680> texture<00:00:58.010> pack<00:00:58.250> is<00:00:58.460> that<00:00:58.700> and<00:00:58.910> they

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
said what texture pack is that and they

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.209 
said what texture pack is that and they
went<00:00:59.210> ahead<00:00:59.360> and<00:00:59.629> responded<00:01:00.290> it's<00:01:00.410> a<00:01:00.920> city

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
texture pack a smiley face so we now

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.650 
texture pack a smiley face so we now
know<00:01:04.250> that<00:01:04.280> it<00:01:04.580> is<00:01:04.670> going<00:01:04.729> to<00:01:05.000> be<00:01:05.119> a<00:01:05.149> texture

pack<00:01:05.840> based<00:01:06.200> around<00:01:06.470> a<00:01:06.979> obviously<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:07.520> city<00:01:07.910> so

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
pack based around a obviously a city so

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:09.550 
pack based around a obviously a city so
with<00:01:08.660> this<00:01:08.780> texture<00:01:09.110> pack<00:01:09.259> you're<00:01:09.380> going<00:01:09.500> to

with this texture pack you're going to

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.469 
with this texture pack you're going to
be<00:01:09.619> able<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.830> build<00:01:09.979> towns<00:01:10.399> and<00:01:10.789> massive<00:01:11.270> mega

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
have a texture pack that will allow you

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.139 
have a texture pack that will allow you
to<00:01:15.289> create<00:01:15.530> you<00:01:16.280> know<00:01:16.310> maybe<00:01:16.610> things<00:01:16.910> like

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
to create you know maybe things like

lamps and all kinds of other stuff I

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.600 
lamps and all kinds of other stuff I
guess<00:01:20.869> you<00:01:21.140> would<00:01:21.259> see<00:01:21.410> in<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.560> city<00:01:21.800> and<00:01:22.039> it

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
guess you would see in a city and it

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.609 
guess you would see in a city and it
will<00:01:22.910> just<00:01:23.060> open<00:01:23.209> up<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.479> whole<00:01:23.750> new<00:01:23.780> avenue<00:01:24.440> for

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
will just open up a whole new avenue for

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.339 
will just open up a whole new avenue for
actually<00:01:25.580> cool<00:01:25.819> looking<00:01:26.149> maps<00:01:26.360> with<00:01:26.899> creative

00:01:27.339 --> 00:01:27.349 
actually cool looking maps with creative

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:29.410 
actually cool looking maps with creative
designs<00:01:27.679> on<00:01:27.950> them<00:01:28.160> so<00:01:28.759> anyway<00:01:29.060> I'm<00:01:29.149> absolutely

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.230 
sure what's going on with that if
they're<00:01:42.679> kind<00:01:42.890> of<00:01:42.950> trashing<00:01:43.369> that<00:01:43.399> idea<00:01:43.849> or

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
they're kind of trashing that idea or

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.370 
they're kind of trashing that idea or
they're<00:01:44.569> going<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.780> be<00:01:44.869> releasing<00:01:45.020> two

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
they're going to be releasing two

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.930 
they're going to be releasing two
texture<00:01:45.679> packs<00:01:45.860> at<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:45.979> same<00:01:46.190> time<00:01:46.399> or<00:01:46.580> what<00:01:46.759> I

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
texture packs at the same time or what I

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.790 
texture packs at the same time or what I
don't<00:01:47.360> know<00:01:47.509> but<00:01:47.990> we're<00:01:48.380> just<00:01:48.410> gonna<00:01:48.590> have<00:01:48.740> to

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
don't know but we're just gonna have to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.130 
don't know but we're just gonna have to
wait<00:01:48.830> and<00:01:49.160> see<00:01:49.250> exactly<00:01:49.550> what<00:01:50.090> happens<00:01:50.479> but<00:01:50.990> as

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
wait and see exactly what happens but as

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.510 
wait and see exactly what happens but as
far<00:01:51.410> as<00:01:51.470> this<00:01:51.619> texture<00:01:51.979> pack<00:01:52.160> goes<00:01:52.340> that's

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
far as this texture pack goes that's

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.130 
far as this texture pack goes that's
about<00:01:52.910> all<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.239> information<00:01:53.690> we<00:01:53.720> currently

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
about all the information we currently

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.809 
about all the information we currently
have<00:01:54.349> there<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:54.709> no<00:01:54.890> release<00:01:55.190> date<00:01:55.220> or<00:01:55.520> price

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
have there is no release date or price

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.370 
have there is no release date or price
but<00:01:56.360> I<00:01:56.390> would<00:01:56.569> assume<00:01:56.810> that<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.110> price<00:01:57.349> will

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
but I would assume that the price will

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.380 
but I would assume that the price will
be<00:01:57.679> about<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.069> same<00:01:58.280> if<00:01:58.489> not<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.880> exact<00:01:59.179> same

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
be about the same if not the exact same

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.270 
be about the same if not the exact same
as<00:01:59.569> all<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.229> other<00:02:00.500> texture<00:02:00.830> packs<00:02:01.039> have<00:02:01.220> been

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
as all the other texture packs have been

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.130 
as all the other texture packs have been
and<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.819> release<00:02:02.060> date<00:02:02.300> I<00:02:02.330> would<00:02:02.479> imagine<00:02:02.840> is

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
and the release date I would imagine is

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.050 
and the release date I would imagine is
probably<00:02:03.440> two<00:02:03.649> or<00:02:03.679> three<00:02:03.950> weeks<00:02:03.979> out<00:02:04.310> at<00:02:04.520> the

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
probably two or three weeks out at the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.089 
probably two or three weeks out at the
least<00:02:05.239> so<00:02:05.630> anyway<00:02:06.200> with<00:02:06.470> that<00:02:06.500> said<00:02:06.890> I<00:02:06.920> think

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
least so anyway with that said I think

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.190 
least so anyway with that said I think
that's<00:02:07.520> about<00:02:07.759> it<00:02:08.149> for<00:02:08.300> me<00:02:08.450> if<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:08.989> guys
