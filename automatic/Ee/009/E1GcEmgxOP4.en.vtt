00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
know if you can see that it's a little

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.060 
know if you can see that it's a little
dented<00:01:41.509> on<00:01:42.430> this<00:01:43.430> part<00:01:43.850> of<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:45.320> front<00:01:45.710> of<00:01:45.920> the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
dented on this part of the front of the

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.469 
dented on this part of the front of the
case<00:01:46.280> or<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.640> front<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.180> side<00:01:47.390> panel<00:01:49.479> it

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
case or the front of the side panel it

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.870 
case or the front of the side panel it
might<00:01:50.869> cause<00:01:51.200> some<00:01:51.229> problems<00:01:52.009> it<00:01:52.280> might<00:01:52.550> not

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
might cause some problems it might not

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.999 
might cause some problems it might not
see<00:01:53.270> right<00:01:53.450> there<00:01:55.720> so<00:01:56.720> we'll<00:01:56.990> see<00:01:57.259> whether<00:01:57.860> or

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
see right there so we'll see whether or

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.730 
see right there so we'll see whether or
not<00:01:58.070> it's<00:01:58.250> going<00:01:58.399> to<00:01:58.490> hold<00:01:59.360> in<00:01:59.539> place<00:01:59.590> like<00:02:00.590> it

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
not it's going to hold in place like it

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.070 
not it's going to hold in place like it
should<00:02:01.179> so<00:02:02.179> that's<00:02:02.360> one<00:02:02.690> dent<00:02:03.560> that<00:02:03.679> I<00:02:03.920> saw<00:02:05.080> see

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
should so that's one dent that I saw see

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.370 
should so that's one dent that I saw see
any<00:02:06.229> scratches<00:02:07.039> on<00:02:07.220> it<00:02:08.380> so<00:02:09.610> let's<00:02:10.610> get<00:02:10.789> the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
any scratches on it so let's get the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.840 
any scratches on it so let's get the
computer<00:02:12.380> case<00:02:12.560> down<00:02:12.830> here<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.370> let's<00:02:13.730> see

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
computer case down here and let's see

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.830 
computer case down here and let's see
how<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.060> looks<00:02:14.240> like<00:02:14.890> stand<00:02:15.890> by<00:02:16.569> all<00:02:17.569> right<00:02:17.720> so

how it looks like stand by all right so

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.270 
how it looks like stand by all right so
there's<00:02:18.020> case<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:18.530> let's<00:02:18.740> go<00:02:18.920> ahead<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.130> get

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
there's case so let's go ahead and get

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:31.920 
there's case so let's go ahead and get
the<00:02:19.460> side<00:02:19.700> panel<00:02:20.030> on

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.149 

not<00:02:32.530> too<00:02:32.709> bad<00:02:34.110> what<00:02:35.110> I<00:02:35.140> like<00:02:35.379> about<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:35.860> side

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
not too bad what I like about this side

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:42.059 
not too bad what I like about this side
panel<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.819> that<00:02:37.659> it's<00:02:38.500> cut<00:02:38.920> out<00:02:39.099> just<00:02:41.069> enough

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
panel is that it's cut out just enough

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.000 
panel is that it's cut out just enough
to<00:02:42.370> where<00:02:42.519> it<00:02:42.670> shows<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.780> actual<00:02:44.140> inside<00:02:44.739> of

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
to where it shows the actual inside of

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.599 
to where it shows the actual inside of
your<00:02:45.129> case<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:46.569> leaves<00:02:46.900> all<00:02:47.409> of<00:02:47.439> your<00:02:47.769> your

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
your case and it leaves all of your your

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.899 
your case and it leaves all of your your
hard<00:02:48.909> drives<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.599> optical<00:02:50.670> drive<00:02:51.670> bays

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
hard drives and optical drive bays

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:56.640 
hard drives and optical drive bays
covered<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.689> you<00:02:52.870> don't<00:02:53.019> see<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:55.650> another

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
covered so you don't see it and another

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.039 
covered so you don't see it and another
thing<00:02:56.769> I<00:02:57.040> like<00:02:57.220> about<00:02:57.250> this<00:02:57.640> case<00:02:57.959> for<00:02:58.959> those

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
thing I like about this case for those

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.300 
thing I like about this case for those
of<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.349> who<00:02:59.470> have<00:02:59.680> this<00:02:59.920> case<00:03:01.349> this<00:03:02.349> original

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
of you who have this case this original

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.830 
of you who have this case this original
side<00:03:03.640> panel<00:03:04.180> is<00:03:04.329> really<00:03:04.859> hard<00:03:05.859> to<00:03:06.040> remove<00:03:06.840> for

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
side panel is really hard to remove for

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.860 
side panel is really hard to remove for
some<00:03:08.049> reason<00:03:08.409> I<00:03:08.530> don't<00:03:08.590> know<00:03:08.769> what<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.220> I

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
some reason I don't know what it is I

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.170 
some reason I don't know what it is I
mean<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.319> gets<00:03:11.470> easier<00:03:11.950> over<00:03:12.430> time<00:03:12.579> to<00:03:12.879> remove

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
mean it gets easier over time to remove

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.000 
mean it gets easier over time to remove
but<00:03:13.540> it's<00:03:13.690> still<00:03:13.900> pretty<00:03:14.200> difficult<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.859> where

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
but it's still pretty difficult to where

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.759 
but it's still pretty difficult to where
you<00:03:15.159> still<00:03:15.370> have<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:15.700> kind<00:03:15.909> of<00:03:15.970> like<00:03:16.500> push<00:03:17.500> in

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
you still have to kind of like push in

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.030 
you still have to kind of like push in
and<00:03:18.189> pull<00:03:18.250> up<00:03:18.909> pull<00:03:19.329> out<00:03:19.480> well<00:03:20.170> with<00:03:20.439> this<00:03:20.709> side

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
and pull up pull out well with this side

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.000 
and pull up pull out well with this side
panel<00:03:21.549> it<00:03:21.790> actually<00:03:22.720> goes<00:03:22.959> in<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.319> it

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
panel it actually goes in and it

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.780 
panel it actually goes in and it
actually<00:03:24.730> goes<00:03:25.329> on<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.870> comes<00:03:26.139> off<00:03:26.790> fairly

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
actually goes on and comes off fairly

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:42.439 
actually goes on and comes off fairly
easy<00:03:28.329> now<00:03:29.760> let<00:03:30.760> me<00:03:30.849> demonstrate<00:03:31.060> it<00:03:31.510> for<00:03:31.720> you

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.039 

just<00:03:43.449> like<00:03:43.599> that

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
just like that

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.390 
just like that
now<00:03:44.500> with<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.829> original<00:03:45.280> side<00:03:45.549> panel<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:47.709> you

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
now with the original side panel you you

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.550 
now with the original side panel you you
had<00:03:48.730> to<00:03:49.000> like<00:03:49.180> kind<00:03:49.510> of<00:03:49.599> push<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:49.930> kind<00:03:50.470> of

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
had to like kind of push and kind of

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.059 
had to like kind of push and kind of
like<00:03:50.799> pull<00:03:51.629> to<00:03:52.629> get<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.959> side<00:03:53.169> panel<00:03:53.560> off<00:03:53.680> but

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
like pull to get the side panel off but

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.610 
like pull to get the side panel off but
this<00:03:54.579> one<00:03:54.819> makes<00:03:55.389> it<00:03:55.540> so<00:03:55.750> much<00:03:55.900> easier<00:03:55.959> to<00:03:56.379> do

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
this one makes it so much easier to do

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.780 
this one makes it so much easier to do
and<00:03:56.980> I<00:03:57.790> think<00:03:58.180> my<00:03:58.989> guess<00:03:59.620> is<00:03:59.980> with<00:04:00.669> the

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
and I think my guess is with the

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.110 
and I think my guess is with the
original<00:04:01.269> side<00:04:01.540> panel<00:04:02.099> the<00:04:03.099> little<00:04:03.819> tabs

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
original side panel the little tabs

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.430 
original side panel the little tabs
right<00:04:04.419> here<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:06.879> way<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.269> was<00:04:07.479> powder<00:04:07.900> coated

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
right here the way it was powder coated

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.939 
right here the way it was powder coated
or<00:04:08.729> probably<00:04:09.729> just<00:04:10.030> because<00:04:10.359> of<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.690> gap<00:04:11.680> in

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
or probably just because of the gap in

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.819 
or probably just because of the gap in
between<00:04:12.069> was<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.790> little<00:04:13.090> bit<00:04:13.209> smaller<00:04:13.829> then

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
between was a little bit smaller then

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.080 
between was a little bit smaller then
these<00:04:15.190> are<00:04:15.519> a<00:04:15.549> little<00:04:15.970> bit<00:04:16.239> closer<00:04:16.810> together

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
these are a little bit closer together

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.659 
these are a little bit closer together
then<00:04:19.090> these<00:04:19.659> little<00:04:19.930> tabs<00:04:20.169> are<00:04:20.409> so<00:04:20.979> I<00:04:21.280> think

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
then these little tabs are so I think

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:22.950 
then these little tabs are so I think
that's<00:04:21.970> what<00:04:22.120> makes<00:04:22.330> this<00:04:22.539> a<00:04:22.599> whole<00:04:22.810> lot

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
that's what makes this a whole lot

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.870 
that's what makes this a whole lot
easier<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.440> put<00:04:23.710> it<00:04:23.770> up<00:04:23.860> put<00:04:23.919> on<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:24.490> take<00:04:24.699> off

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
easier to put it up put on and take off

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.960 
easier to put it up put on and take off
so<00:04:25.330> and<00:04:26.139> another<00:04:26.470> thing<00:04:26.740> I<00:04:26.800> want<00:04:27.010> to<00:04:27.070> know<00:04:27.190> -<00:04:27.250> it

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
so and another thing I want to know - it

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.390 
so and another thing I want to know - it
seems<00:04:28.389> pretty<00:04:28.690> flimsy<00:04:29.139> you<00:04:29.889> know<00:04:30.010> you<00:04:30.099> could

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
seems pretty flimsy you know you could

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.600 
seems pretty flimsy you know you could
you<00:04:31.210> can<00:04:31.419> bend<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.250> stuff<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:33.460> doesn't

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
you can bend it and stuff it doesn't

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.610 
you can bend it and stuff it doesn't
bend<00:04:33.909> all<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.060> way<00:04:34.180> but<00:04:34.570> it<00:04:35.110> just<00:04:35.289> seems<00:04:35.530> like

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
bend all the way but it just seems like

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.930 
bend all the way but it just seems like
it's<00:04:35.889> not<00:04:36.099> really<00:04:36.460> a<00:04:36.490> a<00:04:37.800> well-constructed

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
it's not really a a well-constructed

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.740 
it's not really a a well-constructed
piece<00:04:39.940> of<00:04:40.180> side<00:04:40.389> panel<00:04:41.099> but<00:04:42.099> once<00:04:42.490> it's<00:04:42.669> on

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
piece of side panel but once it's on

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.910 
piece of side panel but once it's on
nonetheless<00:04:43.870> it<00:04:44.490> stays<00:04:45.490> pretty<00:04:45.910> oh<00:04:46.620> it<00:04:47.620> stays

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
nonetheless it stays pretty oh it stays

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:54.990 
nonetheless it stays pretty oh it stays
pretty<00:04:49.620> you<00:04:50.620> know<00:04:53.490> what's<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:54.640> word<00:04:54.850> I'm

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
pretty you know what's the word I'm

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.350 
pretty you know what's the word I'm
looking<00:04:55.030> for<00:04:56.490> you<00:04:57.490> know<00:04:57.520> it<00:04:57.700> doesn't<00:04:57.970> bend<00:04:58.180> as

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
looking for you know it doesn't bend as

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.180 
looking for you know it doesn't bend as
much<00:04:59.370> for<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.400> lack<00:05:00.610> of<00:05:00.640> better<00:05:00.970> words<00:05:01.980> so<00:05:02.980> this

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
much for a lack of better words so this

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.860 
much for a lack of better words so this
computer<00:05:03.700> is<00:05:03.760> pretty<00:05:03.940> much<00:05:04.180> all<00:05:04.360> done<00:05:04.630> you

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
computer is pretty much all done you

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.540 
computer is pretty much all done you
know<00:05:04.960> I<00:05:04.990> mean<00:05:05.230> the<00:05:05.620> only<00:05:05.770> thing<00:05:05.860> I<00:05:06.100> need<00:05:06.280> to<00:05:06.370> do

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
know I mean the only thing I need to do

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.960 
know I mean the only thing I need to do
is<00:05:07.230> really<00:05:08.230> check<00:05:08.530> out<00:05:08.710> what's<00:05:09.430> causing<00:05:09.640> my

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
is really check out what's causing my

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.440 
is really check out what's causing my
high<00:05:10.210> temperatures<00:05:11.010> with<00:05:12.010> the<00:05:12.130> CPU<00:05:12.640> I'm<00:05:13.270> gonna

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
high temperatures with the CPU I'm gonna

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.390 
high temperatures with the CPU I'm gonna
go<00:05:13.570> ahead<00:05:13.660> and<00:05:13.780> double<00:05:14.140> check<00:05:14.170> the<00:05:14.650> does

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
go ahead and double check the does

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.890 
go ahead and double check the does
heatsink<00:05:15.940> and<00:05:16.090> make<00:05:16.240> sure<00:05:16.390> it's<00:05:16.570> actually

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
heatsink and make sure it's actually

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.520 
heatsink and make sure it's actually
completely<00:05:17.730> flat<00:05:18.730> on<00:05:19.030> the<00:05:19.240> CPU<00:05:19.750> I'm<00:05:20.200> making

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
completely flat on the CPU I'm making

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.000 
completely flat on the CPU I'm making
full<00:05:21.100> contact<00:05:21.130> with<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:21.970> CPU<00:05:22.330> and<00:05:22.720> just<00:05:23.590> doing

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
full contact with the CPU and just doing

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.580 
full contact with the CPU and just doing
all<00:05:24.280> other<00:05:24.550> types<00:05:25.090> of<00:05:25.330> tests<00:05:25.750> to<00:05:26.110> see<00:05:26.350> what's

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
all other types of tests to see what's

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.080 
all other types of tests to see what's
going<00:05:26.770> on<00:05:26.950> with<00:05:27.130> the<00:05:27.220> temperatures<00:05:27.640> because

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
going on with the temperatures because

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.180 
going on with the temperatures because
even<00:05:29.020> though<00:05:29.080> if<00:05:29.170> it<00:05:29.260> is<00:05:29.380> stable<00:05:29.620> at<00:05:29.950> 80
