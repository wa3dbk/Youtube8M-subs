00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.630
 I returned 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:18.300
 Okay, you 're out of tune, but I'm missing. 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:25.420
 I returned 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:34.030
 This is what I came back with the 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:38.560
 channel and now with another recipe 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.410
 incredible is Dona 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.500
 those rains there the keys ate 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.430
 all sung by ganda bone interfaces 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.970
 dodo 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:53.890
 then it is strange as it seems is 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:57.700
 only 12,341 suitors and more water 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:01.000
 removing sugar and cinnamon if you do 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:04.920
 so that's it and this recipe practically 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.920
 everything done on the stove 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:25.259
 the staff do not forget take 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.259
 very careful when handling fire 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.569
 these things and if you notice that 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.479
 the stove is in some matches 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.829
 do not notice that I made a prescription 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:42.299
 and it did not work very well 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:48.420
 however we will put water to water and now 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:51.110
 We will put butter in the salt I 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.549
 sugar 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.549
 now we will start to fiddle 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.689
 so the staff uses it like this 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:02.670
 stirring well is fine until you begin to make 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.950
 start was respected 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.599
 I'm talking right now we're going to put 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.970
 the flour where laying so look 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.440
 bit of a stir and 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.440
 putting a little more 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.370
 without stopping to move personnel to download 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.840
 a little fire 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.760
 So, folks, we 're staying. 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.519
 pressing our lady for a few 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.909
 three to five minutes I'm already 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.939
 only four minutes to voice the name of it 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:39.069
 the mass and that's it 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.780
 and we have to keep doing it 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.769
 begin to peel off the pan where the 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.750
 bottom of the pan 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:50.620
 otto also dollar and the pot is getting 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.470
 It's strange but the clothes, but that's the way it is 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.280
 so now the staff is the decrease 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.950
 fire 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.530
 the time I started to knead the dough 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.120
 with the spoon and that's it now we 'll go 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.540
 for from the future 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.239
 So the people there will be picking up the 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.000
 and putting in this business here that 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.799
 I forgot the name is confectioner and there 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.340
 whoever does not have it can take a 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.680
 they cut a little bit know and 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.560
 or making the same kind of clay 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.870
 of modeling and there you look too 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.209
 put it to fry is basically just 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.209
 this is now going to the end result 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:47.189
