of<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.530> dual-screen<00:00:46.950> notebook<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:47.730> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
of a dual-screen notebook with a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.389 
of a dual-screen notebook with a
multi-touch<00:00:48.390> touchpad<00:00:48.829> they<00:00:49.829> had<00:00:50.219> some

and<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:56.309> they<00:00:56.430> brought<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.699> concept<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.180> us<00:00:57.270> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
and so they brought this concept to us a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.420 
and so they brought this concept to us a
few<00:00:57.570> years<00:00:57.750> ago<00:00:57.899> we<00:00:58.649> brought<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.010> into<00:00:59.160> HP

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
few years ago we brought it into HP

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.700 
few years ago we brought it into HP
ultimately<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:00.930> created<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.440> as<00:01:01.680> a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
ultimately and we created this as a

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.260 
ultimately and we created this as a
mobile<00:01:01.980> version<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.550> black<00:01:02.760> for<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.030> same

like the latest ati graphic cards and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.670 
like the latest ati graphic cards and
crossfire<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.689> got<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> quad-core<00:01:10.200> intel

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
because it's a multi-touch touchpad that

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.870 
because it's a multi-touch touchpad that
uses<00:01:39.150> your<00:01:39.829> when<00:01:40.829> gamers<00:01:41.070> play<00:01:41.369> games<00:01:41.700> they

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
uses your when gamers play games they

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.870 
uses your when gamers play games they
use<00:01:42.090> their<00:01:42.299> amount

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
use their amount

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.910 
use their amount
basically<00:01:43.509> right<00:01:43.689> and<00:01:43.930> they<00:01:44.350> have<00:01:44.469> a<00:01:44.500> left

click<00:01:45.039> and<00:01:45.159> a<00:01:45.310> right<00:01:45.490> click<00:01:45.610> when<00:01:45.820> they're

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
click and a right click when they're

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.300 
click and a right click when they're
playing<00:01:46.119> a<00:01:46.210> game<00:01:46.390> so<00:01:46.960> we<00:01:47.079> thought<00:01:47.110> why<00:01:48.070> would

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
playing a game so we thought why would

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.770 
playing a game so we thought why would
we<00:01:48.430> want<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:48.729> put<00:01:48.880> it<00:01:48.969> down<00:01:49.119> here<00:01:49.390> when<00:01:49.539> we<00:01:49.630> can

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
we want to put it down here when we can

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.450 
we want to put it down here when we can
put<00:01:49.899> it<00:01:49.990> here<00:01:50.259> and<00:01:50.590> we<00:01:50.829> use<00:01:51.009> our<00:01:51.130> middle<00:01:51.430> finger

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
put it here and we use our middle finger

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.580 
put it here and we use our middle finger
as<00:01:51.850> a<00:01:51.880> mouse<00:01:52.180> and<00:01:52.479> left<00:01:53.049> click<00:01:53.289> with<00:01:53.439> the<00:01:53.560> left

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
as a mouse and left click with the left

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.810 
as a mouse and left click with the left
finger<00:01:54.009> and<00:01:54.130> right<00:01:54.250> click<00:01:54.399> at<00:01:54.579> the<00:01:54.610> right

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
finger and right click at the right

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.069 
finger and right click at the right
finger<00:01:55.119> so<00:01:55.240> we<00:01:55.360> can<00:01:55.479> actually<00:01:55.600> mouse<00:01:55.869> around

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
finger so we can actually mouse around

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.569 
finger so we can actually mouse around
like<00:01:56.439> it's<00:01:56.619> a<00:01:56.740> you<00:01:56.979> know<00:01:57.070> like<00:01:57.250> your<00:01:57.369> article

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
like it's a you know like your article

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:03.600 
like it's a you know like your article
in<00:01:57.789> a<00:01:57.820> game<00:01:58.030> with<00:01:58.179> it<00:01:59.130> and<00:02:00.130> then<00:02:00.340> it<00:02:00.970> has<00:02:02.610> plenty

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
in a game with it and then it has plenty

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.240 
in a game with it and then it has plenty
of<00:02:03.670> every<00:02:03.939> life<00:02:04.210> nice<00:02:04.840> dislikes<00:02:05.530> like<00:02:05.679> a<00:02:05.710> UPS

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
of every life nice dislikes like a UPS

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.580 
of every life nice dislikes like a UPS
right<00:02:07.000> it's<00:02:07.479> not<00:02:07.659> really<00:02:07.840> a<00:02:07.869> battery<00:02:08.229> we<00:02:08.410> call

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
right it's not really a battery we call

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.589 
right it's not really a battery we call
it<00:02:08.679> an<00:02:08.880> uninterruptible<00:02:09.880> power<00:02:09.910> supply<00:02:10.420> if

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
it an uninterruptible power supply if

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.020 
it an uninterruptible power supply if
you've<00:02:10.720> moved<00:02:10.840> from<00:02:11.050> one<00:02:11.170> room<00:02:11.349> to<00:02:11.410> another

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
you've moved from one room to another

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.790 
you've moved from one room to another
but<00:02:13.030> yeah<00:02:13.150> I<00:02:13.180> mean<00:02:13.420> we<00:02:13.810> wanted<00:02:14.319> to<00:02:14.349> keep<00:02:14.560> sort

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
but yeah I mean we wanted to keep sort

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.600 
but yeah I mean we wanted to keep sort
of<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.920> design<00:02:15.250> language<00:02:15.459> of<00:02:17.370> Blackbird<00:02:18.370> with

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
of the design language of Blackbird with

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.910 
of the design language of Blackbird with
this<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.030> we<00:02:19.930> also<00:02:20.080> took<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.380> power<00:02:20.680> supply

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
this and we also took the power supply

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.350 
this and we also took the power supply
from<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:21.430> like<00:02:21.640> we<00:02:21.849> took<00:02:22.000> some<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.299> the

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
from this like we took some of the

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.150 
from this like we took some of the
innovations<00:02:22.690> from<00:02:22.989> here<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.440> we<00:02:23.739> moved<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.040> to

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
innovations from here and we moved it to

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.860 
innovations from here and we moved it to
our<00:02:24.250> Firebird<00:02:24.670> system<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.480> desktop

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
our Firebird system that the desktop

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.080 
our Firebird system that the desktop
says<00:02:26.049> that<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.349> guys<00:02:26.410> see<00:02:26.680> on<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:26.890> floor<00:02:27.130> so

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
says that you guys see on the floor so

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.030 
says that you guys see on the floor so
we<00:02:28.239> we<00:02:28.989> like<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.260> create<00:02:29.470> things<00:02:29.680> like<00:02:29.890> this

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
we we like to create things like this

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.250 
we we like to create things like this
this<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.489> prototype<00:02:30.790> once<00:02:31.299> again<00:02:31.569> we<00:02:32.110> do

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
this is a prototype once again we do

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.870 
this is a prototype once again we do
tend<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.590> create<00:02:32.890> prototypes<00:02:33.130> every<00:02:33.610> now<00:02:33.730> and

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
tend to create prototypes every now and

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.009 
tend to create prototypes every now and
then<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.150> sometimes<00:02:34.510> we<00:02:34.660> take<00:02:34.780> them<00:02:34.900> to

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
then and sometimes we take them to

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.170 
then and sometimes we take them to
market<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.470> sometimes<00:02:35.769> we<00:02:35.920> don't<00:02:36.180> and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
market and sometimes we don't and

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.660 
market and sometimes we don't and
