has<00:03:15.530> three<00:03:16.010> windows<00:03:16.490> in<00:03:16.760> it<00:03:16.910> obviously<00:03:17.300> we're

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
has three windows in it obviously we're

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.190 
has three windows in it obviously we're
not<00:03:18.290> gonna<00:03:18.500> paint<00:03:18.860> these<00:03:19.070> windows<00:03:19.670> so<00:03:20.200> first

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
not gonna paint these windows so first

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.650 
not gonna paint these windows so first
find<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.680> area<00:03:22.100> of<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.670> big<00:03:22.880> piece<00:03:23.210> the<00:03:23.450> big

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
find the area of the big piece the big

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.380 
find the area of the big piece the big
blue<00:03:23.870> wall<00:03:24.140> by<00:03:25.070> using<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.640> formula<00:03:26.210> of<00:03:26.300> a

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
blue wall by using the formula of a

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:33.180 
blue wall by using the formula of a
rectangle<00:03:27.340> 24<00:03:28.340> times<00:03:28.850> 14<00:03:29.660> feet<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:30.850> gonna<00:03:31.850> be

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
rectangle 24 times 14 feet is gonna be

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.300 
rectangle 24 times 14 feet is gonna be
336<00:03:34.420> square<00:03:35.420> feet<00:03:35.900> we're<00:03:36.709> not<00:03:36.860> gonna<00:03:37.040> paint

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
336 square feet we're not gonna paint

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.130 
336 square feet we're not gonna paint
the<00:03:37.489> windows<00:03:37.880> but<00:03:38.180> we<00:03:38.330> still<00:03:38.570> need<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:38.930> find

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
the windows but we still need to find

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.770 
the windows but we still need to find
the<00:03:39.380> area<00:03:39.560> for<00:03:40.070> all<00:03:40.250> three<00:03:40.580> of<00:03:40.610> them<00:03:40.880> they're

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
the area for all three of them they're

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.780 
the area for all three of them they're
all<00:03:41.959> identical<00:03:42.140> so<00:03:42.890> all<00:03:43.100> I<00:03:43.220> have<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.400> do<00:03:43.640> is

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
all identical so all I have to do is

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.000 
all identical so all I have to do is
find<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.330> area<00:03:44.660> of<00:03:44.780> one<00:03:45.050> window<00:03:45.470> and<00:03:45.920> then

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
find the area of one window and then

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.440 
find the area of one window and then
multiply<00:03:46.550> it<00:03:46.610> by<00:03:46.880> three

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
multiply it by three

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.110 
multiply it by three
each<00:03:48.170> one<00:03:48.440> those<00:03:48.590> are<00:03:48.800> rectangles<00:03:49.459> so<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.790> find

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
each one those are rectangles so to find

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.750 
each one those are rectangles so to find
the<00:03:50.450> area<00:03:50.750> of<00:03:50.840> one<00:03:50.900> window<00:03:51.500> all<00:03:52.130> I<00:03:52.280> have<00:03:52.489> to<00:03:52.610> do

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
the area of one window all I have to do

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.920 
the area of one window all I have to do
is<00:03:52.940> multiply<00:03:53.510> 8<00:03:54.140> by<00:03:54.170> 3<00:03:54.800> and<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.640> get<00:03:55.700> 24<00:03:56.450> square

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
is multiply 8 by 3 and I get 24 square

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.220 
is multiply 8 by 3 and I get 24 square
feet<00:03:57.370> but<00:03:58.370> then<00:03:58.760> I<00:03:59.090> have<00:03:59.239> to<00:03:59.390> multiply<00:03:59.540> by<00:04:00.200> 3

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
feet but then I have to multiply by 3

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.220 
feet but then I have to multiply by 3
again<00:04:00.860> because<00:04:01.280> there's<00:04:01.550> three<00:04:01.850> windows<00:04:02.360> so

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
again because there's three windows so

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.590 
again because there's three windows so
the<00:04:03.560> total<00:04:03.980> surface<00:04:04.550> area<00:04:05.060> for<00:04:05.300> the<00:04:05.330> three

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
the total surface area for the three

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.770 
the total surface area for the three
windows<00:04:06.050> is<00:04:06.320> 72<00:04:06.980> square<00:04:07.430> feet<00:04:07.760> to<00:04:08.480> find<00:04:08.690> my

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
windows is 72 square feet to find my

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.170 
windows is 72 square feet to find my
total<00:04:09.170> surface<00:04:09.380> area<00:04:09.920> it's<00:04:10.459> pretty<00:04:10.610> easy<00:04:10.880> and

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
total surface area it's pretty easy and

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.840 
total surface area it's pretty easy and
I<00:04:11.330> just<00:04:11.510> have<00:04:11.660> to<00:04:11.780> add<00:04:11.959> up<00:04:12.230> all<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.680> areas<00:04:13.100> the

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
I just have to add up all the areas the

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.570 
I just have to add up all the areas the
walls<00:04:14.180> that<00:04:14.450> I<00:04:14.510> have<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:14.930> paint<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:16.070> red<00:04:16.310> wall

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
walls that I have to paint the red wall

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.110 
walls that I have to paint the red wall
the<00:04:16.850> blue<00:04:17.060> wall<00:04:17.299> and<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.780> other<00:04:17.810> red<00:04:18.230> wall<00:04:19.120> so

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
the blue wall and the other red wall so

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.540 
the blue wall and the other red wall so
I'll<00:04:20.570> just<00:04:20.959> add<00:04:21.200> up<00:04:21.230> all<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.950> pieces<00:04:22.220> that<00:04:22.400> I

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
I'll just add up all the pieces that I

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.080 
I'll just add up all the pieces that I
did<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:23.630> 24<00:04:24.410> plus<00:04:26.110> 336<00:04:27.250> for<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.370> blue<00:04:28.610> wall<00:04:28.820> and

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
did to 24 plus 336 for the blue wall and

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.590 
did to 24 plus 336 for the blue wall and
the<00:04:29.270> other<00:04:29.300> wall<00:04:29.750> is<00:04:30.310> 252<00:04:31.310> but<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.360> thing<00:04:32.570> is

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
the other wall is 252 but the thing is

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.409 
the other wall is 252 but the thing is
I'm<00:04:33.320> not<00:04:33.500> going<00:04:33.770> to<00:04:33.860> add<00:04:33.979> 72<00:04:34.789> because<00:04:35.000> I'm<00:04:35.270> not

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
I'm not going to add 72 because I'm not

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.239 
I'm not going to add 72 because I'm not
painting<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:36.020> windows<00:04:36.350> so<00:04:37.010> I

00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:37.249 
painting the windows so I

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:39.219 
painting the windows so I
have<00:04:37.369> to<00:04:37.519> subtract<00:04:38.149> it<00:04:38.419> from<00:04:38.599> my<00:04:38.869> total

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
have to subtract it from my total

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.909 
have to subtract it from my total
surface<00:04:39.469> area<00:04:40.779> make<00:04:41.779> your<00:04:41.929> calculations<00:04:42.709> and

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
surface area make your calculations and

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.169 
surface area make your calculations and
you<00:04:43.039> should<00:04:43.459> get<00:04:43.839> 740<00:04:44.839> square<00:04:45.319> feet<00:04:45.969> meaning<00:04:46.969> I

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:47.179 
you should get 740 square feet meaning I

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:51.899 
you should get 740 square feet meaning I
have<00:04:47.419> to<00:04:47.659> paint<00:04:48.819> 740<00:04:49.819> square<00:04:50.209> feet<00:04:50.509> of<00:04:50.749> my<00:04:51.019> wall

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
have to paint 740 square feet of my wall

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:54.639 
have to paint 740 square feet of my wall
the<00:04:52.909> last<00:04:53.209> step<00:04:53.479> is<00:04:53.689> just<00:04:53.719> to<00:04:53.959> divide<00:04:54.349> it<00:04:54.529> by

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:54.649 
the last step is just to divide it by

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:57.489 
the last step is just to divide it by
300<00:04:55.459> square<00:04:55.909> feet<00:04:56.209> because<00:04:56.839> that's<00:04:57.139> how<00:04:57.379> much

00:04:57.489 --> 00:04:57.499 
300 square feet because that's how much

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:00.339 
300 square feet because that's how much
one<00:04:57.799> gallon<00:04:58.249> covers<00:04:58.699> and<00:04:59.029> I<00:04:59.509> figure<00:04:59.899> out<00:05:00.109> how

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
one gallon covers and I figure out how

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.869 
one gallon covers and I figure out how
many<00:05:00.529> gallons<00:05:00.919> of<00:05:01.129> paint<00:05:01.369> I<00:05:01.639> have<00:05:02.119> to<00:05:02.449> buy<00:05:03.879> 2.46

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:04.879 
many gallons of paint I have to buy 2.46

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.539 
many gallons of paint I have to buy 2.46
repeating<00:05:05.569> I<00:05:05.779> can't<00:05:06.499> buy<00:05:06.709> that<00:05:06.739> amount<00:05:07.399> of

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:07.549 
repeating I can't buy that amount of

00:05:07.549 --> 00:05:09.850 
repeating I can't buy that amount of
paint<00:05:07.819> exactly<00:05:08.509> so<00:05:08.929> I<00:05:08.959> have<00:05:09.229> to<00:05:09.349> round<00:05:09.589> it<00:05:09.679> up

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
paint exactly so I have to round it up

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.119 
paint exactly so I have to round it up
to<00:05:10.009> three<00:05:10.369> gallons<00:05:10.909> in<00:05:11.229> order<00:05:12.229> to<00:05:12.379> paint<00:05:12.679> all

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:13.129 
to three gallons in order to paint all

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:16.790 
to three gallons in order to paint all
three<00:05:13.669> walls<00:05:13.999> of<00:05:14.299> my<00:05:14.539> condo

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
three walls of my condo

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.020 
three walls of my condo
but<00:05:17.699> using<00:05:18.000> Syria<00:05:18.690> you<00:05:19.259> can<00:05:19.500> clearly<00:05:20.190> estimate

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
but using Syria you can clearly estimate

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.390 
but using Syria you can clearly estimate
how<00:05:21.300> much<00:05:21.509> paint<00:05:21.870> you'll<00:05:22.050> need<00:05:22.319> for<00:05:23.069> a<00:05:23.099> project

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
how much paint you'll need for a project

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.050 
how much paint you'll need for a project
session<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:24.569> in<00:05:24.720> your<00:05:24.870> house<00:05:25.610> now<00:05:26.610> use<00:05:26.879> your

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
session and in your house now use your

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.420 
session and in your house now use your

I<00:06:00.749> started<00:06:01.749> by<00:06:01.869> finding<00:06:02.349> the<00:06:02.499> surface<00:06:02.709> area<00:06:03.249> of

00:06:03.359 --> 00:06:03.369 
I started by finding the surface area of

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:06.809 
I started by finding the surface area of
my<00:06:03.549> half<00:06:03.849> circles<00:06:04.389> and<00:06:04.889> since<00:06:05.889> my<00:06:06.039> diameter<00:06:06.610> of

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:06.819 
my half circles and since my diameter of

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.779 
my half circles and since my diameter of
16<00:06:07.329> feet<00:06:07.719> is<00:06:07.899> given<00:06:08.319> to<00:06:08.469> me<00:06:08.649> I<00:06:08.889> know<00:06:09.369> that<00:06:09.669> my

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
16 feet is given to me I know that my

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:14.009 
16 feet is given to me I know that my
radius<00:06:10.179> is<00:06:10.389> 8<00:06:10.599> so<00:06:11.409> I<00:06:11.439> did<00:06:11.799> pi<00:06:12.159> times<00:06:12.909> 8<00:06:13.209> squared

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:14.019 
radius is 8 so I did pi times 8 squared

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:18.659 
radius is 8 so I did pi times 8 squared
times<00:06:14.919> 1/2<00:06:15.539> that<00:06:16.539> equals<00:06:16.989> to<00:06:17.259> 100<00:06:17.889> point<00:06:18.159> 48

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
times 1/2 that equals to 100 point 48

times 1/2 that equals to 100 point 48
square<00:06:19.059> feet<00:06:19.360> and<00:06:20.019> since<00:06:20.439> there's<00:06:20.739> 2<00:06:21.009> of<00:06:21.039> them

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:21.189 
square feet and since there's 2 of them

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:25.679 
square feet and since there's 2 of them
I<00:06:21.610> multiplied<00:06:22.479> it<00:06:22.509> by<00:06:22.719> 2<00:06:22.899> and<00:06:23.489> I<00:06:24.489> got<00:06:24.759> 200<00:06:25.089> point

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:25.689
