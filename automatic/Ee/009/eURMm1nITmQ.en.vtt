00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
next installment will be the best one

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.819 
next installment will be the best one
yet<00:03:59.629> recently<00:04:00.629> we<00:04:00.810> even<00:04:00.989> got<00:04:01.139> some<00:04:01.409> news<00:04:01.590> that

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
yet recently we even got some news that

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.469 
yet recently we even got some news that
the<00:04:01.919> game<00:04:02.069> will<00:04:02.219> not<00:04:02.549> require<00:04:02.969> the<00:04:03.090> use<00:04:03.449> of

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.479 
the game will not require the use of

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.110 
the game will not require the use of
motion<00:04:04.049> controls<00:04:04.409> which<00:04:05.099> makes<00:04:05.370> me<00:04:05.579> very

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
motion controls which makes me very

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.499 
motion controls which makes me very
happy<00:04:06.509> since<00:04:07.049> i<00:04:07.290> don't<00:04:08.129> particularly<00:04:08.909> like

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:09.509 
happy since i don't particularly like

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:12.409 
happy since i don't particularly like
motion<00:04:09.930> based<00:04:10.319> controls<00:04:10.949> so<00:04:11.819> i'm<00:04:11.939> glad<00:04:12.120> they

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
motion based controls so i'm glad they

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.469 
motion based controls so i'm glad they
won't<00:04:12.719> be<00:04:12.870> forced<00:04:13.169> upon<00:04:13.319> me<00:04:13.560> i'd<00:04:14.489> love<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.299> see

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
won't be forced upon me i'd love to see

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.539 
won't be forced upon me i'd love to see
this<00:04:15.599> game<00:04:15.840> in<00:04:16.019> action<00:04:16.169> at<00:04:16.500> e3<00:04:16.620> this<00:04:16.889> year<00:04:17.070> and

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
this game in action at e3 this year and

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.969 
this game in action at e3 this year and
with<00:04:17.639> a<00:04:17.669> 2015<00:04:18.449> release<00:04:18.630> date<00:04:19.019> I<00:04:19.259> would<00:04:19.739> have<00:04:19.949> a

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
with a 2015 release date I would have a

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.589 
with a 2015 release date I would have a
hard<00:04:20.219> time<00:04:20.310> believing<00:04:20.729> that<00:04:21.060> Nintendo

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
hard time believing that Nintendo

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:26.460 
hard time believing that Nintendo
wouldn't<00:04:21.989> show<00:04:22.139> this<00:04:22.320> off<00:04:23.960> number<00:04:24.960> one

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
wouldn't show this off number one

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.470 
wouldn't show this off number one
and<00:04:26.740> now<00:04:27.040> I<00:04:27.070> guess<00:04:27.280> one<00:04:27.520> was<00:04:27.670> probably<00:04:28.240> obvious

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
and now I guess one was probably obvious

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.420 
and now I guess one was probably obvious
