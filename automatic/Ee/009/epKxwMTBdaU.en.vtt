there

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.970 

and<00:03:49.920> just<00:03:50.400> in<00:03:50.490> case<00:03:50.700> more<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.120> is<00:03:51.210> here<00:03:54.980> got

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
and just in case more it is here got

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.620
