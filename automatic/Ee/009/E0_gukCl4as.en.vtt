00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.750
 with this method we see how to change 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.760
 color to anything not only 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.990
 at the police lamborghini we hope 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.639
 that the police do not get angry 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.440
 let's move quickly to the image of 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.439
 departure that was with its color 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.600
 original then the active here we open 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.689
 the levels window from the usual menu 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.080
 window levels and let's start with 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.230
 adding a color correction 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.410
 from the central ball below 15 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.520
 check saturation and lo toning 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.579
 we find in this position up here 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.250
 color saturation hue 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.550
 that we have to the color of the object 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.770
 that we want to change in color 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.829
 we must choose here how much 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.590
 where we find composite his channel 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.719
 or at least that channel that includes i 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.469
 its colors 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:03.899
 we see that the car is blue then 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.150
 re-enters the blue channel but there will be a 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.610
 little bit of return also in the channel 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.630
 chan we start with the blue channel e 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.430
 let's see how fast we can already 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.979
 make the first changes of 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.880
 color what happens naturally is 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.460
 that change the other blue contents 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.640
 in the image therefore if there are others 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.380
 other things that have similar shades 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.299
 the risk is what they too 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.310
 change color but we don't have to 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.159
 to worry about this the first phase is 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.549
 that of changing the color to ours 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.409
 object therefore still seen that in the 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.810
 original spot color falls 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.220
 also in the cianci channel we can also see 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.290
 there is also a flatbed in this case 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.130
 of course then everyone will have their own 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.369
 colors to change and we also carry out 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.040
 here another change we see that if 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.460
 we exaggerate can jump out of the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.210
 artifacts of the disorders therefore 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.820
 attention to how we move to 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.860
 get to colors that you can 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.140
 naturally reach 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.200
 here we have saturation even then 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.240
 we can also increase a little bit 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.340
 what is the initial color too 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.470
 here be careful not to overdo it 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.780
 as easily bust and everything 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.710
 so we stop when we see that 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.000
 things are still acceptable we stop 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.360
 what I said before is the problem 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.630
 of the other elements that have the 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.890
 same colors and on this we intervene 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.860
 quickly on the layer mask 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.420
 that is created automatically with the 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.060
 check that the has been added 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.550
 we activate with a black click color of 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.040
 close up a brush of course 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.959
 suitable for size 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.610
 that we have to take action on 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.610
 let's see what happens 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:03.459
 with the application of the brush 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.670
 if to be careful you see you notice that 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.280
 where i'm working i'm applying one 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.980
 mask here is the meaning is that where 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.319
 I apply the black you see the image below 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.230
 original and I will of course try to 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.530
 do it in those positions where the 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.200
 color took maybe part ha 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.060
 modified part of the image that does not 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.459
 we were interested here the shirt was 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.459
 probably blue I go too 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:34.120
 recover here too 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:37.000
 same thing and if we make a mistake we are not left 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.340
 which invert the foreground colors from 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.609
 black to white eventually recover 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.709
 if we realized we were wrong 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:48.280
 this is a very simple system 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.919
 to change maybe evaluate how it can 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.900
 be our car with another 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.280
 color or change the features to 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.760
 police 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.650
 everyone will want to do what you do 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.629
 will interest here if we want to recover 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.530
 the logo or to show how 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:07.629
 recover a detail 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.239
 in the year reversing naturally 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.680
 laniero bianco activating the mask 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.409
 even here if we want the original logo 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.609
 with a bit of calm and maybe doing more 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.159
 great 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:22.479
 the image to work better myself 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:25.240
 then usually I'm not too crazy 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:28.570
 to not stretch the tutorials too much though 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.150
 we can already see how much it can 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.150
 be quick this system put me there 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.810
 more time explaining it than doing it 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.490
 directly an extra touch for 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.780
 edit a photo as it can 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.070
 be this where there are gods 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.990
 disturbing elements of people 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.590
 around we can add some 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.810
 dynamic with a little intervention 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.139
 so when we finished this 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.030
 operation we can combine this level 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.159
 with the underlying therefore against the a 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.490
 keyboard to combine everything 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:03.280
 we duplicate this level we drag 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.980
 the second icon at the bottom right 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.690
 right click to convert 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.200
 in advanced subject I already have it 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.490
 explained the system for many times 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.680
 apply filters and be able to use them 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.330
 recover if there later 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.169
 we realize we have made some mistakes 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:25.060
 then the filter menu blur response 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.800
 c check the movement effect e 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.490
 let's go to apply 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:37.060
 I apologize is not the movement effect 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:38.050
 but it is radial blur blur filter 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.280
 here it is 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.840
 the movement could also be good 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.820
 however for this for this intervention 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.010
 radial apiculture that to this mask 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.970
 that doesn't preview so we can't 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:54.190
 see what happens with ours 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:57.850
 intervention maybe you adjust a little 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:00.130
 factor check the zoom and confirm by 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.260
 see what happened 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.030
 possibly just as an object 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.310
 advanced can be recovered 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.150
 subsequently because it is applied 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:12.580
 the filter aside here 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.950
 this dynamic effect so applied e 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.530
 we can possibly reduce a little 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.780
 opacity to bring out the photo below 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.150
 or if we want to leave this 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.070
 most obvious explosion we can 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.530
 then apply a layer mask 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.600
 activate the layer a mask of 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:32.190
 third level icon starting from the left 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.990
 still black and again brush 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.169
 round is nuanced and this time of 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.270
 larger sizes 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:42.870
 maybe we open in the central area for 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.070
 recover sharpness and leave 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.560
 the explosion that 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.660
 extend to the outside of the 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.920
 car that here with a bit of calm 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:56.310
 we are able to resume photography 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.310
 original 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.440
 if you want to deepen yours 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.970
 knowledge and improve even more 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.340
 elaborations on your photographs 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:09.370
 take a leap here on my site and there 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:13.380
 are and there are over 400 tutorials 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.380
 exclusive not present on youtube 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.760
 if you liked the tutorial put the 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.860
 I like that it's very important 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.920
