00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:16.600
 It is a concept 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:21.120
 There is a good sound think it is better for us 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:25.890
 Studio master sound Hey 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:34.129
 It is easy to understand for many people 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:34.129
 We made it with the concept of being able to hear in the car interior 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:01.520
 Become a group of professional recording engineers 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:05.030
 Representatively Mr. Tsujii-san or Imai Miki-san or all of the famous Japanese artists 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:09.380
 It is undergoing brocade to say the recording 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.970
 I 'm one of the best recording studio engineers in Japan 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.630
 What 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:20.440
 It 's about a relationship with us 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:21.980
 Since then much emergence from that would be what kind of a good sound is going to say in Musu' and who we 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:28.970
 Think about it 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:30.980
 Among them, the sound of this cd I'm listening to is really recorded 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.350
 I wonder if it comes out the same way 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.460
 I have always been in doubt 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.320
 If it can be done 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:44.790
 Come that Naa want to listen if the the Tteyuu the studio master sound opportunity 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.790
 I have always thought of 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.409
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:02:03.429
 Well the first thing is that the sound is good as we are about good sound 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:10.299
 It does not come to listen to the master sound to them Well studio because say what say 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:11.150
 Actually I was let in in the studio and music at this time in that or 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.440
 Pig version stage 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.030
 I told you 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:22.980
 Or rather Fimini not painful it is also raising much sound 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:27.660
 Say I question and was the first to experience the Tteyuu become noisy is low in these 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:31.920
 At the same time I was able to experience the wonderful thing at the same time 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.460
 When angry at the time of the studio home 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.060
 difference cd and 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:42.080
 I was introduced several songs of Johannes songs 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:47.860
 Stand far from not they heard of the straight 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:52.660
 Well what kind of speakers can be of that kind of place, please this book properly Kikashi 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.660
 I had to advice 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:09.330
 This is it is a still I st micro-lane I have a reputation from previous fet 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:11.520
 We use the burn Pu, which is said to be less noise using from the time it Yeah Fukakusa 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:17.370
 People still the longest good model using 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.040
 It is a part of the tail of the music that I use now, but trace a detailed part well 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.359
 I mean 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.100
 I think I can understand very much by comparing 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:29.880
 Pump is Oh 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.880
 We are allowed to use the thing as a conventional f class at last of the City rice 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:46.620
 First of all, let 's create a foundation on which a master of sound can be made in one flat. 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.430
 There are quite a few stick partners in the specs, but it is 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.530
 After all 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.550
 To Tteyuu blue 10 points will collect it in in the worth system of this strange things 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.540
 It's there after all 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:00.969
 Spic specs even if this is low 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.230
 There is a thing that I am in the house very much and still it is such an experience of the actual person 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:06.489
 Up 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:10.890
 Holding the rear area is not only specs but always work l Cars 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.890
 It will have no way to determine claims 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:27.600
 I will return to the previous story, but tell me the reference cd and the basement and it's big 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.650
 When you sound the band stage by all means 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:36.449
 It is is not uncontrollably point I do Mase is whether there's more descriptive that the amplifier not a no 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:39.509
 The more you go up in the garden, the more bass you hear 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:45.419
 I think that the drance of the well is a trumpet 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:49.409
 There is no possibility that eh would disturb other trombone Toka high potato Notsurupu Huh Huh Toka all 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:52.260
 Do not say Rutte still out bass, but it should 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:57.780
 But there is 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:05:03.630
 I'm flexible condenser worked in was equivalent struggle went back siri back 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:06.960
 But it was way much still last in Well 20 minutes when was about to give up anymore without any 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.800
 But Tteyuu hey condenser people of the manufacturer or let's do this one time 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.790
 By 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.790
 I wrote a bit and I left 

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:36.080
 I'm here till but that 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.539
 Not 's or hate likely to say I do not me to do is to listen to that sort of when I listened to when 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.310
 It is that Tteyuu'm good in this Te 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:47.030
 that 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:51.140
 It was so impressive that it was so impressive to adopt that part so outside 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.449
 Resin to be now let me put the stamp of Splatoon of house 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.509
 Because there was debris 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:06:01.449
 We are allowed to sing in the fire Dharma 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:07.330
 People who really make thin film in Sanraku seem to be a food maker after all 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:09.230
 My sister-in-law's of the other side 's civilization went to that place 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.250
 At this price 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:15.650
 Can be and such come Tteyuu I'd seem to have approached the story or I'll me to do 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:21.290
 It seems to have been from spring 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:26.090
 Longer praised by Panasonic's inn I mean was it not determined is this not a sound and 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.930
 It seems to have been told many times by saying that it is me, but let's say it by running already 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.220
 Hey you don't want to 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:34.740
 After all job popularity quality 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:37.590
 After listening to the story that you are asking me to make it one part, it is after all 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:43.200
 I think 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:48.150
 I felt that it would be interesting to hear this kind of sound next time 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.110
 Even for beginners, there is a song called "Swing 1000 Swing" on that big band stage . 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.760
 but 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:56.760
 Lee of that 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:07:00.660
 Of cod is this glass of Tteyuu uplifting feeling of when it becomes rough It is a drum speed at the time of Inhai 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:04.020
 It is to attract the key and the chamber already in it by say absolute Likes 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:08.090
 I can attract myself 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:11.290
 To say I do not unless we make after all to cherish that sort of a 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.290
 Hit at that time that I mentioned 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.880
 me 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:26.130
 It is difficult if expressed in words 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.390
 Well still many users also in the do Strada of it is speaking in that acquisition that house 

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:33.000
 Because there is 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:36.840
 There is a function called that srs, but after all the sound image is raised and lowered or the bass as an example 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.870
 It seems that there is a function of releasing 

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:44.230
 It is not such a concept that the function is just a master of sound 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:49.500
 Rather than being real, I feel that air 

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:55.100
 Each song has a feeling that the singer has the air 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:08:01.200
 The creator can tell you something that you really want to tell 

00:07:55.100 --> 00:08:04.010
 Because it is finished to such a sound of the subject mainly making a sound, it is always with a movie 

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.010
 We visually
