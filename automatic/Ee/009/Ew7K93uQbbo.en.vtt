want to know more about it well we have

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.570 
want to know more about it well we have
this<00:00:18.660> new<00:00:19.170> great<00:00:19.380> protein<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.920> called<00:00:19.949> classic

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
this new great protein is called classic

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.939 
this new great protein is called classic
plus<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.300> when<00:00:21.930> we<00:00:22.020> talk<00:00:22.230> about<00:00:22.260> somewhere

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
plus and when we talk about somewhere

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.640 
plus and when we talk about somewhere
that<00:00:23.279> we<00:00:23.369> do<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:24.050> create<00:00:25.050> products<00:00:25.529> that

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
that we do is we create products that

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.339 
that we do is we create products that
are<00:00:26.099> used<00:00:27.000> three<00:00:27.240> filters<00:00:27.480> which<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.080> raw

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
are used three filters which is raw

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.220 
are used three filters which is raw
being<00:00:28.949> an<00:00:29.130> organic<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.390> everything<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.869> do<00:00:30.990> is

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
being an organic so everything we do is

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.790 
being an organic so everything we do is
the<00:00:31.769> only<00:00:32.520> way<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.790> go<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.660> what<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.620> we

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
the only way to go so what we do is we

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.920 
the only way to go so what we do is we
use<00:00:34.980> for<00:00:35.670> different<00:00:35.850> kinds<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.300> proteins<00:00:36.660> we

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
use for different kinds of proteins we

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.680 
use for different kinds of proteins we
use<00:00:37.050> organic<00:00:37.230> p<00:00:37.739> organic<00:00:38.610> rice<00:00:38.850> organic<00:00:39.510> to

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
use organic p organic rice organic to

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.650 
use organic p organic rice organic to
law<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.140> Morgana<00:00:40.950> camera<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.329> tastes

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
law and Morgana camera and it tastes

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.600 
law and Morgana camera and it tastes
amazing<00:00:42.770> that's<00:00:43.770> number<00:00:43.950> one<00:00:44.250> which<00:00:44.579> is

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
amazing that's number one which is

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.420 
amazing that's number one which is
number<00:00:44.969> one<00:00:45.300> that's<00:00:45.719> right<00:00:45.890> what<00:00:46.890> happens<00:00:47.309> is

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
number one that's right what happens is

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.069 
number one that's right what happens is
that<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.879> used<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.149> be<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> industry<00:00:48.870> they

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
that it used to be the industry they

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.470 
that it used to be the industry they
would<00:00:49.260> produce<00:00:49.559> proteins<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.670> work<00:00:50.820> okay

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
would produce proteins it work okay

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.869 
would produce proteins it work okay
tasty<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.289> decided<00:00:52.860> as<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.129> want<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.430> make<00:00:53.550> this

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
tasty we decided as we want to make this

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.970 
tasty we decided as we want to make this
really<00:00:54.090> go<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> school<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.350> got<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.800> much

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
really go to school and it's got so much

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.920 
really go to school and it's got so much
good<00:00:56.219> stuff<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.840> a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
good stuff in it and it's like it's a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.660 
good stuff in it and it's like it's a
reasonable<00:00:58.530> price<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.039> think<00:00:59.070> compared<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.640> a

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
reasonable price I think compared to a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.790 
reasonable price I think compared to a
lot<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.910> protein<00:01:00.300> powders<00:01:00.690> absolutely<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
lot of protein powders absolutely and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.170 
lot of protein powders absolutely and
that's<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.340> other<00:01:02.430> thing<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.940> we

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
that's the other thing is that we

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.460 
that's the other thing is that we
actually<00:01:03.210> produce<00:01:03.719> products<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.379> are

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
actually produce products that are

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.450 
actually produce products that are
affordable

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
affordable

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.160 
affordable

tribe that they have isn't more your
tribe<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.440> sense<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.979> community<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.700> they

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
tribe a sense of community that they

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.719 
tribe a sense of community that they
filled<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.650> know<00:01:22.770> our<00:01:22.979> members<00:01:23.490> have

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
filled and you know our members have

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.399 
filled and you know our members have
talked<00:01:24.000> about<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.240> guys<00:01:24.330> all<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.780> time<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
talked about you guys all the time you

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.570 
talked about you guys all the time you
know<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.740> think<00:01:25.920> that's<00:01:26.070> really<00:01:26.220> really

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
know and I think that's really really

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.310 
know and I think that's really really
important<00:01:27.119> what<00:01:27.840> are<00:01:27.960> some<00:01:27.990> other<00:01:28.229> things

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
important what are some other things

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.020 
important what are some other things
that<00:01:28.590> set<00:01:28.890> apart<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.340> Sun<00:01:29.550> warrior<00:01:29.850> from

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
that set apart like Sun warrior from

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.210 
that set apart like Sun warrior from
other<00:01:30.330> brands<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.740> most<00:01:31.860> important

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
other brands one of the most important

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.730 
other brands one of the most important
things<00:01:32.399> is<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.640> we're<00:01:33.330> still<00:01:33.630> family<00:01:34.290> owned

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
things is that we're still family owned

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.530 
things is that we're still family owned
and<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.159> two<00:01:35.280> people<00:01:35.399> that<00:01:35.610> started<00:01:36.090> Sun

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
and the two people that started Sun

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.930 
and the two people that started Sun
warriors<00:01:36.960> still<00:01:37.259> own<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.490> think<00:01:38.700> that

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
warriors still own it and I think that

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.210 
warriors still own it and I think that
