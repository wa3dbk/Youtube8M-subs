00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
thermo that yeah the thermostat sits so

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.110 
thermo that yeah the thermostat sits so
it<00:02:48.000> seals<00:02:48.269> right<00:02:49.280> kind<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.340> just<00:02:50.519> wipe<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.940> out

it seals right kind of just wipe it out
there<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.420> little<00:02:51.630> bit

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
there a little bit

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.570 
there a little bit
are<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.680> actually<00:02:52.830> what<00:02:53.099> you<00:02:53.190> could<00:02:53.340> do<00:02:53.459> is

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
are you actually what you could do is

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.150 
are you actually what you could do is
put<00:02:53.700> your<00:02:53.880> hose<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.330> there<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.690> shoot<00:02:54.959> out<00:02:55.170> put

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
put your hose in there and shoot out put

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.530 
put your hose in there and shoot out put
your<00:02:56.190> hose<00:02:56.459> nozzle<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.000> there<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.269> should<00:02:57.450> just

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
your hose nozzle in there it should just

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.320 
your hose nozzle in there it should just
Peet<00:02:57.810> right<00:02:58.019> out<00:02:58.230> there<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:59.790> let's<00:02:59.970> put<00:03:00.180> this

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
Peet right out there so let's put this

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.580 
Peet right out there so let's put this
thermostat<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:01.200> there<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:03.540> we'll<00:03:04.140> be<00:03:04.170> good<00:03:04.530> to

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
thermostat in there and we'll be good to

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.559 
thermostat in there and we'll be good to
go<00:03:04.739> there<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.790> new<00:03:05.940> ones<00:03:06.120> just<00:03:06.269> going<00:03:06.510> to

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
go there so the new ones just going to

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.509 
go there so the new ones just going to
fit<00:03:06.750> in<00:03:06.870> like<00:03:07.049> that<00:03:07.610> just<00:03:08.610> pop<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:09.000> in<00:03:09.120> there

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
fit in like that just pop it in there

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.920 
fit in like that just pop it in there
I'll<00:03:11.519> zoom<00:03:11.880> in<00:03:12.090> there<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.299> little<00:03:12.450> bit<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:12.840> we

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
I'll zoom in there a little bit so we

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.350 
I'll zoom in there a little bit so we
get<00:03:13.049> a<00:03:13.080> little<00:03:13.319> bit<00:03:13.470> better<00:03:14.150> new<00:03:15.150> one<00:03:15.330> just

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
get a little bit better new one just

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.150 
get a little bit better new one just
pops<00:03:15.750> right<00:03:15.989> in<00:03:16.140> there<00:03:16.290> like<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.470> we're

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
pops right in there like that we're

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.850 
pops right in there like that we're
going<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.370> pull<00:03:17.519> out<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.849> new<00:03:18.030> seal<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:19.769> the
