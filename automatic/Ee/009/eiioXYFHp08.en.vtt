00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.059 
and you riffle the cards and you leave
the<00:01:53.580> four<00:01:53.789> aces<00:01:53.940> on<00:01:54.179> top<00:01:54.440> right<00:01:55.440> so<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.830> leave

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
the four aces on top right so you leave

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:57.559 
the four aces on top right so you leave
the<00:01:56.190> Foresters<00:01:56.580> on<00:01:56.670> top<00:01:56.880> when<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.090> riffle<00:01:57.420> I

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
the Foresters on top when you riffle I

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.809 
the Foresters on top when you riffle I
actually<00:01:57.899> teach<00:01:58.289> this<00:01:58.590> shuffle<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.490> the

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
actually teach this shuffle in the

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.960 
actually teach this shuffle in the
description<00:02:00.360> below<00:02:00.479> okay<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.380> then<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.459> did<00:02:02.670> an

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
description below okay and then I did an

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.910 
description below okay and then I did an
extra<00:02:03.360> different<00:02:03.720> cut<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.080> realize<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.740> I

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
extra different cut I realize this I

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.309 
extra different cut I realize this I
actually<00:02:05.280> cut<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.880> deck<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.899> way<00:02:07.110> and

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
actually cut the deck like this way and

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.099 
actually cut the deck like this way and
I've<00:02:07.950> actually<00:02:08.100> taught<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.910> cut<00:02:09.209> before<00:02:09.630> you

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:10.109 
I've actually taught this cut before you

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:12.680 
I've actually taught this cut before you
can<00:02:10.259> learn<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.649> inside<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.730> description<00:02:12.060> area

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
can learn it inside the description area

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.930 
can learn it inside the description area
I've<00:02:13.049> actually<00:02:13.200> taught<00:02:13.470> this<00:02:13.590> before<00:02:13.739> so<00:02:14.489> then

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
I've actually taught this before so then

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.569 
I've actually taught this before so then
I<00:02:14.970> do<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.299> shuffle<00:02:15.630> then<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:15.959> do<00:02:16.019> the<00:02:16.200> cut<00:02:16.579> the

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
I do the shuffle then I do the cut the

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.150 
I do the shuffle then I do the cut the
fake<00:02:17.850> cut<00:02:18.090> right<00:02:19.049> and<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.709> doesn't<00:02:19.980> matter<00:02:20.070> if

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
fake cut right and it doesn't matter if

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.099 
fake cut right and it doesn't matter if
it's<00:02:20.340> messy<00:02:20.549> as<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.850> said<00:02:21.030> again<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.900> fake

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
it's messy as I said again so the fake

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.979 
it's messy as I said again so the fake
cut<00:02:22.380> once<00:02:23.100> again<00:02:23.340> face<00:02:23.670> up<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.180> looks<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.750> bit

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
cut once again face up it looks a bit

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.140 
cut once again face up it looks a bit
more<00:02:25.260> obvious<00:02:25.350> but<00:02:25.890> because<00:02:26.400> you're<00:02:26.940> just

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
more obvious but because you're just

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.729 
more obvious but because you're just
cutting<00:02:27.329> over<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.750> cards<00:02:28.019> like<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.350> and

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
cutting over the cards like this and

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.610 
cutting over the cards like this and
you're<00:02:29.489> dropping<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.000> bottom<00:02:30.269> pack<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.810> then

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
you're dropping the bottom pack and then

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.199 
you're dropping the bottom pack and then
dropping<00:02:32.040> these<00:02:32.250> on<00:02:32.430> top<00:02:32.670> but<00:02:32.850> if<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.000> do<00:02:33.120> it

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
dropping these on top but if you do it

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.840 
dropping these on top but if you do it
fast<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.840> looks<00:02:33.959> very<00:02:34.230> natural<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.609> it<00:02:35.700> looks

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
fast it looks very natural and it looks

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.120 
fast it looks very natural and it looks
like<00:02:36.030> you've<00:02:36.209> just<00:02:36.480> cut<00:02:37.109> the<00:02:37.260> cards<00:02:37.650> it's<00:02:37.859> very

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
like you've just cut the cards it's very

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.840 
like you've just cut the cards it's very
convincing

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
convincing

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.569 
convincing
of<00:02:39.090> course<00:02:39.359> these<00:02:39.540> four<00:02:39.750> races<00:02:40.079> and<00:02:40.230> not<00:02:40.579> makes

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
of course these four races and not makes

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.430 
of course these four races and not makes
up<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:42.450> once<00:02:42.660> again<00:02:42.750> if<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.930> want<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.079> detailed

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
up so once again if you want a detailed

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.720 
up so once again if you want a detailed
explanation<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.070> move<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:44.519> in<00:02:44.640> the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
explanation of that move it's in the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.360 
explanation of that move it's in the
video<00:02:44.970> below<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.780> do<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.989> fake<00:02:46.170> cut<00:02:46.410> right

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
video below so you do the fake cut right

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.180 
video below so you do the fake cut right
and<00:02:47.579> then<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.150> say<00:02:48.329> all<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.540> do<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:49.109> I<00:02:49.769> have<00:02:50.010> to

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
and then you say all I do is I have to

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.559 
and then you say all I do is I have to
work<00:02:50.340> but<00:02:50.459> if<00:02:50.549> I<00:02:50.670> get<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.940> cards<00:02:51.329> it's<00:02:51.480> a

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
work but if I get the cards it's a

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.870 
work but if I get the cards it's a
presentation<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.380> think<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.890> said<00:02:53.310> but<00:02:53.640> if<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.790> get

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
presentation I think I said but if I get

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.430 
presentation I think I said but if I get
the<00:02:54.120> cards<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.569> take<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.840> cards<00:02:55.140> what<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.319> do

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
it because there's a story when you put

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.479 
it because there's a story when you put
a<00:03:13.810> story<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.349> your<00:03:14.439> magic<00:03:14.650> trick<00:03:14.860> anyways<00:03:15.280> it

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
makes the presentation strong I'm not

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.960 
makes the presentation strong I'm not
saying<00:03:17.290> every<00:03:18.040> magic<00:03:18.340> trick<00:03:18.370> should<00:03:18.670> have<00:03:18.939> a

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
saying every magic trick should have a
