00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.840
 did you know that the development of banjo bots 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.720
 It was created carefree 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.640
 in fact the final product had nothing 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.829
 what to do with the initial product trader 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.690
 named the new suite invoice title 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.239

 of banja tweet that followed on nintendo 64 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.980
 they even showed a demo test in the 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.440
 space world of 2000 without any kind of 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.210
 name just to please the fans of 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.280
 that errare had thought about publishing a 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.290
 new title and it's here where things 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.629
 the strange ones begin in September of 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.969
 Year 2002 rare was purchased by Microsoft 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.160
 the purchase included the properties 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.899
 intellectuals of radware as a scholarship or 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.820
 conquer between multiple games 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.619
 nintendo were canceled so that 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.600
 errare could work in games to 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.399
 the xbox and so we know this 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.170
 also included pando that I uploaded the 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.550
 rare developers and communicated 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.190
 is working on a game called 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.289
 district of twist however the project 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.009
 He could not be carried out even though 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.110
 there was no light 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.179
 external sources got the code 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.890
 of the game and inside it found new 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.500
 devices like shoes with 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.910
 docks backpack rocket metal pens 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.960
 aviator caps chocolates 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.060
 visibility 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.159
 and a diamond peak also 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.170
 they included objects imported from games 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.780
 like the driver byte edulis or live piñata 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.940
 both games developed for xbox that 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.740
 they ended up dating for xbox 360 so 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.509
 all this would make sense in the chat of 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.300
 the community with several people over 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.729
 the gray series is a key programmer of 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.500
 the franchise revealed that the lazio bots 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.960
 it was the third attempt to make cloth 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.790
 blue 3 the first ideas were reaction 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.920
 the game with very bizarre changes and 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.360
 unexpected something similar to how 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.759
 they remade the counter game 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.320
 futuver and an example of this was a 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.300
 termite queen at the top of the first 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.220
 level of courtyard that flowed boombox from 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.110
 time making conga lostran 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.519
 oranges left and right the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.290
 next idea was a game of 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.000
 traditional platforms with which the witch 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.140
 auto utility pursued our partner 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 of heroes for each level 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.190
 trying to destroy them in every scenario 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.870
 the sectionals betas of the champ bots 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.269
 they were so complicated that it was almost 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.920
 impossible to tell where I was left x without 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.260
 However, there is something that we can do 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.000
 be safe in 2004 another started to 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.100
 work in a game called bank that 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.989
 schumi when this name was published 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.690
 people thought it was the title the 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.500
 development of the 2005 banjo game for 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.300
 they 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.400
 it was really a racing game 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.380
 thought for xbox the approach of the game 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.180
 was to build their own vehicles with 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.950
 different parts and then put to 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.110
 run your own creations without 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.210
 However, the game was stored and the 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.800
 concept was implemented in nacho world 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.390
 when the developers were given 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.430
 account that the levels were very large 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.080
 to walk them on foot they did 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.180
 that the project was redone 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.800
 completely with vehicles in mind the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.650
 titles for this game include a 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.050
 banjo dudi banjo kazooie 3 and banjo 3 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.360
 all of these suggest that both 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.090
 arose from the idea of ​​banjo tui a 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.090
 traditional 3d platform as well as banjo 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.370
 kazooie iván youtube like you have 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.410
 lost now we solve the mess 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.390
 Manuel Ruiz was presented at the space work 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.970
 as a demonstration video but 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.700
 Microsoft bought it and created banjo x 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.180
 banjo katsumi and finally van jones 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.000
 samples 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.709
 you knew taking the case initially I was going 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.659
 to be a super nintendo game called 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.790
 project turin focused on a job 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.769
 called edition and banjo was a character 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.230
 secondary that resembled a bear 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.480
 generic there was also an idiot dog and 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.400
 a rabbit the game was delaying more 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.680
 than expected and decided to move the 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.989
 Super Nintendo Project to Nintendo 64 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.120
 the main character in the game is 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.189
 changed the rabbit was actually changed in 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.019
 several times until the paper is 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.639
 he gave it to a bear called rooster without 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.069
 mention that the main argument 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:00.079
 took a radical change that blue was not 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.510
 imported from the project trim but it appeared 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.280
 like a baby inside a nest in his 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.560
 own house the real enemies of the 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.540
 game was a pirate band led 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.730
 for a captain called black eyed from 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.500
 fact there is a plate reference in the 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.450
 bathing suit that blue at the level of 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.430
 matt monsters stain his portrait comes out 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.259
 behind a treasure chest appeared 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.840
 again on a banjo tui level 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:23.120
 repeating and again and again once had 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.889
 a dream in reference to project and 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.320
 talking about a bear that would have stolen 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.940
 his glory in reference to bath taking 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.620
 the spotlights and leaving the captain black 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.020
