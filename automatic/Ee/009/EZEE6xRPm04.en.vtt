00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
face and looking right at it I don't

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.480 
face and looking right at it I don't
think<00:04:30.690> it<00:04:31.020> really<00:04:31.200> evens<00:04:31.680> out<00:04:31.770> my<00:04:31.950> skin<00:04:32.220> tone

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
think it really evens out my skin tone

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.460 
think it really evens out my skin tone
the<00:04:32.790> only<00:04:32.970> discoloration<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:33.960> I<00:04:34.020> have<00:04:34.260> on<00:04:34.440> my

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
the only discoloration that I have on my

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.310 
the only discoloration that I have on my
face<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:35.190> just<00:04:35.580> my<00:04:36.000> under-eye<00:04:36.600> circles<00:04:36.990> with

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
face is just my under-eye circles with

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.220 
face is just my under-eye circles with
the<00:04:37.350> rest<00:04:37.680> of<00:04:37.860> my<00:04:37.980> skin<00:04:38.190> tone<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:38.730> I<00:04:39.720> feel<00:04:39.990> like

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
the rest of my skin tone and I feel like

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.370 
the rest of my skin tone and I feel like
it<00:04:40.440> kind<00:04:40.740> of<00:04:41.210> minimized<00:04:42.210> it<00:04:42.480> a<00:04:42.570> little<00:04:42.960> bit<00:04:43.170> but

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
it kind of minimized it a little bit but

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.290 
it kind of minimized it a little bit but
nothing<00:04:43.470> too<00:04:43.950> drastic<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.670> I<00:04:44.700> don't<00:04:45.120> need<00:04:45.240> to

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
nothing too drastic that I don't need to

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.600 
nothing too drastic that I don't need to
apply<00:04:45.810> concealer<00:04:46.140> or<00:04:46.800> foundation<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:47.460> cover

apply concealer or foundation to cover

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.090 
apply concealer or foundation to cover

out my skin to him I would not wear this
for<00:04:53.970> that<00:04:54.150> reason<00:04:54.660> but<00:04:55.530> looking<00:04:56.130> at<00:04:56.310> the

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
for that reason but looking at the

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.520 
for that reason but looking at the
mirror<00:04:57.000> I<00:04:57.090> can<00:04:57.240> really<00:04:57.570> see<00:04:57.870> that<00:04:58.140> it<00:04:58.260> did

mirror I can really see that it did
minimize<00:04:58.950> my<00:04:59.250> pores<00:04:59.610> because<00:05:00.360> I<00:05:00.390> do<00:05:00.600> have

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
like the neutral scent because it

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.650 
like the neutral scent because it
reminds<00:05:22.350> me<00:05:22.500> of<00:05:22.590> my<00:05:22.830> suave<00:05:23.190> advanced<00:05:23.940> therapy

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
reminds me of my suave advanced therapy

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.450 
reminds me of my suave advanced therapy
lotion<00:05:25.140> and<00:05:25.350> this<00:05:25.440> is<00:05:25.590> just<00:05:25.830> no<00:05:26.070> scent<00:05:26.370> just

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
lotion and this is just no scent just

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.020 
lotion and this is just no scent just
like<00:05:26.730> a<00:05:26.880> regular<00:05:27.390> white<00:05:28.080> cream<00:05:28.740> lotion<00:05:29.520> and

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
like a regular white cream lotion and

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.080 
like a regular white cream lotion and
that<00:05:30.210> is<00:05:30.420> what<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.230> think<00:05:32.010> it<00:05:32.280> smells<00:05:32.550> like<00:05:32.850> and

it<00:05:33.180> has<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.390> same<00:05:33.540> texture<00:05:33.900> but<00:05:34.170> this<00:05:34.260> is<00:05:34.410> a

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
it has the same texture but this is a

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.470 
it has the same texture but this is a
little<00:05:34.770> bit<00:05:34.860> heavier<00:05:35.160> but<00:05:35.370> it<00:05:35.850> does<00:05:36.060> have<00:05:36.330> that

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
little bit heavier but it does have that

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.480 
little bit heavier but it does have that
