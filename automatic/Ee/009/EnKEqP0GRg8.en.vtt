00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
somewhere but as soon as I got these I

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.569 
somewhere but as soon as I got these I
did<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> review<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.110> them<00:00:55.230> there's<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.280> lot<00:00:56.430> of

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
did a review on them there's a lot of

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.599 
did a review on them there's a lot of
creasing<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> back<00:00:57.649> you<00:00:58.649> know<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.039> 23<00:00:59.520> is

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
creasing on the back you know the 23 is

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.840 
creasing on the back you know the 23 is
actually<00:00:59.940> not<00:01:00.090> too<00:01:00.270> bad<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.780> still<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.850> it's

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
actually not too bad but still it's it's

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.500 
actually not too bad but still it's it's
not<00:01:03.000> really<00:01:03.239> all<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.390> wide<00:01:04.700> or<00:01:05.700> tall<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:06.479> it

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
not really all that wide or tall as it

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.830 
not really all that wide or tall as it
is<00:01:06.630> wide<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.760> that's<00:01:08.760> basically<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.479> about

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
is wide so that's basically just about

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.469 
is wide so that's basically just about
the<00:01:10.020> only<00:01:10.200> fix<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.619> haven't<00:01:11.010> done<00:01:11.180> actually<00:01:12.180> on

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the only fix I haven't done actually on

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.980 
the only fix I haven't done actually on
the<00:01:12.659> insides<00:01:13.189> I've<00:01:14.189> got<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> 2012<00:01:15.240> Jordans

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the insides I've got the 2012 Jordans

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.200 
the insides I've got the 2012 Jordans
and<00:01:16.259> these<00:01:16.890> are<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.100> flowers<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:17.970> make

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
and these are the flowers of these make

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.109 
and these are the flowers of these make
them<00:01:18.330> super<00:01:18.689> comfortable<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.400> do<00:01:20.400> wear<00:01:20.670> 11<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
them super comfortable I do wear 11 and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.690 
them super comfortable I do wear 11 and
a<00:01:21.180> half<00:01:21.390> 12<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:22.049> depending<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.560> size<00:01:22.799> this

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
a half 12 just depending on size this

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.100 
a half 12 just depending on size this
makes<00:01:23.939> them<00:01:24.060> fit<00:01:24.210> really<00:01:24.479> comfortable<00:01:24.930> there

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
makes them fit really comfortable there

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.780 
makes them fit really comfortable there
there<00:01:25.439> are<00:01:25.530> 13<00:01:25.890> there<00:01:26.040> probably<00:01:26.310> about<00:01:26.640> a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
there are 13 there probably about a

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.340 
there are 13 there probably about a
whole<00:01:26.970> size<00:01:27.210> small<00:01:27.570> anyway<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:27.990> they'd

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
whole size small anyway so they'd

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.830 
whole size small anyway so they'd
probably<00:01:28.470> fit<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:28.890> 11<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.490> half<00:01:29.840> with

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
probably fit like 11 and a half with

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.210 
probably fit like 11 and a half with
these<00:01:30.990> insoles<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.650> them<00:01:31.799> because<00:01:32.040> they're

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
didn't even stitch it back so it seems

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.990 
didn't even stitch it back so it seems
