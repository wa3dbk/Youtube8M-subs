Swift<00:00:34.460> tutorial<00:00:35.460> something<00:00:36.239> similar<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.660> it

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
Swift tutorial something similar to it

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.680 
Swift tutorial something similar to it
and<00:00:37.500> basically<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.090> want<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.390> do<00:00:39.540> it's

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
and basically what you want to do it's

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.450 
and basically what you want to do it's
really<00:00:39.960> easy<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.590> just<00:00:40.829> kind<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.070> flip<00:00:41.309> your

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
really easy is just kind of flip your

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.229 
really easy is just kind of flip your
hair<00:00:41.700> over<00:00:43.340> so<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.489> kind<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.760> all<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
hair over so it's kind of all on the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.920 
hair over so it's kind of all on the
side<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.500> going<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.739> work<00:00:46.860> best<00:00:46.920> for

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
side and this is going to work best for

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.160 
side and this is going to work best for
longer<00:00:48.930> hair<00:00:49.140> or<00:00:49.350> if<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.890> extensions<00:00:50.879> in

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
longer hair or if you have extensions in

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.200 
longer hair or if you have extensions in
and<00:00:52.370> then<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.430> will<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:53.670> get<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.059> little

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
and then it will just get it a little

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.080 
and then it will just get it a little
bit<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.480> texture<00:00:55.399> if<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.730> want<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.940> leave

bit of texture if you just want to leave

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.119 
bit of texture if you just want to leave
a<00:00:57.149> few<00:00:57.510> pieces<00:00:58.070> down<00:00:59.090> for<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.300> side<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.199> then

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
a few pieces down for the side and then

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.740

volume kind of stays gather it and the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:22.039 
volume kind of stays gather it and the

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.859 

and<00:01:47.290> then<00:01:47.560> you<00:01:47.860> can<00:01:48.040> I<00:01:48.310> use<00:01:48.640> any<00:01:48.939> kind<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.450> hair

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
look a little cleaner I suggest using

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.910 
look a little cleaner I suggest using
the<00:01:57.700> elastic<00:01:58.240> hair<00:01:58.420> ties<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:59.380> are<00:01:59.439> clear<00:02:01.920> see

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
the elastic hair ties that are clear see

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.160

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.900 
that I'm just secured securing here and
then<00:02:11.170> this<00:02:11.200> crazy<00:02:11.769> piece<00:02:12.160> that's<00:02:12.489> here<00:02:12.730> you

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
then this crazy piece that's here you

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.400 
then this crazy piece that's here you
can<00:02:13.090> kind<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.390> pull<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.720> down<00:02:13.900> here<00:02:14.170> if<00:02:14.290> you
