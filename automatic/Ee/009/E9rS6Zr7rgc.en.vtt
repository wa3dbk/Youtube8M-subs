what is anabolic estrogen is anabolic

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.770 
what is anabolic estrogen is anabolic
estrogen<00:04:28.010> is<00:04:28.130> found<00:04:28.400> in<00:04:28.520> meat<00:04:28.790> and<00:04:28.820> dairy<00:04:29.030> fish

estrogen is found in meat and dairy fish

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.140 
estrogen is found in meat and dairy fish
or<00:04:30.350> animals<00:04:31.100> have<00:04:31.250> estrogens<00:04:31.850> when<00:04:32.030> you're

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160

gain<00:04:57.140> and<00:04:57.650> then<00:04:58.070> you<00:04:58.160> have<00:04:58.340> more<00:04:58.550> insulin<00:04:59.450> from

extra<00:05:00.290> fat<00:05:00.620> and<00:05:00.650> protein<00:05:01.370> so<00:05:01.760> you<00:05:01.880> have<00:05:02.060> this

extra fat and protein so you have this

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.530

is<00:05:54.350> a<00:05:54.590> lot<00:05:55.490> of<00:05:55.610> that<00:05:55.990> so<00:05:56.990> it's<00:05:57.080> quite

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
is a lot of that so it's quite

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.810 
is a lot of that so it's quite
