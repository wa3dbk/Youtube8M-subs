00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.740
 it seems that for killer whales hunting is easy 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.180
 but it's not the secret to your success is 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.180
 they do it all as a family 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.550
 a young orca will need 15 years or more 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.690
 in learning from his mother the techniques of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.690
 hunting and other skills 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.550
 these killer whales develop slowly and 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.200
 they live as long as we do thanks 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.910
 to the French scientists who have 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.310
 focused on this family for more than 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.680
 20 years we are beginning to understand 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.670
 how much time and effort does the species put 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.670
 to teach their young 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.960
 to this little playful female of the film 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.699
 of 14 years has one more summer left for 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.149
 learn to become a 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.149
 predatory 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.570
 by house killers 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.340
 our family spends the summer in half 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.490
 from one end of South Africa and the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.120
 Antarctic, monitoring the coasts of 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.120
 crozet islands 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.759
 this inhospitable uninhabited land nothing 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.610
 except a few small deposits 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.450
 volcanic is in the path of 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.759
 the storms 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.710
 in bad weather days the winds 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.320
 they go through the extensive ones without control 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.240
 oceans reaching 120 miles by 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.710
 hour until they hit these islands 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.710
 causing strong waves 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.810
 the only safe place is in 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.040
 some protected beaches inhabited by 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.040
 penguins and elephant seals 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.700
 landing on the shore is dangerous for 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.700
 a young girl here 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.070

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.390
 Bellows are weak just have 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.390
 forces to move his tail 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.890
 must reflide humanity by 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.870
 dehydration 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.819
 being very young several killer whales 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.819
 crozet have perished in this way 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.459

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.470
 young man in his family might be the 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.300
 strong swell or curiosity about 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.280
 penguins what made this female 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.550
 adventurous get too close to the 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.550
 shore 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.090
 whatever the cause is your family

 he will not abandon those pitiful ones 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.340
 bellows will attract them quickly to their 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.340
 side

 Dolphin must do more than mint 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.650
 it has to work closely his 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.650
 mother really 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.680
 the that raises its dorsal fin showing 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.530

 tries harder hunching is 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.159
 with all his strength

 no sun and encourages and gradually as 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.600
 that a dolphin caterpillar moves towards 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.600
 ahead 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.740
 so they can touch each other 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.959
 the and they are turning their own tail to join 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.290
 to her daughter and with her she encourages 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.290

 little brood was left stranded and was 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.900
 rescued by French scientists 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.370
 since that day the whole family trusts 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.910
 of the approaching scuba divers 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.910
 too 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.110
 scientists are not supposed to just 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.219
 anthropomorphic people still agree 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.919
