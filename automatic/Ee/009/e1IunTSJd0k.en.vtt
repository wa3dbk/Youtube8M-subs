00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.060
 The purpose of this tutorial is to administer 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.510
 put a list and TV with the respective 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.620
 programming logos of the channels in the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.360
 code 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:19.070
 Therefore, they should require a TV 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.390
 live in general must put on activated 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.970
 will travel for being a message to say 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.099
 that has no predict active on ok 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.500
 computer to select the customer 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.649
 want to use for this should they 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:39.469
 position pr ptb with 5 on file 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:44.820
 let's invite ebola in general 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:48.120
 Let's put the belt on that will be 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:54.899
 type used in the video description is like this 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.610
 with all the data in this tutorial in your 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.190
 ct 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:13.200
 let's also equate a position 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:15.500
 Remote is to receive later on 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.060
 the structure is also in production 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.250
 you can check out this little movie 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.810
 I did and it will now twist the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.450
 in the relationship 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.130
 programming is also there 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.470
 provide a link with which he had 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.470
 explaining the structure of this smell 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.110
 for the game and I could put the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.850
 organization of our computer ready 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:50.759
 football will be distracted assets that gift 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.759
 things there is not the description of the video 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.770
 we just have to re-enter the cone 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.870
 can see is because it is a loading 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.690
 18 channels that noggin and the list and 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:39.450
 you are importing information from the 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:42.760
 programming channels channels 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:56.580
 we can see that already looks the same reason 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:56.580
 the channels are in the same channel 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:19.420
 system 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:31.079
 the coffee approval of the mall and almost 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:31.079
 fool the channel 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:56.510
 the tender this way the same Tony the 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.900
 conflict are leaving comment on the video 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.560
 do not forget to subscribe to the channel 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.560
 to the next
