00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260 

place<00:00:00.149> I<00:00:00.480> tend<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:01.050> make<00:00:01.410> it<00:00:01.589> flare<00:00:02.340> out<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:03.149> the

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
place I tend to make it flare out to the

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.630 
place I tend to make it flare out to the
back<00:00:03.480> wider<00:00:03.899> and<00:00:04.319> when<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:04.500> dig<00:00:04.770> out<00:00:04.920> this<00:00:05.220> I'll

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
back wider and when I dig out this I'll

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.419 
back wider and when I dig out this I'll
make<00:00:06.000> it<00:00:06.150> flare<00:00:06.450> toward<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:06.990> center<00:00:07.400> so<00:00:08.400> that

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
make it flare toward the center so that

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.339 
make it flare toward the center so that
the<00:00:08.790> wood<00:00:09.000> is<00:00:09.179> thicker<00:00:09.540> than<00:00:09.929> it<00:00:10.200> actually

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
the wood is thicker than it actually

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.990 
the wood is thicker than it actually
looks<00:00:10.920> because<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.370> want<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.670> be<00:00:11.730> nice<00:00:11.940> and

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
looks because you want it to be nice and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.160 
looks because you want it to be nice and
elegant<00:00:12.360> looking<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.759> side<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:15.240> Stella<00:00:15.960> got

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
elegant looking on the side I Stella got

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.080 
elegant looking on the side I Stella got
a<00:00:16.230> small<00:00:16.560> nice<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.279> thing<00:00:17.640> but<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.880> want<00:00:18.029> it

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
a small nice and thing but you want it

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.609 
a small nice and thing but you want it
to<00:00:18.210> flare<00:00:18.480> out<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.050> wood<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.350> thicker

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
to flare out so the wood is thicker

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.130 
to flare out so the wood is thicker
where<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.980> peg<00:00:20.160> will<00:00:20.340> be<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.900> that<00:00:21.900> will<00:00:22.020> make

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
where the peg will be and that will make

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.810 
where the peg will be and that will make
it<00:00:22.289> last<00:00:22.850> for<00:00:23.850> centuries<00:00:25.699> that's<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
it last for centuries that's the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.759 
it last for centuries that's the
interesting<00:00:27.060> thing<00:00:27.539> about<00:00:27.570> violin<00:00:28.529> making

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
interesting thing about violin making

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.650 
interesting thing about violin making
it's<00:00:29.279> been<00:00:29.429> around<00:00:29.670> for<00:00:29.910> centuries<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.630> they

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
it's been around for centuries and they

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.620 
it's been around for centuries and they
the<00:00:33.660> ones<00:00:33.870> being<00:00:34.079> made<00:00:34.350> today<00:00:34.559> or<00:00:35.480> will<00:00:36.480> be

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
the ones being made today or will be

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.500 
the ones being made today or will be
around<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.320> long<00:00:37.380> time<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.520> that's<00:00:39.329> why<00:00:39.480> i

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
around for a long time so that's why i

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.869 
around for a long time so that's why i
like<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.899> make<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.800> best<00:00:41.309> instrument<00:00:41.850> i

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
like to make the best instrument i

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.569 
like to make the best instrument i
possibly<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.690> one<00:00:43.680> other<00:00:43.829> interesting<00:00:44.070> thing

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
possibly can one other interesting thing

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.190 
possibly can one other interesting thing
about<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.940> violin<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:45.719> one<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.050> only

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
about the violin it's one of the only

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.250 
about the violin it's one of the only
instruments<00:00:46.980> that's<00:00:47.579> even<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.570> glue<00:00:48.870> that

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
instruments that's even the glue that

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.610 
instruments that's even the glue that
you<00:00:49.590> use<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.280> made<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.239> be<00:00:51.539> taking<00:00:51.989> up<00:00:52.140> taken

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
you use is made to be taking up taken

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.189 
you use is made to be taking up taken
apart<00:00:52.980> now<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.730> use<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> hide<00:00:54.420> glue<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.989> this

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
apart now I use a hide glue with this

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.110 
apart now I use a hide glue with this
which<00:00:55.410> comes<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.800> granules<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.670> cook<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.030> up

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
which comes in granules and I cook it up

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.720 
which comes in granules and I cook it up
every<00:00:57.420> day<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.660> know<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.230> glue<00:00:58.440> pot<00:00:58.730> and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
every day you know in a glue pot and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
every day you know in a glue pot and
what<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.270> glue<00:01:00.570> does<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.170> instead<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.750> some

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
what this glue does is instead of some

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.899 
what this glue does is instead of some
of<00:01:03.840> today's<00:01:04.140> glue<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.920> butt<00:01:05.159> glue<00:01:05.489> that

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
of today's glue it's a butt glue that

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.469 
of today's glue it's a butt glue that
goes<00:01:06.150> together<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.750> makes<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.049> very<00:01:07.290> hard<00:01:07.680> seal

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
goes together and makes a very hard seal

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.950 
goes together and makes a very hard seal
right<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:09.630> places<00:01:10.080> like<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.070> seams<00:01:11.960> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
right at places like like the seams the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.830 
right at places like like the seams the
high<00:01:13.140> glue<00:01:13.530> kind<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.610> has<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> tendril<00:01:15.420> effect

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
high glue kind of has a tendril effect

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.140 
high glue kind of has a tendril effect
into<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> wood<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.280> scene<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.790> actually

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
into the wood and the scene can actually

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.450 
into the wood and the scene can actually
be<00:01:18.270> broken<00:01:18.720> fairly<00:01:19.229> easy<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.799> that's<00:01:20.250> how

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
be broken fairly easy and that's how

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.390 
be broken fairly easy and that's how
these<00:01:21.030> instruments<00:01:21.570> will<00:01:21.900> last<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.830> long<00:01:23.280> time

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
these instruments will last a long time

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.890 
these instruments will last a long time
because<00:01:23.759> there's<00:01:24.000> nothing<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.600> can't<00:01:24.840> be

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
because there's nothing that can't be

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.039 
because there's nothing that can't be
repaired<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.400> taken<00:01:26.759> apart<00:01:27.049> repaired

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
repaired it can be taken apart repaired

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.249 
repaired it can be taken apart repaired
put<00:01:28.439> back<00:01:28.619> together<00:01:29.659> everywhere<00:01:30.659> everywhere

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
put back together everywhere everywhere

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.740 
put back together everywhere everywhere
that<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.590> use<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.040> glue<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.939> can<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.570> can

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that you use the glue you can you can

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.469 
that you use the glue you can you can
take<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:35.100> blocks<00:01:35.400> if<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.729> need<00:01:35.970> new<00:01:36.119> blocks

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
take the blocks if you need new blocks

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.969 
take the blocks if you need new blocks
or<00:01:37.430> you<00:01:38.430> can<00:01:38.579> repair<00:01:38.939> cracks<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.630> back<00:01:39.979> so

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
or you can repair cracks in the back so

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.649 
or you can repair cracks in the back so
that's<00:01:41.310> how<00:01:41.579> they<00:01:41.729> last<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.240> long<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.630> that

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
that's how they last so long is that

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.859 
that's how they last so long is that
they<00:01:42.960> can<00:01:43.140> be<00:01:43.229> taken<00:01:43.560> apart<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.630> repaired<00:01:45.630> so

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
they can be taken apart and repaired so

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.050 
they can be taken apart and repaired so
when<00:01:46.320> people<00:01:46.590> bring<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:47.040> violin<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.790> looks

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
when people bring in a violin that looks

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.840 
when people bring in a violin that looks
like<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.509> been<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.960> Attic<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.850> 200

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
like it's been in the Attic for 200

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.679 
like it's been in the Attic for 200
years<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.509> probably<00:01:51.630> has<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:53.360> has<00:01:54.360> fallen

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
years and probably has and has fallen

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.590 
years and probably has and has fallen
apart<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.680> warped<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.399> everything<00:01:56.759> else<00:01:56.939> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
apart and warped and everything else and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.899 
apart and warped and everything else and
they<00:01:58.049> say<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.619> fix<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.369> say<00:01:59.610> of

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
they say can you fix it and I say of

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
that will protect it against the

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
and you can see how this is kind of a V

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.380 
and you can see how this is kind of a V
up<00:05:31.810> into<00:05:32.200> up<00:05:32.470> into<00:05:33.039> the<00:05:33.160> back<00:05:33.370> and<00:05:33.669> this<00:05:34.180> is<00:05:34.360> a
