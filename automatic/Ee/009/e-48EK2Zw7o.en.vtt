get it you'll get a high ball flight not
much<00:00:30.480> penetration<00:00:30.859> you'll<00:00:31.859> lose<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> lot<00:00:32.250> of

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
much penetration you'll lose a lot of

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.970 
much penetration you'll lose a lot of
distance<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.809> if<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.559> what<00:00:34.950> I
