00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.040
 casting trunk as a threat to

 officially since those are the rules 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.470
 of the site but it is clear that the 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.670
 government is not going to expel a singer 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.900

 world of video games and neither sony nor 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.900
 Microsoft have been afraid to name 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.180
 the competition when it comes to offering 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.769

 microsoft in the middle of the last 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.379

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.940
 He was hoping to avenge one 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.430
 recent campaign in big business 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.709
