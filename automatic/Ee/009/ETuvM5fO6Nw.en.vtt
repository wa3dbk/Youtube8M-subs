as a tariff in and it's just lazy as a

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.089 
as a tariff in and it's just lazy as a
Terrapin<00:02:45.660> but<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.140> thing<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.319> when<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:46.829> rabbit

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
Terrapin but the thing is when a rabbit

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.360
