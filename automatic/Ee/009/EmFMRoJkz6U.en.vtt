00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
got to think most of these mixtapes have

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.530 
got to think most of these mixtapes have
budgets<00:02:41.890> on<00:02:42.130> them<00:02:42.340> they're<00:02:42.549> not<00:02:42.850> mix<00:02:43.239> tapes

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
budgets on them they're not mix tapes

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.140 
budgets on them they're not mix tapes
they're<00:02:43.750> free<00:02:44.200> albums<00:02:45.069> a<00:02:45.370> lot<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:45.819> times

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
they're free albums a lot of times

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.789 
they're free albums a lot of times
lately<00:02:46.480> also<00:02:46.959> have<00:02:47.080> something<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.380> do<00:02:47.530> with<00:02:47.709> it

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
lately also have something to do with it

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.920 
lately also have something to do with it
so<00:02:47.980> it's<00:02:48.040> not<00:02:48.190> like<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.640> artist<00:02:49.360> is<00:02:49.540> entirely

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930
