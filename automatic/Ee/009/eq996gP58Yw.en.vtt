00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
some reason all right now let's build

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:08.030 
some reason all right now let's build
our<00:00:01.770> first<00:00:02.040> neighborhood<00:00:06.500> let's<00:00:07.500> take<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.770> look

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
our first neighborhood let's take a look

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.740 
our first neighborhood let's take a look
all<00:00:08.429> right<00:00:08.580> so<00:00:08.730> we're<00:00:08.849> gonna<00:00:08.910> build<00:00:09.210> probably

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
all right so we're gonna build probably

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.890 
all right so we're gonna build probably
from<00:00:09.990> up<00:00:10.280> here<00:00:14.240> there<00:00:15.240> we<00:00:15.330> go<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:15.660> our<00:00:15.780> first

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
from up here there we go so our first

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.220 
from up here there we go so our first
neighborhoods<00:00:16.379> gonna<00:00:16.560> be<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.800> here<00:00:21.020> let's<00:00:22.020> see

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
neighborhoods gonna be in here let's see

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.320 
neighborhoods gonna be in here let's see
how<00:00:22.380> far<00:00:22.680> if<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.250> don't<00:00:23.430> want<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.640> use<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:24.000> if

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
how far if you don't want to use this if

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.200 
how far if you don't want to use this if
you<00:00:24.390> don't<00:00:24.900> think<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.410> judge<00:00:26.130> how<00:00:26.760> far

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
you don't think you can judge how far

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.720 
you don't think you can judge how far
out<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.990> by<00:00:28.260> just<00:00:28.470> looking<00:00:28.590> at<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.099> we

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
out that is by just looking at it and we

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.460 
out that is by just looking at it and we
can<00:00:29.760> measure<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.210> up<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:30.720> right<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.320> can

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
can measure it up so it's right you can

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.749 
can measure it up so it's right you can
actually<00:00:31.619> see<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:31.949> little<00:00:32.099> cactus<00:00:32.309> right

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
actually see that little cactus right

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.630 
actually see that little cactus right
there<00:00:33.260> that<00:00:34.260> shows<00:00:34.530> us<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.739> max<00:00:35.070> density<00:00:35.550> is

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
there that shows us the max density is

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.280 
there that shows us the max density is
we're<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:35.880> hovering<00:00:36.300> over<00:00:36.570> there<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.140> could

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
we're just hovering over there you could

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.470 
we're just hovering over there you could
also<00:00:37.590> plop<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.890> park<00:00:38.510> up<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.870> Nature<00:00:40.739> Park<00:00:40.980> there

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
also plop a park up a Nature Park there

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.270 
also plop a park up a Nature Park there
right<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.989> that'll<00:00:43.530> actually<00:00:44.010> show<00:00:44.219> you

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
right here and that'll actually show you

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.970 
right here and that'll actually show you
the<00:00:44.370> max<00:00:45.059> width<00:00:45.660> as<00:00:45.930> well<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.530> if<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.770> need

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
the max width as well so if you need

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.260 
the max width as well so if you need
something<00:00:47.280> concrete<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:48.090> show<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> way

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
something concrete to show you the way

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.189 
something concrete to show you the way
what<00:00:51.270> we're<00:00:51.390> gonna<00:00:51.480> do<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.809> we're<00:00:51.930> gonna<00:00:51.989> make

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna make

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.450 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna make
sure<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:52.350> plop<00:00:52.649> water<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:54.770> and<00:00:55.770> power<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
sure we plop water and and power and

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.549 
sure we plop water and and power and
sewage<00:00:56.820> right<00:00:57.030> now<00:00:57.239> before<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.260> run<00:00:58.410> out<00:00:58.530> of

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
sewage right now before we run out of

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.470 
sewage right now before we run out of
money<00:01:01.430> wind<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> good<00:01:02.789> starter<00:01:03.180> cuz<00:01:03.329> it's

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
money wind is a good starter cuz it's

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.390 
money wind is a good starter cuz it's
really<00:01:03.719> cheap<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:06.979> don't<00:01:07.979> know<00:01:08.040> how<00:01:08.100> much<00:01:08.189> wind

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
really cheap I don't know how much wind

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.320 
really cheap I don't know how much wind
they're<00:01:08.580> gonna<00:01:08.729> get<00:01:08.850> down<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> ravine

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
they're gonna get down in the ravine

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.840 
they're gonna get down in the ravine
there<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.020> don't<00:01:10.080> think<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.439> matters<00:01:10.850> our

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
there but I don't think it matters our

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.270 
there but I don't think it matters our
simcity<00:01:12.299> only<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.600> PC<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.470> don't<00:01:14.010> think<00:01:14.189> they

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
simcity only for PC I don't think they

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.690 
simcity only for PC I don't think they
have<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> console<00:01:15.030> version<00:01:15.060> yet<00:01:16.460> I'm<00:01:17.460> glad

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
have a console version yet I'm glad

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.950 
have a console version yet I'm glad
you're<00:01:17.820> enjoying<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.210> Toki<00:01:18.390> I'm<00:01:18.600> using<00:01:18.780> a

little bit more interactive than my my

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.249 
little bit more interactive than my my
chatters<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> beginning<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:21.869> I'm<00:01:21.990> trying

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259

had wrecked or somebody had requested it

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.770 
had wrecked or somebody had requested it
yesterday<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.330> all<00:01:27.330> right<00:01:27.420> what<00:01:27.509> we're<00:01:27.659> gonna

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
yesterday so all right what we're gonna

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.120 
yesterday so all right what we're gonna
do<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.049> we're<00:01:28.140> gonna<00:01:28.200> start<00:01:28.530> with<00:01:28.619> medium

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
do is we're gonna start with medium

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.010 
do is we're gonna start with medium
density<00:01:29.520> now<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:29.909> better<00:01:30.119> just<00:01:30.360> go<00:01:30.630> with<00:01:30.810> low

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
density now it's better just go with low

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.440 
density now it's better just go with low
density<00:01:31.369> as<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.700> see<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.060> bottom<00:01:33.210> of

medium density road right there and now
we<00:02:13.040> have<00:02:13.280> grids<00:02:13.610> for<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.450> medium<00:02:14.720> density

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
we have grids for the medium density

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.290 
we have grids for the medium density
roads<00:02:17.830> boom<00:02:18.830> perfect<00:02:19.250> now<00:02:19.910> remember<00:02:20.150> what<00:02:20.270> I

measurement<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.890> how<00:02:31.010> far<00:02:31.280> our<00:02:31.430> zone<00:02:31.670> is<00:02:31.880> right

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
measurement of how far our zone is right

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:40.120 
measurement of how far our zone is right
past<00:02:32.960> that<00:02:33.230> there<00:02:36.850> all<00:02:37.850> right
