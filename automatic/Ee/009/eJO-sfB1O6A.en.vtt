00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
is a little different that you might

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.740 
is a little different that you might
notice<00:03:51.590> as<00:03:51.830> I'm<00:03:51.950> blinking<00:03:52.430> my<00:03:52.610> lashes<00:03:53.390> seemed

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
notice as I'm blinking my lashes seemed

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.630 
notice as I'm blinking my lashes seemed
to<00:03:53.900> be<00:03:53.989> sticking<00:03:54.470> sticking<00:03:55.070> together<00:03:55.220> for

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
to be sticking sticking together for

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.970 
to be sticking sticking together for
like<00:03:55.730> a<00:03:55.760> few<00:03:55.970> seconds<00:03:56.540> um<00:03:56.720> maybe<00:03:57.590> it<00:03:57.739> needs<00:03:57.890> to

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
like a few seconds um maybe it needs to

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.320 
like a few seconds um maybe it needs to
drive<00:03:58.190> a<00:03:58.220> little<00:03:58.580> bit<00:03:58.700> longer<00:03:58.820> but<00:03:59.180> that's

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
drive a little bit longer but that's

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.880 
drive a little bit longer but that's
definitely<00:03:59.870> definitely<00:04:00.440> a<00:04:00.650> little<00:04:00.709> bit

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
definitely definitely a little bit

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.320 
definitely definitely a little bit
different<00:04:01.130> feeling<00:04:01.400> I've<00:04:01.820> never<00:04:02.030> had<00:04:02.209> my

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
different feeling I've never had my

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.540 
different feeling I've never had my
mascara<00:04:02.780> I<00:04:02.840> kind<00:04:03.020> of<00:04:03.080> stick<00:04:03.470> and<00:04:03.709> kind<00:04:04.310> of<00:04:04.340> pull

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
mascara I kind of stick and kind of pull

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.630 
mascara I kind of stick and kind of pull
up<00:04:04.670> my<00:04:04.790> bottom<00:04:04.970> lashes<00:04:05.300> so<00:04:06.310> yeah<00:04:07.310> that's<00:04:07.550> a

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
up my bottom lashes so yeah that's a

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.670 
up my bottom lashes so yeah that's a
little<00:04:07.670> different<00:04:08.000> but<00:04:08.270> I<00:04:08.540> think<00:04:09.320> once<00:04:09.530> that

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
little different but I think once that

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.530 
little different but I think once that
goes<00:04:09.860> away<00:04:10.040> I<00:04:10.160> will<00:04:10.489> really<00:04:11.090> like<00:04:11.209> them<00:04:11.390> at

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
goes away I will really like them at

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.540 
goes away I will really like them at
this<00:04:11.780> mascara<00:04:12.200> I<00:04:12.530> think<00:04:13.100> just<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.340> way<00:04:13.459> it

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
this mascara I think just the way it

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.100 
this mascara I think just the way it
feels<00:04:13.700> is<00:04:13.970> something<00:04:14.239> that<00:04:14.330> you<00:04:14.480> really<00:04:14.720> have

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
feels is something that you really have

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.590 
feels is something that you really have
to<00:04:15.320> get<00:04:15.440> used<00:04:15.709> to<00:04:15.980> but<00:04:16.489> I<00:04:16.760> am<00:04:17.120> actually<00:04:17.390> really

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
to get used to but I am actually really

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.940 
to get used to but I am actually really
really<00:04:17.989> really<00:04:18.260> impressed<00:04:18.680> with<00:04:18.769> this

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
really really impressed with this

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.320 
really really impressed with this
mascara<00:04:19.489> I<00:04:20.169> think<00:04:21.220> like<00:04:22.220> I<00:04:22.280> keep<00:04:22.850> saying<00:04:22.910> you

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
mascara I think like I keep saying you

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.580 
mascara I think like I keep saying you
would<00:04:23.570> just<00:04:23.690> have<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.020> get<00:04:24.110> used<00:04:24.320> to<00:04:24.500> the

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
would just have to get used to the

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.490 
would just have to get used to the
feeling<00:04:24.860> of<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.730> stickiness<00:04:26.270> of<00:04:26.330> this<00:04:26.780> but

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
feeling of the stickiness of this but

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.900 
feeling of the stickiness of this but
once<00:04:27.650> it's<00:04:27.830> set<00:04:28.160> like<00:04:28.400> I<00:04:28.520> don't<00:04:28.580> feel<00:04:28.760> the

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
once it's set like I don't feel the

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.030 
once it's set like I don't feel the
stickiness<00:04:29.330> now<00:04:29.540> the<00:04:30.260> stickiness<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:30.919> the

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
stickiness now the stickiness of the

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.370 
stickiness now the stickiness of the
mascara<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:31.790> then<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.720> feeling<00:04:33.080> of<00:04:33.169> like

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
mascara and then the feeling of like

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.930 
mascara and then the feeling of like
you're<00:04:33.500> putting<00:04:33.680> cotton<00:04:34.070> or<00:04:34.400> like<00:04:34.520> feathers

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
you're putting cotton or like feathers

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.270 
you're putting cotton or like feathers
or<00:04:35.120> something<00:04:35.450> directly<00:04:35.750> onto<00:04:36.080> your<00:04:36.290> eye<00:04:36.320> it's

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
or something directly onto your eye it's

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.130 
or something directly onto your eye it's
a<00:04:37.370> little<00:04:37.850> just<00:04:38.390> strange<00:04:38.750> it's<00:04:38.990> just

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
a little just strange it's just

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.450 
a little just strange it's just
something<00:04:39.470> I'm<00:04:39.560> not<00:04:39.710> used<00:04:39.770> to<00:04:40.010> but<00:04:40.190> I<00:04:40.220> think<00:04:40.400> I

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
something I'm not used to but I think I

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.490 
something I'm not used to but I think I
could<00:04:40.669> definitely<00:04:40.850> get<00:04:41.330> used<00:04:41.390> to<00:04:41.660> it<00:04:41.840> within<00:04:42.440> a

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
could definitely get used to it within a

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.680 
could definitely get used to it within a
matter<00:04:42.620> of<00:04:42.740> a<00:04:42.919> week<00:04:43.030> if<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.180> was<00:04:44.300> getting<00:04:44.570> these

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
matter of a week if I was getting these

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.180 
matter of a week if I was getting these
long<00:04:44.960> lashes<00:04:45.200> every<00:04:45.530> single<00:04:45.770> day<00:04:45.860> because<00:04:45.980> I'm

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
long lashes every single day because I'm

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.340 
long lashes every single day because I'm
really<00:04:46.610> have<00:04:46.880> super<00:04:47.390> long<00:04:47.419> lashes<00:04:47.780> to<00:04:48.080> begin

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
really have super long lashes to begin

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.320 
really have super long lashes to begin
with<00:04:48.530> so<00:04:48.830> you<00:04:49.430> know<00:04:49.550> this<00:04:49.669> is<00:04:49.850> so<00:04:50.030> much<00:04:50.180> faster

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
with so you know this is so much faster

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
with so you know this is so much faster
than<00:04:50.540> applying<00:04:50.840> false<00:04:51.260> lashes<00:04:51.440> I<00:04:51.919> don't<00:04:52.100> think

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
than applying false lashes I don't think

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.580 
than applying false lashes I don't think
it's<00:04:54.350> going<00:04:54.530> to<00:04:54.620> give<00:04:54.710> you<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:54.890> same

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
it's going to give you the same

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.770 
it's going to give you the same
is<00:04:55.680> that<00:04:56.010> the<00:04:56.160> fall<00:04:56.370> lashes<00:04:56.880> like<00:04:57.030> strips<00:04:57.510> will

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
is that the fall lashes like strips will

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.690 
is that the fall lashes like strips will
you<00:04:57.990> know<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.260> way<00:04:58.350> they<00:04:58.530> just<00:04:58.740> look<00:04:58.860> thick

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
you know the way they just look thick

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.910 
you know the way they just look thick
throughout<00:05:00.030> that<00:05:00.210> line<00:05:00.450> I<00:05:00.720> don't<00:05:01.440> see<00:05:01.800> myself

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
throughout that line I don't see myself

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.250 
throughout that line I don't see myself
getting<00:05:02.280> it<00:05:02.520> this<00:05:02.730> from<00:05:03.000> this<00:05:03.330> mascara<00:05:03.870> but

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
getting it this from this mascara but

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.980 
getting it this from this mascara but
the<00:05:04.440> length<00:05:04.710> is<00:05:04.980> where<00:05:05.460> I<00:05:05.790> really<00:05:06.300> see<00:05:06.510> a<00:05:06.540> huge

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
the length is where I really see a huge

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.920 
the length is where I really see a huge
difference<00:05:07.080> um<00:05:07.950> I<00:05:08.700> don't<00:05:09.240> believe<00:05:09.630> you<00:05:09.810> know

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
around but definitely or even that long

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.700 
around but definitely or even that long

think this is the mascara for you I

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.620 
think this is the mascara for you I
think<00:06:01.620> this<00:06:02.010> works<00:06:02.430> wonderfully<00:06:03.150> for<00:06:03.390> people

think this works wonderfully for people

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.680 
think this works wonderfully for people
who<00:06:03.720> have<00:06:03.960> shorter<00:06:04.440> lashes<00:06:04.950> like<00:06:05.160> I<00:06:05.310> do<00:06:05.690> who

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
who have shorter lashes like I do who

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.300 
who have shorter lashes like I do who
are<00:06:06.780> really<00:06:07.110> looking<00:06:07.230> for<00:06:07.650> some<00:06:07.770> length<00:06:08.010> and

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
are really looking for some length and

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.000 
are really looking for some length and
don't<00:06:08.880> want<00:06:09.030> to<00:06:09.090> look<00:06:09.180> too<00:06:09.240> fake<00:06:09.810> I<00:06:10.110> think<00:06:10.890> that

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
don't want to look too fake I think that

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.440 
don't want to look too fake I think that
this<00:06:11.160> would<00:06:11.370> be<00:06:11.400> perfect<00:06:11.700> for<00:06:12.030> you<00:06:12.150> but<00:06:12.360> if

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
this would be perfect for you but if

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.150 
this would be perfect for you but if
you're<00:06:12.660> somebody<00:06:12.930> who's<00:06:13.170> looking<00:06:13.500> for<00:06:13.530> just

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
you're somebody who's looking for just

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.070 
you're somebody who's looking for just
thickness<00:06:14.730> and<00:06:15.030> really<00:06:15.420> trying<00:06:15.600> to<00:06:15.690> fill<00:06:15.900> out

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
thickness and really trying to fill out

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.800 
thickness and really trying to fill out
your<00:06:16.110> already<00:06:16.680> long<00:06:16.950> lashes<00:06:17.220> I<00:06:17.640> don't<00:06:18.210> I<00:06:18.720> don't

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
your already long lashes I don't I don't

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.240 
your already long lashes I don't I don't
think<00:06:19.140> this<00:06:19.200> would<00:06:19.380> be<00:06:19.470> the<00:06:19.560> mascara<00:06:19.950> for<00:06:20.130> you

think this would be the mascara for you
