you<00:01:35.439> know<00:01:35.530> let's<00:01:35.710> jump<00:01:35.950> up<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.340> couple<00:01:36.549> octaves

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
you know let's jump up a couple octaves

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:45.300 
you know let's jump up a couple octaves
check<00:01:37.329> it<00:01:37.450> out<00:01:37.539> of<00:01:37.630> here<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.810> obviously<00:01:44.649> still

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
check it out of here so obviously still

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.580 
check it out of here so obviously still
