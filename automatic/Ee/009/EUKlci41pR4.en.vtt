 Hello in this way I want to show you how it works under Windows 7 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.079
 can prevent newly installed programs from running 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.079
 ensures only for certain file types ads can 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.579
 for example, the teacher of the three parties with the one they want 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.019
 Programs install a software and this takes over 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:27.010
 undesirable 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.230
 The file Association for mp3 files to prevent this they managed 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.850
 Just the rescue credit clock 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.270
 as I may show that we are hereby changing that 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.130
 Setting for all users on this computer if so someone else 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.290
 People working with accounts like this will also work for this 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.290
 Accounts set the appropriate place 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.560
 but we are just as loud gang wars and you under programs 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.049
 Browse files easily 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:55.520
 after Heck he goes to comment AXA so Kuhn 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.060
 such finds in the area 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.260
 the user account control asked Wenger after simply on the approx 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
 and even as necessary the registry editor 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.330
 Here we look for next the HF 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.330
 Hakki Local Machine can figure it out 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.810
 next software 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.810
 Microsoft 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.590
 Windows 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.340
 To dominate Karen 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.220
 Policies 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.010
 here we need a shelter called Explorer in this case 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.410
 not available yet 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.020
 to that extent, among investors came Polly Â»Seas marked right mouse button

 Bark and click here in the submenu key 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.740
 then we get directly the new key displayed it is just newer 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.240
 Key number one there, however, we are now going to Explorer IE 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.840
 when explored by default the world is on the right 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.999
 press the right mouse button again 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.240
 gets another context menu 9 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.249
 and in that they would be ready 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:13.349
 we can get on it 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.909
 and her the name is the World who heart 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.809
 that is No 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:18.839
 Veiel 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.839
 looks like that 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.989
 Double-click on it to give it a reduced value By default, the value is 0 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.989
 the change we have a one click on OK de 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.689
 so that the lock is successfully set if you use this lock again 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.499
 All they really need to do is double-click on a trap again 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.040
 Societa perform 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.919
 Company value again 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:43.949
 now put 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:48.539
 or alternatively they export the complete key to the explorer 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:52.529
 Simply click here and go to Text in front of animals in the "File" menu 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.390
 when capturing position rest so that i should have saved all 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.519
 The stores are selected 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.120
 Now, putting the lock on is just one reason 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.169
 Of course they can 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:07.169
 leave another club 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.109
 and to be able to switch it off completely when the whole thing is over 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.019
 Right mouse button in the context menu Copy 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.269
 and on the desktop again insert a coupe us the whole December 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.269
 succeeded in strife 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.310
 In addition, select the topic from and editing in the context menu 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.280
 then we see the corresponding entry in the registry here 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.740
 End on 1 you have set the whole at the end of 1 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.009
 the race was in a 0 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:43.540
 save and close customers so he lets about this second part entirely 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.359
 conveniently turn the lock on or off 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.389
 shortly after it is turned on so double click on it 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:51.539

 it comes as the user account control Hessenliga dabble is now in demand 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:59.219
 the whole thing will be about the registry in the future too Dr 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.219
 in the end put in order and now we see the zero here 

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:05.919
 that is, the lock is no longer active so we can each 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.159
 install a software 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.129

 and our only one 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.799
 heights 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.539
 but 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.439
 on 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:32.710
