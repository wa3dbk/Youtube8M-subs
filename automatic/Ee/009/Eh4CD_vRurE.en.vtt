00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.150
 jaypee pokemon eyes and live in the day 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.799

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.410
 5 today I bring you a top 5 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.019
 Pretty special pokemon ruby or mega 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.940
 and sapphire alpha today we are going to 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.949
 talk about the 5 best medium 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.720
 evolutions not as to what 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.430
 competitive not much less but in 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.439
 this time we will talk about what 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.019
 physical in terms of the better said aspect 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.519
 as for the design at least in my 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.349
 opinion they know that if you have one poular 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.660
 a completely different opinion to the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.189
 mine down here have the comments 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.690
 so they can give me any remedy 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.450
 evolution that I think I missed or 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.040
 inclusive that you put your top number 5 of 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.899
 the half evolutions of blond pokemon 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.730
 I like alpha fio that more of their 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.280
 nice but good friends we started 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.660
 directly with position number 5 and not 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.079
 forget to destroy that button I like 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.090
 and let's see if we reach 250 likes in 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.309
 place number 5 would have what it would be 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.770
 mega dylan yes I think this pokemon 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.180
 Needless to say more because you are in 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.190
 this top of the best designs 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.940
 It really is a pretty design 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.409
 incredible yours quite beautiful the truth 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.690
 you really see this and that is a 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.420
 complete queen of diamonds the queen 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.730
 of the cármenes really this design is 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.130
 itself is nice as could describe 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.260
 which is a pretty elegant design for 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.390
 this mega evolution that is also 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.130
 pretty good in terms of the competitive 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.040
 refers at least in my opinion the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.290
 number 5 would Abidjan if I - 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.690
 directly already to position number 4 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.460
 I will put an evolution completely 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.740
 different I would say yes but nevertheless 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.740
 also with something very particular that what 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.510
 It emphasizes that it is a design very 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.310
 I know how to describe it, it's just like 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.990
 that a rustic design but at the same time 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.240
 incredible to what I am referring 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.870
 is nothing more and nothing less than mega 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.490
 steel and this mega pokemon is pretty 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.030
 well and really in its various color 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.460
 it is simply shielder this pokemon 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.070
 I really love mega evolution 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.050
 as to what the aspect it relates in 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.120
 the competitive not so much but in the 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.340
 aspect this pokemon simply obliterates 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.870
 in me this since especially in his 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.880
 way various colors of pokemon is 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.979
 just amazing I think we take 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.290
 will be with me that is not a pokémon the 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.290
 which stands out for being beautiful but without 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.719
 however, that 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.909
 it's like a diamond in the rough really 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:18.920
 it's a little bit in which you like it even though 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.689
 make you ugly ranked No. 4 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.420
 we have nothing more and nothing less than 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:25.040
 mega steel ix and now advanced and to another 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.890
 put and getting to what would be the 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.750
 podio del turnero 3 would have nothing more and 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.579
 nothing less than pure mega I who did 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.069
 it's not that he changes his design so much 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.620
 but nevertheless its pretty design 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.629
 simple pretty basic really is what 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.340
 that makes it stand out and be nice since 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.159
 they did not speak to him of things of more emission than 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.750
 the pokemon saw as it were something 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.489
 ridiculous but they put him 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.170
 just some extra little details 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.239
 Do you put it on its own? 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.739
 pretty nice and now this mega what 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.319
 puts and it's not pretty but it's 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.909
 just amazing I think all the 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.340
 world will be with me that this pokemon 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.400
 even if you do not have as many details, it's what 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.220
 that gives you a certain 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.500
 certain elegance to this pokemon now 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.299
 talking about elegance friends there's another 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.939
 mega pokemon which is in the position 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.640
 number 2 which also stands out for not 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:15.250
 change absolutely nothing of your good 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.739
 almost nothing of its normal form but that 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.329
 simply win some colors and win 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.359
 to some other thing but nevertheless 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.489
 these little details make this 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.650
 pokemon really at least for me it 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.450
 see simply amazing this design in 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.480
 so minimalist that it will increase with 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.280
 so many things that they simply did 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.739
 a design a little more advanced as 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.930
 that the pokemon is already and mega asked for test 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.940
 the number 2 position is a pokemon which 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.739
 I like it very much for the same reason 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.019
 I like it, you can see that I like it 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.359
 both this type of designs in which 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.099
 do not abuse the pokemon too much and do not 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.959
 they make the ridiculous fall but they 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.909
 the pokemon with just some 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.939
 Extra little details make the pokemon 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:57.400
 have something amazing that ends 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:00.189
 liking in the number 2 position would have 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.920
 nothing more and nothing less than mega asked 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:04.750
 of friends now in the position number 1 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.640
 I hope I put number one here 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.670
 down in the comments 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.730
 nothing more and nothing less than friend in Welsh 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.630
 mega light in terms of design 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.090
 I just can not ask 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.980
 absolutely nothing but beats in a 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.560
 pokémon which sincerely in the 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.750
 design I did not finish to like but I 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.150
 gaga beats with that cloak that they put 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.730
 it's just amazing really 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.610
 they seem super heroes this pokemon this 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.340
 mega pokemon better said is beautiful the 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.169
 truth is simply more we want is a 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.570
 Pretty incredible pokemon which 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.240
 it works a lot in competitive but 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.240
 in design for me at least for me 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.040
 it would be the best design they did for 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.410
 the mega evolutions of ruby pokemon or 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.240
 mega and alpha sapphire good I think it will be 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.580
 all for this top which I'm bringing 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.410
 here on january 1st, 2015 the 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.030
 first day of the year I hope you have them 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.280
 I liked it enough and that you can support me 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.110
 destroying this button I like and 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.450
 I hope you've put in the top 5 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.790
 because I'm very interested in knowing if 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.919
 we agree in some places or know 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:10.470
 if they have any completely different 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.470
 and why until the next speed
