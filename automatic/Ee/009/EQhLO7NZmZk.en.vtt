00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.300 
so from this presses down onto your neck
look<00:02:23.160> how<00:02:23.250> far<00:02:23.459> down<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.819> goes<00:02:23.849> to<00:02:24.150> pretty<00:02:24.900> far

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
look how far down it goes to pretty far

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.500 
look how far down it goes to pretty far
which<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.430> great<00:02:26.670> since<00:02:26.880> it's<00:02:27.120> supposed<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.450> be

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
which is great since it's supposed to be

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.140 
which is great since it's supposed to be
a<00:02:27.540> lifting<00:02:27.840> mask<00:02:28.400> once<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.519> put<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.730> Froome

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
a lifting mask once you put that Froome

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.020 
a lifting mask once you put that Froome
take<00:02:30.540> these<00:02:30.720> flaps<00:02:30.989> over<00:02:31.319> here<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:32.400> press

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
take these flaps over here and press

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.770 
take these flaps over here and press
them<00:02:33.209> downward<00:02:34.489> again<00:02:35.489> just<00:02:38.510> making<00:02:39.510> sure<00:02:39.660> you

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.160 

so<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.150> noticed<00:02:49.570> that<00:02:49.720> this<00:02:49.810> one<00:02:49.990> obviously

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.650 
so I noticed that this one obviously
doesn't<00:02:50.620> have<00:02:50.740> to<00:02:50.860> my<00:02:51.010> flaps<00:02:51.370> like<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:52.510> new

white<00:02:59.650> mass<00:02:59.830> which<00:03:00.040> is<00:03:00.070> kind<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.340> nice<00:03:00.460> if

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
white mass which is kind of nice if

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.920

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
know sure that the mouthpiece was a

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.220 
know sure that the mouthpiece was a
little<00:03:07.360> bit<00:03:07.450> bigger<00:03:07.630> because<00:03:07.780> I'm<00:03:07.960> a<00:03:07.990> big

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
little bit bigger because I'm a big

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.450 
little bit bigger because I'm a big
mouth<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:10.690> does<00:03:10.900> feel<00:03:11.110> pretty<00:03:11.620> secure<00:03:11.890> on

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.770 
the skin I'm gonna do I am standing up I

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
could tell that the texture of the mask

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.630 
could tell that the texture of the mask
is<00:03:25.990> thick<00:03:26.350> but<00:03:26.590> it's<00:03:26.770> not<00:03:26.950> too<00:03:27.220> thick<00:03:27.520> that

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
in hydrogen I really do like this do you

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.710 
in hydrogen I really do like this do you
think<00:05:07.220> it's<00:05:07.460> nice<00:05:07.940> or<00:05:08.150> what<00:05:08.270> I<00:05:08.300> think<00:05:08.599> is

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
think it's nice or what I think is

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.020 
think it's nice or what I think is
different<00:05:08.990> between<00:05:09.740> this<00:05:10.190> and<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:10.669> other<00:05:10.910> one

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
different between this and the other one

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.240 
different between this and the other one
is<00:05:11.449> the<00:05:11.930> serum<00:05:12.289> that's<00:05:12.530> left<00:05:12.710> on<00:05:12.830> the<00:05:12.889> skin<00:05:13.130> is

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
is the serum that's left on the skin is

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.700 
is the serum that's left on the skin is
not<00:05:13.550> as<00:05:13.849> thick<00:05:14.419> this<00:05:15.080> could<00:05:15.349> definitely<00:05:15.470> be

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
not as thick this could definitely be

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.379 
not as thick this could definitely be
done<00:05:15.919> before<00:05:16.580> an<00:05:16.669> event<00:05:16.789> where<00:05:17.120> is<00:05:17.210> the<00:05:17.300> other

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
done before an event where is the other

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.480 
done before an event where is the other
one<00:05:17.509> I<00:05:17.569> always<00:05:17.720> kind<00:05:18.020> of<00:05:18.050> suggested<00:05:19.039> they<00:05:19.130> get

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
one I always kind of suggested they get

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.980 
one I always kind of suggested they get
away<00:05:19.639> from<00:05:19.699> you<00:05:19.880> a<00:05:19.910> little<00:05:20.150> bit<00:05:20.240> better<00:05:20.810> when<00:05:20.930> I

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
away from you a little bit better when I

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.300 
away from you a little bit better when I
was<00:05:21.110> suggested<00:05:21.500> to<00:05:21.590> do<00:05:21.740> maybe<00:05:22.009> the<00:05:22.160> night

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
was suggested to do maybe the night

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.909 
was suggested to do maybe the night
before<00:05:22.520> so<00:05:23.479> this<00:05:23.660> one<00:05:23.840> it<00:05:23.960> I<00:05:24.199> could<00:05:24.560> definitely

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
before so this one it I could definitely

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.670 
before so this one it I could definitely
do<00:05:25.250> an<00:05:26.180> hour<00:05:26.569> to<00:05:26.870> a<00:05:26.900> for<00:05:27.169> an<00:05:27.229> event<00:05:27.440> and<00:05:27.560> just

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
do an hour to a for an event and just

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.409 
do an hour to a for an event and just
let<00:05:27.800> everything<00:05:27.919> sink<00:05:28.370> in<00:05:28.580> so<00:05:28.910> I<00:05:28.940> do<00:05:29.090> kind<00:05:29.389> of

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
let everything sink in so I do kind of

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.050 
let everything sink in so I do kind of
like<00:05:29.479> that<00:05:29.840> aspect<00:05:30.410> of<00:05:30.590> it<00:05:30.740> it<00:05:31.580> does<00:05:31.789> have<00:05:32.030> a

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
like that aspect of it it does have a

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.899 
like that aspect of it it does have a
actually<00:05:32.720> no<00:05:32.870> it<00:05:33.080> does<00:05:33.259> have<00:05:33.410> a<00:05:33.440> little<00:05:33.560> bit

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:33.909 
actually no it does have a little bit

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:36.640 
actually no it does have a little bit
firmness<00:05:34.909> to<00:05:35.210> my<00:05:35.300> skin<00:05:35.539> I<00:05:35.659> will<00:05:35.810> say<00:05:35.990> it<00:05:36.409> kind

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
firmness to my skin I will say it kind

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.360

of that is nice

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.580 
of that is nice
I<00:05:37.630> would<00:05:38.630> they<00:05:38.720> do<00:05:38.840> wish<00:05:39.020> they<00:05:39.199> did<00:05:39.349> have<00:05:39.500> the

I would they do wish they did have the

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.140 
I would they do wish they did have the
eye<00:05:39.620> flaps<00:05:39.979> now<00:05:40.250> though<00:05:40.460> I<00:05:40.490> do<00:05:40.669> kind<00:05:40.940> of<00:05:41.000> wish

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150

they did have that one like the new
white<00:05:42.860> I<00:05:43.069> do<00:05:43.159> think<00:05:43.520> that<00:05:43.669> my<00:05:43.759> skin<00:05:44.030> looks

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
white I do think that my skin looks

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:47.230 
white I do think that my skin looks
firmer<00:05:45.229> and<00:05:45.500> plumper<00:05:45.889> I<00:05:46.159> mean<00:05:47.060> it<00:05:47.120> doesn't

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
firmer and plumper I mean it doesn't

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.749 
firmer and plumper I mean it doesn't
look<00:05:47.389> like<00:05:47.419> but<00:05:48.380> it<00:05:48.590> looks<00:05:48.770> really<00:05:49.310> nice<00:05:49.460> and<00:05:49.520> I

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 
look like but it looks really nice and I

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.010 
look like but it looks really nice and I
feel<00:05:49.819> like<00:05:50.030> if<00:05:50.120> this<00:05:50.240> was<00:05:50.479> something<00:05:50.750> that<00:05:50.870> you

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
feel like if this was something that you

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.350 
feel like if this was something that you
did<00:05:51.199> on<00:05:51.229> a<00:05:51.620> weekly<00:05:52.039> basis<00:05:52.430> you<00:05:52.639> could<00:05:53.090> probably

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
did on a weekly basis you could probably

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.529 
did on a weekly basis you could probably
get<00:05:53.630> a<00:05:53.659> good<00:05:54.020> have<00:05:54.550> plump<00:05:55.550> firmness<00:05:55.970> from<00:05:56.389> this

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
get a good have plump firmness from this

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.689 
get a good have plump firmness from this
but<00:05:57.409> let's<00:05:57.620> look<00:05:57.800> at<00:05:57.889> the<00:05:57.949> little<00:05:58.190> lines<00:05:58.400> I

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
but let's look at the little lines I

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.149 
but let's look at the little lines I
always<00:05:59.090> have<00:05:59.300> let's<00:06:00.199> get<00:06:00.409> real<00:06:00.560> close<00:06:00.770> I

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:01.159 
always have let's get real close I

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:03.399 
always have let's get real close I
always<00:06:01.520> have<00:06:01.639> this<00:06:01.729> line<00:06:02.030> right<00:06:02.270> here<00:06:02.330> if<00:06:03.139> I<00:06:03.289> go

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409 
always have this line right here if I go

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:05.740 
always have this line right here if I go
like<00:06:03.530> this<00:06:03.560> a<00:06:03.710> lot<00:06:03.979> unfortunately<00:06:04.909> I<00:06:05.090> do<00:06:05.449> feel

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
like this a lot unfortunately I do feel

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.930 
like this a lot unfortunately I do feel
like<00:06:05.810> that<00:06:05.870> actually<00:06:06.430> there<00:06:07.430> doesn't<00:06:07.789> seem<00:06:07.820> to

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
like that actually there doesn't seem to

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.379 
like that actually there doesn't seem to
be<00:06:08.060> any<00:06:08.330> little<00:06:08.780> line<00:06:09.580> that<00:06:10.580> is<00:06:10.820> too<00:06:11.090> visible

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
be any little line that is too visible

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.890 
be any little line that is too visible
can't<00:06:12.050> you<00:06:12.110> see<00:06:12.259> it<00:06:12.380> I<00:06:12.590> can't<00:06:13.449> and<00:06:14.449> then<00:06:14.599> also<00:06:14.719> I

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
always tend to the glue lines right here

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.800 
always tend to the glue lines right here
which<00:06:16.729> is<00:06:16.849> why<00:06:16.969> I<00:06:17.000> wish<00:06:17.389> there<00:06:17.570> was<00:06:17.630> a<00:06:17.690> little
