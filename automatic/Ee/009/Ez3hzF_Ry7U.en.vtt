00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
would advise sprinting in short bursts

would advise sprinting in short bursts
in<00:00:36.930> order<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.350> regain<00:00:37.530> your<00:00:37.860> stamina

advice for this triathlon is the kind of
lag<00:00:53.620> behind<00:00:53.800> and<00:00:54.280> save<00:00:54.430> your<00:00:54.610> stamina<00:01:10.560> once
