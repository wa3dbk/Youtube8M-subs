00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.570
 Speak lester and today be very well. 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.160
 welcome to another aquino lister tutorial 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.320
 tutorials 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.300
 so it's only here this time how to improve 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.939
 the performance of your processor then 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.220
 staff to start you will have to 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.259
 on your keyboard you select key 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:32.780
 windows and is letter r will open the execute 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:37.100
 so here you will put the following 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.989
 m / s trust and give a ok 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.769
 there is that will open the configuration 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.719
 system 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:47.010
 you will have to initialize the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.219
 system advanced options and here they 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.620
 selected number of processors and 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.289
 here folks you be smart here 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.909
 that maybe you will have more than 2 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.909
 most people I think have 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:03.030
 two but if you have more than 2 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.920
 I selected until the last conquered 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.590
 I have the biggest one I have to select 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:14.689
 two and then I'll write okay you will not either 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:19.469
 apply and what it is who quit without restarting 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.969
 then staff will leave a link calm 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:24.780
 I'll leave in the video description a 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:26.189
 link from a program called everest is 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.259
 everest 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.790
 they will have to open it soon as you 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.280
 open the everest you will have to 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:41.219
 computer overlock and in 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:48.570
 overclock you will see the CPU cash 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:50.969
 calm down the staff will have cash l2 still 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.590
 You want to be here my two in the case and 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:58.380
 3 mega megabytes so that's remembering that 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.119
 everest requires an activation cereal 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.399
 that it is not free 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.829
 so you need you will have to 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.780
 buy buy it or find a way 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.700
 install it 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.520
 so I did not buy it, I'm here 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.540
 With him I think it's the here 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.640
 days he is going 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.280
 the computer is not for the case that I never 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.519
 I have bought a test and here in 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.689
 cache is here on your foot and may 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:28.480
 to be in hair or in mb 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:31.060
 in my case it has mb then just after the 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.730
 studies in doing this you will have to 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.920
 you will have to select windons r from 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.030
 new but this time of writing you 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.560
 they will have to write the following regime ti 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.500
 Legitimate and give an okay 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.840
 right after that 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.599
 soon after that you will have to edit 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:03:06.060
 find and you will have to type 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:03:06.060
 second second level level test date 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:13.000
 so you'll have to type this 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.010
 century of level data cash and soon after 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.799
 to do this you have to put in 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.280
 find next click on find 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.989
 next and will search the registry will 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.440
 take a little while then the staff 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.079
 right after you've uploaded everything already 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.569
 this person is going to who is 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:35.709
 second level data cash selected will 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:38.019
 double click on above and here 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.669
 pay attention in this part that this 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.370
 part is very important 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:45.609
 you will have to put value data 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.629
 that value that you have seen in everest 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:53.199
 in my case it's in casting l23 megas 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:56.290
 you will put here data of the value 3 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:59.500
 You do not have to put mega or head 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.049
 Do not even bother and pay attention here. 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.169
 staff if in your head was you 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.579
 will have to leave hexadecimal if they are mb 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:09.759
 of this evil 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.239
 in my case it's mb so I'll leave it 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:13.269
 bad 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:16.209
 if you have a head at that 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.280
 for hair instead of mbps hexadecimal 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:23.529
 This was the wrong word. 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.450
 Okay, you'll have to give me an okay and then 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:29.160
 do this 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:34.620
 you will have to edit 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.060
 next and right after you click 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.540
 find next 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:43.860
 You will open here again. 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:48.750
 again and enter the value and select 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:53.610
 and giving a ok then personal is basically 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:57.180
 This is very easy, not to improve the 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.560
 performance of the computer pc and here 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.080
 it's here right? 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.500
 and I recommend it right after you 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.530
 do this restart the computer to 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.740
 for you to see the difference soon enough 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.800
 after reboot and is also very 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.270
 better then I'm not lazy at networks 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.240
 hold the computer 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.470
 I think that's it for today and only if 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.200
