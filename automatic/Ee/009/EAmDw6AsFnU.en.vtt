I've made my train it's just a simple
test<00:00:17.550> map<00:00:17.789> skybox<00:00:18.390> all<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.289> stuff<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:20.060> I

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
test map skybox all that stuff and I

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.730 
test map skybox all that stuff and I
made<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.510> train<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.930> middle<00:00:22.199> with<00:00:22.470> am

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
made the train in the middle with am

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.519 
made the train in the middle with am
pond<00:00:23.369> area<00:00:23.850> hollowed<00:00:24.269> out<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.720> what

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
do is go to textures surface type water

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.770 
do is go to textures surface type water
and<00:00:34.430> you<00:00:35.430> want<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.670> find<00:00:35.820> your<00:00:36.000> clip<00:00:36.450> water

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
texture you don't want to use clip water

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.619 
texture you don't want to use clip water
player<00:00:39.629> for<00:00:39.870> now<00:00:39.960> that's<00:00:40.230> from<00:00:41.480> walking<00:00:42.480> on

that your pawns going to be in and it
has<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.210> go<00:00:57.390> all<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> way<00:00:57.660> down<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.800> can

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
has to go all the way down to so you can

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.610 
has to go all the way down to so you can
do<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.960> you<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.109> see<00:01:01.260> you've<00:01:01.410> started

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
do that and you can see you've started

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.759

to<00:01:01.800> fill<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> area<00:01:02.520> or<00:01:02.699> pond<00:01:03.030> isn't<00:01:03.769> so

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
to fill in the area or pond isn't so

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.030 
to fill in the area or pond isn't so
once<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.460> position<00:01:06.650> not<00:01:07.650> your

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
once you have that position not your

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.219 
once you have that position not your
waters<00:01:08.340> there<00:01:08.610> if<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.299> are<00:01:09.510> compiled<00:01:10.080> this

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
waters there if you are compiled this

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.289 
waters there if you are compiled this
and<00:01:10.380> loaded<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.799> game<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.700> would<00:01:11.850> see<00:01:12.240> it

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
and loaded in the game you would see it

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.870 
and loaded in the game you would see it
um<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:13.710> would<00:01:13.830> be<00:01:13.950> able<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.189> walk<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.760> your

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
um you would be able to walk in your

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.450 
um you would be able to walk in your
water<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.560> you<00:01:16.560> wouldn't<00:01:16.830> actually<00:01:17.070> be<00:01:17.340> able

water but you wouldn't actually be able

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.550 
water but you wouldn't actually be able
to<00:01:17.640> see<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.909> because<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.869> texture<00:01:19.350> isn't

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
to see it because this texture isn't

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.030 
to see it because this texture isn't
visible<00:01:20.360> so<00:01:21.360> what<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.350> want<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.590> do<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.799> suck

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.910 
water is there in game and you'll be
able<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.369> see<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.619> there's<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.680> slight

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
problem that is anyone underneath this

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.880 
problem that is anyone underneath this
can<00:01:56.880> look<00:01:57.180> up<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.479> shoot<00:01:57.659> people<00:01:57.840> without<00:01:58.409> the

can look up and shoot people without the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.080 
can look up and shoot people without the
water<00:01:59.100> blocking<00:01:59.759> their<00:01:59.909> view<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.560> fix<00:02:01.740> that

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
water blocking their view so to fix that

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.320 
water blocking their view so to fix that
you<00:02:03.090> want<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.390> take<00:02:04.200> your<00:02:04.320> water<00:02:04.560> brush

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
you want to take your water brush

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.330 
you want to take your water brush
copy<00:02:07.260> it<00:02:07.729> move<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.759> back<00:02:09.920> turn<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.070> into<00:02:11.190> a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
copy it move it back turn it into a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.210 
copy it move it back turn it into a
train<00:02:11.640> patch<00:02:12.290> 2<00:02:13.290> by<00:02:13.440> 2<00:02:13.500> because<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.100> don't

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
train patch 2 by 2 because you don't

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.500 
train patch 2 by 2 because you don't
want<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.400> use<00:02:14.490> more<00:02:14.640> vertices<00:02:15.000> than<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.330> have

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
want to use more vertices than you have

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.920 
want to use more vertices than you have
to<00:02:16.460> refit<00:02:17.460> it<00:02:17.490> because<00:02:18.000> you'll<00:02:18.300> notice<00:02:18.780> it's

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
to refit it because you'll notice it's

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.070 
to refit it because you'll notice it's
gone<00:02:19.110> back<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:20.480> then<00:02:21.480> rotated<00:02:21.990> 180<00:02:22.560> degrees

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
gone back and then rotated 180 degrees

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.630 
gone back and then rotated 180 degrees
so<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.440> surface<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.190> now<00:02:26.310> pointing

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
so that that surface is now pointing

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.630 
so that that surface is now pointing
downwards<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.710> so<00:02:28.710> it<00:02:28.830> doesn't<00:02:29.070> overlap<00:02:29.400> with

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
downwards and so it doesn't overlap with

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.120 
downwards and so it doesn't overlap with
that<00:02:29.760> top<00:02:30.030> texture<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:31.590> want<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.890> move<00:02:32.010> it

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
that top texture you want to move it

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.280 
that top texture you want to move it
down<00:02:32.330> just<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.600> little<00:02:33.750> bit<00:02:35.510> so<00:02:36.510> want<00:02:36.870> anybody

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
down just a little bit so want anybody

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.080 
down just a little bit so want anybody
underneath<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.860> slaughter<00:02:38.100> is<00:02:38.370> going<00:02:39.030> to

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
underneath the slaughter is going to

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.610 
underneath the slaughter is going to
look<00:02:39.240> back<00:02:39.450> up<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.810> see<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.050> same<00:02:40.230> exact

look back up and see the same exact
thing<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:40.980> they<00:02:41.040> won't<00:02:41.220> be<00:02:41.310> able<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.900> abuse

your water in the map so I'm going to

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.750 
your water in the map so I'm going to
pause<00:02:46.050> here<00:02:46.080> while<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.500> compile<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.100> come<00:02:47.640> back

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
pause here while I compile and come back

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.190

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
I'm just loading the map now here we go

I'm just loading the map now here we go
there's<00:02:57.600> your<00:02:57.750> water<00:02:58.550> looks<00:02:59.550> pretty<00:02:59.850> good<00:03:00.060> now

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
in a second if we go underneath it you

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.880 
in a second if we go underneath it you
can<00:03:06.570> see<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.990> it<00:03:07.200> has<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.380> exact<00:03:07.860> same
