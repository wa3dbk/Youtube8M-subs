00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.930
 alonso to repeat 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.740
 moral boy 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.810
 When several came for the pact in the middle of the fair, to overcome them for you 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:09.310
 I could 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.770
 the bad luck delays is incredible nor a car to win and yet another 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.879
 Because of bad luck 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.600
 I hope to take off road 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.480
 all this was in favor of a guy 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.400
 oscar aventín 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.300
 is thinking about the championship 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.920
 and correct two dropouts 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.880
 ascend 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.240
 now to the fifth place oscar aventín to get to buenos aires to three points 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.869
 of capello attention gentlemen that not only puts 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.510
 interesting as it has been so far the race but 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.159
 increasingly interesting the championship 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:40.100
 yes yes if you define yourself in buenos aires 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.710
 in the autodrome of the capital of daguestán we entering to bail 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.960
 to think that the lover 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.270
 Aisha Latvia 22 years 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.590
 the field the straight 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.560
 for this circuit to look for another lung at any time there may be 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.269
 news or modifications 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.440
 because they are all very pressured 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.479
 very rushed 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.940
 Garcia is approaching the white car each time the author 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.470
 since balcarce trying to keep the first placement there are 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.760
 entering by vehicles that will not only be among the pointers 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.760
 they are coming out on the wide straight I see very little 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.640
 pretoria 29 to the branches has not executed 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.960
 in all sectors 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.670
 tony aventín and lalo bouquets 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.730
 that were approaching calama that when the time comes 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.970
 whereas now we do not see that the block as it blocked when it hurried 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.479
 roberto mouras who was going 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.890
 with the left rear rubber totally in santa there is coming 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.320
 roberto hours to the pit area and we continue with the tip of the 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.719
 race with this fight affects to cure that is keeping all these pilots 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.899
 while we are going to say 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.380
 and so there we have it happened 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.480
 to see there is the case 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.890
 panasonic 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.600
 abelardo bouquets when tonight and first no is not bad 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.380
 diego Catalan though 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.570
 after 100 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.740
 legal and alajuela lula also inside and try to get out a little bit 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.130
 fastest ítala mandiola lo ramón carabante that has achieved 87 hundredths 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.230
 of second in his favor above all and 23 of the second and 1 21 over the third 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.190
 ramón slope quarter garrido to more than 13 seconds painted to lie to 14 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.530
 seconds the sector the tano pernía to 15 and a half now well in vienna signed the 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.060
 first the second and the third 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.640
 they are not as tight as the previous laps 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.190
 now it seems that the decanter came a little closer to the second attack 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.300
 adventure to try to overcome what we are going to see if we achieve actors and slug 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.300
 boxing no 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:43.839
 as the fastest and 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:47.170
 so while the pointer is monopolizing while the fight 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.719
 continues but not so intense in 3 to 1 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:53.889
 to see if meanwhile we can make the difference between the 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.879
 cars that come behind these three pointers the race when a car makes 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.519
 a spin the machine 62 director for china according to while teams in 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.280
 boxes and 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.160
 just at that moment he got out of the car to Oscar Castilians slammed the door 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.499
 confirmed problem on 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:11.049
 was the team is still the same 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.879
 recover the stroke line for the machine 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:14.969
 of oscar castellano 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:20.229
 and then this impossibility to leave everything for the duel autodrome of the capital 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:21.569
 federal 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.690
 j December 15 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.539
 8 to 13 December 15 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:27.959
 that day 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.799
 between sunday 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.900
 well those beautiful pointer though the chelsea 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.209
 on the line was how they open 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.209
 sun and adventure think gone on the left 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:42.549
 the supervisor right to the left on your television comes 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.990
 we talked much more open the cars were left 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.349
 rafa kill from the moment of having arid 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.369
 while they can not approach at least up to now a machine that 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:54.570
 it comes very well affirmed 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.749
 How is it 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:00.709
 mariano alberto calamante direct return of sacks 32 hundredths blue 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:07.059
 47 hundredth hala the branches were going to have fight at any time for the 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:11.009
 fourth place delivered laughed and oscar aventín that are separated only 

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:15.539
 by 86 in a second of a second while he is staying 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:17.459
 32 osvaldo machine the ing 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.269
 vanessa not so much of the test 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.229
 and park 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.330
 behind the machine 47 pablo zalaquett equipment before 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.800
 there's land there we have again these auto buses that go from 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.770
 pledging declared pointers and tried red try to pass by 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.319
 up to see what happens in braking for the chicane can not you have to 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.630
 keep behind and then these cars that are located 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:42.249
 and sixth place out 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:44.939
 it's the opposite straight 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:48.860
 to look for the other one by bolívar to look for a new round and aventín 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.330
 he will not lose patience his experience indicates that he has first of all 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.069
 you have to think about the championship especially considering that we are not 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:58.520
 enclosure and note the Spanish pincho 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.259
 who was going to say 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.259
 that mariano alberto talamantes I studied cgt 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.629
 there not only the tip lot if they will not be in the background and the 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.629
 forcefulness with almost four seconds in his favor 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:15.909
 the year I think no one even himself is not like this is exactly these are 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:16.660
 things 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.930
 of motorsport tc things 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.270
 the uncertainty that occurs before each race 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.670
 nobody knows what might happen 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.840
 today I obviously think that neither oscar castellano 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:30.810
 clementino got upset because he can not show it 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.530
 have a car to walk a job 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.560
 they did not have it 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.120
 but obviously there are some 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.070
 public or morresi and now in the case the Spanish pincho 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.199
 that very quickly 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.909
 without practically being able to develop the race they had to leave it 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:49.099
 as a reference I want to tell you 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.870
 in this round for the first time 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.139
 almost the whole race when wolf adventure is up now garrido goes by 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.620
 outside but that adegi is the new fourth of the race to do and practically 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.880
 in a line there is already room oscar aventín and is located some 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.540
 points and a half of Castilian in the fight for the championship I wanted to tell you cherry 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.779
 dumps in the 15th for the first time 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:14.730
 in 19 hundredths slower than previously 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:20.000
 and 6 hundredths maell tortellá the second and third bouquets in the end this 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 competition to eta reiteration 

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:27.059
 maybe these postulates 

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:32.109
 too strong opens too much his curve radius manceñido as always oscar 

00:06:32.109 --> 00:06:37.119
 adventurous and then this allows you to go out better get out more armed get out more 

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:40.569
 firm are a not so dirty part of the circuit 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:43.979
 this fourth actress 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:46.979
 the possibilities for the development of the last test 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:56.189
 the championship the fight for the pilot point to take avante I've been talking 

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:57.310
 with and aventín 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.129
 one thing exactly the same 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:00.080
 what yes 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.399
 very catchy 

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:03.770
 very traditional 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.050
 so the history of cinema 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.210
 ap has resisted this fight aware of in an intense way 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.409
 the chevrolet vectra forward 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:15.919
 the incentive for young people was left practically without possibilities 

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:19.589
 really already the fight for change 

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:23.490
 the possibility of seeing 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.770
 this fight of the race so intense I want to tell you that in eta 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.919
 that field is missing, according to the speaker 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:33.960
 and it was covered to 21 hundredths celaá the bouquets that are put to the apparatus nor I think 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.180
 that now it's going to be the second one recovered very clipped the auto actor and 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.869
 yesterday soccer 

00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:43.139
 now it comes throughout the year let's see when they foresee it seems to me that the 

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:43.740
 rope 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.710
 despite the brown rule allow 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.470
 pass it to toni does not have a car
