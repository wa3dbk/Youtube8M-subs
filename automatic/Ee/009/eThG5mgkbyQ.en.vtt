which they claim is three times stronger

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:19.160 
which they claim is three times stronger
I'm<00:00:12.570> gonna<00:00:12.750> test<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.170> out<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.440> see<00:00:17.990> this<00:00:18.990> is

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
well now they claim it's three times

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.790 
well now they claim it's three times
stronger<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.630> they<00:00:31.109> talked<00:00:31.320> about<00:00:31.590> this

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
stronger and they talked about this

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.729 
stronger and they talked about this
orange<00:00:32.669> tip<00:00:33.000> connector<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.899> still<00:00:34.410> think<00:00:34.620> it's

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
orange tip connector I still think it's

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.200 
orange tip connector I still think it's
plastic<00:00:35.190> though<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.670> don't<00:00:35.730> know<00:00:35.969> how<00:00:36.059> it's

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
plastic though so I don't know how it's

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.180 
plastic though so I don't know how it's
going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.390> fix<00:00:36.600> those<00:00:36.809> issues<00:00:36.840> where<00:00:37.469> they

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
going to fix those issues where they

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.490 
going to fix those issues where they
would<00:00:38.340> leak<00:00:38.550> or<00:00:38.790> crack<00:00:39.090> here's<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.140> hose<00:00:40.290> out

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
would leak or crack here's the hose out

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.619 
would leak or crack here's the hose out
of<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> package<00:00:41.070> these<00:00:41.460> connectors<00:00:41.969> they're

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
of the package these connectors they're

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.299 
of the package these connectors they're
still<00:00:42.870> plastic<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.469> don't<00:00:43.620> know<00:00:43.710> why<00:00:43.860> orange

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
still plastic I don't know why orange

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.130 
still plastic I don't know why orange
makes<00:00:44.640> them<00:00:44.879> stronger<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:45.539> they're<00:00:45.750> claiming

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
makes them stronger but they're claiming

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.090 
makes them stronger but they're claiming
that<00:00:46.260> maybe<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.680> some<00:00:46.800> different

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
that maybe it's some different

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.090 
that maybe it's some different
formulation<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.789> plastic<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.840> does

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
formulation of plastic and it does

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.470 
formulation of plastic and it does
compact<00:00:50.100> pretty<00:00:50.430> well<00:00:50.610> at<00:00:50.850> least<00:00:51.090> before<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
compact pretty well at least before the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.869 
compact pretty well at least before the
first<00:00:51.690> time<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.020> use<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.010> 50<00:00:53.670> feets

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
first time you use it this is 50 feets

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.000 
first time you use it this is 50 feets
worth<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.449> pocket<00:00:54.809> hose<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> contracted

worth of pocket hose in the contracted

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.130 
worth of pocket hose in the contracted
form<00:00:56.039> when<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.550> hook<00:00:56.789> up<00:00:56.910> water<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.570> close<00:00:57.960> the

form when we hook up water and close the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.660 
form when we hook up water and close the
valve<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> end<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.219> fills<00:00:59.460> with

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
valve on the end so it fills with

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.760 
valve on the end so it fills with
pressure<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.359> should<00:01:00.570> expand<00:01:00.989> out<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.320> 50<00:01:01.620> feet

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
pressure it should expand out to 50 feet

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.740 
pressure it should expand out to 50 feet
long<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.520> if<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.730> watch<00:01:02.879> stay<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.270> my<00:01:03.359> pocket

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
have noticed I've upgraded my testing

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.950 
have noticed I've upgraded my testing
rig<00:01:12.049> and<00:01:13.049> they're<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.450> almost<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.659> straight

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
rig and they're in almost a straight

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.499 
rig and they're in almost a straight
line<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:17.549> gonna<00:01:17.700> get<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.119> tape<00:01:18.479> measure

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
line here I'm gonna get the tape measure

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.520 
line here I'm gonna get the tape measure
and<00:01:19.189> see<00:01:20.189> if<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.369> actually<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.700> 50<00:01:21.030> feet

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
and see if it actually is 50 feet

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.320 
and see if it actually is 50 feet
actually<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.799> little<00:01:22.979> over<00:01:23.220> 50<00:01:23.549> feet<00:01:23.700> close<00:01:24.180> to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
actually a little over 50 feet close to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.120 
actually a little over 50 feet close to
fifty<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.750> feet<00:01:24.990> long<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.409> see<00:01:25.860> how<00:01:25.979> well<00:01:26.100> it

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
fifty one feet long and see how well it

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.380 
fifty one feet long and see how well it
shrinks<00:01:26.490> back<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.880> turn<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> water<00:01:28.170> off<00:01:28.320> here

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
shrinks back up turn the water off here

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.789 
shrinks back up turn the water off here
and<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.509> don't<00:01:30.659> see<00:01:30.810> any<00:01:30.960> shrinking<00:01:31.320> yet<00:01:31.530> cuz

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
and we don't see any shrinking yet cuz

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.140 
and we don't see any shrinking yet cuz
it's<00:01:31.950> still<00:01:32.130> under<00:01:32.250> pressure<00:01:32.549> got<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.939> go<00:01:33.090> to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
it's still under pressure got to go to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:42.690 
it's still under pressure got to go to
the<00:01:33.329> other<00:01:33.450> end<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.869> turn<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.200> valve

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.300 

quite<00:01:43.700> a<00:01:43.729> lot<00:01:43.880> of<00:01:43.909> water<00:01:44.090> in<00:01:44.360> there<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:49.100> grass

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
quite a lot of water in there the grass

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.160 
quite a lot of water in there the grass
is<00:01:49.580> holding<00:01:49.880> on<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.000> it<00:01:50.270> so<00:01:50.630> you<00:01:50.690> don't<00:01:50.900> get<00:01:51.020> as

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
is holding on to it so you don't get as

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.620 
is holding on to it so you don't get as
dramatic<00:01:51.770> shrink<00:01:52.520> up<00:01:52.640> effect<00:01:53.000> as<00:01:53.180> you<00:01:53.330> do<00:01:53.450> on

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.700 

here's<00:02:07.330> what<00:02:07.510> it<00:02:07.600> looks<00:02:07.750> like<00:02:07.870> contracting<00:02:08.470> go

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
here's what it looks like contracting go

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:20.550 
here's what it looks like contracting go
ahead<00:02:17.340> doesn't<00:02:18.340> contract<00:02:18.780> as<00:02:19.780> quickly<00:02:20.170> and

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
ahead doesn't contract as quickly and

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.010 
ahead doesn't contract as quickly and
with<00:02:20.950> enthusiasm<00:02:21.640> as<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.300> pocket<00:02:22.630> hose<00:02:22.750> did

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
with enthusiasm as the pocket hose did

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.820 
with enthusiasm as the pocket hose did
last<00:02:23.260> year

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
last year

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.650 
last year
I<00:02:23.860> think<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.520> has<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.730> do<00:02:24.940> with<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.240> hosing

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
I think it has to do with the hosing

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.780 
I think it has to do with the hosing
that<00:02:25.810> they're<00:02:25.960> using<00:02:26.140> now<00:02:26.410> inside<00:02:26.770> so<00:02:27.760> I

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
that they're using now inside so I

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.970 
that they're using now inside so I
turned<00:02:28.090> on<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.270> water<00:02:28.510> close<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.290> valve<00:02:29.680> now

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
turned on the water close the valve now

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.830 
turned on the water close the valve now
I've<00:02:30.250> got<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.880> under<00:02:31.060> pressure<00:02:31.330> so<00:02:31.630> I've<00:02:31.720> got

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
I've got it under pressure so I've got

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.300 
I've got it under pressure so I've got
the<00:02:31.990> sprinkler<00:02:32.350> about<00:02:32.500> 50<00:02:32.860> feet<00:02:33.070> away<00:02:33.160> from

down and turn that little knob and then

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.830 
down and turn that little knob and then
run<00:02:38.050> which<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:39.070> was<00:02:39.250> successful<00:02:39.820> at<00:02:39.970> I'm<00:02:40.540> seem

to see about water flow through the
pocket<00:02:44.530> hose<00:02:44.740> ultra<00:02:45.070> I've<00:02:45.580> got<00:02:45.820> my<00:02:46.090> standard

the pocket hose ultra I'm gonna see

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.600 
the pocket hose ultra I'm gonna see
which<00:02:50.560> can<00:02:50.770> fill<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.040> bucket<00:02:51.280> up<00:02:51.370> first

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
which can fill the bucket up first

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.060 
which can fill the bucket up first
something<00:02:52.360> interesting<00:02:53.050> though<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:53.200> did<00:02:53.470> take

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
something interesting though I did take

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.740 
something interesting though I did take
this<00:02:54.220> piece<00:02:54.520> off<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:55.180> so<00:02:55.390> it'll<00:02:55.570> have

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
this piece off of this so it'll have

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.660 
this piece off of this so it'll have
better<00:02:56.320> flow<00:02:56.680> rate<00:02:56.920> I'm<00:02:57.040> thinking<00:02:57.400> deeper

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
better flow rate I'm thinking deeper

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.610 
better flow rate I'm thinking deeper
down<00:02:57.820> inside<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.480> pocket<00:02:58.810> hose<00:02:58.930> ultra<00:02:59.110> once

down inside the pocket hose ultra once
you've<00:02:59.770> taken<00:02:59.980> off<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.520> valve<00:03:00.730> portion<00:03:01.270> of<00:03:01.390> it

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
you've taken off the valve portion of it

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.750 
you've taken off the valve portion of it
look<00:03:01.690> at<00:03:01.810> how<00:03:01.900> tiny<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:03.100> opening<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.580> there

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
look at how tiny the opening is there

all right here we go

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.650 
all right here we go

leaving into the pocket hose ultra a

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:16.470 
leaving into the pocket hose ultra a
little<00:03:07.870> head<00:03:08.019> start

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.280 

oh<00:03:18.780> man

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.110 

they<00:03:23.290> are<00:03:23.470> both<00:03:23.680> sharing<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.549> water<00:03:24.760> pressure

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
they are both sharing the water pressure

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.089 
they are both sharing the water pressure
and<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.420> water<00:03:25.599> flow<00:03:25.900> out<00:03:25.930> of<00:03:26.200> one<00:03:26.349> faucet<00:03:26.860> but

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
and the water flow out of one faucet but

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:34.410 
and the water flow out of one faucet but
look<00:03:27.250> at<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:29.760> there's<00:03:30.760> our<00:03:30.909> that<00:03:33.420> even

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
look at that there's our that even

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.729 
look at that there's our that even
though<00:03:34.510> they<00:03:34.599> are<00:03:34.720> differently<00:03:35.170> shaped<00:03:35.410> these

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
though they are differently shaped these

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.740 
though they are differently shaped these
are<00:03:35.890> both<00:03:36.010> 11<00:03:36.340> quart<00:03:36.549> buckets<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.239> the

standard garden hose just filled that 11
quart<00:03:40.330> bucket<00:03:40.690> and<00:03:41.200> I'm<00:03:41.739> sitting<00:03:42.069> look

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
quart bucket and I'm sitting look

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.080 
quart bucket and I'm sitting look
thinking<00:03:42.640> maybe<00:03:42.790> we're<00:03:43.030> 25%<00:03:43.900> full<00:03:44.170> on<00:03:44.440> the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
thinking maybe we're 25% full on the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.069 
thinking maybe we're 25% full on the
pocket<00:03:46.090> hose<00:03:46.239> ultra<00:03:46.390> side<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.900> things

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
definitely filling that faster now now

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.240 
definitely filling that faster now now
that<00:03:49.930> it's<00:03:50.049> got<00:03:50.170> all<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.379> water<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:50.920> work<00:03:51.040> with

consider in this experiment I got some

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.710 
consider in this experiment I got some
statistical<00:04:08.109> variance<00:04:08.560> on<00:04:08.739> my<00:04:08.859> pants<00:04:09.190> there

statistical variance on my pants there
okay<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.930> know<00:04:11.079> some<00:04:11.319> of<00:04:11.349> the<00:04:11.470> water<00:04:11.620> sprayed

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
okay I know some of the water sprayed

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.640 
okay I know some of the water sprayed
out<00:04:12.160> I<00:04:12.370> would<00:04:12.760> say<00:04:12.790> let's<00:04:13.690> call<00:04:13.930> it<00:04:14.109> a<00:04:14.200> minute

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
out I would say let's call it a minute

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.830 
out I would say let's call it a minute
to<00:04:15.129> fill<00:04:15.489> the<00:04:15.640> bucket<00:04:15.940> up<00:04:16.060> and<00:04:16.359> we'll<00:04:16.690> just

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
to fill the bucket up and we'll just

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.569 
to fill the bucket up and we'll just
round<00:04:17.049> it<00:04:17.260> off<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.410> that<00:04:17.739> okay<00:04:18.340> that's<00:04:18.400> about

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
round it off to that okay that's about

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.949 
round it off to that okay that's about
where<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:18.910> other<00:04:19.060> one<00:04:19.239> was<00:04:19.389> at<00:04:19.539> a<00:04:19.570> minute<00:04:19.840> so

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
where the other one was at a minute so

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.159 
where the other one was at a minute so
45<00:04:20.380> seconds<00:04:20.889> so<00:04:21.310> 25%<00:04:22.270> faster<00:04:22.479> went<00:04:22.930> under

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
45 seconds so 25% faster went under

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.629 
45 seconds so 25% faster went under
these<00:04:23.289> conditions<00:04:23.770> so<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.099> regular<00:04:24.370> garden

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
these conditions so the regular garden

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.480 
these conditions so the regular garden
hose<00:04:24.820> does<00:04:25.120> have<00:04:25.389> better<00:04:25.630> water<00:04:26.020> flow<00:04:26.490> under

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
hose does have better water flow under

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.920 
hose does have better water flow under
pretty<00:04:27.639> much<00:04:27.789> all<00:04:27.970> conditions<00:04:28.450> but<00:04:28.630> it's<00:04:28.780> not

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
pretty much all conditions but it's not

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.810 
pretty much all conditions but it's not
as<00:04:29.139> much<00:04:29.410> as<00:04:29.590> it<00:04:29.740> seemed<00:04:30.099> when<00:04:30.460> they<00:04:30.550> were<00:04:30.610> both

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
as much as it seemed when they were both

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.159 
as much as it seemed when they were both
sharing<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.300> faucet<00:04:31.720> because<00:04:31.990> of<00:04:32.080> the

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
sharing the faucet because of the

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.839 
sharing the faucet because of the
difference<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.530> water<00:04:32.710> pressure<00:04:33.039> makes<00:04:33.400> in

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
difference the water pressure makes in

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:36.810 
difference the water pressure makes in
the<00:04:34.510> pocket<00:04:35.260> hose<00:04:35.410> ultra<00:04:35.620> so<00:04:36.460> it's<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.669> same

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
the pocket hose ultra so it's the same

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.250 
the pocket hose ultra so it's the same
pressure<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.419> smaller<00:04:37.660> opening<00:04:38.110> I'm

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
pressure and the smaller opening I'm

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.680 
pressure and the smaller opening I'm
thinking<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.710> spray<00:04:39.070> out<00:04:39.400> of<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:39.849> pocket

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
thinking the spray out of the pocket

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.330 
thinking the spray out of the pocket
hose<00:04:40.720> ultra<00:04:40.960> how<00:04:41.349> to<00:04:41.410> be<00:04:41.590> three<00:04:41.889> to<00:04:42.010> four<00:04:42.160> times

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
hose ultra how to be three to four times

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.010 
hose ultra how to be three to four times
further<00:04:42.760> than<00:04:42.940> the<00:04:43.240> standard<00:04:43.630> hose<00:04:43.780> let's

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
further than the standard hose let's

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:59.760 
further than the standard hose let's
look<00:04:44.169> at<00:04:44.289> that<00:04:58.289> here's<00:04:59.289> what<00:04:59.440> you're<00:04:59.590> really

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
look at that here's what you're really

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.200 
look at that here's what you're really
paying<00:05:00.010> for<00:05:00.130> with<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:00.520> pocket<00:05:00.880> hose<00:05:01.000> after

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
paying for with the pocket hose after

and take care of compared to this which

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.450 
and take care of compared to this which
is<00:05:22.750> a<00:05:22.780> regular<00:05:23.169> 50<00:05:23.500> foot<00:05:23.650> garden<00:05:23.979> hose<00:05:24.160> which

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
is a regular 50 foot garden hose which

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.339 
is a regular 50 foot garden hose which
is<00:05:24.610> going<00:05:24.760> to<00:05:24.820> end<00:05:25.000> up<00:05:25.180> spread<00:05:25.630> out<00:05:25.810> across<00:05:26.080> the

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
is going to end up spread out across the

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:27.390 
is going to end up spread out across the
driveway<00:05:26.590> out<00:05:27.099> and

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
driveway out and

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.950 
driveway out and
long<00:05:27.580> possibly<00:05:28.210> getting<00:05:28.389> run<00:05:28.570> over<00:05:28.660> by<00:05:28.810> the

long possibly getting run over by the

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.330 
long possibly getting run over by the
lawnmowers<00:05:29.410> so<00:05:29.650> that's<00:05:29.830> what<00:05:30.009> you<00:05:30.100> got<00:05:30.220> the

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
lawnmowers so that's what you got the

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.760 
lawnmowers so that's what you got the
deal<00:05:30.460> with<00:05:30.699> but<00:05:31.240> your<00:05:31.389> regular<00:05:31.720> hose<00:05:31.930> now<00:05:32.710> the

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
deal with but your regular hose now the

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.980 
deal with but your regular hose now the
pocket<00:05:33.460> hose<00:05:33.580> basically<00:05:34.120> to<00:05:34.210> be<00:05:34.330> successful

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
pocket hose basically to be successful

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.659 
pocket hose basically to be successful
since<00:05:35.290> it's<00:05:35.530> obviously<00:05:35.860> much<00:05:36.039> easier<00:05:36.070> to<00:05:36.520> take

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
since it's obviously much easier to take

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.310 
since it's obviously much easier to take
care<00:05:36.880> of<00:05:36.910> when<00:05:37.060> you're<00:05:37.180> done<00:05:37.300> using<00:05:37.509> it<00:05:37.780> needs

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
care of when you're done using it needs

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.320 
care of when you're done using it needs
to<00:05:38.620> be<00:05:38.770> at<00:05:38.919> least<00:05:39.009> comparable<00:05:39.580> in<00:05:39.880> terms<00:05:40.120> of

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
to be at least comparable in terms of

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.110 
to be at least comparable in terms of
water<00:05:40.539> flow<00:05:40.930> water<00:05:41.680> pressure<00:05:42.120> versatility

and<00:05:43.270> being<00:05:43.479> used<00:05:43.750> with<00:05:44.020> different<00:05:44.229> nozzles

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
and being used with different nozzles

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.560

and<00:05:45.430> for<00:05:45.580> different<00:05:45.699> functions<00:05:45.970> around<00:05:46.360> your

and for different functions around your

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.330 
and for different functions around your
house<00:05:46.690> so<00:05:47.380> if<00:05:47.500> it<00:05:47.620> meets<00:05:47.770> all<00:05:47.949> those<00:05:48.039> criteria

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
house so if it meets all those criteria

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.150 
house so if it meets all those criteria
I<00:05:48.759> think<00:05:48.789> it<00:05:49.120> wins<00:05:49.360> just<00:05:49.750> because<00:05:50.470> it's<00:05:51.009> so

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
I think it wins just because it's so

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.260 
I think it wins just because it's so
easy<00:05:51.340> to<00:05:51.430> take<00:05:51.639> care<00:05:51.850> of<00:05:51.910> when<00:05:52.030> you're<00:05:52.150> done

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
easy to take care of when you're done

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.900 
easy to take care of when you're done
with<00:05:52.449> it<00:05:52.479> price-wise<00:05:53.440> my<00:05:54.190> big<00:05:54.400> hose<00:05:54.610> it

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
with it price-wise my big hose it

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.370 
with it price-wise my big hose it
actually<00:05:55.300> is<00:05:55.419> a<00:05:55.449> little<00:05:55.720> bit<00:05:55.840> higher<00:05:56.020> grade

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
actually is a little bit higher grade

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.900 
actually is a little bit higher grade
one<00:05:56.560> it's<00:05:56.740> supposed<00:05:57.039> to<00:05:57.160> be<00:05:57.310> one<00:05:57.460> that<00:05:57.580> doesn't

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
one it's supposed to be one that doesn't

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.960 
one it's supposed to be one that doesn't
kink<00:05:58.150> and<00:05:58.710> can<00:05:59.710> withstand<00:05:59.889> some<00:06:00.370> UV<00:06:00.669> so<00:06:00.850> it's

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
kink and can withstand some UV so it's

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.550 
kink and can withstand some UV so it's
about<00:06:01.060> forty<00:06:01.419> dollars<00:06:01.720> for<00:06:01.750> that<00:06:02.050> 50<00:06:02.410> foot

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
about forty dollars for that 50 foot

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.290 
about forty dollars for that 50 foot
hose<00:06:02.590> at<00:06:03.070> the<00:06:03.100> home-improvement<00:06:03.610> store

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
hose at the home-improvement store

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.840 
hose at the home-improvement store
versus<00:06:04.870> a<00:06:04.900> 50<00:06:05.380> foot<00:06:05.500> pocket<00:06:05.919> hose<00:06:06.039> ultra<00:06:06.280> which

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
versus a 50 foot pocket hose ultra which

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.790 
versus a 50 foot pocket hose ultra which
goes<00:06:07.150> for<00:06:07.680> $19.99

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
goes for $19.99

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.310 
goes for $19.99
now<00:06:09.160> if<00:06:09.610> the<00:06:09.850> pocket<00:06:10.210> hose<00:06:10.360> if<00:06:10.900> they<00:06:11.110> have

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
now if the pocket hose if they have

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.900 
now if the pocket hose if they have
actually<00:06:11.560> improved<00:06:11.979> the<00:06:12.190> strength<00:06:12.460> of<00:06:12.610> it<00:06:12.699> so

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
actually improved the strength of it so

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.520 
actually improved the strength of it so
the<00:06:13.030> issues<00:06:13.330> don't<00:06:13.510> happen<00:06:13.900> with<00:06:14.050> it<00:06:14.139> popping

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
the issues don't happen with it popping

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.290 
the issues don't happen with it popping
so<00:06:14.710> easily<00:06:14.889> if<00:06:15.190> they<00:06:15.340> have<00:06:15.490> made<00:06:15.760> it<00:06:15.910> so<00:06:15.940> that

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
so easily if they have made it so that

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.210 
so easily if they have made it so that
that<00:06:16.330> outer<00:06:16.750> nylon<00:06:17.199> webbing<00:06:17.410> doesn't<00:06:17.889> tear<00:06:18.070> as

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
that outer nylon webbing doesn't tear as

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.890 
that outer nylon webbing doesn't tear as
easily<00:06:18.400> if<00:06:18.880> the<00:06:19.030> connectors<00:06:19.449> to<00:06:19.479> the<00:06:19.630> faucet

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
easily if the connectors to the faucet

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.260 
easily if the connectors to the faucet
don't<00:06:20.349> crack<00:06:20.650> or<00:06:20.949> leak<00:06:21.130> as<00:06:21.310> easily<00:06:21.699> then<00:06:22.240> I

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
don't crack or leak as easily then I

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.610 
don't crack or leak as easily then I
think<00:06:22.539> they<00:06:22.660> have<00:06:22.840> a<00:06:22.870> winner<00:06:23.110> just<00:06:23.410> have<00:06:23.530> to

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
think they have a winner just have to

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.350 
think they have a winner just have to
use<00:06:23.800> it<00:06:23.830> and<00:06:24.099> see<00:06:24.250> and<00:06:24.460> I'll<00:06:24.550> report<00:06:24.849> back<00:06:24.940> in<00:06:25.300> a

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
use it and see and I'll report back in a

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.790 
use it and see and I'll report back in a
couple<00:06:25.479> months<00:06:25.780> I'll<00:06:26.050> put<00:06:26.229> a<00:06:26.259> link<00:06:26.470> to<00:06:26.650> the

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
couple months I'll put a link to the

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.860 
couple months I'll put a link to the
update<00:06:27.160> video<00:06:27.490> here<00:06:27.970> that<00:06:28.090> will<00:06:28.539> let<00:06:28.660> you<00:06:28.750> know

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
update video here that will let you know

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.150 
update video here that will let you know
if<00:06:28.960> it's<00:06:29.080> still<00:06:29.289> working<00:06:29.470> for<00:06:29.740> me<00:06:29.800> I'll<00:06:29.949> try<00:06:30.099> to

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
if it's still working for me I'll try to

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.650 
if it's still working for me I'll try to
give<00:06:30.340> it<00:06:30.370> a<00:06:30.460> good<00:06:30.580> workout<00:06:31.000> so<00:06:31.210> if<00:06:31.330> it<00:06:31.419> is<00:06:31.539> gonna

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
give it a good workout so if it is gonna

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.629 
give it a good workout so if it is gonna
break<00:06:31.990> under<00:06:32.320> normal<00:06:32.770> use<00:06:33.130> at<00:06:33.340> least<00:06:33.430> I'll

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:33.639 
break under normal use at least I'll

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:35.760 
break under normal use at least I'll
have<00:06:33.789> an<00:06:33.910> idea<00:06:34.210> early<00:06:34.599> on<00:06:34.750> for<00:06:35.139> now<00:06:35.260> I<00:06:35.289> can<00:06:35.620> say

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
have an idea early on for now I can say

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:36.960 
have an idea early on for now I can say
as<00:06:35.830> they<00:06:35.979> seem<00:06:36.220> to<00:06:36.250> be<00:06:36.460> aware<00:06:36.699> of<00:06:36.760> the

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
as they seem to be aware of the

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.000 
as they seem to be aware of the
weaknesses<00:06:37.539> with<00:06:37.930> the<00:06:38.139> design<00:06:38.440> of<00:06:38.770> the<00:06:38.889> old

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
weaknesses with the design of the old

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.710 
weaknesses with the design of the old
pocket<00:06:39.310> hose<00:06:39.669> and<00:06:40.000> they've<00:06:40.150> tried<00:06:40.389> to<00:06:40.539> fix

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
pocket hose and they've tried to fix

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.300 
pocket hose and they've tried to fix
them<00:06:40.840> in<00:06:40.930> the<00:06:40.990> pocket<00:06:41.289> hose<00:06:41.410> ultra<00:06:41.560> if<00:06:42.099> the

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
them in the pocket hose ultra if the

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.600 
them in the pocket hose ultra if the
three<00:06:42.520> times<00:06:42.729> stronger<00:06:43.090> does<00:06:43.659> refer<00:06:44.199> to

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
three times stronger does refer to

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.860 
three times stronger does refer to
ability<00:06:45.610> to<00:06:45.880> deal<00:06:46.060> with<00:06:46.270> higher<00:06:46.539> water

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
ability to deal with higher water

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.260 
ability to deal with higher water
pressures<00:06:47.349> especially<00:06:47.830> over<00:06:48.099> 100<00:06:48.430> psi<00:06:48.849> that's

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
pressures especially over 100 psi that's

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.879 
pressures especially over 100 psi that's
going<00:06:49.419> to<00:06:49.479> make<00:06:49.599> a<00:06:49.630> big<00:06:49.870> difference<00:06:49.990> the<00:06:50.650> fact

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
going to make a big difference the fact

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:53.040 
going to make a big difference the fact
that<00:06:51.010> it<00:06:51.159> doesn't<00:06:51.310> contract<00:06:51.880> as<00:06:52.240> much<00:06:52.750> or<00:06:52.960> as

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
that it doesn't contract as much or as

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.230 
that it doesn't contract as much or as
quickly<00:06:53.320> as<00:06:53.710> last<00:06:54.159> year's<00:06:54.400> version<00:06:54.610> makes<00:06:55.000> me

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
quickly as last year's version makes me

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.460 
quickly as last year's version makes me
think<00:06:55.479> they're<00:06:55.630> using<00:06:55.960> a<00:06:56.020> different<00:06:56.320> type<00:06:56.440> of

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
think they're using a different type of

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.770 
think they're using a different type of
tubing<00:06:56.979> and<00:06:57.159> they've<00:06:57.610> sacrificed<00:06:57.880> some<00:06:58.659> of

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:58.780 
tubing and they've sacrificed some of

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.110 
tubing and they've sacrificed some of
that<00:06:58.960> contract<00:06:59.710> ability<00:07:00.220> for<00:07:00.760> strength

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
that contract ability for strength

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.200 
that contract ability for strength
hopefully<00:07:01.690> also<00:07:02.110> they<00:07:02.560> have<00:07:03.159> updated<00:07:03.550> the

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
hopefully also they have updated the

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.120 
hopefully also they have updated the
webbing<00:07:04.720> at<00:07:04.900> least<00:07:05.080> with<00:07:05.260> the<00:07:05.380> solar<00:07:05.650> stripe

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.130 
webbing at least with the solar stripe

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.010 
webbing at least with the solar stripe
on<00:07:06.370> it<00:07:06.490> whatever<00:07:06.669> that<00:07:06.940> does<00:07:07.150> and<00:07:07.419> then<00:07:07.870> they

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 
on it whatever that does and then they

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.990 
on it whatever that does and then they
claim<00:07:08.349> to<00:07:08.380> have<00:07:08.650> made<00:07:08.680> the<00:07:09.099> connectors<00:07:09.760> in

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
claim to have made the connectors in

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.820 
claim to have made the connectors in
some<00:07:10.659> improvements<00:07:11.169> to<00:07:11.199> the<00:07:11.380> connectors

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:11.830 
some improvements to the connectors

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.969 
some improvements to the connectors
there<00:07:12.340> now<00:07:12.490> orange<00:07:12.940> instead<00:07:13.690> of<00:07:13.810> black<00:07:14.020> they

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:14.979 
there now orange instead of black they

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:16.379 
there now orange instead of black they
may<00:07:15.159> be<00:07:15.220> a<00:07:15.340> different<00:07:15.699> type<00:07:15.820> of<00:07:15.849> plastic

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:16.389 
may be a different type of plastic

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:17.850 
may be a different type of plastic
that's<00:07:16.510> more<00:07:16.750> durable<00:07:17.199> now<00:07:17.500> they're<00:07:17.620> out<00:07:17.710> they

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860 
that's more durable now they're out they

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.860 
that's more durable now they're out they
haven't<00:07:18.039> gone<00:07:18.280> is<00:07:18.610> putting<00:07:19.000> brass<00:07:19.240> connectors

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:19.870 
haven't gone is putting brass connectors

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.779 
haven't gone is putting brass connectors
on<00:07:20.020> so<00:07:20.320> there's<00:07:20.500> really<00:07:20.620> a<00:07:20.979> much<00:07:21.550> better

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:21.789 
on so there's really a much better

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:23.909 
on so there's really a much better
connection<00:07:22.449> to<00:07:22.570> the<00:07:22.780> faucet<00:07:23.020> and<00:07:23.380> also<00:07:23.620> to<00:07:23.680> the

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 
connection to the faucet and also to the

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:27.210
