00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
what it does as we mentioned before is

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.380 
what it does as we mentioned before is
it<00:02:03.009> puts<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:03.399> face<00:02:03.579> on<00:02:03.819> who<00:02:03.999> some<00:02:04.240> of<00:02:04.270> these

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
it puts a face on who some of these

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.109

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
because people like they're policemen

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.720 
because people like they're policemen
they<00:02:37.420> like<00:02:37.720> their<00:02:38.019> firefighters<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.640> of

course they like their teachers on and

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.869 
course they like their teachers on and
and<00:02:41.680> that's<00:02:41.829> what<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.069> Obama<00:02:42.310> campaign<00:02:42.430> is

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
and that's what the Obama campaign is

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.460 
and that's what the Obama campaign is
trying<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.180> play<00:02:43.359> on<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.690> thought<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> very

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
trying to play on I thought a very

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.680 
trying to play on I thought a very
effective<00:02:44.859> foray<00:02:45.370> into<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.150> because<00:02:46.480> Mitt

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
effective foray into that because Mitt

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.420 
effective foray into that because Mitt
Romney<00:02:47.019> is<00:02:47.140> always<00:02:47.500> super<00:02:47.769> vague<00:02:48.129> when

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
Romney is always super vague when

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.520 
Romney is always super vague when
talking<00:02:48.700> about<00:02:48.910> these<00:02:49.299> things<00:02:49.569> then<00:02:50.140> Romney

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
talking about these things then Romney

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.710 
talking about these things then Romney
comes<00:02:50.739> back<00:02:50.980> i<00:02:51.010> think<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:52.060> know<00:02:52.090> coming<00:02:52.599> off

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
comes back i think you know coming off

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.099 
comes back i think you know coming off
of<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:53.440> Obama<00:02:54.120> gaffe<00:02:55.120> which<00:02:55.510> was<00:02:55.720> certainly<00:02:56.019> a

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
of the Obama gaffe which was certainly a

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.979 
of the Obama gaffe which was certainly a
gaff<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.709> it's<00:02:57.190> where<00:02:57.849> Obama<00:02:58.660> said<00:02:58.959> the

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
gaff and it's where Obama said the

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.710 
gaff and it's where Obama said the
private<00:02:59.500> sector<00:02:59.829> is<00:02:59.889> doing<00:03:00.099> fine<00:03:00.519> Mitt<00:03:01.359> Romney

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
private sector is doing fine Mitt Romney

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.569 
private sector is doing fine Mitt Romney

where<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.459> comedy<00:03:06.760> just<00:03:06.940> didn't<00:03:07.239> work<00:03:07.329> this

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
where the comedy just didn't work this

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.170 
where the comedy just didn't work this

again that was an rnc at it wasn't paid

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.830 
again that was an rnc at it wasn't paid
for<00:03:48.530> by<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.680> Romney<00:03:49.280> campaign<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:50.390> takes

to the Mulligan as an idea and that

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.240 
to the Mulligan as an idea and that
somebody<00:03:54.049> would<00:03:54.140> get<00:03:54.290> another<00:03:54.590> shot<00:03:54.890> first<00:03:55.129> of

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
somebody would get another shot first of

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.410 
somebody would get another shot first of
all<00:03:55.340> I<00:03:55.370> don't<00:03:55.700> think<00:03:55.909> you're<00:03:56.030> getting<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.299> lot

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
all I don't think you're getting a lot

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.970 
all I don't think you're getting a lot
of<00:03:56.480> votes<00:03:56.750> from<00:03:56.870> people<00:03:57.170> who<00:03:57.260> don't<00:03:57.290> play<00:03:57.650> golf

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
of votes from people who don't play golf

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.100 
of votes from people who don't play golf
there<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.489> Mulligan<00:03:58.940> is<00:03:59.120> sort<00:03:59.629> of<00:03:59.659> an<00:03:59.750> arcane

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
there the Mulligan is sort of an arcane

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.009 
there the Mulligan is sort of an arcane
term<00:04:00.440> but<00:04:01.190> use<00:04:01.549> all<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:02.000> time<00:04:02.209> for<00:04:02.569> golfers

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
term but use all the time for golfers

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.170 
term but use all the time for golfers
and<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.560> think<00:04:03.799> there's<00:04:04.010> a<00:04:04.099> in<00:04:04.549> popular<00:04:05.000> culture

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
and I think there's a in popular culture

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.360 
and I think there's a in popular culture
it's<00:04:05.870> known<00:04:06.230> what<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.530> mulligan<00:04:06.739> is<00:04:07.069> but<00:04:07.280> it

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
it's known what a mulligan is but it

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.860 
it's known what a mulligan is but it
doesn't<00:04:07.640> spread<00:04:07.849> much<00:04:08.090> further<00:04:08.299> than<00:04:08.450> that

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
doesn't spread much further than that

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.410 
doesn't spread much further than that
also<00:04:09.680> mulligan<00:04:10.099> is<00:04:10.190> taking<00:04:10.579> another<00:04:11.090> shot

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
also mulligan is taking another shot

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.119 
also mulligan is taking another shot
here<00:04:11.780> they<00:04:11.959> show<00:04:12.170> him<00:04:12.290> taking<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.709> same<00:04:12.890> shot

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
here they show him taking the same shot

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.819 
here they show him taking the same shot
over<00:04:13.489> and<00:04:13.609> over<00:04:13.730> and<00:04:13.940> over<00:04:14.030> again<00:04:14.299> I<00:04:14.870> just<00:04:15.650> feel

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
over and over and over again I just feel

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.469 
over and over and over again I just feel
like<00:04:15.890> they<00:04:16.160> have<00:04:16.190> an<00:04:16.519> opportunity<00:04:16.820> here<00:04:17.209> when

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
like they have an opportunity here when

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.909 
like they have an opportunity here when
you<00:04:17.600> have<00:04:17.750> somebody<00:04:18.019> making<00:04:18.350> saying

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
you have somebody making saying

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.189 
you have somebody making saying
something<00:04:19.370> like<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.669> President<00:04:20.120> did<00:04:20.299> when<00:04:21.169> he

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
something like the President did when he

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.170 
something like the President did when he
said<00:04:21.560> you<00:04:22.010> know<00:04:22.160> that<00:04:22.460> give<00:04:22.729> us<00:04:22.850> the<00:04:23.000> time
