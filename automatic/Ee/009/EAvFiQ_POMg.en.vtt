code<00:02:00.990> for<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.740> whoever<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.700> want<00:02:02.909> to

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
code for you and whoever you want to

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.910 
code for you and whoever you want to
share<00:02:03.119> with<00:02:03.360> would<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:03.750> take<00:02:04.020> their<00:02:04.439> cue<00:02:04.799> our

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
share with would then take their cue our

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.700 
share with would then take their cue our
scanning<00:02:05.219> application<00:02:05.930> turn<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.140> hover<00:02:07.560> it

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
scanning application turn it on hover it

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.570 
scanning application turn it on hover it
over<00:02:07.890> your<00:02:08.129> device<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.970> would<00:02:09.090> scan

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
over your device and it would scan

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.340 
over your device and it would scan
that<00:02:09.940> image<00:02:10.210> right<00:02:10.390> off<00:02:10.540> of<00:02:10.690> your<00:02:10.900> phone<00:02:11.080> and

that image right off of your phone and

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.150 
that image right off of your phone and
they<00:02:11.410> would<00:02:11.530> automatically<00:02:11.920> have<00:02:12.130> that

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
they would automatically have that

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.490 
they would automatically have that
application<00:02:12.850> that<00:02:12.880> whatever<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.570> may<00:02:13.720> be<00:02:13.750> so

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
application that whatever it may be so

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.330 
application that whatever it may be so
that's<00:02:14.590> pretty<00:02:14.890> cool

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
that's pretty cool

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.860 
that's pretty cool
the<00:02:15.580> other<00:02:15.700> cool<00:02:15.910> thing<00:02:15.970> too<00:02:16.330> is<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:16.600> can<00:02:16.720> also

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
the other cool thing too is you can also

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.750 
the other cool thing too is you can also
do<00:02:17.080> something<00:02:17.290> like<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:18.190> know<00:02:18.280> tap<00:02:18.520> my

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
do something like you know tap my

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.110 
do something like you know tap my
profile<00:02:19.240> it'll<00:02:19.930> generate<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.620> code<00:02:20.980> for<00:02:21.790> your

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
profile it'll generate a code for your

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.660 
profile it'll generate a code for your
information<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.990> they<00:02:23.800> can<00:02:23.980> scan<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.430> and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
information and they can scan that and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.790 
information and they can scan that and
it<00:02:24.760> will<00:02:24.850> add<00:02:25.000> them<00:02:25.240> or<00:02:25.780> add<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.170> into<00:02:26.620> their

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
it will add them or add you into their

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.560 
it will add them or add you into their
address<00:02:27.370> book<00:02:27.550> automatically<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:28.390> it's<00:02:28.510> a

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
address book automatically so it's a

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.060 
address book automatically so it's a
neat<00:02:28.720> way<00:02:28.870> of<00:02:29.020> exchanging<00:02:29.260> business<00:02:29.800> cards

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
neat way of exchanging business cards

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.740 
neat way of exchanging business cards
without<00:02:30.460> actually<00:02:30.970> exchanging<00:02:31.390> business

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
without actually exchanging business

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.770 
without actually exchanging business
cards<00:02:31.960> so<00:02:32.610> that's<00:02:33.610> about<00:02:33.820> it<00:02:34.000> for<00:02:34.210> QR<00:02:34.540> codes

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
cards so that's about it for QR codes

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.620 
cards so that's about it for QR codes
hope<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.380> enjoyed
