stays<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:20.600> I'm<00:01:21.600> going<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.990> make<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.409> thing

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
stays on I'm going to make this thing

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.820 
stays on I'm going to make this thing
here<00:01:23.159> bigger<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.229> shouldn't<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.590> tacked

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
here bigger so I shouldn't have tacked

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.819 
here bigger so I shouldn't have tacked
it<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.990> I'm<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.200> make<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.500> bigger

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
it but I'm going to make this bigger

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.420 
it but I'm going to make this bigger
like<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:30.299> big<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.259> can<00:01:31.560> turn<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.860> lot<00:01:32.250> more

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
like that big so it can turn a lot more

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.940 
like that big so it can turn a lot more
because<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:33.600> full<00:01:33.869> lock<00:01:34.140> which<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.500> full<00:01:34.740> up

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
because that full lock which is full up

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.050 
because that full lock which is full up
there<00:01:35.689> there<00:01:36.689> are<00:01:36.750> any<00:01:36.840> turns<00:01:37.140> like<00:01:37.470> 4<00:01:38.460> 45

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
there there are any turns like 4 45

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.600 
there there are any turns like 4 45
degrees<00:01:39.689> maybe<00:01:39.900> 40<00:01:40.259> degrees<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:43.770> I'm<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.520> to

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
degrees maybe 40 degrees so I'm going to

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.030 
degrees maybe 40 degrees so I'm going to
make<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.060> concerned<00:01:45.540> like<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:48.090> much<00:01:49.040> so

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
make it so concerned like that much so

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.370 
make it so concerned like that much so
that's<00:01:50.610> pretty<00:01:50.790> easy<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:51.420> yeah<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.350> just

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
that's pretty easy but yeah it just

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.560 
that's pretty easy but yeah it just
doesn't<00:01:52.950> turn<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.280> off<00:01:55.790> fold<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.909> all<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.329> and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
doesn't turn it off fold it all that and

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.110 
doesn't turn it off fold it all that and
on<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.899> sides<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.469> stuff

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
on the sides and stuff

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.719 
on the sides and stuff
welded<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:01.240> seat<00:02:01.479> again<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.340> then<00:02:03.340> I<00:02:03.460> saved

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
welded the seat again and then I saved

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.060 
welded the seat again and then I saved
this<00:02:04.210> one<00:02:04.270> for<00:02:04.510> last<00:02:04.810> because<00:02:05.080> I<00:02:05.560> knew<00:02:05.920> you'd

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
this one for last because I knew you'd

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.070 
this one for last because I knew you'd
screw<00:02:06.310> up<00:02:06.520> all<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.700> other<00:02:06.880> ones<00:02:07.030> i<00:02:07.299> started

with<00:02:08.289> those<00:02:09.009> two<00:02:09.280> there<00:02:09.429> because<00:02:09.700> they<00:02:09.819> don't

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
with those two there because they don't

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000 
with those two there because they don't
have<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.240> be<00:02:10.390> strong<00:02:11.110> so<00:02:11.319> I<00:02:11.350> practiced<00:02:11.590> on<00:02:11.920> my

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.850 
and then I did this one the seat I did
the<00:02:21.100> seat<00:02:21.310> not<00:02:21.550> sort<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.090> first<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.630> then<00:02:23.380> I

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
the seat not sort of first and then I

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.729 
the seat not sort of first and then I
did<00:02:24.220> this<00:02:24.310> one<00:02:24.520> last<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.540> knew<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:25.959> would<00:02:26.290> get<00:02:26.470> a

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
did this one last so knew I would get a

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.910 
did this one last so knew I would get a
better<00:02:27.160> world<00:02:27.840> I'm<00:02:28.840> pretty<00:02:29.080> happy<00:02:29.290> with<00:02:29.560> it<00:02:29.620> I

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
better world I'm pretty happy with it I

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.330 
better world I'm pretty happy with it I
think<00:02:30.819> I<00:02:30.910> might<00:02:31.120> put<00:02:31.330> a<00:02:31.360> little<00:02:31.750> cross<00:02:32.739> you

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
think I might put a little cross you

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.120 
think I might put a little cross you
know<00:02:33.430> bar<00:02:33.700> across<00:02:33.940> there<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.440> maybe<00:02:35.440> across

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
know bar across there and maybe across

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.280 
know bar across there and maybe across
there<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.790> at<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.690> front<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.959> don't<00:02:38.140> really

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
there and at the front I don't really

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.390 
there and at the front I don't really
have<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.500> worry<00:02:38.530> about<00:02:40.560> that's<00:02:41.560> an<00:02:41.709> okay<00:02:42.040> world

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
have to worry about that's an okay world

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.479 
have to worry about that's an okay world
not<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.570> great<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:45.040> ones<00:02:45.220> on<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.370> bottom

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
not that great the ones on the bottom

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.400 
not that great the ones on the bottom
are<00:02:45.880> all<00:02:46.000> right<00:02:46.150> but<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.630> have<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.019> grind<00:02:47.230> them

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
are all right but I have to grind them

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.550 
are all right but I have to grind them
off<00:02:47.560> because<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.930> world's<00:02:50.200> at<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.350> bottom

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
off because the world's at the bottom

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.590 
off because the world's at the bottom
here<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.070> world<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.340> bottom<00:02:51.610> there<00:02:51.820> hit

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
here and the world the bottom there hit

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.310 
here and the world the bottom there hit
this<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.080> they<00:02:53.200> make<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:53.800> it's<00:02:53.950> like<00:02:54.130> that

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
this so they make it so it's like that

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.229 
this so they make it so it's like that
far<00:02:56.320> away<00:02:56.410> from<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.739> frame<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.250> then<00:02:58.090> the

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
far away from the frame and then the

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.190 
far away from the frame and then the
other<00:02:58.360> one<00:02:58.450> might<00:02:58.720> be<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.930> little<00:02:59.050> bit

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
other one might be a little bit

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.110 
other one might be a little bit
different<00:02:59.530> so<00:02:59.739> I'm<00:03:00.280> going<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.519> change<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:00.970> got

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
different so I'm going to change I got

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.970 
different so I'm going to change I got
to<00:03:01.209> grind<00:03:01.360> that<00:03:01.540> off<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:02.140> they<00:03:02.260> sit<00:03:02.319> flat<00:03:02.800> on

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
to grind that off so they sit flat on

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.199 
to grind that off so they sit flat on
the<00:03:03.069> bottom<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:05.590> engine<00:03:05.860> should<00:03:06.070> be<00:03:06.250> all<00:03:07.150> I

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
the bottom the engine should be all I

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.509 
the bottom the engine should be all I
got<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.510> do<00:03:07.600> tomorrow<00:03:08.049> is<00:03:08.680> i'll<00:03:08.890> probably<00:03:09.070> do<00:03:09.310> a

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
got to do tomorrow is i'll probably do a

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.610 
got to do tomorrow is i'll probably do a
few<00:03:09.880> cross<00:03:10.150> sections<00:03:10.570> there<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.380> there

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
few cross sections there and there

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.560 
few cross sections there and there
that's<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.130> so<00:03:12.730> that's<00:03:12.910> a<00:03:13.030> parts<00:03:13.329> really

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
that's it so that's a parts really

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.960 
that's it so that's a parts really
strong<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.110> i<00:03:14.500> might<00:03:14.680> might<00:03:15.400> do<00:03:15.579> one<00:03:15.670> just<00:03:15.880> up

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
strong and i might might do one just up

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.670 
strong and i might might do one just up
front<00:03:16.239> in<00:03:16.810> case<00:03:16.959> it<00:03:17.110> hit<00:03:17.200> something<00:03:17.590> and

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
front in case it hit something and

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.009 
front in case it hit something and
lengthen<00:03:18.370> that<00:03:18.489> steering<00:03:18.880> then<00:03:19.750> i<00:03:19.780> can<00:03:19.989> just

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
lengthen that steering then i can just

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.630 
lengthen that steering then i can just
mount<00:03:20.260> everything<00:03:20.829> doesn't<00:03:21.220> take<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:21.579> long

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
mount everything doesn't take that long

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.850 
mount everything doesn't take that long
to<00:03:21.790> mount<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.299> then<00:03:22.930> I<00:03:23.019> just<00:03:23.170> got<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.380> well<00:03:23.620> a

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
to mount it and then I just got a well a

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.190 
to mount it and then I just got a well a
little<00:03:24.100> plate<00:03:24.400> over<00:03:25.360> on<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.660> side<00:03:25.690> just<00:03:26.110> like

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
little plate over on that side just like

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.020 
little plate over on that side just like
a<00:03:26.400> bit<00:03:27.400> of<00:03:27.519> angle<00:03:27.850> iron<00:03:27.970> or<00:03:28.239> something<00:03:29.790> for<00:03:30.790> my

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
a bit of angle iron or something for my

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.509 
a bit of angle iron or something for my
caliper<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:32.650> is<00:03:32.769> a<00:03:32.799> little<00:03:33.040> thing<00:03:33.190> I<00:03:33.280> made

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
crappy because i had the settings on too

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.150 
crappy because i had the settings on too
high<00:03:55.180> so<00:03:55.480> it<00:03:55.570> melted<00:03:55.900> it<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.200> now<00:03:56.769> just<00:03:56.950> try<00:03:57.130> to

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
high so it melted it and now just try to

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.620 
high so it melted it and now just try to
put<00:03:57.340> world<00:03:57.640> over<00:03:57.940> it<00:03:58.060> like<00:03:58.209> on<00:03:58.359> a<00:03:58.390> little

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
put world over it like on a little

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.970 
put world over it like on a little
setting<00:03:58.900> but<00:03:59.019> it<00:03:59.079> just<00:03:59.170> made<00:03:59.320> a<00:03:59.350> massive<00:03:59.560> blob

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
setting but it just made a massive blob

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.120 
setting but it just made a massive blob
as<00:04:00.670> you<00:04:00.790> can<00:04:00.910> see<00:04:01.350> i<00:04:02.350> got<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:02.829> settings

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
as you can see i got the settings

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.180 
as you can see i got the settings
mastered<00:04:03.640> down<00:04:04.530> but<00:04:05.530> that's<00:04:05.620> pretty<00:04:05.859> strong

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
mastered down but that's pretty strong

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.220 
mastered down but that's pretty strong
still<00:04:06.519> but<00:04:07.150> I'm<00:04:07.269> hoping<00:04:07.540> my<00:04:07.660> go-kart<00:04:08.049> will<00:04:08.139> be

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
still but I'm hoping my go-kart will be

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.259 
still but I'm hoping my go-kart will be
pretty<00:04:08.380> strong<00:04:08.650> but<00:04:08.859> yet<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:09.220> just<00:04:09.699> do<00:04:09.790> a.m.

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
pretty strong but yet I just do a.m.

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.870 
pretty strong but yet I just do a.m.
tomorrow<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:11.049> cross<00:04:11.500> section<00:04:11.829> across<00:04:11.980> there

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
tomorrow a cross section across there
