out and that's the one that runs this
computer

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.460 

our<00:04:25.410> no<00:04:25.770> pardon<00:04:26.069> meets<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.400> bottom<00:04:26.610> computer

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
our no pardon meets the bottom computer

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.930 
our no pardon meets the bottom computer
so<00:04:28.470> he<00:04:28.500> took<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.889> lid<00:04:29.069> off<00:04:29.100> it<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:29.669> there's<00:04:29.880> a

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
so he took the lid off it and there's a

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.390 
so he took the lid off it and there's a
capacitor<00:04:30.720> inside<00:04:31.110> that's<00:04:31.410> gone<00:04:31.620> black<00:04:31.949> it

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
capacitor inside that's gone black it

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.460 
capacitor inside that's gone black it
needs<00:04:32.610> to<00:04:32.729> be<00:04:32.880> replaced<00:04:33.150> maybe<00:04:33.539> a<00:04:33.660> TV<00:04:33.960> or<00:04:34.259> radio

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
needs to be replaced maybe a TV or radio

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:41.930 
needs to be replaced maybe a TV or radio
guy<00:04:34.830> could<00:04:35.240> put<00:04:36.240> a<00:04:36.300> new<00:04:36.479> one<00:04:36.630> in

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.940 

that's<00:04:42.420> the<00:04:42.660> issue<00:04:42.750> with<00:04:43.080> this<00:04:43.230> machine<00:04:43.620> other

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
that's the issue with this machine other

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.050 
that's the issue with this machine other
than<00:04:44.040> that<00:04:44.250> it<00:04:44.430> was<00:04:44.520> working<00:04:44.970> great

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.480 

relatively<00:04:48.650> it's<00:04:49.650> in<00:04:49.860> what's<00:04:50.040> called<00:04:50.190> limp

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
relatively it's in what's called limp

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.340 
relatively it's in what's called limp
mode<00:04:50.730> now<00:04:50.940> have<00:04:51.150> eliminated<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:51.900> bypassed

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
mode now have eliminated and bypassed

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.020 
mode now have eliminated and bypassed
all<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.720> electronic<00:04:54.720> functions<00:04:55.610> so<00:04:56.610> run<00:04:56.910> on

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
all the electronic functions so run on

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:06.270 
all the electronic functions so run on
it's<00:04:57.180> manual<00:04:57.510> throttle

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.530 

but<00:05:06.790> it's<00:05:06.940> really<00:05:07.120> slow

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
but it's really slow

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.330 
but it's really slow
it's<00:05:08.900> basically<00:05:09.290> like<00:05:09.500> Dee<00:05:09.710> stroking<00:05:10.220> the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
it's basically like Dee stroking the

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.100 
it's basically like Dee stroking the
pump

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.790 

so<00:05:14.260> it'll<00:05:14.380> function<00:05:14.970> but<00:05:15.970> it's<00:05:16.260> it's<00:05:17.260> not<00:05:17.590> at

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
so it'll function but it's it's not at

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.830 
so it'll function but it's it's not at
full<00:05:18.010> speed<00:05:18.340> not<00:05:18.790> at<00:05:18.910> full<00:05:19.060> power<00:05:19.300> and<00:05:19.720> it's

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
full speed not at full power and it's

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.020 
full speed not at full power and it's
not<00:05:20.050> load<00:05:20.320> sensing<00:05:20.680> or

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:30.070 

some<00:05:24.270> works

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:38.690 

it's<00:05:30.560> sort<00:05:30.860> of<00:05:30.949> usable<00:05:31.520> but<00:05:31.669> it's<00:05:31.849> not<00:05:32.030> proper

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.240 

that<00:05:39.300> bucket<00:05:39.720> linkage<00:05:40.080> is<00:05:40.260> real<00:05:40.470> tight<00:05:40.740> it's

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
that bucket linkage is real tight it's

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.850 
that bucket linkage is real tight it's
as<00:05:41.400> tight<00:05:41.580> as<00:05:41.760> a

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.100 

just<00:05:45.189> about<00:05:45.400> as<00:05:45.550> Titus<00:05:45.909> in<00:05:46.030> my<00:05:46.150> newer<00:05:46.330> ones<00:05:46.629> I

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
just about as Titus in my newer ones I

00:05:47.110 --> 00:06:05.410 
just about as Titus in my newer ones I
think<00:05:47.409> it's<00:05:47.530> been<00:05:47.710> done<00:05:47.860> once

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.330 

if<00:06:05.840> you're<00:06:06.110> the<00:06:06.290> engine<00:06:06.620> sputter<00:06:06.950> a<00:06:07.040> little

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
if you're the engine sputter a little

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.040 
if you're the engine sputter a little
bit<00:06:07.460> that's<00:06:07.640> because<00:06:08.000> there's<00:06:08.210> a<00:06:08.270> wire<00:06:08.780> that

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
bit that's because there's a wire that

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.420 
bit that's because there's a wire that
goes<00:06:09.110> to<00:06:09.230> the<00:06:11.320> to<00:06:12.320> the<00:06:12.440> electric<00:06:12.860> fuel<00:06:13.160> lift

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
goes to the to the electric fuel lift

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.250 
goes to the to the electric fuel lift
pump<00:06:13.730> that<00:06:14.150> isn't<00:06:14.570> hooked<00:06:14.660> to<00:06:14.840> the<00:06:14.960> battery

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
pump that isn't hooked to the battery

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.170 
pump that isn't hooked to the battery
right<00:06:15.440> now<00:06:15.500> so<00:06:15.830> it's<00:06:15.980> just<00:06:16.100> trying<00:06:16.250> to<00:06:16.400> suck

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
right now so it's just trying to suck

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.200 
right now so it's just trying to suck
its<00:06:17.390> fuel<00:06:17.630> from<00:06:17.840> the<00:06:17.900> tank<00:06:18.730> so<00:06:19.730> it's<00:06:19.820> got<00:06:19.940> a<00:06:19.970> few

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
its fuel from the tank so it's got a few

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.290 
its fuel from the tank so it's got a few
little<00:06:20.390> issues<00:06:20.570> but<00:06:21.230> it's<00:06:22.070> all<00:06:22.280> there<00:06:22.490> and<00:06:22.760> a

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
little issues but it's all there and a

selling<00:06:40.070> it<00:06:40.400> is<00:06:40.520> I<00:06:40.550> run<00:06:40.820> newer<00:06:41.030> equipment<00:06:41.630> I

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
selling it is I run newer equipment I

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.260 
selling it is I run newer equipment I
rent<00:06:42.020> them<00:06:42.140> out<00:06:42.320> this<00:06:42.710> machine<00:06:42.920> is<00:06:43.280> just<00:06:43.550> it's

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
rent them out this machine is just it's

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.120 
rent them out this machine is just it's
just<00:06:44.480> too<00:06:44.600> old<00:06:44.780> to<00:06:44.960> put<00:06:45.110> out<00:06:45.230> on<00:06:45.380> a<00:06:45.410> rental<00:06:45.860> it's

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.130 
just too old to put out on a rental it's

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.560 
just too old to put out on a rental it's
if<00:06:46.400> I<00:06:46.490> was<00:06:46.580> going<00:06:46.700> to<00:06:46.730> owner/operator<00:06:47.360> it<00:06:47.480> I'd

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.570 
if I was going to owner/operator it I'd

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.090 
if I was going to owner/operator it I'd
probably<00:06:47.600> fix<00:06:48.140> it<00:06:48.320> and<00:06:48.410> keep<00:06:48.560> it<00:06:48.770> I<00:06:48.860> kind<00:06:49.070> of

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
probably fix it and keep it I kind of

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.700 
probably fix it and keep it I kind of
like<00:06:49.250> the<00:06:49.430> machine<00:06:49.760> but<00:06:50.050> it<00:06:51.050> just<00:06:51.260> doesn't<00:06:51.560> fit

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
like the machine but it just doesn't fit

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.340
