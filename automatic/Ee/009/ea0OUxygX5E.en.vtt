 Hello everyone, this is a kind of eagle son . 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:15.000
 today we train bust and disassemble 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.260
 the song 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.039
 tenderness which probably quail 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.529
 half the country 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.810
 This music Pakhmutova not a word for 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.919
 my dobronravov how I read from 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.380
 movie three poplars on all the pines 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.579
 she is known for the same price maternity 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.579
 give a recipe 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.860
 the land is empty without you 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.930
 I have a few hours to live 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:08.159
 also butted foliage so 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:14.060
 and somewhere in a hurry taxi just empty 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:24.220
 on earth alone without you 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:24.220
 and you fly and they give you their stars 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.049
 not 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.640
 it was just empty on earth 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.969
 but 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.969
 and when flying 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.420
 and 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.880
 so did the foliage in the gardens 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.070
 I could not even think of you 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.070
 land 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:02:02.960
 how long to live and without it 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.010
 and then 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:12.680
 all stars to him 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:14.319
 from his 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.769
 but 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.769
 gone 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.590
 but 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.280
 empty plus 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.850
 but 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.850
 family 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.580
 all u can believe 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.110
 in russia begins 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.020
 on this map 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.080
 so he play with us all open strings 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:03:01.700
 except 4 5 4 5 and clamped on the second 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:04.180
 it turns out 0002 but I play with brute force 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.180
 six 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.680
 about 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.780
 about 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.450
 so it turns out the bases in the minor minor are gay 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.460
 6th string 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.490

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.390
 m-can 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.420
 second line is the same 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.420
 but 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.120

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:52.080
 up to 7 taxis 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.370
