00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.960
 such it is not on 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:36.490
 hello this video review from the portal 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.460

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.980
 Today we will talk about the expected many 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.280
 fans of post-apocalypse game under 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.980
 name metro ray of hope metro did 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.489
 a long release was postponed a few times 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.110
 during this time managed destroyer and publisher 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.390
 May 18th the game is finally available on 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.739
 territory of the cis and now everyone can 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.489
 continue the story 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:03.600
 started in the first part so start the beam 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:07.960
 hope this is a direct continuation of the subway 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.030
 2033 released in 2010 by mat 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.909
 the book of the same name by Dmitry Glukhovsky 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.490
 the game turned out to be ambiguous cons 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.680
 It was almost more than plus but all 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.740
 the same love of players the game was able to win 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.070
 this time we were promised a correction of all 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.890
 mistakes and improvements to the old aspects of the game 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.400
 3 years have passed and we see that we are not 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.290
 lied to the plot has become much better 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.170
 opponents smarter left 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.510
 component of the game brought to mind now 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.070
 on on the lynch will not work out especially 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.830
 on a high level of difficulty 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.090
 immediately grab a bullet in the forehead and pass 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.580
 him in stealth mode 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.800
 one pleasure is immediately remembered 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.010
 sensational hitman or dysonord 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.140
 following is everywhere it is not you perfectly 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.870
 sees enemies so twist or 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.940
 break light bulbs and cut down beautifully 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.830
 enemies are much more interesting than simple 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.380
 shooting 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.470
 Do not forget the developers about the new weapon 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.780
 now it has become a little more 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.320
 and shooting has become much more adequate 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.450
 also new types of mutants appeared alone 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.390
 of them resemble caterpillars others 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.480
 scorpions and with each one you need 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.020
 fight on its own the game does not give 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.720
 fall asleep 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.790
 now and then throw a new player 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.060
 adventure dive into the game perfectly 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.810
 this is particularly facilitated by the dialogues of 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.080
 which player 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.660
 by the way can learn a lot of new little 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.570
 tell you then he is worth a look at 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.880
 Beautiful view of the destroyed Moscow 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.550
 elaborated thanks laval 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.310
 the designers of the first part showed it to us 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.170
 quite a glimpse and here the lesson will be on 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.569
 surface about 40 times 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.959
 and another 10 percent will be from someone 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.410
 run away while shooting the rest 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.650
 part of the game 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.940
 under the board and station most often 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.140
 accompanied by mate and also cancer 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.560
 will have the opportunity to ride on 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.230
 car hive armored train which more 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.300
 destroyer beam tanks from the first part well 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.970
 no matter how good the game she herself 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.010
 there are shortcomings some of them are stories 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.780
 them a little but still they are not 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.170
 convenience optimization is not perfect in 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.349
 some scenes waist up 75 or 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.270
 less I hope it will get better but that is not 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.730
 correct it so called it 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.530
 elsi groups suffered the same fate as 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.960
 many other projects when i invented 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.370
 something cut out and then sell them for 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.110
 money 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.170
 the developers decided to cut out of the game 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.830
 difficulty mode ranger which first 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.530
 part of the lips for free to sell it for 129 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.080
 world pre-ordered and therefore using mode 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.910
 for free but what else do we do 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.540
 here for higher complexity or 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.430
 score and 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.280
 suspecting that it will simply download 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.010
 pre-installed version 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.860
 we even come in cons not game very 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.230
 I liked it if you have after 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.200
 passages of the game remain pleasant 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.040
 feelings and you want to plunge again 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.620
 it's an adventure 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.620
 you hardly call the game bad
