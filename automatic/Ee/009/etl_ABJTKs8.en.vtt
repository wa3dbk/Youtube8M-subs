getting all the gear together and it was

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.750 
getting all the gear together and it was
really<00:00:15.590> intimidating<00:00:16.590> for<00:00:16.920> me<00:00:17.070> because<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.609> had

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
really intimidating for me because I had

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.720 
really intimidating for me because I had
no<00:00:17.970> idea<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.449> there<00:00:18.660> are<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.080> many<00:00:19.470> hoses<00:00:20.100> so

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
no idea that there are so many hoses so

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.300 
no idea that there are so many hoses so
many<00:00:20.999> clips<00:00:21.900> everything<00:00:22.560> like<00:00:22.679> that<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:23.099> only

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
many clips everything like that I only

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.339 
many clips everything like that I only
thought<00:00:23.669> that<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:24.210> know<00:00:24.329> get<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.599> tank<00:00:24.990> and

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
thought that you know get a tank and

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:26.870 
thought that you know get a tank and
then<00:00:25.499> you<00:00:25.619> had<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> hose<00:00:26.070> from<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.789> you

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
then you had a hose from that that you

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.050 
then you had a hose from that that you
breathe<00:00:27.179> through<00:00:27.419> so<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.560> was<00:00:29.060> overwhelming

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
breathe through so it was overwhelming

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.990 
breathe through so it was overwhelming
kind<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.509> to<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.079> huge<00:00:31.499> apparatus<00:00:32.340> with

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
kind of to have this huge apparatus with

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.880 
kind of to have this huge apparatus with
tons<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.600> different<00:00:33.750> hoses<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.560> connect

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
tons of different hoses that connect

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.310 
tons of different hoses that connect
into<00:00:35.190> different<00:00:35.489> things<00:00:35.629> but<00:00:36.629> Annie<00:00:36.899> had<00:00:36.989> us

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
into different things but Annie had us

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.799 
into different things but Annie had us
go<00:00:37.530> over<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.980> several<00:00:38.250> times<00:00:38.699> so<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.059> connected

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
go over it several times so we connected

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.689 
go over it several times so we connected
things<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.320> took<00:00:40.920> them<00:00:41.070> apart<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.670> he

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
things and took them apart so he

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:44.090 
things and took them apart so he
understood<00:00:42.269> what<00:00:42.539> each<00:00:42.750> part<00:00:43.410> meant<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.949> why

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
understood what each part meant and why

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.240 
understood what each part meant and why
it<00:00:44.160> was<00:00:44.430> there<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.899> was<00:00:46.109> really<00:00:46.710> good<00:00:47.039> and

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
it was there so that was really good and

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.580 
it was there so that was really good and
interesting<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.940> see<00:00:48.149> how<00:00:48.390> everything<00:00:49.050> really

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
interesting to see how everything really

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.979 
interesting to see how everything really
worked<00:00:49.949> and<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.120> got<00:00:51.300> into<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> pool

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
worked and then we got into the pool

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.849 
worked and then we got into the pool
which<00:00:52.769> was<00:00:52.800> really<00:00:53.129> exciting<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:55.500> took<00:00:55.710> my

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
which was really exciting and I took my

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.770 
which was really exciting and I took my
first<00:00:56.160> breath<00:00:56.489> underwater<00:00:56.940> using<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
first breath underwater using the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.130 
first breath underwater using the
regulator<00:00:58.640> which<00:00:59.640> was<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> crazy<00:01:00.420> experience

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
regulator which was a crazy experience

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.430 
regulator which was a crazy experience
because<00:01:01.980> you're<00:01:02.850> used<00:01:03.179> to<00:01:03.359> breathing<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:04.080> land

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
because you're used to breathing on land

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.740 
because you're used to breathing on land
with<00:01:04.920> air<00:01:05.280> around<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.150> all<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.390> sudden

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
with air around you and all of a sudden

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.200 
with air around you and all of a sudden
you're<00:01:07.020> submerged<00:01:07.800> underwater<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:09.000> so

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
you're submerged underwater and so

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.210 
you're submerged underwater and so
everything<00:01:09.659> around<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.170> liquid<00:01:10.829> and<00:01:11.040> it's

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
everything around you is liquid and it's

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.600 
everything around you is liquid and it's
totally<00:01:11.579> a<00:01:12.090> much<00:01:12.840> denser<00:01:13.250> substance<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.549> you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
totally a much denser substance and you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.370 
totally a much denser substance and you
can<00:01:14.820> feel<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.240> all<00:01:15.540> around<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:16.079> and<00:01:16.110> your

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
can feel it all around you and your

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.490 
can feel it all around you and your
breathing<00:01:16.860> something<00:01:17.640> that's<00:01:18.030> not<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.259> same

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
breathing something that's not the same

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.190 
breathing something that's not the same
substance<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.280> you're<00:01:20.810> surrounded<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:21.960> I

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
substance that you're surrounded in I

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.520 
substance that you're surrounded in I
didn't<00:01:22.710> feel<00:01:22.890> like<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.100> mermaid<00:01:23.490> at<00:01:23.880> first

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
didn't feel like a mermaid at first

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.660 
didn't feel like a mermaid at first
definitely<00:01:25.530> because<00:01:25.860> there's<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.369> much<00:01:26.610> stuff

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
definitely because there's so much stuff

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.080 
definitely because there's so much stuff
going<00:01:27.149> on<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.110> felt<00:01:28.740> very<00:01:29.009> bulky<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.700> was<00:01:29.820> hard

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
going on I felt very bulky it was hard

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.840 
going on I felt very bulky it was hard
to<00:01:30.180> move<00:01:30.540> around<00:01:31.159> we<00:01:32.159> practiced<00:01:32.700> swimming

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
to move around we practiced swimming

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.109 
to move around we practiced swimming
