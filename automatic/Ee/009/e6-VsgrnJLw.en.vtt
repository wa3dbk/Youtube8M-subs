able to get get loans and then that's a

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.140 
able to get get loans and then that's a
real<00:03:15.530> problem<00:03:15.739> so<00:03:16.070> that's<00:03:16.519> point<00:03:16.700> number<00:03:16.820> one

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
real problem so that's point number one

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.509 
real problem so that's point number one
and<00:03:17.180> then<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:18.560> then<00:03:18.680> long-term<00:03:18.890> we've<00:03:19.310> just

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
and then and then long-term we've just

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.060 
and then and then long-term we've just
got<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.870> figure<00:03:20.870> out<00:03:21.110> how<00:03:21.260> are<00:03:21.380> we<00:03:21.500> investing

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
got to figure out how are we investing

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.550 
got to figure out how are we investing
to<00:03:22.640> make<00:03:22.760> ourselves<00:03:22.910> more<00:03:23.180> productive<00:03:23.810> in

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
to make ourselves more productive in

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.960 
to make ourselves more productive in
this<00:03:24.799> global<00:03:25.310> economy<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.850> that<00:03:25.910> means

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
this global economy and that means

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.880 
this global economy and that means
investing<00:03:26.780> in<00:03:26.900> infrastructure<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.680> means
