see how this investigation plays out how

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.559 
see how this investigation plays out how

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
independent it really is what it

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.960 
independent it really is what it
uncovers<00:03:50.199> and<00:03:50.470> I<00:03:51.129> think<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.459> will<00:03:51.519> be<00:03:51.669> a<00:03:51.699> case

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
uncovers and I think it will be a case

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.270 
uncovers and I think it will be a case
if<00:03:52.180> anything<00:03:52.540> does<00:03:52.750> happen<00:03:53.099> most<00:03:54.099> of<00:03:54.220> the
