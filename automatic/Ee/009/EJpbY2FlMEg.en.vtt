00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello my name is benders today 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.960
 we look at one interesting mod we 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.080
 This is me from tepco as soon as I remove the mod 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.660
 everything turned like you banned okay not 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.089
 take offense what are you but happens all your 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.820
 finish shorter and today look at 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.500
 my friends who are very very very 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.869
 interesting for those who like to play with 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.029
 friends on servers and on their servers 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.920
 that is, if for example rented somewhere 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.800
 server all where the best servers 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.269
 yeah i know i rent there too in general 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.830
 and if you for example on player has 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.219
 my server passed by default 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.510
 you don't have any plugins and 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.340
 accordingly, if I go to the server, I 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.829
 I can open any chest 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.870
 your chest and friend can open too 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.059
 not any cancer can open and here 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.250
 today's mod will help help such 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.469
 I personally do not like situations 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.300
 plugins don't really like plugins they 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.520
 decide some part of minekravt 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.949
 something residential you now know exactly 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.460
 that you cannot overcome wood 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.890
 a door 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.079
 but what is it this is funny or are you not 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.120
 can break a stone too stupid 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.299
 enough and here's the current mod decides 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.100
 this problem completely yes now if you 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.640
 play without a plugin on private and on 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100
 server 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.670
 you still have the opportunity to hide 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.400
 your belongings safe banter most safe 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.530
 real safe and it is him today we 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.610
 crafting and testing along with 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.890
 you and so 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.259
 from the first thing we need to do it 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.990
 kraft kraft it as follows from 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.420
 iron blocks and ingots lay out 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.090
 the next craft is quite expensive for you 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.430
 I will say but it's worth it and we get a safe 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.920
 real safe and by the way it's all on 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.500

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.409

 getting ready to blow this damn safe 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.760
 there is nothing in it but it doesn't matter to us 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.400
 the main thing to see if he can take a punch 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.280

 I set I can not break it 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.730
 it would be stupid enough if the other 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.130
 a player could break no other player 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.620
 he can not break it and that's it 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.930

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.970
 that he adds one safe but enough 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.830
