what people are going to be wearing from
here<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.989> but<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> interesting<00:00:52.980> thing<00:00:53.160> about

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
here on but the interesting thing about

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.459 
here on but the interesting thing about
our<00:00:53.670> trend<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.449> what<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.440> have

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
our trend is what we have is we have

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.709 
our trend is what we have is we have
different<00:00:55.949> areas<00:00:56.399> within<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.879> haircut<00:00:57.300> that

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
different areas within a haircut that

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.049 
different areas within a haircut that
basically<00:00:58.140> serve<00:00:58.469> different<00:00:58.680> purposes<00:00:59.059> there

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
basically serve different purposes there

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.240 
basically serve different purposes there
are<00:01:00.149> longer<00:01:00.359> areas<00:01:00.960> there<00:01:01.289> are<00:01:01.320> shorter<00:01:01.829> areas

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
are longer areas there are shorter areas

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.369 
are longer areas there are shorter areas
the<00:01:02.640> shorter<00:01:03.000> areas<00:01:03.300> compact<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.989> hair<00:01:04.170> down

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the shorter areas compact the hair down

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.080 
the shorter areas compact the hair down
so<00:01:04.890> what<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.430> get<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.580> contrast

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
so what you do is you get a contrast

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.080 
so what you do is you get a contrast
between<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.750> flatter<00:01:07.229> area<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.310> longer<00:01:08.549> area

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
between a flatter area and a longer area

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.789 
between a flatter area and a longer area
I<00:01:09.270> think<00:01:09.659> what's<00:01:09.780> involved<00:01:10.140> with<00:01:10.409> these<00:01:10.530> looks

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
I think what's involved with these looks

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.469 
I think what's involved with these looks
is<00:01:11.010> don't<00:01:11.250> look<00:01:11.549> at<00:01:11.700> them<00:01:11.850> they're<00:01:12.240> being<00:01:12.450> very

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
is don't look at them they're being very

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.660 
is don't look at them they're being very
short<00:01:12.990> or<00:01:13.170> very<00:01:13.380> long<00:01:13.650> look<00:01:14.070> at<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.280> flavor

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
short or very long look at the flavor

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.330 
short or very long look at the flavor
and<00:01:15.119> he<00:01:15.299> kind<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.720> they<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.229> kind<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.920> feeling

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
and he kind of they have kind of feeling

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.039 
and he kind of they have kind of feeling
in<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.490> spirit<00:01:17.880> that's<00:01:18.000> going<00:01:18.299> on<00:01:18.450> there<00:01:18.900> have

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
in a spirit that's going on there have

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.690 
in a spirit that's going on there have
to<00:01:19.140> be<00:01:19.170> worn<00:01:19.530> long

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
to be worn long

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.280 
to be worn long
could<00:01:21.700> be<00:01:21.790> worn<00:01:22.030> on<00:01:22.120> any<00:01:22.420> kind<00:01:22.810> of<00:01:22.930> person<00:01:23.260> that

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
could be worn on any kind of person that

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.960 
could be worn on any kind of person that
you<00:01:23.470> want<00:01:23.500> to<00:01:23.680> work<00:01:23.830> in<00:01:24.040> on<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.460> be<00:01:24.580> here<00:01:24.820> is

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
you want to work in on to be here is

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.760 
you want to work in on to be here is
there<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.600> most<00:01:25.840> important<00:01:26.290> thing<00:01:26.350> with<00:01:26.650> I

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
there the most important thing with I

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.280 
there the most important thing with I
philosophy<00:01:27.400> is<00:01:27.610> to<00:01:27.670> focus<00:01:28.420> on<00:01:28.720> creating<00:01:28.990> an

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
philosophy is to focus on creating an

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.010 
philosophy is to focus on creating an
overall<00:01:29.680> facial<00:01:29.890> consider<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:30.970> ideal<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.900> if

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
overall facial consider the ideal and if

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.630 
overall facial consider the ideal and if
you<00:01:32.110> don't<00:01:32.350> know<00:01:32.530> what<00:01:32.740> an<00:01:32.860> ideal<00:01:33.220> overall

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
you don't know what an ideal overall

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.640 
you don't know what an ideal overall
patient<00:01:33.820> looks<00:01:34.270> like<00:01:34.510> this<00:01:35.080> is<00:01:35.229> what<00:01:35.410> it<00:01:35.500> looks

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
patient looks like this is what it looks

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:43.170 
patient looks like this is what it looks
like<00:01:41.190> we<00:01:42.190> always<00:01:42.340> have<00:01:42.610> hair<00:01:42.850> which<00:01:43.060> is

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
like we always have hair which is

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.210 
like we always have hair which is
whether<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.540> ideal<00:01:43.930> very<00:01:44.470> very<00:01:44.680> pie<00:01:44.890> in<00:01:44.950> there

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
whether the ideal very very pie in there

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.710 
whether the ideal very very pie in there
but<00:01:45.490> again<00:01:45.700> I<00:01:45.850> think<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.119> most<00:01:46.210> important

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
but again I think the most important

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.330 
but again I think the most important
thing<00:01:46.750> with<00:01:46.930> fine<00:01:47.140> hair<00:01:47.170> it's<00:01:47.830> like<00:01:48.010> to<00:01:48.130> try

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
thing with fine hair it's like to try

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.770 
thing with fine hair it's like to try
and<00:01:48.460> deliberately<00:01:48.820> necessarily<00:01:49.479> make<00:01:49.630> it

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
and deliberately necessarily make it

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.290 
and deliberately necessarily make it
look<00:01:49.930> thick<00:01:50.320> or<00:01:50.650> full<00:01:51.160> but<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.820> work<00:01:52.000> with<00:01:52.180> the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
look thick or full but to work with the

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.910 
look thick or full but to work with the
fabric<00:01:52.479> and<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.899> fiber<00:01:53.140> that<00:01:53.350> you<00:01:53.470> have<00:01:53.710> I

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
fabric and the fiber that you have I

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.249 
fabric and the fiber that you have I
often<00:01:54.399> find<00:01:54.700> a<00:01:54.910> fine<00:01:55.180> hair<00:01:55.509> is<00:01:55.810> better<00:01:56.050> when

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
often find a fine hair is better when

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.960 
often find a fine hair is better when
it's<00:01:56.410> kind<00:01:56.619> of<00:01:56.710> folded<00:01:57.220> and<00:01:57.369> collected<00:01:57.850> on

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
it's kind of folded and collected on

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.460 
it's kind of folded and collected on
yourself<00:01:58.330> because<00:01:58.420> it<00:01:58.930> tends<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.200> look<00:01:59.380> more

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
yourself because it tends to look more

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.469 
yourself because it tends to look more
dense<00:01:59.770> my<00:02:00.280> favorite<00:02:00.700> technique<00:02:01.090> that<00:02:01.240> really

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
dense my favorite technique that really

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.090 
dense my favorite technique that really
kind<00:02:01.660> of<00:02:01.810> runs<00:02:01.990> through<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.320> entire<00:02:02.350> haircut

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
kind of runs through the entire haircut

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.430 
kind of runs through the entire haircut
is<00:02:03.340> really<00:02:03.759> a<00:02:03.790> graduated<00:02:04.420> technique<00:02:04.810> one<00:02:05.320> of

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
is really a graduated technique one of

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.050 
is really a graduated technique one of
the<00:02:05.500> principles<00:02:06.040> when<00:02:06.220> we<00:02:06.340> cut<00:02:06.550> hair<00:02:06.790> we<00:02:06.910> can

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
the principles when we cut hair we can

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.060 
the principles when we cut hair we can
layer<00:02:07.300> we<00:02:07.479> can<00:02:07.630> graduate<00:02:08.020> and<00:02:08.350> we<00:02:08.800> could<00:02:08.950> do

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
layer we can graduate and we could do

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.220 
layer we can graduate and we could do
one<00:02:09.489> length<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:10.239> once<00:02:10.390> we<00:02:10.540> understand<00:02:11.140> really

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
one length and once we understand really

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.110 
one length and once we understand really
the<00:02:11.470> true<00:02:11.800> technique<00:02:12.280> techniques<00:02:12.790> of<00:02:12.940> those

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
the true technique techniques of those

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.180 
the true technique techniques of those
we<00:02:13.570> can<00:02:13.720> create<00:02:13.900> any<00:02:14.140> shades<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.680> love<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.160> fact

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
we can create any shades I love the fact

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.860 
we can create any shades I love the fact
that<00:02:15.459> there's<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.760> return<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.360> technical

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
that there's a return a technical

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.020 
that there's a return a technical
haircutting<00:02:17.260> less<00:02:17.980> shipping<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.580> shopping

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
haircutting less shipping and shopping

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.790 
haircutting less shipping and shopping
and<00:02:19.180> more<00:02:19.600> about<00:02:19.870> design<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.290> structure

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
and more about design and structure

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.190 
and more about design and structure
because<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.670> think<00:02:21.820> guys<00:02:22.230> around<00:02:25.019> so<00:02:26.019> really

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
because I think guys around so really

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.870 
because I think guys around so really
what<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.440> kid<00:02:26.650> was<00:02:26.799> quite<00:02:27.010> simply<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:27.459> took<00:02:27.580> the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
what I kid was quite simply I took the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.729 
what I kid was quite simply I took the
area<00:02:28.180> which<00:02:28.299> is<00:02:28.420> from<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.720> ground<00:02:28.989> I<00:02:29.260> work

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
area which is from the ground I work

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.289 
area which is from the ground I work
very<00:02:29.769> very<00:02:30.040> closely<00:02:30.280> into<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.760> palm<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.090> the

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
very very closely into the palm of the

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.420 
very very closely into the palm of the
hands<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.780> need<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.260> be<00:02:32.350> series<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.830> diagonal

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
hands I need to be series the diagonal

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.910 
hands I need to be series the diagonal
sections<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.060> over<00:02:34.600> directing<00:02:35.170> if<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.680> think

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
sections and over directing if you think

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.590 
sections and over directing if you think
to<00:02:36.040> hear<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.370> elevate<00:02:36.790> elevate<00:02:37.180> an<00:02:37.330> event

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
to hear is elevate elevate an event

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.120 
to hear is elevate elevate an event
elevator

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
elevator

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.070 
elevator
they<00:02:38.280> elevate<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.210> transition<00:02:39.540> goes<00:02:39.870> from

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
they elevate so the transition goes from

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.230 
they elevate so the transition goes from
very<00:02:40.140> long<00:02:40.470> into<00:02:40.800> shorter<00:02:41.760> areas<00:02:42.090> that

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
very long into shorter areas that

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.570 
very long into shorter areas that
basically<00:02:42.600> are<00:02:42.900> invisible<00:02:43.320> yeah<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:44.100> love<00:02:44.460> the

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
basically are invisible yeah I love the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.490 
basically are invisible yeah I love the
way<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.790> side<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.390> take<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.870> very<00:02:46.140> short<00:02:46.320> and

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
way the side and take a very short and

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.710 
way the side and take a very short and
very<00:02:46.530> flat<00:02:46.890> but<00:02:47.370> again<00:02:47.460> be<00:02:47.730> true<00:02:47.940> here<00:02:48.300> there's

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
very flat but again be true here there's

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.970 
very flat but again be true here there's
the<00:02:48.750> little<00:02:48.930> areas<00:02:49.350> with<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.590> tartlets

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
the little areas with the tartlets

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.530 
the little areas with the tartlets
deliberately<00:02:50.430> back<00:02:50.670> down<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.210> you<00:02:51.420> can

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
deliberately back down and you can

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.270 
deliberately back down and you can
expand<00:02:51.990> to<00:02:52.140> arise<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:52.830> could<00:02:53.040> really<00:02:53.190> be

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
expand to arise and it could really be

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.340 
expand to arise and it could really be
quite<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.640> narrow<00:02:53.940> or<00:02:54.420> quite<00:02:54.780> big<00:02:55.050> but<00:02:55.080> in

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
quite a narrow or quite big but in

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.170 
quite a narrow or quite big but in
essence<00:02:55.740> this<00:02:56.250> area<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:56.670> just<00:02:56.880> layered

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
essence this area is just layered

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.030 
essence this area is just layered
through<00:02:57.420> work<00:02:57.930> through<00:02:58.230> vertically<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.890> can

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
through work through vertically you can

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.830 
through work through vertically you can
work<00:02:59.250> around<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.670> air<00:02:59.820> creating<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.660> length

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
work around the air creating the length

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.260 
work around the air creating the length
that<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.050> want<00:03:01.140> yeah<00:03:01.770> so<00:03:02.280> in<00:03:02.610> fact<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:03.030> was

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
that you want yeah so in fact I was

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.880 
that you want yeah so in fact I was
already<00:03:03.540> very<00:03:03.660> very<00:03:03.990> sure<00:03:04.200> when<00:03:04.380> she<00:03:04.500> came<00:03:04.650> in

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
already very very sure when she came in

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.860 
already very very sure when she came in
I<00:03:05.070> think<00:03:05.580> it's<00:03:05.790> easy<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.300> cut<00:03:06.450> some<00:03:06.600> is<00:03:06.720> there

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
I think it's easy to cut some is there

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.780 
I think it's easy to cut some is there
from<00:03:07.050> long<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.440> short<00:03:07.470> which<00:03:08.220> going<00:03:08.460> into

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
from long to short which going into

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.700 
from long to short which going into
transition<00:03:09.420> but<00:03:09.870> what<00:03:10.050> does<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.410> think<00:03:10.530> about

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
transition but what does it think about

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.960 
transition but what does it think about
the<00:03:10.980> hair<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.250> have<00:03:11.400> in<00:03:11.490> front<00:03:11.520> of<00:03:11.820> you

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
the hair that you have in front of you

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.450 
the hair that you have in front of you
and<00:03:12.150> how<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.600> can<00:03:12.810> make<00:03:12.990> a<00:03:13.050> change<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.740> miss<00:03:14.190> to

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
and how you can make a change to miss to

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.790 
and how you can make a change to miss to
this<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.880> this<00:03:14.910> this<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.990> making<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.350> easy

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
this to this this to making it easy

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.760 
this to this this to making it easy
suitable<00:03:17.790> practical<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.840> something<00:03:19.410> unique

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
suitable practical and something unique

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.740 
suitable practical and something unique
that<00:03:19.800> separates<00:03:20.370> me<00:03:20.640> from<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.180> sound<00:03:21.630> down

by shifting my coat the colors are used

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.490 
by shifting my coat the colors are used
here<00:05:02.360> what<00:05:03.360> she<00:05:03.600> actually<00:05:03.720> came<00:05:04.110> in<00:05:04.170> as<00:05:04.470> a
