00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
here has a tendency to kind of dig in a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.200 
here has a tendency to kind of dig in a
little<00:01:36.689> bit<00:01:37.049> if<00:01:37.229> your<00:01:37.740> shirts<00:01:37.979> tucked<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.460> it

little bit if your shirts tucked in it

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.569 
little bit if your shirts tucked in it
doesn't<00:01:39.270> bother<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.049> if<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.350> not

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
doesn't bother you but if it's not

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:50.749 
doesn't bother you but if it's not
bothers<00:01:41.579> me<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> little<00:01:41.970> bit<00:01:49.460> now<00:01:50.460> when<00:01:50.640> you're

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
bothers me a little bit now when you're

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.690 
bothers me a little bit now when you're
putting<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> putting<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.259> blade<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.460> this

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
putting the putting the blade in this

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.870 
putting the putting the blade in this
kydex<00:01:54.119> sheath<00:01:54.210> if<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.439> put<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.860> kind<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.790> at

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
kydex sheath if you put it in kind of at

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.840 
kydex sheath if you put it in kind of at
the<00:01:56.909> wrong<00:01:57.180> angle<00:01:58.040> it<00:01:59.040> kind<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.369> gets<00:01:59.460> stuck

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the wrong angle it kind of gets stuck

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.670 
the wrong angle it kind of gets stuck
even<00:02:00.060> coming<00:02:00.390> straight<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.719> sometimes<00:02:01.350> of

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
even coming straight in sometimes of

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.219 
even coming straight in sometimes of
course<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:02.009> won't<00:02:02.130> do<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.340> long<00:02:02.780> video<00:02:03.780> taping

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
course it won't do it long video taping

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.709 
course it won't do it long video taping
but<00:02:04.409> sometimes<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.460> even<00:02:05.520> gets<00:02:05.729> stuck<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.600> what

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
but sometimes it even gets stuck so what

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.540 
but sometimes it even gets stuck so what
I<00:02:06.780> tend<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.110> do<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.290> put<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.680> at<00:02:07.860> an<00:02:07.979> angle<00:02:08.099> like

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
I tend to do is put in at an angle like

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.710 
I tend to do is put in at an angle like
this

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
this

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.060 
this
well<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.930> course<00:02:11.990> now<00:02:12.320> it<00:02:12.470> gets<00:02:12.560> stuck<00:02:12.830> going

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
well of course now it gets stuck going

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.340 
well of course now it gets stuck going
like<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.370> but<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.330> can<00:02:14.480> see<00:02:14.690> sometimes<00:02:15.200> it

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
like that but you can see sometimes it

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.030 
like that but you can see sometimes it
gets<00:02:15.410> stuck<00:02:15.620> going<00:02:15.980> in<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:17.470> that's<00:02:18.470> primarily

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
gets stuck going in and that's primarily

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.250 
gets stuck going in and that's primarily
because<00:02:19.460> of<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.760> shape<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.180> blade<00:02:20.330> with

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
because of the shape of the blade with

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.870 
because of the shape of the blade with
this<00:02:21.380> being<00:02:21.560> mold<00:02:21.860> at<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.130> exact<00:02:22.520> shape<00:02:22.610> of

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
this being mold at the exact shape of

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.420 
this being mold at the exact shape of
the<00:02:22.970> blade<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:24.200> has<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:24.380> tendency<00:02:24.590> sometimes<00:02:24.920> to

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
the blade it has a tendency sometimes to

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.040 
the blade it has a tendency sometimes to
get<00:02:25.580> stuck<00:02:25.970> but<00:02:28.390> that's<00:02:29.390> not<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:29.630> big<00:02:29.720> deal

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
get stuck but that's not a big deal

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.990 
get stuck but that's not a big deal
really<00:02:30.770> bothered<00:02:31.130> me<00:02:31.250> as<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.520> comfort<00:02:31.850> issue

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
really bothered me as the comfort issue

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.690 
really bothered me as the comfort issue
with<00:02:32.240> this<00:02:32.390> right<00:02:32.600> here<00:02:33.190> but<00:02:34.190> I<00:02:34.220> do<00:02:34.340> like<00:02:34.640> the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
with this right here but I do like the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.810 
with this right here but I do like the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
idea right here you can see it's a the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.040 
idea right here you can see it's a the
blade<00:02:40.010> slightly<00:02:40.430> exposed<00:02:40.970> for<00:02:41.750> putting

mounting attachments here or options for
attachments<00:02:48.500> here<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:49.700> there's<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.630> sheath

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959
