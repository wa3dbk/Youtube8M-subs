the wires through the hole push the

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.920 
the wires through the hole push the
grommet<00:00:05.790> into<00:00:05.910> place<00:00:06.180> if<00:00:06.390> you<00:00:06.450> want<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.750> put<00:00:06.899> a

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
grommet into place if you want to put a

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.240 
grommet into place if you want to put a
little<00:00:07.080> bit<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.290> grease<00:00:07.500> on<00:00:07.680> it<00:00:07.830> so<00:00:08.010> that<00:00:08.130> it

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
little bit of grease on it so that it

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.759 
little bit of grease on it so that it
seals<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.970> little<00:00:09.150> bit<00:00:09.240> better<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.630> then<00:00:10.469> push

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
seals a little bit better and then push

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.629 
seals a little bit better and then push
press<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.490> stator<00:00:11.759> up<00:00:13.309> once<00:00:14.309> you've<00:00:14.460> got<00:00:14.610> it

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
press the stator up once you've got it

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.680 
press the stator up once you've got it
centered<00:00:16.760> you<00:00:17.760> can<00:00:17.880> kind<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.210> see<00:00:18.390> how<00:00:18.570> my

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
centered you can kind of see how my

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.300 
centered you can kind of see how my
holes<00:00:18.930> are<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> little<00:00:19.289> bit<00:00:19.470> off<00:00:19.500> for<00:00:19.890> my<00:00:19.980> timing

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
holes are a little bit off for my timing

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.490 
holes are a little bit off for my timing

position my hole is just a half a
millimeter<00:00:25.500> off<00:00:25.740> or<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.460> don't<00:00:26.519> need

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
millimeter off or so so you don't need

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.089 
millimeter off or so so you don't need
to<00:00:26.820> go<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.119> far<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.539> when<00:00:28.470> you're<00:00:28.590> doing<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
to go that far in when you're doing the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.030 
to go that far in when you're doing the
mod<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.630> go<00:00:30.689> through<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.230> drill

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
mod so I'm going to go through and drill

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.650 
mod so I'm going to go through and drill
out<00:00:32.160> those<00:00:32.399> three<00:00:32.940> holes<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.390> little<00:00:33.570> bit

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
out those three holes a little bit

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.150 
out those three holes a little bit
better<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.110> then<00:00:34.350> install<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.920> three<00:00:35.130> screws

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
better and then install the three screws

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.680 
better and then install the three screws
that<00:00:35.489> hold<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.120> timing<00:00:36.570> plate<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.590> place<00:00:38.690> now

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
that hold the timing plate in place now

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.030 
that hold the timing plate in place now
I<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.989> timing<00:00:40.379> plate<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.739> stator

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
I have the timing plate in the stator

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.830 
I have the timing plate in the stator
installed<00:00:41.550> I'm<00:00:42.000> gonna<00:00:42.210> install<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.899> flywheel

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
installed I'm gonna install the flywheel

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.150 
installed I'm gonna install the flywheel
once<00:00:45.840> again<00:00:46.079> make<00:00:46.260> sure<00:00:46.289> your<00:00:46.530> flywheel<00:00:46.770> key

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
once again make sure your flywheel key

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.830 
once again make sure your flywheel key
is<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.430> place<00:00:47.670> right<00:00:47.969> there<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.450> that's<00:00:48.719> going

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
is in place right there and that's going

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.770 
is in place right there and that's going
to<00:00:48.930> line<00:00:49.140> up<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.890> notch<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.780> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
to line up with the notch in the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.240 
to line up with the notch in the
flywheel<00:00:52.289> which<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.770> right<00:00:52.949> there<00:00:55.129> go<00:00:56.129> ahead

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
flywheel which is right there go ahead

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.450 
flywheel which is right there go ahead
and<00:00:56.340> slide<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.210> then<00:00:58.219> lock<00:00:59.219> tight

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and slide that on and then lock tight

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.790 
and slide that on and then lock tight
the<00:00:59.579> nut<00:00:59.760> nut<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.510> put<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> nut<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.109> now<00:01:01.770> I

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
the nut nut and put the nut on now I

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.820 
the nut nut and put the nut on now I
installed<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> stator<00:01:03.559> make<00:01:04.559> sure<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
installed the stator make sure the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.520 
installed the stator make sure the
flywheel<00:01:05.189> key<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.549> lined<00:01:05.820> up<00:01:05.939> with<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.150> notch

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
flywheel key is lined up with that notch

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.550 
flywheel key is lined up with that notch
the<00:01:07.530> best<00:01:07.770> bet<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.159> had<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.560> get

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the best bet that I had was to just get

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.679 
the best bet that I had was to just get
down<00:01:10.710> at<00:01:10.890> eye<00:01:11.010> level<00:01:11.040> with<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:12.119> watch

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
down at eye level with it and then watch

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.190 
down at eye level with it and then watch
inside<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.350> hole<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> flashlight<00:01:14.400> and

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
inside the hole with a flashlight and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.749 
inside the hole with a flashlight and
then<00:01:16.200> make<00:01:16.770> sure<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.009> was<00:01:17.100> lined<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.520> cuz<00:01:17.640> that

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
then make sure it was lined up cuz that

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.580 
then make sure it was lined up cuz that
key<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.090> actually<00:01:18.420> move<00:01:18.630> since<00:01:19.200> it's<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.409> moon

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
key can actually move since it's a moon

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.280 
key can actually move since it's a moon
shape<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.130> slide<00:01:20.430> around<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.170> once<00:01:22.170> you

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
shape it can slide around so once you

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.200 
shape it can slide around so once you
think<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:22.890> place<00:01:23.159> spin<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
think you have it in place spin the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.200 
think you have it in place spin the
stator<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.259> crank<00:01:25.530> should<00:01:25.770> spin<00:01:26.340> in

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
stator and the crank should spin in

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.480 
stator and the crank should spin in
conjunction<00:01:27.630> with<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.020> stator<00:01:28.290> no<00:01:29.280> matter

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
conjunction with the stator no matter

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.859 
conjunction with the stator no matter
what

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
what

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.920 
what
now<00:01:31.680> put<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.520> pretty<00:01:33.270> good<00:01:33.450> amount<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.810> blue

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
now put a pretty good amount of blue

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.990 
now put a pretty good amount of blue
loctite<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.530> here<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.340> install<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
loctite on here and then install the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.319 
loctite on here and then install the
screw<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:37.100> torque<00:01:38.100> spec<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.850> 58

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
screw and torque spec is going to be 58

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.090 
screw and torque spec is going to be 58
foot-pounds<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.350> I'm<00:01:40.439> going<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:40.710> sixty

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
foot-pounds so I'm going to do sixty

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.789 
foot-pounds so I'm going to do sixty
foot<00:01:41.340> pounds<00:01:41.700> for<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.140> nut<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.320> holds<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
foot pounds for that nut that holds the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.880 
foot pounds for that nut that holds the
flywheel<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:45.079> make<00:01:46.079> sure<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.350> use<00:01:46.619> lock

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
flywheel on I make sure you use lock

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.230 
flywheel on I make sure you use lock
tight<00:01:47.100> because<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.430> will<00:01:47.670> come<00:01:47.909> loose<00:01:48.090> if

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
tight because this will come loose if

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.789 
tight because this will come loose if
you<00:01:48.360> don't<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:48.930> make<00:01:49.110> sure<00:01:49.140> use<00:01:49.380> lock<00:01:49.560> tight<00:01:49.770> on

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
