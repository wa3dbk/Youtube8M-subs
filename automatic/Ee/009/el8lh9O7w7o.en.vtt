00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.480 

researchers<00:00:04.080> at<00:00:04.230> Harvard<00:00:04.259> actually<00:00:05.130> found<00:00:05.370> a

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
researchers at Harvard actually found a

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.579 
researchers at Harvard actually found a
way<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.670> alter<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.569> amount<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:07.049> an<00:00:07.200> enzyme

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
way to alter the amount of an enzyme

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.700 
way to alter the amount of an enzyme
called<00:00:07.910> telomere<00:00:09.050> okay<00:00:10.050> look<00:00:10.260> this<00:00:10.380> up<00:00:10.559> I

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
called telomere okay look this up I

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.360 
called telomere okay look this up I
swear<00:00:10.740> uh<00:00:11.340> an<00:00:11.700> enzyme<00:00:12.120> called<00:00:12.389> telomerase

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
swear uh an enzyme called telomerase

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.120 
swear uh an enzyme called telomerase
polymerase<00:00:14.420> telomerase<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:16.680> enzyme

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
polymerase telomerase so this enzyme

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.390 
polymerase telomerase so this enzyme
telomerase<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:18.150> uh<00:00:18.720> something<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.619> protects

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
telomerase is uh something that protects

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.750 
telomerase is uh something that protects
DNA<00:00:21.359> right<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.380> also<00:00:22.590> has<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.189> do<00:00:23.340> with<00:00:23.519> how

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
DNA right and it also has to do with how

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.570 
DNA right and it also has to do with how
fast<00:00:24.150> or<00:00:24.510> how<00:00:24.539> slow<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:25.109> age<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.189> more<00:00:26.430> of

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
fast or how slow you age so the more of

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.720 
fast or how slow you age so the more of
this<00:00:26.670> enzyme<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.330> have<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:28.019> your<00:00:28.289> DNA<00:00:28.730> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
this enzyme you have on your DNA the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.120 
this enzyme you have on your DNA the
slower<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.750> age<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.410> less<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.980> enzyme

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
slower you age the less of the enzyme

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.490 
slower you age the less of the enzyme
you<00:00:32.550> have<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.149> faster<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.719> age<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.140> they

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
you have the faster you age and they

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.770 
you have the faster you age and they
found<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:34.950> out<00:00:35.190> by<00:00:35.520> testing<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.510> mice

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
found this out by testing it on mice

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.580 
found this out by testing it on mice
okay<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.309> uh<00:00:38.670> first<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.780> all<00:00:39.870> they<00:00:40.079> had<00:00:40.290> mice

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
okay so uh first of all they had mice

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.040 
okay so uh first of all they had mice
they<00:00:41.280> altered<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.879> amount<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> enzyme<00:00:42.750> in

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
they altered the amount of the enzyme in

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.250 
they altered the amount of the enzyme in
the<00:00:43.110> mice<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:44.059> they<00:00:45.059> made<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.420> less<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the mice and they made it less so the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.190 
the mice and they made it less so the
mice<00:00:46.469> died<00:00:46.739> within<00:00:47.039> six<00:00:47.430> months<00:00:47.610> however<00:00:48.570> they

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
mice died within six months however they

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.150 
mice died within six months however they
also<00:00:49.620> bred<00:00:50.579> more<00:00:51.000> mice<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.690> they<00:00:52.530> increased

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
also bred more mice and they increased

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.569 
also bred more mice and they increased
the<00:00:53.370> amount<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.850> enzyme<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.600> them<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
the amount of this enzyme in them and

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.849 
the amount of this enzyme in them and
they<00:00:56.579> actually<00:00:57.050> reversed<00:00:58.050> when<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.530> came<00:00:58.680> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
they actually reversed when it came to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.490 
they actually reversed when it came to
aging<00:00:59.280> okay<00:00:59.879> so<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.180> give<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.690> an<00:01:00.809> example<00:01:01.170> it

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
aging okay so to give you an example it

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.189 
aging okay so to give you an example it
they<00:01:02.219> regain<00:01:02.730> their<00:01:02.940> fertility<00:01:03.300> they<00:01:04.140> were

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
they regain their fertility they were

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.280 
they regain their fertility they were
sprouting<00:01:04.830> new<00:01:04.979> neurons<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.670> their<00:01:05.790> brains

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
sprouting new neurons in their brains

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.510 
sprouting new neurons in their brains
over<00:01:07.290> okay<00:01:07.950> end<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.890> as<00:01:10.890> soon<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.310> read

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
over okay end of this as soon as I read

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.070 
over okay end of this as soon as I read
it<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.670> was<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.880> oh<00:01:12.060> she's<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.570> Lord<00:01:12.750> Mersey

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
it I was like oh she's in Lord Mersey

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.590 
it I was like oh she's in Lord Mersey
here<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.380> go<00:01:13.530> okay<00:01:14.100> more<00:01:14.600> miraculous

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
here we go okay more miraculous

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.149 
here we go okay more miraculous
breakthroughs<00:01:16.200> okay<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.960> mice<00:01:19.290> innocent

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
breakthroughs okay so the mice innocent

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.700 
breakthroughs okay so the mice innocent
in<00:01:20.280> essence<00:01:20.700> got<00:01:21.330> younger<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:22.200> got<00:01:22.439> younger

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
in essence got younger they got younger

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.880 
in essence got younger they got younger
yeah<00:01:23.009> okay<00:01:23.340> would<00:01:23.909> telomerase<00:01:24.570> okay<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.380> then

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
yeah okay would telomerase okay so then

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.749 
yeah okay would telomerase okay so then
I<00:01:25.950> was<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.189> oh<00:01:26.340> boy<00:01:26.790> there<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.689> going<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.110> be<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
I was like oh boy there is going to be a

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.060 
I was like oh boy there is going to be a
gigantic<00:01:29.759> industry<00:01:30.329> around<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.530> know<00:01:32.040> as

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
gigantic industry around this know as

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.480 
gigantic industry around this know as
there<00:01:32.520> should<00:01:32.700> be

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
there should be

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.219 
there should be
haha<00:01:35.490> let<00:01:35.850> me<00:01:35.939> let<00:01:36.150> me<00:01:36.180> clarify<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.869> because

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
haha let me let me clarify that because

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.730 
haha let me let me clarify that because
already<00:01:37.470> first<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.220> all<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.490> these<00:01:38.939> are<00:01:39.740> very

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
already first of all the these are very

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.319 
already first of all the these are very
important<00:01:41.280> studies<00:01:41.640> right<00:01:41.790> they've<00:01:42.030> done<00:01:42.210> it

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
important studies right they've done it

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.569 
important studies right they've done it
on<00:01:42.420> mice<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.649> means<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.310> more

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
on mice and that means that with more

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.190 
on mice and that means that with more
testing<00:01:45.060> more<00:01:45.240> testing<00:01:45.659> pretty<00:01:45.869> soon<00:01:46.079> they

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
testing more testing pretty soon they

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.170 
testing more testing pretty soon they
could<00:01:46.259> find<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.710> way<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.460> transfer<00:01:48.060> this

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
could find a way to transfer this

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.480 
could find a way to transfer this
information<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.840> humans<00:01:49.259> right<00:01:49.530> however<00:01:50.130> they

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
information to humans right however they

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.550 
information to humans right however they
haven't<00:01:50.729> done<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.210> yet<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.659> already<00:01:52.049> people

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
haven't done that yet and already people

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.899 
haven't done that yet and already people
are<00:01:52.740> trying<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.070> capitalize<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.610> this

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
are trying to capitalize on this

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.330 
are trying to capitalize on this
information<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.780> course<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.619> first<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.070> all<00:01:56.130> to

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
information of course so first of all to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.380 
information of course so first of all to
give<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.610> sense<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.939> study<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.299> a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
give you a sense of the study it's a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.690 
give you a sense of the study it's a
nature<00:01:57.600> magazine<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.439> done<00:01:59.310> by<00:01:59.490> Harvard

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
nature magazine and done by Harvard

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.450 
nature magazine and done by Harvard
University<00:02:00.259> researchers<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.250> nature

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
University researchers and so in nature

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.959 
University researchers and so in nature
is<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> very<00:02:03.270> well-respected<00:02:04.490> outlet<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.700> this

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
is a very well-respected outlet so this

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.119 
is a very well-respected outlet so this
is<00:02:06.119> incredibly<00:02:06.990> real<00:02:07.170> now<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.829> course<00:02:08.009> just

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
is incredibly real now of course just

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.380 
is incredibly real now of course just
because<00:02:08.369> it's<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.670> mice<00:02:08.849> doesn't<00:02:09.149> mean<00:02:09.239> that

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
because it's in mice doesn't mean that

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.790 
because it's in mice doesn't mean that
it's<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.660> humans<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.410> going<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> take

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
it's in humans and it's going to take

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.320 
it's in humans and it's going to take
years<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.310> years<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.790> figure<00:02:12.000> out<00:02:12.060> how<00:02:12.209> it

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
years and years to figure out how it

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.790 
years and years to figure out how it
works<00:02:12.540> in

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
works in

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.440 
works in
humans<00:02:13.070> and<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.760> course<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.090> has<00:02:14.210> downsides

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
humans and of course it has downsides

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.630 
humans and of course it has downsides
which<00:02:14.840> we'll<00:02:15.020> get<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.170> in<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.440> second<00:02:15.860> but

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
which we'll get to in a second but

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.460 
which we'll get to in a second but
that's<00:02:16.850> not<00:02:17.060> stopping<00:02:17.180> anybody<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:17.960> turns<00:02:18.260> out

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
that's not stopping anybody it turns out

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.250 
that's not stopping anybody it turns out
there's<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.740> plant<00:02:19.100> in<00:02:19.280> Mongolia<00:02:19.940> called

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
there's a plant in Mongolia called

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.070 
there's a plant in Mongolia called
astragalus<00:02:21.370> okay<00:02:22.630> there's<00:02:23.630> going<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.960> be<00:02:24.020> a

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
astragalus okay there's going to be a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.920 
astragalus okay there's going to be a
huge<00:02:24.590> market<00:02:24.830> in<00:02:25.160> Australia<00:02:25.430> us<00:02:25.970> now<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.510> is

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
huge market in Australia us now it is

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.340 
huge market in Australia us now it is
apparently<00:02:27.350> filled<00:02:27.680> with<00:02:27.920> telomerase<00:02:28.490> right

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
apparently filled with telomerase right

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.420 
apparently filled with telomerase right
apparently<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:30.530> could<00:02:30.650> activate<00:02:31.190> telomerase

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
apparently it could activate telomerase

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.310 
apparently it could activate telomerase
that's<00:02:32.090> already<00:02:32.390> in<00:02:32.570> your<00:02:32.690> body<00:02:32.900> or<00:02:33.170> that's

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
that's already in your body or that's

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.090 
that's already in your body or that's
much<00:02:33.560> more<00:02:33.740> accurate<00:02:34.040> sorry<00:02:34.310> yes<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:36.100> it's

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
much more accurate sorry yes and so it's

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.370 
much more accurate sorry yes and so it's
over<00:02:37.400> it's<00:02:37.970> going<00:02:38.240> to<00:02:38.300> be<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.390> run<00:02:38.660> on<00:02:38.690> Mongolia

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
over it's going to be a run on Mongolia

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.160 
over it's going to be a run on Mongolia
in<00:02:39.590> fact<00:02:40.040> there's<00:02:40.580> now<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.790> 20%<00:02:41.480> chance<00:02:41.690> we<00:02:42.050> will

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
in fact there's now a 20% chance we will

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.920 
in fact there's now a 20% chance we will
invade<00:02:42.470> Mongolia<00:02:43.070> we<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:44.210> liberation<00:02:44.840> of
