00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.950
 hi to all today so this is the 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.810
 second tip so the second video 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.919
 that I do for my advice for 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:21.779
 to take muscle so in fact there we go 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.119
 talk about indoor training you 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.710
 train at home so why 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.289
 why make a choice to train 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.650
 rather in the room or rather at home 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.400
 first point 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.690
 it's going to be actually the schedules of your 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.160
 gym that you chose and 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.960
 find out if it fits your 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.150
 way of life so if you train 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.230
 finally if you want to train 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.610
 in the gym and that you 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.260
 work night you're going to have 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.850
 maybe problems so if you 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.800
 only count on two days when you 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.340
 may be able to go that will ask 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.200
 problems 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.690
 so that's going to be the first point to 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.640
 take into account 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.160
 the second point it's going to be there the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.230
 distance you are going to have between 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.649
 you and the gym so more 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.499
 is going to be far more will have to have 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:10.009
 need motivation to start again at 

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:13.140
 sport and it's going to be a handicap 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.520
 compared to how long are you 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.020
 take on the day so if you have 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.100
 half an hour to go practice 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.380
 and that you train one hour a 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.329
 hour and a half you go quickly fast 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.729
 timed 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.840
 every day and suddenly it's not going to be 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.740
 great for your private privacy etc 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.290
 after 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.020
 for a no we'll say it's more 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.060
 profitable to train in the gym 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.729
 bodybuilding because if you want 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.640
 equipping you I calculated about that 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.649
 makes a budget of 1500 euros for 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.250
 can have an adjustable bench so 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.830
 this is the basis 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.330
 an adjustable dumbbell bench so 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.420
 halts and adjustable like with 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.310
 weight weights you can fit on 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.600
 a boat that should be bought too 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.340
 a straight bar a rack to squat and 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.729
 that's about the base that 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.409
 you need 1500 euros so we will say that 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.459
 if you have only one who is in the 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:12.340
 five senses that finally between 3 and 500 euros 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.350
 by year it's going to be not actually repay 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.690
 in a year but if you 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.330
 want to progress you have you know 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.010
 that it will take us more than a year and 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.480
 that if you remain passionate after 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.799
 three years you paid off your 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.100
 material and you can start to 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.000
 evolve 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.920
 so after really what you need to know 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.709
 is that depending on your 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.000
 availability of your work so 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.200
 whether you work day or night 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.510
 night of distance and your life one 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.850
 will say in private social quotes if 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.380
 you have children if I do not know me 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.640
 an invading person who you 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.370
 do not leave too much like that 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.739
 for an hour or two it can be 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.580
 interesting to train a home at home 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.080
 know that a room 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.340
 a home gym as it's called is 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.110
 it is very very practical it allows to 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.700
 train on weekends days 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.370
 holidays if you can not do it too much 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.670
 the week and it's still interesting 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.010
 on these points there so here after if 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.080
 you have the time and you also have 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.510
 possibilities in relation to your 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.540
 working time schedule what 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.280
 professional the gym that 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.400
 will offer you a wider choice 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.600
 of equipment a mood the 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.850
 opportunity to meet and 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.080
 so it's both possible to 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.360
 to take muscle 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.400
 whether at home or in the dining room 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.620
 just make a good balance sheet of all these 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.000
 points to leave we'll say between 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.740
 quotation marks on a good foundation and be 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.930
 sure to be able to maintain a frequency 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.160
 regular workout so that's it 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.160
 will be everything for this straw video
