so<00:05:56.830> soft<00:05:57.450> hd60<00:05:58.450> in<00:05:58.660> the<00:05:59.610> HD<00:06:00.610> software<00:06:01.180> but<00:06:01.419> map

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
so soft hd60 in the HD software but map

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.649 
so soft hd60 in the HD software but map
but<00:06:04.000> windows<00:06:04.629> at<00:06:05.560> the<00:06:05.680> moment<00:06:06.099> is<00:06:06.280> better<00:06:06.699> as

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:07.659 
but windows at the moment is better as

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.379

better<00:06:07.960> software<00:06:08.289> then<00:06:08.650> map<00:06:09.370> because<00:06:10.000> they're

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
better software then map because they're

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.899 
better software then map because they're
