00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.790 
another PC or Mac and basically I had a
little<00:00:24.269> switch<00:00:24.660> about<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.140> big<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.680> had

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
little switch about this big and you had

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.980 
little switch about this big and you had
to<00:00:25.920> plug<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.400> or<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.820> USB<00:00:27.119> connections<00:00:27.750> for

to plug in or the USB connections for
the<00:00:28.109> mouse<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> PC<00:00:29.099> -<00:00:29.939> essentially<00:00:30.480> this

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
the mouse and the PC - essentially this

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.100 
the mouse and the PC - essentially this
little<00:00:31.050> switch<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:32.130> then<00:00:32.250> use<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.180> both<00:00:33.600> PC<00:00:33.870> or

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
little switch to then use on both PC or

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.299 
little switch to then use on both PC or
Mac<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.440> now<00:00:34.559> I'm<00:00:34.649> going<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.829> demonstrate<00:00:34.980> a

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
Macs you're going to be using or going

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.319 
Macs you're going to be using or going
to<00:00:46.289> want<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.280> once<00:00:48.149> you've

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
to want to do this on once you've

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.540 
to want to do this on once you've
downloaded<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.899> software<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.590> any<00:00:49.980> machines

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
downloaded the software on any machines

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.680 
downloaded the software on any machines
you're<00:00:50.789> actually<00:00:51.000> going<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.239> using<00:00:51.449> this

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
you're actually going to be using this

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.600 
you're actually going to be using this
on<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:51.989> need<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.260> boot<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.590> on<00:00:52.680> your<00:00:52.860> main<00:00:53.070> PC

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
on you need to boot it on your main PC

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.389 
on you need to boot it on your main PC
and<00:00:53.850> set<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.510> server<00:00:54.870> then<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.920> need<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.219> set

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
and set up a server then you need to set

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.549 
and set up a server then you need to set
up<00:00:56.430> any<00:00:56.730> additional<00:00:57.360> pcs<00:00:57.809> or<00:00:58.020> Macs<00:00:58.260> as<00:00:58.530> a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
up any additional pcs or Macs as a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.319 
up any additional pcs or Macs as a
client<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.489> basically<00:00:59.730> do<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.180> by

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
client you can basically do that by

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.720 
client you can basically do that by
locking<00:01:00.690> into<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.050> IP<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.399> basically

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
locking into the IP and basically

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.299 
locking into the IP and basically
setting<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.300> up<00:01:03.359> as<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> client<00:01:04.170> device<00:01:04.680> now

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
setting it up as a client device now

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.710 
setting it up as a client device now
once<00:01:05.519> you've<00:01:05.670> done<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.240> obviously<00:01:06.360> need

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
once you've done that you obviously need

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.690 
once you've done that you obviously need
to<00:01:06.869> configure<00:01:07.200> where<00:01:08.159> you're<00:01:08.280> actually<00:01:08.400> going

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
to configure where you're actually going

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.340 
to configure where you're actually going
to<00:01:08.850> put<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> screen<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.630> obviously<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.200> my

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
to put the screen so obviously I have my

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.080 
to put the screen so obviously I have my
main<00:01:10.590> PC<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> right-hand<00:01:11.670> which<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.970> in

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
main PC on the right-hand which is in

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.850 
main PC on the right-hand which is in
the<00:01:12.150> middle<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.780> then<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> left

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
the middle here and then on the left

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.859 
the middle here and then on the left
obviously<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.369> my<00:01:14.490> macbook<00:01:14.909> pro<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.630> wherever

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
obviously of my macbook pro so wherever

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.480 
obviously of my macbook pro so wherever
your<00:01:16.080> screens<00:01:16.439> are<00:01:16.619> actually<00:01:16.860> based<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.310> your

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
your screens are actually based in your

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.130 
your screens are actually based in your
view<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.180> need<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.420> go<00:01:18.540> into<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.869> server

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
view you need to go into the server

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.870 
view you need to go into the server
configuration<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.070> drag<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.490> drop<00:01:20.670> them<00:01:20.820> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
configuration and drag and drop them to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.789 
configuration and drag and drop them to
where<00:01:21.270> they're<00:01:21.479> actually<00:01:21.600> be<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.080> here<00:01:22.350> and

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
where they're actually be on here and

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.109 
where they're actually be on here and
the<00:01:23.130> reason<00:01:23.280> I'm<00:01:23.520> not<00:01:23.640> giving<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.970> guys<00:01:24.090> a

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
the reason I'm not giving you guys a

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.480 
the reason I'm not giving you guys a
full<00:01:24.540> tutorial<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.350> simply<00:01:25.650> because<00:01:25.770> my<00:01:26.040> IP

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
full tutorial is simply because my IP

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.399 
full tutorial is simply because my IP
addresses<00:01:27.030> will<00:01:27.420> be<00:01:27.630> displayed<00:01:28.110> which<00:01:28.350> is

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
addresses will be displayed which is

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.890 
addresses will be displayed which is
obviously<00:01:28.680> quite<00:01:28.770> harmful<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.670> me<00:01:29.820> but<00:01:30.780> there

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
obviously quite harmful for me but there

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.140 
obviously quite harmful for me but there
is<00:01:30.930> lots<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.439> tutorials<00:01:32.189> online<00:01:32.430> how<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.939> do

for me because I bought all these cables

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.990 
for me because I bought all these cables
and<00:02:32.530> this<00:02:32.709> switch<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.670> was<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.790> good

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000

solution but then someone told me about

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.979 
solution but then someone told me about
this<00:02:36.010> one<00:02:36.190> I<00:02:36.220> was<00:02:36.430> like<00:02:36.550> why<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.150> hell<00:02:37.600> did<00:02:37.870> not
