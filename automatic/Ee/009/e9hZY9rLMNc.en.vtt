down strums like this let's practice

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.780 
down strums like this let's practice
let's<00:01:30.320> try<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:30.590> together<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:31.369> get<00:01:31.460> used<00:01:31.700> to

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
let's try that together to get used to

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.390 
let's try that together to get used to
going<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:32.180> that<00:01:32.360> a<00:01:32.720> chord<00:01:33.049> so<00:01:33.710> nice<00:01:34.010> and<00:01:34.250> slowly

after 4 1 2 3 4 g du and 2 a and then

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.290 
after 4 1 2 3 4 g du and 2 a and then
city<00:01:51.940> ok<00:01:52.940> next<00:01:53.149> we<00:01:53.330> have<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.970> chord<00:01:56.180> of<00:01:56.270> C

and<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:28.120> near<00:02:28.300> court<00:02:28.569> which<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.050> called

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
and the near court which is called

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.000 
and the near court which is called
e-flat<00:02:31.050> let's<00:02:32.050> look<00:02:32.200> at<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.380> new<00:02:32.500> code<00:02:32.739> first

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
e-flat let's look at the new code first

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.949 
e-flat let's look at the new code first
it's<00:02:33.340> called<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.790> flat<00:02:34.150> because<00:02:34.569> it's<00:02:34.720> played

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
it's called a flat because it's played

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.220 
it's called a flat because it's played
one<00:02:35.290> fret<00:02:35.620> or<00:02:35.860> one<00:02:36.250> semitone<00:02:36.700> lower<00:02:37.230> ie

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
one fret or one semitone lower ie

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.550 
one fret or one semitone lower ie
flatter<00:02:38.800> than<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.610> normal<00:02:39.970> ecard<00:02:40.660> so<00:02:41.290> instead

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
flatter than the normal ecard so instead

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.870 
flatter than the normal ecard so instead
of<00:02:41.650> playing<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.950> E<00:02:41.980> chord<00:02:42.250> with<00:02:42.459> your<00:02:42.580> first

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
of playing the E chord with your first

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.910 
of playing the E chord with your first
finger<00:02:43.209> on<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.390> second<00:02:43.870> fret<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:44.590> first

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
finger on the second fret of the first

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.339 
finger on the second fret of the first
string<00:02:45.069> we<00:02:46.030> played<00:02:46.300> with<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.810> first<00:02:47.019> finger

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
string we played with the first finger

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.630 
string we played with the first finger
on<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.560> first<00:02:47.709> fret<00:02:48.069> of<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.489> first<00:02:48.910> string

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
on the first fret of the first string

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.460 
on the first fret of the first string
and<00:02:51.640> third<00:02:52.390> finger<00:02:52.690> across<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.080> third<00:02:53.260> fret

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
and third finger across the third fret

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.720 
and third finger across the third fret
of<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.650> second<00:02:53.950> third<00:02:54.099> and<00:02:54.130> fourth<00:02:54.459> strings

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
of the second third and fourth strings

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.539 
of the second third and fourth strings
like<00:02:54.970> this<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:57.550> this<00:02:58.420> is<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.630> god<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:58.810> e-flat

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
like this and this is the god of e-flat

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.220 
like this and this is the god of e-flat
so<00:03:00.549> let's<00:03:01.330> look<00:03:01.450> at<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.600> first<00:03:01.810> part<00:03:01.959> of<00:03:02.110> the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
so let's look at the first part of the

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.790 
so let's look at the first part of the
song

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
song

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.410 
song
this<00:03:04.800> is<00:03:04.950> followed<00:03:05.220> by<00:03:05.250> an<00:03:05.460> E<00:03:05.670> minor<00:03:05.880> chord<00:03:06.240> and

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
this is followed by an E minor chord and

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.660 
this is followed by an E minor chord and
once<00:03:07.080> again<00:03:07.380> we<00:03:07.710> can<00:03:07.830> use<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.010> little<00:03:08.310> trick<00:03:08.430> to

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
once again we can use a little trick to

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.070 
once again we can use a little trick to
move<00:03:08.820> easily<00:03:09.150> from<00:03:09.570> G<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.410> E<00:03:10.440> minor<00:03:10.890> like<00:03:11.490> this

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
move easily from G to E minor like this

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.130 
move easily from G to E minor like this
form<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.230> G<00:03:13.380> chord<00:03:14.390> keep<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.510> G<00:03:15.660> chord<00:03:15.840> in

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
form the G chord keep the G chord in

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.110 
form the G chord keep the G chord in
place<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.770> place<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.220> tip<00:03:17.400> of<00:03:17.580> your<00:03:17.640> fourth

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
place and place the tip of your fourth

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.540 
place and place the tip of your fourth
finger<00:03:18.540> on<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:19.050> third<00:03:19.470> string<00:03:19.500> at<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.280> 4th

finger on the third string at the 4th

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.270 
finger on the third string at the 4th
fret<00:03:20.730> like<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:25.140> if<00:03:25.860> we<00:03:25.950> look<00:03:26.100> at<00:03:26.220> the

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
fret like this and if we look at the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.460 
fret like this and if we look at the
chord<00:03:26.490> diagram<00:03:26.940> now<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.930> can<00:03:28.110> see<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.350> the

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
chord diagram now you can see that the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.530 
chord diagram now you can see that the
fingers<00:03:28.830> are<00:03:28.860> now<00:03:29.220> forming<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:30.030> E<00:03:30.060> minor

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
fingers are now forming the E minor

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.750 
fingers are now forming the E minor
chord<00:03:30.660> with<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.380> fourth<00:03:31.770> finger<00:03:31.860> blocking

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
chord with the fourth finger blocking

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.620 
chord with the fourth finger blocking
the<00:03:32.880> second<00:03:33.270> finger<00:03:33.600> on<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:34.020> third<00:03:34.200> string

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
the second finger on the third string

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.000 
the second finger on the third string
let's<00:03:36.630> try<00:03:36.840> that<00:03:37.020> together<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.620> get<00:03:37.740> used<00:03:37.950> to

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
let's try that together to get used to

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.679 
let's try that together to get used to
going<00:03:38.070> from<00:03:38.430> G<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:39.300> E<00:03:39.330> minor

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689 
going from G to E minor

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.959 
going from G to E minor
next<00:03:42.689> visa<00:03:43.349> for<00:03:43.920> this<00:03:44.040> Court<00:03:44.280> now<00:03:44.459> your<00:03:44.790> first

the chord diagram you can see that it's

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
the chord diagram you can see that it's
still<00:04:59.150> an<00:04:59.240> a<00:04:59.360> chord

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
still an a chord

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.900 
still an a chord
but<00:05:00.140> we've<00:05:00.320> replaced<00:05:00.620> the<00:05:01.070> eighth<00:05:01.370> from<00:05:01.760> the
