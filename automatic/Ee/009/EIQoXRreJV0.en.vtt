00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
them through the mesh as I'm going to

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.660 
them through the mesh as I'm going to
show<00:01:15.970> you<00:01:16.030> can<00:01:16.780> get<00:01:16.929> quite<00:01:17.229> colorful<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.039> just

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
quickly you want to just chop up your

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.480 
quickly you want to just chop up your
apples<00:01:25.209> into<00:01:25.539> smaller<00:01:26.500> pieces<00:01:26.830> so<00:01:27.009> you<00:01:27.250> don't

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
apples into smaller pieces so you don't

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.650 
apples into smaller pieces so you don't
have<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:29.190> use<00:01:30.190> a<00:01:30.220> pusher<00:01:30.640> in<00:01:30.910> the<00:01:31.060> Vitamix<00:01:31.509> you

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
have to use a pusher in the Vitamix you

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.309 
have to use a pusher in the Vitamix you
get<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:31.959> going<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:34.390> I<00:01:34.450> add<00:01:34.660> the<00:01:34.810> apples<00:01:35.289> in<00:01:37.319> give

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:44.020 
get it going so I add the apples in give
your<00:01:38.530> blender<00:01:39.039> a<00:01:39.250> quick<00:01:39.759> turn

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.820 

while<00:01:44.870> the<00:01:45.050> apples<00:01:45.380> are<00:01:45.530> in<00:01:45.580> get<00:01:46.580> your<00:01:47.830> carrots

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
while the apples are in get your carrots

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.480 
while the apples are in get your carrots
rating<00:01:49.810> so<00:01:50.810> once<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.110> apple<00:01:51.410> red<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:52.280> better

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
rating so once the apple red you better

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.340 
rating so once the apple red you better
get<00:01:52.760> your<00:01:52.880> carrots<00:01:53.270> rating<00:01:53.630> I<00:01:53.720> only<00:01:53.930> have<00:01:54.170> to

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
get your carrots rating I only have to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.800 
get your carrots rating I only have to
do<00:01:54.440> just<00:01:54.680> jump<00:01:54.890> off<00:01:55.010> dance<00:01:55.250> my<00:01:56.120> organic<00:01:56.540> soy

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
do just jump off dance my organic soy

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.660 
do just jump off dance my organic soy
don't<00:01:57.080> peel<00:01:57.229> them<00:01:57.350> at<00:01:57.470> all<00:01:57.620> all<00:01:57.890> I<00:01:57.950> have<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.250> cut

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
don't peel them at all all I have to cut

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.150 
don't peel them at all all I have to cut
them<00:01:58.820> into<00:01:58.940> smaller<00:01:59.270> pieces<00:01:59.510> so<00:02:00.020> again<00:02:01.010> it

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
them into smaller pieces so again it

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.630 
them into smaller pieces so again it
does<00:02:01.550> not<00:02:01.790> achieve<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:02.390> blender<00:02:03.640> little

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
does not achieve the blender little

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.700 
does not achieve the blender little
iSAGEN<00:02:05.119> glass<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:05.570> makes<00:02:05.600> too<00:02:05.960> much<00:02:06.110> noise<00:02:06.170> and

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
iSAGEN glass it makes too much noise and

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.150 
iSAGEN glass it makes too much noise and
then<00:02:07.340> I'm<00:02:07.490> going<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:07.729> use<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.660> gold<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.679> Greens

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
then I'm going to use a gold the Greens

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.740 
then I'm going to use a gold the Greens
up<00:02:10.310> for<00:02:10.459> these<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.670> degree<00:02:10.970> smoothing<00:02:11.510> so

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
up for these a degree smoothing so

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.960 
up for these a degree smoothing so

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
nutrients so check that up get it ready

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.490 
nutrients so check that up get it ready
now<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:31.970> get<00:02:32.180> Vitamix<00:02:32.780> radio<00:02:33.110> what<00:02:33.320> we're

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
now you get Vitamix radio what we're

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.110 
now you get Vitamix radio what we're
going<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.739> do<00:02:33.890> is<00:02:34.130> slowly<00:02:34.370> add<00:02:34.730> all<00:02:34.910> the
