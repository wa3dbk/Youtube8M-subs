00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.880
 in our previous meeting 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.550
 we left two questions in the air 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.490
 of pepe thunder origin of the name of the 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.890
 Stick cut difference between the stick 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.850
 cut and the amontillado and another of 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.610
 savior monday the cut stick is born or is 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.830
 it's good to answer these two 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.949
 questions and those we left in the 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:39.379
 previous encounter the cut stick comes 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:41.540
 of the vineyard of bread or yeast 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.629
 the pre- phyllous varietals that 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.690
 say some of the selection in the 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.750
 cellar or is 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.289
 the chalk of the goblin doing his madness in 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.620
 the winery really are many many 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:58.839
 variables to try to solve all 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.180
 those variables we did not come to 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.860
 historical file of Gonzalez byass 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:08.110
 where documents are safeguarded 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.020
 practically since our foundation and 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:17.140
 we are going to go almost to an inventory 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:22.020
 foundational to the inventory of 1838 in the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.819
 inventory of 1838 does not collect any 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.729
 inexistence of cut stick to fix 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:31.179
 nothing as close as it is collected is a 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:36.909
 oloroso fino if we go to the inventory 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:40.030
 from 1863 a fine odorose is already collected 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.210
 three cut and if we go to the 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.850
 inventory of 1877 are clearly 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.250
 identified the clubs cut the 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.520
 three cut the two cut and the 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.829
 four cut what does this mean 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.520
 for us a lot indisputably 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.979
 we are talking about a selection in the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.860
 cellar in those times in the century 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:08.649
 19 we could be talking about a path 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.769
 crooked a road in which a wine 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:16.620
 classified for biological breeding by 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:19.180
 some accidental or forced reasons 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.510
 unquestionably he took the path of 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.299
 positive breeding and that cut stick that 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.780
 stick because we classified the wines 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:31.150
 for biological breeding I cut him 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.400
 I call cut the line of life the 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.760
 line of biological breeding is 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:41.110
 headed up to 17 17 degrees and 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:44.500
 half 18 and that wine was still on the way 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.709
 oxidative really what is it that had 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.579
 past that a pine coming from 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.670
 drained and the first yolk or what 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.940
 it is the same the best of the best of 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.940
 our harvest that had been classified 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.370
 for fine for uncle pepe or if the road 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.250
 of oxidative aging 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.319
 unquestionably that was going to originate 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.280
 horrific fine as they come in the 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.870
 inventory books all a nose 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.890
 delicate 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.489
 fine elegant and a powerful mouth and 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:24.230
 forceful that fits perfectly in 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:28.250
 the definition of cut sticks 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.920
 let's talk about a cut stick 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.810
 from the bible a cut stick 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.090
 from the guest of boots a stick 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.760
 cut from the classification 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.470
 I think the cut stick of some 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:46.049
 way brings together all those concepts what 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.410
 there is no doubt that a cut stick is not 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:53.040
 the full the pitch of an amontillado and 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:56.940
 an odorous that's something like saying that a 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.390
 pink is the play or the cupa of a red 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.810
 and a plan with a cut stick is a lot 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:07.650
 more is a complex wine is a wine that 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.120
 brings together the best of xerez as I say of 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.000
 the 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.430
 a wine with soul a wine with teeth a 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.310
 chalk mark on the soul that I will carry 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.109
 with me forever at the beginning of 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.780
 our meeting told you that the xerez 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.090
 it was not easy but if we enter the 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.380
 world of the cut clubs we are going to 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:31.710
 find an added difficulty what 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.680
 unexplainable how mysterious we are going to 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.100
 try to unravel I leave you one 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.620
 question for our next meeting 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.160
 How many types of cut sticks can we 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.160
 find
