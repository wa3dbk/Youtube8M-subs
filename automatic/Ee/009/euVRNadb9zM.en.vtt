that<00:01:31.620> up<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.820> one<00:01:33.120> tends<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.720> loose<00:01:34.110> this

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
that up this one tends to be loose this

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.270 
that up this one tends to be loose this
last<00:01:34.830> stitch<00:01:35.220> now<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.840> pattern<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:38.040> take

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
last stitch now the pattern is to take

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.600 
last stitch now the pattern is to take
two<00:01:38.820> steps<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.840> left<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.380> come<00:01:41.130> into<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
two steps to the left and come into the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.649 
two steps to the left and come into the
stitch<00:01:42.409> two<00:01:43.409> needles<00:01:44.220> over<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.060> left<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.600> I

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
stitch two needles over on the left so I

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.980 
stitch two needles over on the left so I
skip<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.260> one<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.860> come<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:47.940> from<00:01:48.330> back<00:01:48.630> to

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
skip this one and come in from back to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.170 
skip this one and come in from back to
front

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
front

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.840 
front
then<00:01:51.180> draw<00:01:51.510> that<00:01:51.720> up<00:01:51.780> fairly<00:01:52.320> tight<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
then draw that up fairly tight it is the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.600 
then draw that up fairly tight it is the
spacing<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.690> needles<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.710> determines

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
spacing of the needles that determines

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.330 
spacing of the needles that determines
how<00:01:56.880> tight<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.690> bind<00:01:58.020> off<00:01:58.260> is<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.799> because

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
how tight this bind off is and because

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.880 
how tight this bind off is and because
the<00:01:59.640> needles<00:01:59.970> are<00:02:00.150> fairly<00:02:00.390> far<00:02:00.720> apart<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.409> need

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the needles are fairly far apart I need

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.700 
the needles are fairly far apart I need
to<00:02:01.979> give<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.610> tug<00:02:03.080> now<00:02:04.080> I'm<00:02:04.320> going<00:02:04.590> to

to give this that tug now I'm going to

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.449 
to give this that tug now I'm going to
take<00:02:04.979> one<00:02:05.490> step<00:02:05.700> back<00:02:06.090> toward<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.659> right<00:02:07.459> put

needle in I like to hold these bits of

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.789 
needle in I like to hold these bits of
yarn<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.670> back<00:02:38.760> up<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:40.110> get<00:02:40.319> my<00:02:40.470> needle

yarn in the back up and get my needle

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:48.979 
yarn in the back up and get my needle
under<00:02:41.280> them<00:02:46.250> now<00:02:47.250> two<00:02:47.670> steps<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.510> left<00:02:48.689> to

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
under them now two steps to the left to

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.099 
under them now two steps to the left to
the<00:02:49.109> next<00:02:49.319> new<00:02:49.950> stitch<00:02:50.599> working<00:02:51.599> toward<00:02:52.019> the

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
the next new stitch working toward the

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.080 
the next new stitch working toward the
left<00:02:52.349> this<00:02:52.590> would<00:02:52.829> be<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.700> fifth<00:02:53.970> stitch<00:02:54.329> and

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
left this would be the fifth stitch and

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.680 
left this would be the fifth stitch and
now<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.120> do<00:02:57.450> my<00:02:57.750> pull<00:02:57.989> up<00:02:58.170> tight<00:02:59.269> now<00:03:00.269> I<00:03:00.329> take<00:03:00.629> a

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
now I do my pull up tight now I take a

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.569 
now I do my pull up tight now I take a
step<00:03:01.049> back<00:03:01.409> into<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.129> fourth<00:03:02.549> stitch<00:03:02.940> and

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
step back into that fourth stitch and

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.229 
step back into that fourth stitch and
then<00:03:05.579> two<00:03:06.420> steps<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.500> left<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.849> sixth

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
then two steps to the left to the sixth

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.410 
then two steps to the left to the sixth
stitch<00:03:09.599> go<00:03:10.440> from<00:03:10.680> back<00:03:10.889> to<00:03:10.920> front<00:03:11.420> avoid

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
stitch go from back to front avoid

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.129 
stitch go from back to front avoid
splitting<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.139> yarn<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.940> again<00:03:14.940> this<00:03:15.750> is<00:03:15.989> the

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
splitting the yarn and again this is the

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.770 
splitting the yarn and again this is the
moment<00:03:16.379> when<00:03:17.420> you<00:03:18.420> want<00:03:18.599> to<00:03:18.690> pull<00:03:18.840> up<00:03:18.959> tight

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
moment when you want to pull up tight

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:32.440 
moment when you want to pull up tight
now<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.810> take<00:03:22.079> a<00:03:22.139> step<00:03:22.500> back<00:03:25.220> two<00:03:26.220> steps<00:03:26.699> forward

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.300 

two<00:03:40.190> steps<00:03:40.580> forward<00:03:41.260> now<00:03:42.260> this<00:03:42.620> can<00:03:42.890> be<00:03:42.920> sown

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
two steps forward now this can be sown

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.270 
two steps forward now this can be sown

see<00:04:59.030> how<00:04:59.300> that<00:04:59.360> looks<00:04:59.960> then<00:05:00.800> up<00:05:01.220> at<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.400> top

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
see how that looks then up at the top

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.230 
see how that looks then up at the top
here's<00:05:02.750> this<00:05:03.020> new<00:05:03.410> version<00:05:03.860> of<00:05:04.220> bound<00:05:05.000> off

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
here's this new version of bound off

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.770 
here's this new version of bound off
edge<00:05:05.510> and<00:05:05.900> see<00:05:06.650> how<00:05:06.830> that<00:05:06.890> looks<00:05:07.100> it's<00:05:07.790> a

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
edge and see how that looks it's a

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.680 
edge and see how that looks it's a
really<00:05:09.710> nice<00:05:09.890> stretchy<00:05:10.250> edge<00:05:10.580> for<00:05:11.030> situations

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
really nice stretchy edge for situations

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.020 
really nice stretchy edge for situations
where<00:05:11.900> you<00:05:12.020> need<00:05:12.229> some<00:05:12.500> stretch<00:05:12.830> now<00:05:13.460> compare

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
where you need some stretch now compare

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.920 
where you need some stretch now compare
that<00:05:14.060> top<00:05:14.780> edge<00:05:15.110> along<00:05:15.979> there<00:05:16.539> to<00:05:17.539> the<00:05:17.690> top

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
that top edge along there to the top

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.219 
that top edge along there to the top
edge<00:05:18.229> of<00:05:18.530> my<00:05:19.400> previous<00:05:19.669> sample<00:05:20.450> do<00:05:20.930> you<00:05:21.020> see

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
edge of my previous sample do you see

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:23.170 
edge of my previous sample do you see
how<00:05:21.380> the<00:05:21.440> previous<00:05:21.770> sample<00:05:22.460> which<00:05:22.669> I've<00:05:22.910> laid

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
how the previous sample which I've laid

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.620 
how the previous sample which I've laid
on<00:05:23.360> top<00:05:23.660> is<00:05:23.960> bumpy<00:05:24.890> and<00:05:25.100> this<00:05:25.669> one<00:05:25.910> is<00:05:26.120> smoother

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
on top is bumpy and this one is smoother

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.870 
on top is bumpy and this one is smoother
now<00:05:26.900> they're<00:05:27.050> both<00:05:27.169> stretchy

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
now they're both stretchy

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.120 
now they're both stretchy
but<00:05:28.880> you<00:05:29.479> get<00:05:29.690> just<00:05:29.720> a<00:05:30.110> little<00:05:30.500> nicer<00:05:30.919> finish

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
but you get just a little nicer finish

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.550 
but you get just a little nicer finish
with<00:05:31.520> that<00:05:31.729> edge<00:05:31.970> so<00:05:32.270> when<00:05:32.840> you're<00:05:33.050> using<00:05:33.080> a

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
with that edge so when you're using a

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.500 
with that edge so when you're using a
tapestry<00:05:34.160> bind<00:05:34.400> off<00:05:34.640> in<00:05:34.850> a<00:05:34.910> place<00:05:35.180> where<00:05:35.419> it's

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
tapestry bind off in a place where it's

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.180 
tapestry bind off in a place where it's
going<00:05:35.750> to<00:05:35.870> show<00:05:36.140> why<00:05:36.919> not<00:05:37.130> try<00:05:37.460> this<00:05:37.520> new<00:05:37.970> one
