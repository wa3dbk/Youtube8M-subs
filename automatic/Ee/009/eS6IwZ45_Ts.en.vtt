00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
throughout the season but I think we're

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.050 
throughout the season but I think we're
making<00:01:18.090> ground<00:01:18.480> i<00:01:18.660> think<00:01:18.900> i<00:01:19.440> think<00:01:20.010> the<00:01:20.760> teams

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
making ground i think i think the teams

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.840 
making ground i think i think the teams
and<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.630> riders<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> insurance<00:01:23.580> all

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
and the riders and the insurance all

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.330

know<00:01:24.090> what<00:01:24.270> we're<00:01:24.420> trying<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:26.100> i<00:01:26.130> think

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
know what we're trying to do so i think

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.190 
know what we're trying to do so i think
things<00:01:26.610> would<00:01:26.850> get<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.030> little<00:01:27.240> smoother<00:01:27.750> as<00:01:28.050> we

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
things would get a little smoother as we

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.110 
things would get a little smoother as we
get<00:01:28.410> some<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.740> more<00:01:29.160> paperwork<00:01:29.580> out<00:01:29.880> that

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
get some of this more paperwork out that

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.270 
get some of this more paperwork out that
they<00:01:30.240> need<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.480> go<00:01:31.110> racing<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.830> i<00:01:31.890> think<00:01:32.130> by

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
they need to go racing and i think by

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.530
