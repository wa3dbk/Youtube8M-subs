00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.020
 the Swiss touring club tested three 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.400
 family cars worth 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.559
 less than 30 thousand francs 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.209
 equipped with gasoline engines and 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.209
 manual boxes constrained 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.189
 to all lord all honor let's start 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.029
 the presentation by the most break 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:31.679
 sold in Switzerland 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:34.500
 the skoda octavia as contradictor 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.089
 we chose Monday minivan 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.610
 most sold in Switzerland the renault grand 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:43.350
 scenic and the new suzuki- vitara alone 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.769
 AWD vehicle of our 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.769
 tazi 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.270
 according to the criteria of tcs in terms of 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:00.489
 family cars and next point 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:02.830
 been examined luggage compartment volume 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.570
 we tested it by placing a 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:10.330
 stroller accompanied by some luggage 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:12.190
 additional other element 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.900
 of importance the child seats 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.720
 we have on the one hand control the 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.610
 ease of installation of the other the 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.840
 possibility of placing a third seat 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.270
 on the back seat 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:29.140
 not to forget to check the lock 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:31.630
 security the doors the space 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.640
 complete interior livability as well 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.479
 that the modularity of the vehicle also have 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.810
 is the subject of attention 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.810
 special 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.960
 another question what about comfort 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.100
 driving 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.160
 are the children properly 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.360
 installed the rear windows are the l 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.729
 team and sun visor 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.490
 what about the breakdown of 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.929
 posterior places but still 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.369
 storage areas are they planned 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.410
 for sunglasses 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.929
 is the car equipped with doors 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.640
 bottle finally we are interested in 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:07.929
 visibility and maneuverability 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.520
 especially for parking results on 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.090
 winner of our test and the renault 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.980
 great scenic with a score of 63% enough 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.690
 whatever during the dynamic tests the 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.330
 great scenic has largely caught up in 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.310
 family quality matter it offers a 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.150
 vast space for both passengers and 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.150
 for their luggage 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.900
 the seats can be adjusted 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.340
 individually see removing the pose from 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.320
 two child seats on the seats 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.720
 posterior is easy thanks to their 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.920
 raised position 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.120
 it is even possible to install one 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.490
 third if needed 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.230
 renault is the only manufacturer of 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.580
 our palette to offer sunshades 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.120
 optional in the image of visibility 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.970
 overall 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.500
 the sound insulation is very good with 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.280
 the big scenic the family can 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.170
 consider long trips without worry 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.630
 based on the limited tester version 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.220
 the value for money is good the 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.780
 car is well equipped the costs of 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.500
 low service and performance 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.780
 sadly enough the 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.490
 consumption 8 per cent kilometers in 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.400
 too high and tarnishes the 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.930
 board 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.700
 for the rest behind the wheel of the scenic 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.280
 it is inadvisable to approach the curves 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.290
 at high speed over the direction and 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.290
 box control lacks precision 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:33.250
 positive enough and excellent space 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:37.460
 modularity good value for money 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.370
 high comfort level negative bad 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.860
 performance / consumption ratio 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.700
 driving pleasure limited direction and 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.590
 box control imprecise skoda 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.150
 Octavia goes up on the second step of the 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.840
 podium with 62% test winner 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.910
 dynamic 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.160
 the skoda showed some weaknesses in 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.960
 terms of family quality even though 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.800
 the habitability of the combi remains 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.800
 incontestable 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.040
 on the other hand the base position of the 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.990
 bench makes it difficult to 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.780
 place child seats and the 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.310
 length of the belts be limited to 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.930
 plus the transport in the back of a 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.810
 third little passage and turns out 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.190
 random 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.290
 the interior is nice 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.700
 overall visibility and quality 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.770
 materials are good by cons 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.870
 serial cd radio installation date 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.350
 somewhat and does not allow any connection 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.350
 bluetooth 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.870
 performance side purchases if a direction 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.240
 and a balance braking system and 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.030
 its guarantor of driving pleasure 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.480
 moreover the sound insulation shows itself to 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.630
 the height 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.760
 including on the highway globally the 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.130
 skoda octavia is an ideal car for 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.100
 to travel with the family the quality ratio 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.930
 price is itself questionable limit 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.030
 at two years the warranty is too short 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.160
 but in comparison to the scenic renault 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.910
 the cash value of the car is 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.940
 positive even sportively led the 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.570
 1.4 turbo engine consumes only 6 of 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.310
 wils a liter for 100 kilometers 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.010
 on the other hand the base position of the seats 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:19.980
 limits the vision of a certain angle and 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:22.630
 makes parking difficult positively 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.970
 large space for passengers and 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.420
 good performance luggage with a 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:33.100
 relatively reasonable consumption 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:36.010
 sporting character affirmed negative threshold 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.650
 loading can practice guarantee 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:42.880
 limited to two years noise from 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:45.520
 of the rear axle with a score of 59 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.420
 % suzuki- vitara takes the third 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.850
 square 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.770
 second in terms of dynamic tests 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.440
 the new suzuki- vitara loses 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.000
 points in the family field the most 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.890
 compact of the three vehicles tested 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.330
 provide good 360 visibility 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:03.590
 degrees of ease of parking 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.480
 the correct habitability but the 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.700
 modularity is limited to records 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.060
 folding rear seats and 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.710
 the cargo space compared to that 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:17.990
 of its competitors the volume of the trunk 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:19.820
 is restricted dominated by trimmings 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:24.140
 hard plastic inside and out 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:25.610
 average quality with the exception of 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.740
 some commands the dashboard 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:33.230
 is well disposed with as a culmination 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:34.310
 the big multimedia screen in terms of 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.920
 child safety 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.780
 the vitara does not impress the 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.690
 rear door lock can 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:44.000
 be disabled without a key and looks like a 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.470
 child's play if two of these 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.910
 easily find their place in 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.450
 adequate seats installed on the 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.830
 bench 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:53.780
 it is excluded to install a third 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:56.660
 driving comfort and pejorated by a 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.430
 questionable sound insulation otherwise the 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:02.210
 vitara is comfortable despite its 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:04.220
 small direct power steering 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.700
 provides a good sense of the state of the 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.370
 roadway 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:10.960
 moreover the all-wheel drive series 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.960
 lets you forget some worries 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.700
 it's a pity that the vitara is not 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.990
 equipped with a 5-speed gearbox 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.900
 the price quality ratio of the version 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.370
 tested and can be described as good 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.550
 costs of services and consumption 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:28.570
 not stay and according to them rotax the value 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:31.070
 of buyout the deal is positive 

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:33.320
 compact dimensions and quick weight 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.540
 high collision and radar alarm from 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.600

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:40.970
 level of negative comfort finish and
