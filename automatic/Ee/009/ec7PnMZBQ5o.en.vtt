00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.749 
has sent this little pod you can see
it's<00:00:31.470> pretty<00:00:31.679> small<00:00:31.769> pretty<00:00:32.160> lightweight<00:00:32.399> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
it's pretty small pretty lightweight and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.400 
it's pretty small pretty lightweight and
the<00:00:33.180> idea<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.540> plug<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.930> into<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.260> wall

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
the idea is you plug this into the wall

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.900 
the idea is you plug this into the wall
it<00:00:34.620> comes<00:00:34.770> with<00:00:34.829> an<00:00:35.010> AC<00:00:35.130> adapter<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.790> just

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
it comes with an AC adapter and you just

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.220 
it comes with an AC adapter and you just
plug<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.239> into<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> wall<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.079> can

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
plug this into the wall and you can

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.440 
plug this into the wall and you can
connect<00:00:37.559> up<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.770> six<00:00:38.280> different<00:00:38.489> devices<00:00:39.090> on

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
connect up to six different devices on

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.510 
connect up to six different devices on
here<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.530> charge<00:00:40.860> six<00:00:41.219> different

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
here so you can charge six different

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.280 
here so you can charge six different
devices<00:00:41.760> at<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.000> same<00:00:42.090> time<00:00:42.450> from<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:42.989> wall

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
devices at the same time from one wall

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.560 
devices at the same time from one wall
plug<00:00:43.559> alright<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.129> will<00:00:44.309> save<00:00:44.610> from<00:00:44.879> wire

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
plug alright so this will save from wire

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.510 
plug alright so this will save from wire
clutter<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.739> know<00:00:46.829> haven't<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.250> all<00:00:47.370> me

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
clutter and you know haven't have all me

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.770 
clutter and you know haven't have all me
a<00:00:47.550> power<00:00:47.850> strip<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.300> order<00:00:48.450> hook<00:00:48.570> everything

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
a power strip in order hook everything

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.479 
a power strip in order hook everything
up<00:00:48.960> or<00:00:49.350> maybe<00:00:49.559> even<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:49.890> sharing<00:00:50.460> a

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
up or maybe even just sharing a

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.369 
up or maybe even just sharing a
connector<00:00:51.059> among<00:00:51.329> multiple<00:00:51.600> devices<00:00:52.079> so

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
connector among multiple devices so

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.810 
connector among multiple devices so
let's<00:00:52.710> say<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.829> got<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> couple<00:00:53.160> iphones<00:00:53.309> and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
let's say you got a couple iphones and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.029 
let's say you got a couple iphones and
an<00:00:54.059> ipod<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.629> well<00:00:54.780> yeah<00:00:54.870> over<00:00:55.079> here<00:00:55.110> instead

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
an ipod like well yeah over here instead

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.619 
an ipod like well yeah over here instead
of<00:00:56.190> having<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:56.520> connector<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.449> know<00:00:57.510> and

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
of having one connector you know and

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.729 
of having one connector you know and
charge<00:00:57.809> them<00:00:57.930> up<00:00:58.050> individually<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.710> can

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
charge them up individually you can

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.319 
charge them up individually you can
charge<00:00:59.129> them<00:00:59.280> up<00:00:59.370> all<00:00:59.609> at<00:00:59.730> once<00:00:59.910> alright<00:01:00.210> so

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
charge them up all at once alright so

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.819 
charge them up all at once alright so
just<00:01:00.539> give<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.719> an<00:01:00.780> idea<00:01:00.840> how<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.230> works<00:01:01.410> so

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
just give you an idea how this works so

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.170 
just give you an idea how this works so
what<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.699> you'll<00:01:02.940> get<00:01:03.059> these

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
what you do here is you'll get these

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.640 
what you do here is you'll get these
adapters<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.019> want<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.260> have<00:01:04.350> an<00:01:04.409> adapter

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
adapters and you want to have an adapter

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.230 
adapters and you want to have an adapter
that<00:01:05.010> fits<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.400> device<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:05.939> you'll<00:01:06.150> just

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
that fits your device so you'll just

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.460 
that fits your device so you'll just
plug<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:06.869> like<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.439> you

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
plug it in just like this and then you

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.620 
plug it in just like this and then you
can<00:01:07.619> plug<00:01:07.799> your<00:01:07.830> device<00:01:07.979> into<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.790> they

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
can plug your device into that and they

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.440 
can plug your device into that and they
say<00:01:09.810> they<00:01:09.930> have<00:01:09.960> over<00:01:10.350> 3000<00:01:11.330> devices<00:01:12.330> this

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
say they have over 3000 devices this

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.760 
say they have over 3000 devices this
support<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:12.990> basically<00:01:13.290> just<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> find

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
support so basically just have to find

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.590 
support so basically just have to find
the<00:01:14.280> adapter<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.210> know<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.420> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
the adapter that you know that that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.870 
the adapter that you know that that
works<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.080> your<00:01:16.170> solution<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.580> then<00:01:17.700> you

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
works for your solution and then you

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.160 
works for your solution and then you
just<00:01:18.030> plug<00:01:18.180> your<00:01:18.210> device<00:01:18.360> into<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.049> it's

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
just plug your device into it so it's

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.140 
just plug your device into it so it's
pretty<00:01:19.320> cool<00:01:19.500> nice<00:01:19.710> short<00:01:19.920> cable<00:01:20.130> all<00:01:20.939> this

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
this is a nifty little idea just for to

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.190 
this is a nifty little idea just for to
extend<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.220> use<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.460> this<00:03:08.850> so<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.960> I<00:03:10.020> tried

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
extend the use of this so and I tried

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.120 
extend the use of this so and I tried
this<00:03:10.260> out<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.590> does<00:03:10.710> work<00:03:10.860> pretty<00:03:10.890> well

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
this out and it does work pretty well

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.560 
this out and it does work pretty well
you<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.670> just<00:03:11.880> basically<00:03:12.060> plugged<00:03:12.300> it<00:03:12.420> in<00:03:12.540> and

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
you I just basically plugged it in and

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.880 
you I just basically plugged it in and
just<00:03:12.840> hooked<00:03:13.020> it<00:03:13.110> up<00:03:13.170> I<00:03:13.320> didn't<00:03:13.530> use<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.650> too

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
just hooked it up I didn't use it too

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.930 
just hooked it up I didn't use it too
much<00:03:14.040> just<00:03:14.100> because<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.520> didn't<00:03:14.760> really<00:03:14.850> have

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
much just because I didn't really have

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.940 
much just because I didn't really have
this<00:03:15.240> use<00:03:15.450> but<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:16.080> does<00:03:16.260> work<00:03:16.440> just<00:03:16.680> like<00:03:16.770> if

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
this use but it does work just like if

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.010 
this use but it does work just like if
it<00:03:17.100> was<00:03:17.220> hooked<00:03:17.490> up<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:18.270> wall<00:03:18.450> alright<00:03:18.840> so

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
it was hooked up to the wall alright so

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.180 
it was hooked up to the wall alright so
let's<00:03:19.230> actually<00:03:19.350> check<00:03:19.650> out<00:03:19.770> this<00:03:19.890> device

interesting<00:03:44.700> this<00:03:44.790> pry<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.000> most<00:03:45.209> versatile

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
interesting this pry the most versatile

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.540 
interesting this pry the most versatile
of<00:03:45.660> all<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.020> of<00:03:46.560> all<00:03:46.740> the<00:03:46.830> adapters<00:03:47.280> because

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
of all the of all the adapters because

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.970 
of all the of all the adapters because
it's<00:03:47.700> just<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.940> regular<00:03:48.090> USB<00:03:48.660> female<00:03:49.110> plug<00:03:49.530> so

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
it's just a regular USB female plug so

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.770 
it's just a regular USB female plug so
you<00:03:50.070> can<00:03:50.160> just<00:03:50.190> take<00:03:50.370> any<00:03:50.580> USB<00:03:51.180> device<00:03:51.570> which

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
you can just take any USB device which

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.300 
you can just take any USB device which
all<00:03:51.930> of<00:03:52.080> these<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.650> know<00:03:52.740> charge<00:03:52.980> from<00:03:53.190> a

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
all of these you know charge from a

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.280 
all of these you know charge from a
standard<00:03:53.640> USB<00:03:53.730> connector<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.570> you<00:03:55.020> just<00:03:55.140> plug

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
standard USB connector and you just plug

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.050 
standard USB connector and you just plug
it<00:03:55.410> in<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:56.160> this<00:03:56.280> one<00:03:56.490> probably<00:03:56.760> is<00:03:57.000> the

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
it in and so this one probably is the

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.850 
it in and so this one probably is the
most<00:03:57.090> versatile<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.930> only<00:03:58.080> downside<00:03:58.290> is<00:03:58.560> of

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
most versatile the only downside is of

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.140 
most versatile the only downside is of
course<00:03:58.980> is<00:03:59.250> then<00:03:59.430> you<00:03:59.550> need<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.790> have<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.120> know

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
course is then you need to have you know

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.210 
course is then you need to have you know
this<00:04:00.330> cable<00:04:00.660> so<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.810> got<00:04:00.990> this<00:04:01.080> cable<00:04:01.470> you

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
this cable so you got this cable you

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.800 
this cable so you got this cable you
laying<00:04:02.490> around<00:04:02.820> it's<00:04:03.000> really<00:04:03.330> handy<00:04:03.510> having

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
laying around it's really handy having

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.660 
laying around it's really handy having
these<00:04:03.990> short<00:04:04.380> little<00:04:04.410> ones<00:04:04.770> because<00:04:05.430> then<00:04:05.550> you

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
these short little ones because then you

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.490 
these short little ones because then you
don't<00:04:05.700> have<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:06.030> spaghetti<00:04:06.900> mess<00:04:07.140> of<00:04:07.290> all<00:04:07.410> these

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
don't have a spaghetti mess of all these

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.780 
don't have a spaghetti mess of all these
cables<00:04:07.890> this<00:04:08.010> is<00:04:08.130> basically<00:04:08.430> all<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:08.760> have

they would take up a lot of space to but

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.370 
they would take up a lot of space to but

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.230 
these these cables are pretty flexible
so<00:05:35.530> and<00:05:36.520> you<00:05:36.580> just<00:05:36.759> saw<00:05:36.880> it<00:05:36.940> right<00:05:37.000> there<00:05:37.090> i

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
so and you just saw it right there i

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.999 
so and you just saw it right there i
could<00:05:37.360> basically<00:05:37.870> you<00:05:38.349> know<00:05:38.470> turn<00:05:38.889> them

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
could basically you know turn them

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.240 
could basically you know turn them
around<00:05:39.070> a<00:05:39.550> few<00:05:39.759> times<00:05:40.020> and<00:05:41.020> it<00:05:41.500> still<00:05:41.740> be<00:05:41.860> you

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
around a few times and it still be you

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.010 
around a few times and it still be you
know<00:05:42.340> just<00:05:42.550> fine<00:05:42.789> so<00:05:43.060> they're<00:05:43.419> nice<00:05:43.539> flexible

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
know just fine so they're nice flexible

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.810 
know just fine so they're nice flexible
cables<00:05:44.380> and<00:05:44.500> they<00:05:44.560> do<00:05:44.620> a<00:05:44.740> turn<00:05:45.159> just<00:05:45.520> like<00:05:45.669> this

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
cables and they do a turn just like this

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.089 
cables and they do a turn just like this
so<00:05:46.090> if<00:05:46.300> it<00:05:47.020> does<00:05:47.139> take<00:05:47.320> up<00:05:47.349> a<00:05:47.530> lot<00:05:47.620> of<00:05:47.680> space<00:05:47.979> on

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
so if it does take up a lot of space on

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:49.350 
so if it does take up a lot of space on
a<00:05:48.159> surface<00:05:48.430> you<00:05:48.699> know<00:05:48.789> you<00:05:48.880> can<00:05:49.090> move<00:05:49.180> things

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
a surface you know you can move things

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.209 
a surface you know you can move things
around<00:05:49.539> and<00:05:49.930> not<00:05:50.380> put<00:05:50.560> a<00:05:50.590> whole<00:05:50.740> lot<00:05:50.889> of<00:05:50.919> stress

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:51.219 
around and not put a whole lot of stress

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:52.649 
around and not put a whole lot of stress
on<00:05:51.370> these<00:05:51.460> connectors<00:05:51.880> or<00:05:51.940> nice<00:05:52.180> flexible

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659 
on these connectors or nice flexible

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:55.080 
on these connectors or nice flexible
cables<00:05:53.139> so<00:05:53.370> you<00:05:54.370> know<00:05:54.460> that's<00:05:54.610> not<00:05:54.699> a<00:05:54.789> big<00:05:54.940> deal

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
cables so you know that's not a big deal

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.700 
cables so you know that's not a big deal

one<00:06:29.860> I<00:06:30.099> guess<00:06:30.460> what's<00:06:30.639> shipping<00:06:30.909> they'd

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
one I guess what's shipping they'd

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.640 
one I guess what's shipping they'd
probably<00:06:31.150> charge<00:06:31.300> your<00:06:31.539> shipping<00:06:31.719> on<00:06:31.930> that<00:06:32.139> so

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
probably charge your shipping on that so

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.379 
probably charge your shipping on that so
you<00:06:32.740> could<00:06:32.830> probably<00:06:33.009> pick<00:06:33.190> up<00:06:33.370> a<00:06:33.520> for<00:06:34.300> that

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:34.389 
you could probably pick up a for that
