 hi friends netizens to celebrate 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.010
 as it should be this end of the year I 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.090
 offers you a new series 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:21.900
 experiences to do at home 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:23.220
 have fun do you know he is 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.029
 possible to write an invisible message 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.740
 thanks to lemon juice 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.349
 for that you already have a 20 out of 20 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.080
 business lemon go through a paintbrush 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.160
 as well as a sheet of paper to start 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.309
 by squeezing the lemon to recover 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.780
 his juice now with brushes 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.110
 write your secret message on the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.110
 sheet of paper 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.640
 once the lemon juice has dried 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.350
 the message will be totally invisible to 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.360
 the naked eye to do it seems he 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.500
 simply iron the sheet with the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.500
 set to minimum power 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.260

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:15.720
 [Music] 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.280
 to make this little trick you have 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.840
 need six to the ubs is game my 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.640
 presence of girls to achieve 80 of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.439
 the equator with his friends without version 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.939
 have the right to break them 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.930
 to succeed this challenge start with those 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.930
 two matches like this 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.470
 now all you have left is 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.610
 put the matches in balance as 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.610
 these is to form a pyramid 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:57.899
 here you have the four triangles 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:59.039
 equilateral 1 2 3 and 4 to achieve 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.299
 this experience you need a 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.539
 plastic slat enough of a sheet 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.740
 of A4 paper started by placing the 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.899
 latte in balance like these on the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.310
 edge of a table now covered 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.000
 the part lying on the table with 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.019
 a sheet a4 arranged in its length 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.260
 if you gently push the end of the 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.620
 language 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.030
 she will fall every time by cons 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.560
 if you hit the Buddha strongly 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.630
 it will stick as if by magic 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.950
 on the table indeed by giving a shot 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.450
 powerful the leaf will rise and 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.799
 created a breath of air that he will flatten 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.799
 automatically lath on the table 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.470
 you see the latte sticks to the 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.470
 office

 [Music] 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.940
 I will now show you how 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.040
 to realize an absolutely 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.630
 beautiful to reproduce it you have 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.980
 need food dyes from the 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.240
 color of your care as well as 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.950
 white flowers like tulips or 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.030
 roses start by putting a few 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:05.560
 drops of food coloring in 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:06.820
 water and then drop the flower after 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.320
 few hours the flora will have absorbed 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.740
 the colored water and the petals take a 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.740
 beautiful color

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.740
 to achieve this experience you have 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.510
 need aa stack of a demon shape 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.190
 cylindrical of a small piece of paper 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.850
 of aluminum as well as a wire 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.840
 malleable about 25 cm to start with 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.140
 down the item in the paper book 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.140
 aluminum 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.570
 once you have it correctly 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.150
 packaged place the stack on top as 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.360
 this thanks to the pressure elements she 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.620
 will come alone now take the 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.280
 shots of wires and then the like 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.660
 these two ends of the two 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.190
 arcs of circles will be in direct contact 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.480
 with the hands so could the curves 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.100
 and slightly to have a better 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.330
 taken now that the wire 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.440
 improperly pray there are no rest 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.550
 more than to put on top of the pile 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.169
 like this thanks to the strength of the magnet 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.250
 and electricians and the battery the wire of 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.250
 iron will fall on its own
