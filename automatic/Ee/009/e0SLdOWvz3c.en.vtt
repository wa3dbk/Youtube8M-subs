00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
electric guitar one of the things that

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.190 
electric guitar one of the things that
urged<00:00:11.610> me<00:00:11.910> about<00:00:12.150> electric<00:00:12.719> guitar<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.080> in

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
urged me about electric guitar is in

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.740 
urged me about electric guitar is in
general<00:00:13.440> as<00:00:13.710> they<00:00:13.889> come<00:00:14.099> out<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.759> box<00:00:14.940> is

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
general as they come out of the box is

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.750 
general as they come out of the box is
the<00:00:15.960> fact<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.350> they<00:00:16.740> sound<00:00:17.010> great<00:00:17.400> when

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
the fact that they sound great when

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.189 
the fact that they sound great when
they're<00:00:17.880> turned<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.240> 10<00:00:20.480> it's<00:00:21.480> nice<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.930> big

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
they're turned on 10 it's nice and big

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.220 
they're turned on 10 it's nice and big
full<00:00:22.859> sounding<00:00:23.460> round<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.449> then<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:24.990> turn

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
full sounding round and then you turn

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.700 
full sounding round and then you turn
the<00:00:25.380> control<00:00:25.830> down<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.699> notch<00:00:27.180> or<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.050> it

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the control down a notch or so and it

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.700 
the control down a notch or so and it
gets<00:00:28.890> dark<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:33.660> further<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.140> turn<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.530> now

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
gets dark the further you turn it now

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.299 
gets dark the further you turn it now
the<00:00:34.770> more<00:00:35.160> undefined<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.030> gets<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:37.100> what<00:00:38.100> you

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
the more undefined it gets and what you

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.549 
the more undefined it gets and what you
lack<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.030> tone<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.780> had<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.230> 10

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
lack is the tone you had on 10

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
volume control quite a few years ago I

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.069 
volume control quite a few years ago I
was<00:00:46.100> looking<00:00:47.100> at<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> Fender<00:00:48.090> tech-support

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
was looking at a Fender tech-support

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.229 
was looking at a Fender tech-support
bulletin<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:49.920> Mike<00:00:50.340> Stevens<00:00:50.879> had<00:00:51.030> written

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
bulletin that Mike Stevens had written

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.380 
bulletin that Mike Stevens had written
and<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> tricks<00:00:52.710> he<00:00:52.800> found<00:00:53.190> was<00:00:54.059> to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
and one of the tricks he found was to

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.569 
and one of the tricks he found was to
add<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.719> small<00:00:55.350> circuit<00:00:55.920> called<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.219> resistor

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
add a small circuit called a resistor

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.319 
add a small circuit called a resistor
capacitor<00:00:56.910> network<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.070> input<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
capacitor network to the input and the

output of any given volume control
particularly<00:01:03.600> was<00:01:04.049> talking<00:01:04.409> about<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.769> Fender

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
particularly was talking about on Fender

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.250 
particularly was talking about on Fender
guitars<00:01:05.489> at<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.820> time<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.960> use<00:01:07.110> this

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
guitars at the time but you can use this

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.370 
guitars at the time but you can use this
mod<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:08.159> about<00:01:08.340> anything<00:01:09.020> this<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
mod on just about anything this is a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.510 
mod on just about anything this is a

one capacitor and 150 K quarter watt
resistor<00:01:21.840> I've<00:01:22.560> soldered<00:01:23.390> alligator<00:01:24.390> clips

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
resistor I've soldered alligator clips

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.460 
resistor I've soldered alligator clips
to<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.799> clip<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.130> into<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> circuit<00:01:27.439> say<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
to so I can clip it into a circuit say a

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.069 
to so I can clip it into a circuit say a
customer<00:01:29.009> comes<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.759> isn't<00:01:30.479> interested

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
customer comes in and isn't interested

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.190 
customer comes in and isn't interested
in<00:01:31.200> more<00:01:31.890> control<00:01:32.280> out<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.729> his<00:01:32.850> guitar<00:01:33.210> well<00:01:34.170> I

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
in more control out of his guitar well I

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.440 
in more control out of his guitar well I
can<00:01:34.530> add<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:35.159> into<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.729> circuit<00:01:36.090> by<00:01:36.240> just

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
can add this into the circuit by just

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.569 
can add this into the circuit by just
simply<00:01:36.659> clipping<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.860> let<00:01:38.070> him<00:01:38.100> listen

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
simply clipping it in and let him listen

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.249 
simply clipping it in and let him listen
and<00:01:39.030> decide<00:01:39.329> for<00:01:39.540> himself<00:01:39.659> whether<00:01:40.049> it's

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
and decide for himself whether it's

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.770 
and decide for himself whether it's
worth<00:01:40.530> doing<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.100> modification<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.150> he

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
worth doing the modification if he

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.800 
worth doing the modification if he
doesn't<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.640> we<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.820> simply<00:01:45.329> undo<00:01:45.659> it

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
doesn't like it we can simply undo it

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.620 
doesn't like it we can simply undo it
it's<00:01:46.290> non-invasive<00:01:47.060> doesn't<00:01:48.060> require<00:01:48.299> any

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
it's non-invasive doesn't require any

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.039 
it's non-invasive doesn't require any
soldering<00:01:49.110> if<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:50.159> don't<00:01:50.369> want<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.840> let's

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
soldering if you don't want to so let's

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.010 
soldering if you don't want to so let's
put<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.500> duo<00:01:52.649> jet<00:01:54.740> it's<00:01:55.740> installed

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
put it in the duo jet it's installed

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.930 
put it in the duo jet it's installed
how's<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.229> sound

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:11.410 

that's<00:02:01.940> aunt<00:02:04.270> nm9<00:02:09.850> so<00:02:10.850> it<00:02:10.970> retains<00:02:11.240> the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
that's aunt nm9 so it retains the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.480 
that's aunt nm9 so it retains the
fidelity<00:02:12.020> through<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.350> entire<00:02:12.650> range<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.340> the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
fidelity through the entire range of the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:26.400 
fidelity through the entire range of the
line<00:02:13.760> control

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.760 

much<00:02:26.980> more<00:02:27.310> controllable
