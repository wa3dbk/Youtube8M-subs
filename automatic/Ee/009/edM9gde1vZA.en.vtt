00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.300
 It's gold 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:00.990
 Why is there such a place 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:05.780
 I came for help with my tongue 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:07.360
 White early not hurry burger and considerable guys is simple 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.190
 Ha ha ha 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.190
 Ohmae Dakkera also there to 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.100
 It's ok they are 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.780

 I will help you from now on 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:30.250
 At that time I Iranka is Well Iyo 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.820
 Shape of the mouth is set in accordance with the vowel of Mach serif 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.810
 While listening to the play last night to get into the drawing work 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.810
 Than is the drawing 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.170
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.170
 Autumn k 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.869
 I asked your impressions of the fresco to victims 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.800
 Exactly was the first time to say man 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:08.830
 kind of a the United States and whether the web Disney 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:13.740
 Although the animation I had heard that I are using a safe list 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.740
 It is actually possible to try it for the first time this time 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.950
 Something very radio-drama-like, in that sense a little empathy 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.379
 Ness angenieux 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.840
 I'm was that was really impressed drink only one that I think I was able to 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.620
 When that I first took it there 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.459
 As it was 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.860
 You move to a fine place such as punk ground 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:43.230
 After all animation is different 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:48.690
 Out to be common in the take way it was not felt at all Fuso meaning 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:51.890
 Ha ha ha I mean I'm also I am willing to express to the fine nuances 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.840
 I thought this was wonderful 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.840
 Oh place to say so is a tremendous nice 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.120
 aan 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.350
 It said the quick action 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:14.690
 Secret of the plesk method 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:19.990
 Even if you don't shoot on film, you can use the power of a computer to create a work immediately 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.990
 It is good to be able to check whether the movement of the words and the mouth is correct 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:32.030
 ni 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:36.440
 That check no 2 Murata you also check that 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:40.540
 Kedomo animators I take the timing in that imagination is also part 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:45.700
 It does not necessarily mean that it is best to go ahead 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:51.060
 If you can use that machine, you can check in advance without having to go to Hiromi 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.060
 I also put the sound at the stage of that magic 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:00.810
 Have a lot of activity and fix timing with it 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:06.510
 Use by which it will be to a high degree of perfection than Well 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.890
 Does not it is not anymore groundbreaking of you or in short that ordinary professional spray-making 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.050
 That's why 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:15.620
 Already 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:16.610
 Cu Chi got a can certainly meet with the Well voice actors of the frit pen pattern is combined in each three 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.100
 But 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:22.960
 After all 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:27.690
 Just stick and say I have a word that you do not cheat is frozen wonder 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:31.590
 If you think in comparison with, it is by far the state Presto is more real 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:38.550
 It contains four times and a half or in that sense Well 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:41.920
 After a long time, I think it will be a 3-inch work called a feature theater work 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.100
 Love it or over of the other good sex 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.630
 Ah ah ah 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.920
 I ordered a bar 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:53.190
 Those Tteyuu automation in underground owners have been made to the flexibility and too much of the form 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.150
 Yes , yes 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.510
 You are different, for example, who are you 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.500
 I've decided it's this of that voice nuller of Gundam 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:05.040
 So much character in the voice 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.040
 Disney 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.800
 when absorbing it happens to have character than ever character you are using Te akira 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.610
 I thought it would be sage as much as possible 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.610
 It is prima facie 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:21.680
 15 difference between almost and heard or try Nechotto of Tteyuu children Koeran of 6-year-old 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.680
 There is no 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.680
 It's not that I'm not feeling sharp and everyone is in the same love 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:36.370
 It might have had I'm sure if you look to Fu say Yabaso Nakanakaeee 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:38.950
 I have no time for teaching acting 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.639
 I tentatively Well 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.590
 In other words 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:47.740
 I chose that kind of feeling or not 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:50.830
 It Nde there is no let alone the painting In the present case 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:54.790
 If anything a 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:57.770
 Wonder if it was something like Tteyuu want here is so out 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:02.449
 How does a variety of request so much because it is here 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:05.229
 It is better to say or not you put out in the way of there if anything rather than go to create a form 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:05.229
 It was close 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:18.739
 Otomo is I think that Mr. Katsuhiro Otomo genius, however 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:19.429
 Those referred to in the You're still so and the car his image when to that Place corn 

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:24.990
 Send 

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:28.350
 Description we from the other I think I'm never not it do you to monkey how is 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:32.690
 Do you draw the image of the director from the director Otomo 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.690
 The point is whether you can tell 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.020
 ano ang 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.020
 ooooooooooooooooooooo oooo 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:48.310
 Dumpling 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:54.000
 The world created by one creator Katsuhiro Otomo is 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:54.000
 Now start looking at the new world out movement become a movie Tan 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:01.700
 With the cooperation of countless people, leaving one filmmaker 's hand 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.960
 It was completed by the upper row 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.849
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:11.880
 Voice actors who did a performance in the body hit the fresco 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:18.410
 Color to challenge the highest level of bis limit 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:18.410
