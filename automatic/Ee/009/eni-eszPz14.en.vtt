00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.950

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.210
 leave a description of the video 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.339
 Once we get into it, we're going to have to 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.599
 wait 5 seconds and then you 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.599
 let's give jump advertising 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.830
 the calls to the police are going to 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:33.830
 redirect to the download page 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:38.150
 until that day 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.150
 service has shown 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.050
 once they showed the casualties do not have 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.300
 to wait a few seconds 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.949
 while the minecraft is downloaded and 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.719
 well this may vary depending on the 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.550
 speed of our internet and also 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.589
 the speed of our computer like this 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.550
 which I recommend closing the largest amount 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:57.000
 of possible things for the moment 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.090

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.520
 complete and it will lower us as if it were 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.850

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.670

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.840
