00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
ways that you can throw flashes with the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.900 
ways that you can throw flashes with the
three<00:00:45.510> different<00:00:46.520> distances<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.760> can

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
three different distances that you can

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.319 
three different distances that you can
throw<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:49.250> good<00:00:50.250> pop<00:00:50.489> flash<00:00:50.760> for<00:00:51.000> mid<00:00:51.149> doors

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.930 
throw it a good pop flash for mid doors
for<00:00:51.600> example<00:00:52.050> if<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:53.250> player<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.489> playing<00:00:53.699> close

for example if a player is playing close
to<00:00:54.030> my<00:00:54.120> doors<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.899> these<00:00:54.989> positions<00:00:55.530> is

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
to my doors in one of these positions is

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.270 
to my doors in one of these positions is
a<00:00:56.699> flash<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.719> line<00:00:57.989> up<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:59.129> have<00:00:59.250> a

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
a flash that you line up you have a

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.340 
a flash that you line up you have a
preset<00:00:59.789> line<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.780> stand<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.109> certain

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
preset line up you stand a certain

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.260 
preset line up you stand a certain
position<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:02.129> aim<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> certain<00:01:02.760> position<00:01:03.000> you

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
position you aim a certain position you

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.200 
position you aim a certain position you
throw<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.040> it's<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.129> guaranteed<00:01:05.729> lineup

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
throw it and it's a guaranteed lineup

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.190 
throw it and it's a guaranteed lineup
spot<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> good<00:01:07.680> pop<00:01:07.860> flash<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.310> mid<00:01:08.430> doors

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
spot so a good pop flash for mid doors

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.460 
spot so a good pop flash for mid doors
would<00:01:10.200> be<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:11.850> any<00:01:12.570> player<00:01:13.290> who's

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
would be just like so any player who's

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.260 
would be just like so any player who's
playing<00:01:13.680> close<00:01:13.830> mid<00:01:14.189> won't<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.700> able<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.939> dodge

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
playing close mid won't be able to dodge

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.429 
playing close mid won't be able to dodge
this<00:01:15.750> flash<00:01:16.430> now<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.490> pop<00:01:17.939> flash<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.600> designed

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
this flash now the pop flash is designed

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.749 
this flash now the pop flash is designed
to<00:01:20.150> flash<00:01:21.150> bring<00:01:21.390> an<00:01:22.009> opponent<00:01:23.009> at<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.189> specific

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
to flash bring an opponent at a specific

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.440 
to flash bring an opponent at a specific
position<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.770> while<00:01:26.369> pop<00:01:26.610> flashes<00:01:27.000> are<00:01:27.119> very

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
position so while pop flashes are very

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.240 
position so while pop flashes are very
good<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.930> eliminate<00:01:28.500> players<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.130> certain

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
good to eliminate players in certain

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.999 
good to eliminate players in certain
positions<00:01:30.079> pop<00:01:31.079> flashes<00:01:31.439> aren't<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> best

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
positions pop flashes aren't the best

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.399 
positions pop flashes aren't the best
flashes<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.610> use<00:01:32.939> when<00:01:33.570> attacking<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.170> bomb

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409

site for example if I'm going up a there

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.160 
site for example if I'm going up a there
is<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> pop<00:01:38.700> flash<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.299> use<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.630> will<00:01:39.990> get

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
is a pop flash I can use that will get

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.569 
is a pop flash I can use that will get
players<00:01:40.439> who<00:01:40.680> are<00:01:40.799> peeking<00:01:41.130> from<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.400> bomb

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
site or city ramp but they are not the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.620 
site or city ramp but they are not the
best<00:01:44.490> flashes<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.149> use<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:47.250> get<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.390> biggest

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
best flashes to use to get the biggest

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.950 
best flashes to use to get the biggest
area<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.170> effect<00:01:49.610> so<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.850> pop<00:01:51.119> flash<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.689> for

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
area of effect so a pop flash on a for

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.740 
area of effect so a pop flash on a for
example<00:01:52.020> would<00:01:52.770> be<00:01:52.829> if<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.280> line<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.030> up<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.329> I

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
example would be if I line it up and I

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.219 
example would be if I line it up and I
throw<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.170> through<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.500> little<00:01:55.710> hole<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:57.229> it

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
throw it through this little hole and it

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.679 
throw it through this little hole and it
just<00:01:58.380> explodes<00:01:58.770> right<00:01:59.070> up<00:01:59.280> here<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.640> it<00:02:00.570> good

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
just explodes right up here is it good

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.300 
just explodes right up here is it good
flash<00:02:00.930> because<00:02:01.200> anybody<00:02:01.770> who's<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.040> ramp

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
flash because anybody who's on the ramp

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.550 
flash because anybody who's on the ramp
will<00:02:02.820> get<00:02:02.969> blind<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.509> they<00:02:04.020> won't<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.290> able<00:02:04.439> to

see this flash coming over here or if

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.820 
see this flash coming over here or if
I'm<00:03:18.660> in<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.870> pit<00:03:19.050> I<00:03:19.170> can<00:03:19.440> see<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.680> flash

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
I'm in the pit I can see the flash

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.770 
I'm in the pit I can see the flash
coming<00:03:20.160> over<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.580> I'll<00:03:20.910> be<00:03:21.060> able<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.269> dodge<00:03:21.540> it

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
coming over and I'll be able to dodge it

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.210 
coming over and I'll be able to dodge it
and<00:03:21.930> I'll<00:03:22.050> be<00:03:22.230> able<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.590> avoid<00:03:22.769> it<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:23.130> it

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
and I'll be able to avoid it and it

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.290 
and I'll be able to avoid it and it
won't<00:03:23.400> affect<00:03:23.489> me<00:03:23.880> at<00:03:23.970> all

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
won't affect me at all

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.320 
won't affect me at all
so<00:03:24.810> regular<00:03:25.290> flash<00:03:25.560> in<00:03:25.739> this<00:03:25.860> situation<00:03:26.459> would

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
so regular flash in this situation would

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.420 
so regular flash in this situation would
be<00:03:27.660> better<00:03:27.989> suited<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.560> getting<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.070> player<00:03:29.280> off

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
be better suited to getting a player off

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.430 
be better suited to getting a player off
of<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.730> lung<00:03:29.940> corner<00:03:30.300> or<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.540> pit<00:03:30.780> but<00:03:31.320> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
of the lung corner or the pit but the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.470 
of the lung corner or the pit but the
pop<00:03:31.650> flash<00:03:31.890> is<00:03:32.100> specifically<00:03:32.580> designed<00:03:32.820> to

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
pop flash is specifically designed to

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.540 
pop flash is specifically designed to
get<00:03:33.600> anybody<00:03:34.019> who's<00:03:34.290> up<00:03:34.830> close<00:03:35.280> in<00:03:35.489> the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
get anybody who's up close in the

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.150 
get anybody who's up close in the
specific<00:03:36.239> location<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:37.500> pop<00:03:37.709> flashes<00:03:38.040> are

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
specific location so pop flashes are

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.880 
specific location so pop flashes are
very<00:03:38.430> useful<00:03:38.820> to<00:03:38.970> use<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.870> eliminate<00:03:40.350> counter

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
very useful to use to eliminate counter

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.560 
very useful to use to eliminate counter
tariffs<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:41.250> are<00:03:41.370> in<00:03:41.580> positions<00:03:42.330> that<00:03:42.420> you

tariffs that are in positions that you

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.470 
tariffs that are in positions that you
know<00:03:42.750> exactly<00:03:43.140> where<00:03:43.470> they<00:03:43.620> are<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:44.480> 100%

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
know exactly where they are and 100%

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.020 
know exactly where they are and 100%
lineups<00:03:46.200> are<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:47.010> best<00:03:47.220> way<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.430> do<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.880> so

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
lineups are the best way to do it so

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.150 
lineups are the best way to do it so

these days is when there's a smoke for

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.310 
these days is when there's a smoke for
example<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.299> you<00:04:09.480> underhand<00:04:10.019> a<00:04:10.110> flash

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
example and you underhand a flash

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.530 
example and you underhand a flash
through<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:10.950> smoke<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.430> you<00:04:11.940> push<00:04:12.150> with<00:04:12.360> it

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
through the smoke and you push with it

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.080 
through the smoke and you push with it
this<00:04:13.470> is<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.739> very<00:04:14.040> good<00:04:14.250> way<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.459> get<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:14.820> pop

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
this is a very good way to get a pop

have to keep in mind is every time you
right-click<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.549> flashbang

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
right-click the flashbang

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.430 
right-click the flashbang
