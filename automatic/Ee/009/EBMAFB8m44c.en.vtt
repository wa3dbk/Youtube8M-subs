00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.390
 they play they play on the server 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.400
 of olimpo crash but what happens that in the 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.500
 olimpo server that that modality of 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.410
 game is in beta version and so 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.570
 so much can only be played by those who 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.790
 have vip and good what happens i do not have 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.430
 I saw how I can play for forget they are 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.530
 those who come yes 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.870
 we add a new server and I'm going to 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.330
 leave it in the description of all 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.590
 forms although you can stop the video and 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.520
 copy 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.329
 copy this 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.640
 and well, well 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.649
 how to play then on this new server 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.250
 we join the server and this server 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.460
 it's exactly like Olympus that 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.680
 you have the same plugins 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.350
 many more games than Olympus back but 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.159
 good to look like here here we give 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.159
 to the compass 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:30.550
 we give the compass or the one that has 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:33.370
 stayed and we give right click 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.540
 a compass and we go here the boat 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.140
 quartz boat xd 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.400
 what says run from the best you say 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.830
 run of the beast escape of the beast 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.020
 then it appears to teleport us and 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.500
 here we go we approach the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.990
 posters and I'll show you now 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.880
 the transition is what 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.799
 there has been a small problem with the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.840
 server and the server has thrown me 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.140
 fly 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.409
 which is very logical because you said the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.980
 vegetable vices I think that in the 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.710
 willis reds 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.030
 comes out in this lobby this is what comes out 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.280
 before 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.790
 before entering the game is the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.860
 Timeout waiting room 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.420
 up you get the seconds left 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.360
 to start the game 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.050
 starting my name I am the beast 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.050
 fair 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.840
 You have also seen has sent me 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.170
 of all of them 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.500
 a man we're serious I want to teach 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.840
 this 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.820
 Well, you will have seen this map now 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.250
 inside looks up how much time goes 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:51.840
 I have left to go out for them 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:55.040
 4 3 2 1 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.040
 worth long beard 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.660
 sorry for the little transition 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.820
 today is the day of the show of the failures 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.340
 ok let's go to sack let's go to the top let's go 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.420
 butt butt to butt to butt 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.420
 to see if I find 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.420
 I do not intend to win the game because 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:24.040
 he lost a lot of time 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.040
 they are also coming to us 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.400
 they do not learn to win the game of this 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.560
 just to show you over me 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.880
 I fall for perfect perfect 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.910
 I take off the numbers faster because 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:48.370
 only these guys teach you that you can 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.370
 play the same maps of 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.530
 thunders 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.530
 to the same maps of 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.450
 Well, these guys, just what I wanted 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.900
 show you how to play because I thought 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.239
 one thing that 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.659
 would interest people because always 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.310
 that is well olimpo crush as I see 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:11.610
 people like you how to conjugate this as 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.799
 by the other and that is good because if you are and 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.599
 you liked it, do not hesitate to give it to the aik 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.320
 how to share with your friends 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:21.880
