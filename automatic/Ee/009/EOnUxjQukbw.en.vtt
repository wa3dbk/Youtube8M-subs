thing<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.420> can<00:00:24.570> use<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:24.960> input

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
thing is is that you can use this input

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.859 
thing is is that you can use this input

that<00:00:29.609> way<00:00:30.560> we<00:00:31.560> have<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.769> input<00:00:32.130> section<00:00:32.489> over

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
that way we have the input section over

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.819 
that way we have the input section over
here<00:00:32.700> which<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.149> essentially<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.870> 610<00:00:34.469> mic

here which is essentially the 610 mic
pre<00:00:35.420> there<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> little<00:00:36.870> different<00:00:37.230> power

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
supply for better noise performance and

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.940 
supply for better noise performance and
also<00:00:39.540> better<00:00:39.809> bass<00:00:40.079> performance<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
also better bass performance in the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.040 
also better bass performance in the
sixty<00:00:41.250> one<00:00:41.370> seventy<00:00:41.579> six<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.120> well<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.989> a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
sixty one seventy six as well it's a

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.290 
sixty one seventy six as well it's a
little<00:00:43.200> bit<00:00:43.320> more<00:00:43.649> performance<00:00:44.370> available

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
little bit more performance available

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.569 
little bit more performance available
there<00:00:45.539> we've<00:00:46.140> also<00:00:46.320> got<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.860> gain<00:00:47.219> stage

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
there we've also got this gain stage

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.360 
there we've also got this gain stage
here<00:00:48.059> we've<00:00:48.600> got<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.899> plus<00:00:49.200> five<00:00:49.469> for<00:00:49.500> plus<00:00:50.070> ten

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
here we've got a plus five for plus ten

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.279 
here we've got a plus five for plus ten
or<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.579> minus<00:00:50.879> five<00:00:51.059> or<00:00:51.270> minus<00:00:51.539> ten<00:00:51.750> setting<00:00:52.170> on

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
or a minus five or minus ten setting on

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.910 
or a minus five or minus ten setting on
a<00:00:52.350> feedback<00:00:53.300> loop<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.899> tube<00:00:55.469> amplifier

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
a feedback loop to the tube amplifier

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.119 
a feedback loop to the tube amplifier
section<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.969> what<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.390> can<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.800> can

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
section so what we can do is we can

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.910 
section so what we can do is we can
change<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.149> harmonic<00:01:00.750> content<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.500> what's

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
change the harmonic content of what's

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.070 
change the harmonic content of what's
coming<00:01:02.129> out<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.370> those<00:01:02.550> tubes<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.270> color<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
coming out of those tubes and color the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.840 
coming out of those tubes and color the
sound<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:04.650> make<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.040> sound<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.339> little<00:01:05.460> cleaner

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
sound or make the sound a little cleaner

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.840 
sound or make the sound a little cleaner
by<00:01:06.450> using<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.960> section<00:01:07.320> right<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.850> we've
