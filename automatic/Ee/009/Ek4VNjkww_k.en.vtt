00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
system that it's incredible to think of

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.660 
system that it's incredible to think of
where<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:10.020> came<00:03:10.470> from<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.740> now<00:03:10.950> works<00:03:11.220> dancing

where it came from and now works dancing
yeah<00:03:12.000> i<00:03:12.030> mean<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.540> pretty<00:03:12.840> incredible<00:03:13.020> to

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
yeah i mean it is pretty incredible to
