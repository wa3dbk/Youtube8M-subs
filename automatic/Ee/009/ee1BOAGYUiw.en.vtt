hurricane<00:00:15.780> track<00:00:16.049> forecast<00:00:16.320> improved<00:00:17.220> quite

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
hurricane track forecast improved quite

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.370 
hurricane track forecast improved quite
a<00:00:17.520> bit<00:00:17.580> over<00:00:17.939> the<00:00:18.060> years<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.720> think<00:00:19.260> that's

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
a bit over the years I think that's

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.290 
a bit over the years I think that's
largely<00:00:19.560> due<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.310> fact<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.670> track<00:00:21.060> is

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
largely due to the fact that track is

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.150 
largely due to the fact that track is
governed<00:00:21.660> by<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> large<00:00:22.230> scale<00:00:22.529> winds<00:00:22.860> and

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
governed by the large scale winds and

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.760 
governed by the large scale winds and
larger<00:00:24.000> scales<00:00:24.300> tend<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.990> be<00:00:25.080> easier<00:00:25.439> to

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
larger scales tend to be easier to

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.370 
larger scales tend to be easier to
predict<00:00:26.340> storm<00:00:27.240> intensity<00:00:27.750> though<00:00:28.020> it<00:00:28.170> much

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
predict storm intensity though it much

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.260 
predict storm intensity though it much
more<00:00:28.560> complicated<00:00:28.770> because<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.699> depends<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.210> a

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
more complicated because it depends on a

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.510 
more complicated because it depends on a
range<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.810> scales<00:00:31.080> all<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> way<00:00:32.220> from<00:00:32.400> those

we're looking at the relative roles of

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
the environment through which the storms

move<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.620> then<00:01:13.770> also<00:01:13.950> what's<00:01:14.280> happening<00:01:14.760> in

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
move and then also what's happening in

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.090 
move and then also what's happening in
the<00:01:15.030> interior<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.690> the<00:01:15.840> storms<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.650> how<00:01:16.830> those

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the interior of the storms and how those

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.390 
the interior of the storms and how those
two<00:01:17.400> interact<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:18.600> lead<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.020> storm

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
two interact to lead to storm

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.450 
two interact to lead to storm
intensification<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:22.620> designed<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
intensification and so we designed the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.880 
intensification and so we designed the
payloads<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> global<00:01:24.690> Hawks<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.590> really

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
payloads on the global Hawks to really

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.640 
payloads on the global Hawks to really

tackle one or the other

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.320 
tackle one or the other
