00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:10.039
 Yes Hello er digital spirit level of it is today here Velbon 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:14.900
 There are two action levels here that I would like to introduce here. 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:20.000
 Here is what you call the action level sound and you become king 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.010
 Here's a guy who doesn't make a roar at the action level . 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.220
 Sold 1 mm because it is thick 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:29.670
 Here will be higher 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:34.280
 Well then it's an introduction to the function Well if you're going to explain at the action level 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.880
 I have such an on-off switch here 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.690
 When you turn on the switch like this 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:44.199
 You will be able to adjust the level like this 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:49.409
 This green also shows the level 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.409
 You can adjust the light intensity with this button 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:57.790
 This is the darkest perfume 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:01:00.770
 Now it looks like it's blinking on the screen, but this is a characteristic of the camera, so it's actually 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:04.989
 Looks like it's always lit 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:09.100
 It is such a feeling when you brighten up the exchange most 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:14.080
 But they are supposed to look like this, but maybe that designer 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.649
 Be legal adjustment of the system here is you might think that while looking through the viewfinder 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.649
 I can do it 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.270
 The left is 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:28.189
 It is the most accuracy is high this is the best accuracy is low 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.509
 Institutional low and very good enough good pictures in the house softening even about this or asleep to say 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:34.860
 I think I can shoot 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:38.670
 It is extremely difficult is to put out the middle clearly saying in the most here is if another hand-held 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.290
 Well then, it's the sound I want to explain the sound 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.420
 It will be this A-chan level sound 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.420
 When you turn on the power 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.930
 in this way 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:58.420
 The sound will be heard and the further you go away the faster the sound will be 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:03.600
 And because the noise is different on the left and right 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.600
 You can adjust the level while looking through the finder 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.729
 There is no sound when it is in the middle, but this is the mode in which no sound is heard 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.060
 is not it 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.650
 With no sound mode 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.819
 There is a mode that only happens when you come to the middle, but this is clearly said 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.470
 When it came to the middle 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:28.870
 Than it was I thought very kana little inconvenient not I'd become when off 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:32.879
 This mode when it is off is the most recommended mode because it takes a picture 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.879
 Yes, I would like to put towards the body 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.750
 Dormer cormorants but I think that can be seen that form for 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.060
 This 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:49.360
 I 'm wearing a general hot shoe by sliding it 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:53.770
 And them here in the strap that comes when they are little used in the wearing of sweet 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.440
 To I think a good idea that you do not fall even out wearing strap just a little 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:00.930
 Too far 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:05.060
 It's a play here because the attachment part is plastic attachment part of the strap 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.060
 Please give to not pull too strongly because 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.819
 Also supports the position of the hand or appearance it can be installed is also very cool Shineato ThatLookLikeThis 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.569
 Because 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:22.310
 I think it is the best dog to check the story of the photo 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:26.780
 It's also an excellent point that you can adjust the system, but it's an accessory 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:31.160
 Three action batteries are included with action level pressure level sound 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.250
 And I just said strap and after action level sound only 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.880
 in this way 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.069
 It is this kind of fixed stand 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:45.129
 Because a magnet is attached to that back 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:47.150
 Also be used in the this kind of wind usually of normal Quinn and to make sure the sound slope of something related products 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:51.019
 Can 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:56.680
 Yes, it looks like this action level sound 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.680
 Thank you for watching you want to end the introduction of the action level
