fresh water and they couldn't keep fresh
bait<00:00:33.309> so<00:00:33.610> we<00:00:33.790> kind<00:00:34.000> of<00:00:34.090> put<00:00:34.239> something

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
bait so we kind of put something

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.900 
bait so we kind of put something
together<00:00:34.720> where<00:00:35.530> he<00:00:35.559> can<00:00:35.829> force<00:00:36.129> water<00:00:36.430> in<00:00:36.670> and

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
together where he can force water in and

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.450 
together where he can force water in and
pump<00:00:37.629> water<00:00:37.720> in<00:00:38.820> looking<00:00:39.820> inside<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:41.460> bait

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
pump water in looking inside the bait

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.420 
pump water in looking inside the bait
well<00:00:42.670> itself<00:00:43.090> with<00:00:43.600> the<00:00:43.840> floor<00:00:44.230> section<00:00:45.160> off

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.479 
well itself with the floor section off
we've<00:00:46.330> got<00:00:47.910> where<00:00:48.910> we're<00:00:49.089> bringing<00:00:49.239> water<00:00:49.660> in

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489

use water from the pump there's a

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:52.649 
use water from the pump there's a
one-way<00:01:50.920> valve<00:01:50.950> here<00:01:51.460> also<00:01:51.670> so<00:01:52.359> if<00:01:52.509> we're

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
one-way valve here also so if we're

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.090 
one-way valve here also so if we're
doing<00:01:52.899> a<00:01:52.960> lot<00:01:53.109> of<00:01:53.140> drifting<00:01:53.619> we're<00:01:53.770> trying<00:01:54.009> to

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
doing a lot of drifting we're trying to

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.099 
doing a lot of drifting we're trying to
keep<00:01:54.280> our<00:01:54.520> baits<00:01:54.969> alive<00:01:55.329> or<00:01:55.659> we<00:01:55.749> want<00:01:55.899> to<00:01:55.960> keep

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
keep our baits alive or we want to keep

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:57.599 
keep our baits alive or we want to keep
our<00:01:56.259> fluke<00:01:56.499> alive<00:01:56.799> and<00:01:57.009> we<00:01:57.069> don't<00:01:57.219> have<00:01:57.429> any

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:57.609 
our fluke alive and we don't have any

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:01.080 
our fluke alive and we don't have any
ice<00:01:58.149> till<00:01:58.569> we<00:01:58.659> get<00:01:58.810> home<00:01:59.020> we<00:01:59.740> can<00:02:00.100> just<00:02:00.880> keep

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
ice till we get home we can just keep

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.149 
ice till we get home we can just keep
that<00:02:01.149> pump<00:02:01.600> on<00:02:01.810> keep<00:02:02.200> recirculating<00:02:02.889> water

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
that pump on keep recirculating water

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.160 
that pump on keep recirculating water
the<00:02:03.700> water<00:02:03.939> will<00:02:04.090> never<00:02:04.329> push<00:02:04.659> past<00:02:04.960> this

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
the water will never push past this

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.410 
the water will never push past this
point<00:02:05.439> because<00:02:05.829> of<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.039> one<00:02:06.219> wave<00:02:06.399> out<00:02:06.639> so

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
point because of the one wave out so

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.050 
point because of the one wave out so
what<00:02:07.840> we've<00:02:07.990> basically<00:02:08.319> created<00:02:08.710> is<00:02:09.340> a<00:02:09.700> real

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
what we've basically created is a real

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.809 
what we've basically created is a real
nice<00:02:10.330> efficient<00:02:10.929> Live<00:02:11.140> Well<00:02:11.380> system<00:02:11.860> for<00:02:12.700> them

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
nice efficient Live Well system for them

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.770 
nice efficient Live Well system for them
to<00:02:13.000> use<00:02:13.210> with<00:02:13.660> fish<00:02:13.930> or<00:02:14.170> with<00:02:14.470> bait<00:02:14.710> and<00:02:15.780> you

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
to use with fish or with bait and you

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.710 
to use with fish or with bait and you
know<00:02:16.900> it's<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.440> doesn't<00:02:17.830> have<00:02:17.980> anything

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
know it's it doesn't have anything

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.360 
know it's it doesn't have anything

opening is here the high water flow
switch<00:02:32.620> is<00:02:32.800> behind<00:02:33.130> it

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
switch is behind it

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.370 
switch is behind it
you<00:02:33.940> can<00:02:34.120> get<00:02:34.240> in<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.540> lid<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.960> can<00:02:34.990> make<00:02:35.260> an

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
you can get in that lid you can make an

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.750 
you can get in that lid you can make an
adjustment<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.040> high<00:02:36.220> water<00:02:36.250> float

adjustment to the high water float
switch<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.240> can<00:02:37.360> clean<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.750> bilge<00:02:37.960> if<00:02:38.230> you

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
switch you can clean the bilge if you

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.690 
switch you can clean the bilge if you
needed<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.680> you'll<00:02:39.040> be<00:02:39.070> able<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.400> get<00:02:39.550> to

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
needed to you'll be able to get to

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.160 
needed to you'll be able to get to
everything<00:02:40.030> you<00:02:40.630> know<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:40.780> got<00:02:40.960> to<00:02:41.050> think

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
everything you know you got to think

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.110 
everything you know you got to think
these<00:02:41.380> things<00:02:41.440> out<00:02:41.830> before<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.280> button<00:02:43.060> them

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
these things out before you button them

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.480 
these things out before you button them
up<00:02:43.270> because<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.530> do<00:02:44.680> have<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.980> get<00:02:45.100> to<00:02:45.250> things

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
up because you do have to get to things

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.160 
up because you do have to get to things
from<00:02:45.640> maintenance<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:46.300> I<00:02:46.510> think<00:02:46.900> this<00:02:47.110> is

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
from maintenance so I think this is

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.490 
from maintenance so I think this is
going<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.440> work<00:02:47.470> really<00:02:48.190> well<00:02:49.200> yeah<00:02:50.280> that's<00:02:51.280> it
