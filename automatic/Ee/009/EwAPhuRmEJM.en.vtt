00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.830
 fast and that the battery lasts longer 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:37.830
 no need 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:40.100
 of ruth well let's start by what by 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.160
 the first 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.560
 the s voice not the laws so that 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.520
 the button and disk work faster 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.920
 from here adjustments and adjustments are going to 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.039
 leave this is marked 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:02.100

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:04.049
 home and then here adjustments this was
