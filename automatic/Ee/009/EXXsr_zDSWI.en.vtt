00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 what's up, guys ? 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.269
 I'm going to teach you guys or rather try 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.800
 teaching tips daruma some tips from there 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.590
 who has difficulty getting the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.809
 wheel bearing and put it back 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.680
 so I'm going to change the wheel I'll put 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.650
 this wheel here is a softer wheel yes 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.980
 to the land that has to stop 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.260
 home is better a softer wheel than 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.019
 is using it here the element found 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.930
 very hard so I'm going to change here today 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.870
 and enjoy and make a video of 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.870
 how to draw is to fit the wheel bearing 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.690
 So go on with the things you're going 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:06.370
 need to be a key 13 that is 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:11.640
 to the wheel crown here is the 13 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:14.530
 you will need on the wheels of the wheels and 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.180
 You will put it on and take it off. 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.310
 so the first thing has to do 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:24.010
 here's gonna take the wheel then said 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.210
 to do here is this because here it is 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.840
 very good 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:32.080
 it protects the bearing rolling 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.479
 does not protect the thread so it will damage 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.830
 rice that will only damage this part of the 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:41.920
 porquinha so here is going to help a lot 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:45.070
 da silva interest 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:51.550
 Good, so you can take the door and you can 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:54.130
 realize that it will protect you and prevent 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.000
 bearing contact with the nut that 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.950
 rolinha 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.380
 so I'll leave it here in the corner 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.390
 to take the wheel and you will realize 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.009
 down here will have another grandmother it here 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.229
 is also to prevent the contact of the 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.899
 bearing contract that is the other expert 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.440
 accountant lament here rolling with 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.880
 sow is what serves her what she has 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.700
 what to do now 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.800
 the wheel has two bearings one of this side 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.920
 here one of this other that has to do 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.650
 now using the tank itself you 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.930
 that the first bearing in the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.569
 excel when you see that when you so 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.520
 You can see that from the top when the 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.390
 excel get on the other end of the first 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.970
 bearing 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.709
 So you have to put it in here. 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.840
 which on the one hand ensures the 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.120
 with one hand and with the other you 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.849
 stay here on the wheel force him to the side 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:52.720
 so that you have the wheel and 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:57.280
 Rolling stay on the other side trick 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:02.860
 when you see that yours is here 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.830
 on the other hand here the bearing 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.830
 wheel 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.380
 the torque is stipulated 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.290
 In this case it was quite easy that you can 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.970
 do is also be turning to here 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.250
 people take this side a little bit this turn 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:21.200
 wheel pulls the other up to 100 all now 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.080
 is putting the wheel here leaves a 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.780
 rolling here is like you 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.030
 they are watching left a lament that catches the 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.140
 ball and puts on the bearing and makes 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.870
 pressure here pushes the wheel over the 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.000
 I regret that he goes to the wheel will enter the 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.490
 bearing will fit on the wheel or 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.770
 It's always easy so if you have too much 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.690
 Difficult thing you can do 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.700
 You can put it here and play all your 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.709
 Weight on top can put skate on the floor 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.120
 and throw all your weight on top of the wheel 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.209
 probably enter 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.459
 If it does not work, it can fit the maximum 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.250
 to get behaves you put in 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.450
 screw and tighten all that increase goes 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.500
 enter right on 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.680
 so do here again put 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.290
 especially pushed the wheel 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.470
 wheel touch bearing 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.620
 as you can see now let's put 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:19.430
 the wheel back without doing now picks up the 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.250
 brown she puts here on the stretch to 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:29.240
 avoid contact of the robot from the 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:30.650
 non-bearing door with the trike and 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.630
 put the nut 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.400
 Another thing you have to know is 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.210
 so much that you have to tighten that 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.240
 nut 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.520
 so I follow your part do not have this 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.970
 protection here that probably will not 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.050
 Tue 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.960
 I recommend you leave it brings 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.330
 rent because when the central screw 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.870
 he skateboard type you send philips kit 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.340
 kat cousin is going to hit excel then it goes 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.530
 damage the thread 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.180
 There you will have this door that will not 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.860
 get put back 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.990
 so what I recommend you leave 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.810
 yields because in that case it will only ruin 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.150
 the nut there is only you to change the nut 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.810
 better than having to change traffic 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.270
 but if not then this protection 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.260
 I recommend you leave the wheel light 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:25.710
 game 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:25.710
 here's some more 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:38.440
 so with this game here it comes little if 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.600
 it is only for those who do not have this protection 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.030
 If you leave, we'll keep 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.130
 A lot of game so I have to do not go 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.760
 stay with the game but it will not hurt 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.770
 anything 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.990
 I do not like to leave too much because 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:54.040
 also because this board then protects 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:57.729
 it will not make a difference but if it had 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.270
 protection and let's pretty good game is 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.660
 that 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.570
 pretty much that's all good guys this 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:08.139
 was the video how to put how to change 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.880
 the laments of how to change the wheel and in 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.350
 brief is also doing how to clean 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.729
 the bearings 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:17.710
 I already bought your own oil, I know if you 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.320
 liked this basic tip that is 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.240
 but for starters I'm betting 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.150
 in the videos there masp for who is 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.380
 starting skateboarding I think goes 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.300
 help a lot 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.229
 so if you like it there and here 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.050
 down 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:36.280
 sign up for the channel down here too 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.200
 share the video add to 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.200
 favorites to help spread the word 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.810
 video and that is there any doubt 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.430
 comments here also that I go 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.039
 trying to answer and if you want 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:51.070
 learning a new one may also have to 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:52.360
 according to the maneuver I do the tutorial and 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.660
 for you 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.229
 So that's what I said and until the next 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.229
 video
