00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
me a second to sort of get used to it

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.240 
me a second to sort of get used to it
and<00:05:04.780> figure<00:05:04.870> out<00:05:05.020> that<00:05:05.320> is<00:05:05.560> this<00:05:05.710> okay<00:05:05.980> is<00:05:06.100> it's

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
and figure out that is this okay is it's

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.100 
and figure out that is this okay is it's
bad<00:05:06.430> I'm<00:05:06.610> scared<00:05:06.700> of<00:05:06.940> change<00:05:07.210> but<00:05:07.720> in<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:07.960> end

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
bad I'm scared of change but in the end

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.290

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
fourth link on Chrome I think there's

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.840 
fourth link on Chrome I think there's
something<00:06:09.669> similar<00:06:09.970> from<00:06:10.270> Mozilla<00:06:10.660> and<00:06:10.930> for

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
something similar from Mozilla and for

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.180 
something similar from Mozilla and for
Safari<00:06:12.850> but<00:06:13.510> on<00:06:13.660> Chrome<00:06:13.990> it's<00:06:14.410> it's<00:06:14.650> this<00:06:14.860> and

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
Safari but on Chrome it's it's this and

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.010 
Safari but on Chrome it's it's this and
what<00:06:15.580> it<00:06:15.669> does<00:06:15.880> is<00:06:16.240> it<00:06:16.390> allows<00:06:16.570> you<00:06:16.720> to<00:06:16.840> see<00:06:16.990> the

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
what it does is it allows you to see the

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.690 
what it does is it allows you to see the
ratings<00:06:17.380> to<00:06:17.440> not<00:06:17.680> get<00:06:17.950> trolled<00:06:18.250> like<00:06:18.550> you

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
ratings to not get trolled like you

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.550 
ratings to not get trolled like you
maybe<00:06:18.880> would<00:06:19.150> before<00:06:19.540> like<00:06:19.780> you<00:06:19.810> know<00:06:20.020> here's

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
maybe would before like you know here's

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.440 
maybe would before like you know here's

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450 
here are my videos I wish that had a

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.330 
here are my videos I wish that had a
better<00:06:22.630> rating<00:06:23.200> but<00:06:23.410> whatever<00:06:23.710> you<00:06:23.890> can<00:06:24.160> sort

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
better rating but whatever you can sort

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.860 
better rating but whatever you can sort
of<00:06:24.400> tell<00:06:24.580> how<00:06:24.790> the<00:06:24.850> video<00:06:25.150> was<00:06:25.300> received<00:06:25.690> and

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
of tell how the video was received and

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.870 
of tell how the video was received and
then<00:06:26.380> when<00:06:26.650> you<00:06:26.770> go<00:06:26.919> to<00:06:26.950> sees<00:06:27.400> other<00:06:27.550> videos

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
then when you go to sees other videos

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.670 
then when you go to sees other videos
like<00:06:28.000> this<00:06:28.120> guy<00:06:28.270> copies<00:06:28.690> my<00:06:28.840> tags<00:06:29.110> so<00:06:29.380> he<00:06:29.500> gets

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
like this guy copies my tags so he gets

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.550 
like this guy copies my tags so he gets
related<00:06:29.950> videos<00:06:30.400> on<00:06:30.550> me<00:06:31.050> his<00:06:32.050> ratings<00:06:32.470> are

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
related videos on me his ratings are

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.950 
related videos on me his ratings are
terrible<00:06:32.890> so<00:06:33.250> I<00:06:33.820> guess<00:06:34.150> people<00:06:34.570> don't<00:06:34.840> like

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
terrible so I guess people don't like

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.200 
terrible so I guess people don't like
his<00:06:35.110> stuff<00:06:35.349> and<00:06:35.590> then<00:06:36.099> like<00:06:36.490> this<00:06:36.669> guy<00:06:36.820> he<00:06:37.060> did

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
his stuff and then like this guy he did

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.640 
his stuff and then like this guy he did
a<00:06:37.240> you<00:06:37.599> know<00:06:37.690> how<00:06:37.780> to<00:06:37.840> Jailbreak<00:06:38.260> he's<00:06:38.380> gotten

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
a you know how to Jailbreak he's gotten

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.650

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
a really great reception so

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.120 
a really great reception so
doing<00:06:40.960> this<00:06:41.050> you<00:06:41.380> can<00:06:41.530> kind<00:06:41.650> of<00:06:41.770> figure<00:06:41.980> out

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
doing this you can kind of figure out

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.280 
doing this you can kind of figure out
you<00:06:43.030> know<00:06:43.060> if<00:06:43.150> you're<00:06:43.450> getting<00:06:43.600> what<00:06:43.900> you<00:06:44.050> want
