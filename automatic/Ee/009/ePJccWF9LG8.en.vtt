00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.370 
campus is because on a majority white
campus<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.310> think<00:02:12.580> too<00:02:13.030> often<00:02:13.239> we<00:02:13.450> we<00:02:14.080> talk

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
campus I think too often we we talk

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.470 
campus I think too often we we talk
about<00:02:14.560> race<00:02:14.920> as<00:02:15.220> only<00:02:15.880> being<00:02:16.060> about<00:02:16.180> other

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
about race as only being about other

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.140 
about race as only being about other
people<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.680> think<00:02:17.739> that<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.640> more<00:02:18.850> we<00:02:19.000> can

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
people and I think that the more we can

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.910 
people and I think that the more we can
be<00:02:19.510> comfortable<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:20.230> talking<00:02:20.530> about<00:02:20.620> race

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
be comfortable and talking about race

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.430 
be comfortable and talking about race
and<00:02:21.160> acknowledging<00:02:21.819> our<00:02:21.910> own<00:02:22.120> race<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
and acknowledging our own race the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.110 
and acknowledging our own race the
better<00:02:23.620> we'll<00:02:23.859> be<00:02:24.010> moving<00:02:24.609> forward

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
better we'll be moving forward

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.640 
better we'll be moving forward
especially<00:02:25.239> as<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.840> demographics<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.560> our

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
especially as the demographics of our

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.920 
especially as the demographics of our
student<00:02:27.070> population<00:02:27.130> change<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:28.209> think

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
student population change I think

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.440 
student population change I think
technology<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.709> think<00:02:29.940> information<00:02:30.940> and

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
technology and I think information and

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.710 
technology and I think information and
our<00:02:31.600> media<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.620> like<00:02:32.769> had<00:02:33.010> helped<00:02:33.720> bring

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
our media and the like had helped bring

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.020 
our media and the like had helped bring
the<00:02:34.840> question<00:02:35.290> up<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.859> include<00:02:36.579> a<00:02:36.700> lot<00:02:36.850> more

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
the question up to include a lot more

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.860 
the question up to include a lot more
people<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.600> lot<00:02:37.750> more<00:02:37.780> examples

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
people and a lot more examples

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.250 
people and a lot more examples
but<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.560> think<00:02:40.860> there's<00:02:41.040> still<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:42.230> lot<00:02:43.230> of

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
but I think there's still a lot of

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.089 
but I think there's still a lot of
racism<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:44.489> exists<00:02:44.849> today<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:46.440> UFO<00:02:46.799> is<00:02:46.950> an

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
racism that exists today the UFO is an

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.729 
racism that exists today the UFO is an
accepting<00:02:47.670> place<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:48.989> theory<00:02:49.650> but<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:52.110> amount

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
accepting place in theory but the amount

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.399 
accepting place in theory but the amount
of<00:02:53.090> racial<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.239> ethnic<00:02:54.569> diversity<00:02:54.720> is

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
of racial and ethnic diversity is

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.119 
of racial and ethnic diversity is
limited<00:02:56.040> we<00:02:56.489> as<00:02:56.849> a<00:02:56.909> society<00:02:57.180> have<00:02:58.040> started<00:02:59.040> to

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
limited we as a society have started to

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.920 
limited we as a society have started to
look<00:02:59.310> away<00:02:59.400> from<00:02:59.519> racing<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.480> making<00:03:00.810> sure

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
look away from racing like making sure

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.569 
look away from racing like making sure
everyone<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:01.709> equal<00:03:02.159> that<00:03:02.340> we're<00:03:02.459> actually

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
everyone is so equal that we're actually

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.309 
everyone is so equal that we're actually
losing<00:03:02.879> part<00:03:03.239> of<00:03:03.360> like<00:03:03.599> what<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:03.989> person's
