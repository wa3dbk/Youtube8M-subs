00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.800

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.260
 last night I discovered in 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.130
 stale chicken breast in the fridge 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.980

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.470

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.530
 I grind 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:48.860
 chicken meat in your food processor 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.170
 adding there fresh onions and garlic and then 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.629

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:38.159
