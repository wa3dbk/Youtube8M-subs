00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
 is the seventh art one level beyond 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.510
 As you can see, they are very comfortable seats 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.130
 cervical support lumbar support in a 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.590
 sponge 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.440
 soft that will take us to a level of 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.020
 comfort throughout the course of the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.180
 movie in the beginning we're going to have 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.710
 the projection of a beat box short 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.020
 corporate where are we going to experience 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.930
 some levels and some types of 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.649
 movements after that we're going let's go 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.060
 to have a short polar express one 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.290
 film that we already project but that 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.100
 he has a cool scene of type feel 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.320
 another level 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.320
 another kind of vibrations obviously the 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.330
 idea is to get into the movie a lot 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.160
 more and we're going to see what we're going to have for 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.020
 example scenes from patterned indie box 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.820
 so you can see how he gets bored 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.250
 some individuals 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.780
 after that we will have gravity 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.670
 because the medium is so versatile that it is 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.890
 so versatile that he will invite us and we 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.810
 is going to put a little in orbit 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.909
 and give us that feeling of zero gravity 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.470
 where are we going to have movements a little 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.040
 more oscillatory 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.360
 soft as it is in the same space by 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.730
 there we went through some explosion of 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.130
 a satellite that we have just in gravity 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.130
 and in the end we will have a sequence 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.750
 strong interesting action star 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.210
 trek then 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.890
 the seat has on the right side a 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.600
 level of control is very important that 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.479
 because who is 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.330
 levels the intensity of the sensations 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.220
 are you the right hand I invite you to 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.400
 that they put it to the maximum this is a tea 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.790
 this time we are going to burst those that 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.680
 they are in the left hand they are so that 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.659
 you put your drinks without any 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.670
 The system will be inconvenient 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.490
 it's just that the experience 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.860
 cinema is moved to a level of 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.119
 addiction without bothering us then 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.880
 we have to be comfortable with these 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.780
 changes with our drink and everything without 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.940
 plus 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.470
 they are same snacks so smart they are 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.470
 educated that will welcome us
