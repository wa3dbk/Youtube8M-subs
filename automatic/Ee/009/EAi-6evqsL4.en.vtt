00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
like I said the best thing is to do is

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.899 
like I said the best thing is to do is
just<00:01:10.560> run<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.950> dodge<00:01:11.100> because<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.580> will<00:01:11.760> be

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
just run and dodge because you will be

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.390 
just run and dodge because you will be
having<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.360> lot<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.439> about<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
having a lot of you have about one to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
two zombies - zombies in the beginning

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.050 
two zombies - zombies in the beginning
and<00:01:16.530> then<00:01:16.619> one<00:01:16.860> after<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.340> kill<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.549> last<00:01:17.790> two

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
use a magnum pick up the Magnum villages

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.950 
use a magnum pick up the Magnum villages
and<00:01:56.460> Magnum<00:01:56.759> should<00:01:57.060> have<00:01:57.240> his<00:01:57.390> little<00:01:57.659> spores

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.460 
and Magnum should have his little spores
for<00:01:58.409> spots

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
for spots

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.190

yellow<00:02:02.500> orange<00:02:02.890> ball<00:02:03.130> thingies<00:02:03.670> that

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
yellow orange ball thingies that

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.700 
yellow orange ball thingies that
sticking<00:02:04.180> on<00:02:04.300> his<00:02:04.420> body<00:02:04.630> but<00:02:05.230> I<00:02:05.440> recommend

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
sticking on his body but I recommend

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.320 
sticking on his body but I recommend
shooting<00:02:06.130> at<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.370> first<00:02:06.640> two<00:02:06.910> thing<00:02:07.180> the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
shooting at the first two thing the

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.030 
shooting at the first two thing the
first<00:02:07.570> hole<00:02:07.720> is<00:02:07.840> one<00:02:08.020> in<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.260> bottom<00:02:08.560> by<00:02:08.860> his

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
first hole is one in the bottom by his

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.700 
first hole is one in the bottom by his
hip<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:09.460> in<00:02:09.910> one<00:02:10.090> respect<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:11.140> it's<00:02:11.530> pretty

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
hip and in one respect so it's pretty

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.590 
hip and in one respect so it's pretty
hard<00:02:12.070> pretty<00:02:12.340> takes<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.730> takes<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:13.090> lot<00:02:13.270> of<00:02:13.300> time

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
hard pretty takes it takes a lot of time

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.540 
hard pretty takes it takes a lot of time
especially<00:02:14.260> when<00:02:14.680> he<00:02:14.740> keeps<00:02:14.890> doing<00:02:15.160> this<00:02:15.250> for

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
especially when he keeps doing this for

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.370 
especially when he keeps doing this for
balls<00:02:15.850> or<00:02:16.060> whatever<00:02:16.210> so<00:02:16.600> it<00:02:16.960> makes<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.290> a

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
balls or whatever so it makes it a

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.170 
balls or whatever so it makes it a
little<00:02:17.560> bit<00:02:17.740> more<00:02:17.920> difficult<00:02:18.370> for<00:02:18.520> you<00:02:18.670> to

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
little bit more difficult for you to

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.550 
little bit more difficult for you to
like<00:02:19.360> actually<00:02:19.570> kill<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.050> guy<00:02:20.140> that's<00:02:20.380> why

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
like actually kill the guy that's why

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.680 
like actually kill the guy that's why
instead<00:02:21.310> take<00:02:21.850> that's<00:02:22.030> why<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.210> said<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.540> takes

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
instead take that's why I said it takes

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.050 
instead take that's why I said it takes
about<00:02:22.810> fifteen<00:02:23.710> ten<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.430> fifteen<00:02:24.760> minutes

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
about fifteen ten to fifteen minutes

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.800 
about fifteen ten to fifteen minutes
tops

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
tops

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.210 
tops
to<00:02:26.200> really<00:02:26.440> kill<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.800> but<00:02:26.920> not<00:02:27.010> only<00:02:27.070> that

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
to really kill it but not only that

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.150 
to really kill it but not only that
maybe<00:02:27.550> longer<00:02:28.030> because<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:29.380> will<00:02:29.560> die<00:02:29.800> a

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
maybe longer because you will die a

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.370 
maybe longer because you will die a
couple<00:02:30.490> of<00:02:30.700> times<00:02:30.910> I'm<00:02:31.570> just<00:02:32.020> putting<00:02:32.290> out

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
couple of times I'm just putting out

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.950 
couple of times I'm just putting out
that<00:02:32.410> you<00:02:32.620> will<00:02:32.770> die<00:02:32.980> up<00:02:33.250> maybe<00:02:33.550> about<00:02:34.390> five<00:02:34.720> to

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
that you will die up maybe about five to

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.960 
that you will die up maybe about five to
six<00:02:35.140> times<00:02:35.380> max<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:36.100> mean<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.310> died<00:02:36.520> more<00:02:36.760> than

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
six times max I mean I died more than

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.050 
six times max I mean I died more than
that<00:02:37.150> but<00:02:37.860> like<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:38.950> said<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.250> just<00:02:39.370> all<00:02:39.760> depends

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
that but like I said it just all depends

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.120 
that but like I said it just all depends
on<00:02:40.150> how<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.360> play<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:40.930> how<00:02:41.080> how<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:41.710> are<00:02:41.950> as<00:02:42.100> a

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
person in the game so like say if you

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.810 
person in the game so like say if you
really<00:02:44.230> act<00:02:44.500> like<00:02:44.590> really<00:02:45.070> really<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.550> good

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
really act like really really that good

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.070 
really act like really really that good
at<00:02:45.940> all<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.240> type<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.450> stuff<00:02:46.600> can<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:46.900> be

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
at all that type of stuff can you be

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.290 
at all that type of stuff can you be
able<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.290> dodge<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.680> quick<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:48.640> know<00:02:48.760> get<00:02:49.030> get

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
able to dodge it quick you know get get

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.360 
able to dodge it quick you know get get
kill<00:02:49.540> away<00:02:49.750> faster<00:02:50.200> but<00:02:50.470> like<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.040> said<00:02:51.100> the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
kill away faster but like I said the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.680 
kill away faster but like I said the
first<00:02:51.490> thing<00:02:51.670> you<00:02:51.760> do<00:02:51.910> just<00:02:52.180> shoot<00:02:52.330> up<00:02:52.450> on

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
first thing you do just shoot up on

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.940 
once you do that it so I recommend
having<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.870> shotgun<00:02:59.140> so<00:02:59.320> when<00:02:59.590> you<00:02:59.680> have<00:02:59.830> the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
having a shotgun so when you have the

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.680 
having a shotgun so when you have the
shotgun<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:01.000> can<00:03:01.180> shoot<00:03:01.450> him

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
shotgun you can shoot him

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.380 
shotgun you can shoot him
I<00:03:01.990> mean<00:03:02.380> maybe<00:03:02.740> sometimes<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.760> probably<00:03:04.150> won't

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
I mean maybe sometimes it probably won't

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.940 
I mean maybe sometimes it probably won't
work<00:03:04.540> sometimes<00:03:05.050> but<00:03:05.170> I'm<00:03:05.410> guaranteeing<00:03:05.830> it

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
work sometimes but I'm guaranteeing it

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.860 
work sometimes but I'm guaranteeing it
will<00:03:06.040> work<00:03:06.190> always<00:03:06.430> where<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.360> have<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.660> run

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
will work always where you have to run

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.960 
will work always where you have to run
up<00:03:07.989> on<00:03:08.140> them<00:03:08.320> close<00:03:08.590> at<00:03:08.830> a<00:03:08.860> good<00:03:09.100> ring<00:03:09.370> not<00:03:09.700> not

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
up on them close at a good ring not not

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.090

shotgun if you should have in the

correct spot and a perfect time you'll

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.780 
correct spot and a perfect time you'll
automatically<00:03:23.830> kill<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:24.220> get<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.370> kill<00:03:24.670> the

Broner

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
Broner

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.790 
Broner
and<00:03:25.330> that<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:26.110> think<00:03:26.350> that's<00:03:26.440> one<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.739> the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
and that I think that's one of the

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.350 
and that I think that's one of the
fastest<00:03:27.160> ways<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.459> can<00:03:27.610> kill<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.820> guy<00:03:28.030> if<00:03:28.209> you

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
fastest ways you can kill a guy if you

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.210 
fastest ways you can kill a guy if you
don't<00:03:28.540> have<00:03:28.690> like<00:03:28.840> a<00:03:28.900> Molotov<00:03:29.440> but<00:03:29.739> if<00:03:30.100> you

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
don't have like a Molotov but if you

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.590 
don't have like a Molotov but if you
have<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.370> Molotov<00:03:30.910> then<00:03:31.090> you<00:03:31.180> can<00:03:31.300> kill<00:03:31.480> them

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
have a Molotov then you can kill them

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.900 
have a Molotov then you can kill them
like<00:03:31.810> way<00:03:32.019> faster<00:03:32.560> probably<00:03:33.040> throw<00:03:33.370> one<00:03:33.640> atom

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
like way faster probably throw one atom

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.040 
like way faster probably throw one atom
in<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:34.209> just<00:03:34.300> start<00:03:34.540> shooting<00:03:34.690> them<00:03:34.870> with<00:03:34.959> a
