one I think you should get because the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.230 
one I think you should get because the
ones<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.340> take<00:01:17.520> off<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.820> cover<00:01:18.000> they're

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.870 
ones that you take off the cover they're
so<00:01:18.390> thick<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.810> barely<00:01:19.590> even<00:01:19.860> portable<00:01:20.460> you

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
so thick that barely even portable you

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.450 
so thick that barely even portable you
get<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.210> one<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:22.170> truly<00:01:22.500> feels<00:01:22.650> portable<00:01:23.369> its

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
get this one it truly feels portable its

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.030 
get this one it truly feels portable its
folds<00:01:23.909> up<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.360> small<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.869> tight<00:01:25.259> much

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
folds up really small and tight much

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.800 
folds up really small and tight much
nicer<00:01:26.490> than<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.360> take<00:01:27.509> off<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
nicer than the one that you take off the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.420 
nicer than the one that you take off the
black<00:01:27.990> cover<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.380> make<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.710> shoot<00:01:29.009> through

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
black cover to make it a shoot through
