insight into that particular event a few

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.060 
insight into that particular event a few
years<00:01:27.299> ago<00:01:27.450> gog<00:01:28.200> announced<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.860> would<00:01:28.950> be

closing down permanently and the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.289 
closing down permanently and the
internet<00:01:31.790> exploded

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.390 

but<00:01:37.299> of<00:01:37.420> course<00:01:37.750> it<00:01:38.020> was<00:01:38.140> all<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.380> big<00:01:38.650> PR<00:01:39.040> stunt

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
but of course it was all a big PR stunt

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.310 
but of course it was all a big PR stunt
and<00:01:39.610> then<00:01:40.150> everyone<00:01:40.630> has<00:01:40.780> kind<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.080> forgot

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
and then everyone has kind of forgot

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.910 
and then everyone has kind of forgot
about<00:01:41.350> it

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
about it

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.370 
about it
CD<00:01:42.610> Projekt<00:01:42.820> rationalized<00:01:43.780> it<00:01:43.990> by<00:01:44.110> saying

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
CD Projekt rationalized it by saying

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.320 
CD Projekt rationalized it by saying
that<00:01:44.500> even<00:01:44.860> if<00:01:44.950> they<00:01:45.100> did<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.369> close<00:01:45.549> down<00:01:45.790> you

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
that even if they did to close down you

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.210 
that even if they did to close down you
could<00:01:46.570> just<00:01:46.810> download<00:01:46.960> all<00:01:47.320> your<00:01:47.500> games<00:01:47.710> DRM

sure<00:03:24.760> valve<00:03:25.060> would<00:03:25.359> just<00:03:25.600> make<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:25.900> so<00:03:26.079> games

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
sure valve would just make it so games

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.830 
sure valve would just make it so games

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840
