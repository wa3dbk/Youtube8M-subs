00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:14.940
 hello welcome here I show you this 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.869
 design that I did thinking about the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.500
 winter season with the new 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.000
 ranges of colors that are going to be 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:31.540
 using the two colors are going to be the 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.880
 reddish brown blue mint 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.610
 the black although we pass the golds 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.940
 although he writes with a combination between 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.790
 golden and turquoise then I hope that 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.489
 like it here I am showing you from 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.329
 the beginning almost does not show it but 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.659
 Now I wanted to do it 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.420
 how is the way I'm doing the 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.600
 almond here the almond of treatment by 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.299
 Regularly do it in two pearls 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.350
 a big one as they saw I let her 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:07.450
 will level alone already only with the pp very 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.259
 softly will tell you by medel and other 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.600
 perlite 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:16.090
 it was all this mixture is a mixture that 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.259
 finished later and if he encouraged for this 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.619
 design is a golden and super mix 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.720
 Gorgeous as you can see and 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.140
 I'm putting it in the whole area of 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.700
 attention reaching the anchors 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.289
 very well 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.420
 in which the dark very well so that 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.939
 is the principle of our nail is the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.090
 strength is what will keep her firm 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.759
 until he has to start very well 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.299
 so that nothing will happen with 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.979
 our one and now this blue is a blue 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.579
 turquoise 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.939
 but it has art drop effect this 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.360
 blue is from my collection for the edition 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.360
 xxi 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:07.650
 I had it for sale but I 'm going to have it 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.899
 the publication to the limited division 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.890
 with those who do not have 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.709
 can you make this combination 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.799
 but easy things in any blue 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.220
 any mint they have already put it in 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:28.420
 all the tips this mix that is 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:32.769
 using as you saw is called saint is 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:36.099
 of my friend loops makeup has channel 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:39.280
 she swapped her time and 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.590
 I received this mascletÃ  and I loved it is from 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.609
 my favorites all the blocks are good 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.190
 nice but these are very favorites and well 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:51.959
 I wanted to show me a video but just 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.819
 it was like that that the precise ass for 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.019
 to show the next ones like that the 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:01.900
 combination as combined this mixture 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.939
 with which I put previously nothing 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.540
 I'm not accommodating all your sticks 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:10.379
 that have very blurred 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.950
 and then I love it is all I'm going to 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:19.799
 put we get it right calculate how they see 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:23.609
 This form of nail is in skeleton is 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:27.260
 narrow of the tip but it is square and 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.260
 here nothing else I'm encapsulating 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.460
 very carefully and encapsulate all the 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.650
 but you can do it this long 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:41.070
 the first of all we are polishing 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.070
 The nail 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.710
 the last ones that I'm using are 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.720
 the tie in love very much are very 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.310
 good ones 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.940
 for ladies the clean definition 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.940
 solutions 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:03.530
 and now I'm going to make a little flower 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.380
 roses of people mention with this 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:10.230
 critical the organic that is smeared 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.090
 white fast drying 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.500
 I'm going to make two roses like three or 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:21.290
 four bananas informs so nothing more 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.290
 they were already turning the rice date 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:30.690
 this clear design is very long but 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.580
 it's just an idea for you 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.180
 they see how they can combine the 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.150
 colors not because they see there 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.250
 I'm not going to be able to be the longest 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.850
 can make anyone not clear that if everything 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.760
 you can make a tiny number one 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.520
 number two and I think the measure 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.330
 perfect nails that look at this 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:59.310
 itches the remaining hands fit very well 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:03.810
 there is a color what live quotes is a 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.730
 number 22 you offer the 12 is an icon of the 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.610
 prices for people who provide more 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:12.980
 get used to like that because number 1 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.980
 It's very curtain but number 2 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.160
 the two roses 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.960
 and now I'm doing it as a 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.970
 species of droplet very on a target 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.440
 lower request, explain depp 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.910
 tried 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:35.949
 this brushes of number 5 howard this 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:40.100
 they received him beautiful in a long time and 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:42.569
 I liked it a lot, I still do not have it 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.679
 and there will be a lot 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:49.729
 now nothing else I will give as an age 

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:52.649
 a sweep could be very the number with 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:55.199
 this critic who is fantasy has not 

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:59.219
 checked nothing else but give it a little 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:01.979
 of business effect airs I share this 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:05.879
 wax pencil that I loved that I 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:09.259
 gave my friend carmen that she is from 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:11.759
 mexico and she was so cute to send me 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:14.729
 many things always because it is to come 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:19.080
 this and it is the best brush that I have 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:20.939
 had for the stones the one that had 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.889
 other steel but it does not work for me 

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:25.559
 if I first it worked 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:28.999
 I appreciate that what I call it the 

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:32.789
 we're just putting pebbles 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:34.949
 indistinctly for the almond area 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:38.580
 and for the area the tip but orange 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:40.349
 just all the spaces you leave now 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.290
 you always impose the guidance of the 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:44.750
 almond 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:48.770
 and nothing else I put these are cupa 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:50.990
 inc.com and it shines a lot and as the 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:54.490
 mix that he put on is like art drop more 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:57.160
 or less can you put the sand 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:01.150
 and you know with turning the stones for 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:03.880
 that do not lose their shine and putting 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.280
 Pretty gel covering the entire nail 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.680
 because sometimes they are like nooks and crannies 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.720
 it's because it makes the nail absorb it so 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:14.050
 you have to put the gel very well so that 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.300
 there is nothing good guaqui then well 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:19.270
 is how my design looks like because the 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:22.660
 very beautiful lamp or just an idea 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:24.340
 I hope you liked my design and 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.889
 from the welcome to the new ones that 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:29.370
 have subscribed to my channel and we see the 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:29.370
 next 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.620
 one
