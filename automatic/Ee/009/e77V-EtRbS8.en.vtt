I<00:02:07.340> use<00:02:07.940> my<00:02:08.119> muscles<00:02:08.330> on<00:02:08.720> other<00:02:08.930> things

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.420 

we'll<00:02:13.180> just<00:02:13.390> keep<00:02:13.540> on<00:02:13.750> running<00:02:14.140> this<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:15.280> if

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
together a few more minutes it'll make a

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.350 
together a few more minutes it'll make a

fast<00:02:56.980> things<00:02:57.250> will<00:02:57.430> be<00:02:57.520> flying<00:02:57.820> out<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.180> here

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
fast things will be flying out of here

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.860 
fast things will be flying out of here
no<00:02:59.470> rush<00:03:02.580> now<00:03:03.580> I'm<00:03:03.640> gonna<00:03:03.940> increase<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.600> speed

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
no rush now I'm gonna increase the speed

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:13.650 
no rush now I'm gonna increase the speed
because<00:03:05.260> it's<00:03:05.410> really<00:03:05.709> coming<00:03:05.950> together

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:33.100 

if<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.440> notice<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:15.730> other<00:03:15.880> thing<00:03:16.180> vibrate

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.020 

now<00:03:34.110> I'll<00:03:34.350> just<00:03:34.590> let<00:03:34.770> it<00:03:34.920> go<00:03:34.950> slow<00:03:35.430> for<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.820> few

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
now I'll just let it go slow for a few

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:48.010 
now I'll just let it go slow for a few
minutes

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.360 

never<00:03:48.650> feel<00:03:48.980> sticky<00:03:49.460> a<00:03:50.860> couple<00:03:51.860> of<00:03:52.250> the

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
never feel sticky a couple of the

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:03.960 
never feel sticky a couple of the
facility

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.850 

see<00:04:07.150> not<00:04:08.150> sticky<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:08.780> it's<00:04:08.900> getting<00:04:09.140> elastic

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
see not sticky and it's getting elastic

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:19.460 
see not sticky and it's getting elastic
it's<00:04:10.520> still<00:04:10.760> breaking<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:11.959> we'll<00:04:12.110> let<00:04:12.230> it<00:04:12.290> run

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.979 

take<00:04:19.860> some<00:04:20.160> time<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.489> it's<00:04:20.940> tough<00:04:21.239> working<00:04:21.510> do

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
take some time and it's tough working do

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.400 
take some time and it's tough working do
this<00:04:22.140> by<00:04:22.350> hand<00:04:22.760> you<00:04:23.760> get<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:23.880> really<00:04:24.480> affected

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
this by hand you get a really affected

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.870 
this by hand you get a really affected
and<00:04:26.090> pound<00:04:27.090> on<00:04:27.390> it<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:27.780> pull<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.670> machine<00:04:29.670> do

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
and pound on it and pull it machine do

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.720 
and pound on it and pull it machine do
it<00:04:30.410> another<00:04:31.410> minute<00:04:31.650> by<00:04:31.890> differences<00:04:32.580> and

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
it another minute by differences and

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:39.070 
it another minute by differences and
done<00:04:34.550> that<00:04:35.550> arm<00:04:35.880> is<00:04:36.120> like<00:04:37.340> pushing<00:04:38.340> pulling

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
done that arm is like pushing pulling

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.360 
done that arm is like pushing pulling
all<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.230> things<00:04:40.500> that<00:04:40.680> you<00:04:40.800> would<00:04:40.950> be<00:04:41.070> doing

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
all the things that you would be doing

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
all the things that you would be doing
with<00:04:41.520> your<00:04:41.670> hand<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:43.020> dough<00:04:43.230> hook<00:04:43.470> is<00:04:43.650> going

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:05:01.260 

let's<00:04:51.390> feel<00:04:51.690> it

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270

so<00:05:01.900> let's<00:05:02.590> say<00:05:02.830> this<00:05:03.160> has<00:05:03.970> been<00:05:04.120> running<00:05:04.480> like

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
so let's say this has been running like

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.380 
so let's say this has been running like
this<00:05:05.070> for<00:05:06.070> about<00:05:06.160> five<00:05:06.580> minutes<00:05:06.910> then<00:05:07.300> I'm

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
and I found that the gun was out today

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.220 
and I found that the gun was out today
it<00:05:56.920> can<00:05:57.130> be<00:05:57.280> made<00:05:57.520> with<00:05:57.550> regular<00:05:58.090> flour<00:05:58.300> but

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
it can be made with regular flour but

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.110 
it can be made with regular flour but
the<00:05:59.440> texture<00:05:59.830> and<00:05:59.950> the<00:06:00.190> color<00:06:00.490> everything<00:06:00.850> is

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.750 
the texture and the color everything is
not<00:06:01.330> the<00:06:01.480> same<00:06:03.060> so<00:06:04.060> that's<00:06:04.510> it<00:06:05.100> this<00:06:06.100> recipe<00:06:06.430> is

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
not the same so that's it this recipe is

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.850 
not the same so that's it this recipe is
done

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
done

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:18.129
