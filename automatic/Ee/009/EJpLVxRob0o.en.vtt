00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
that and originally I wanted to get the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.280 
that and originally I wanted to get the
beat<00:02:27.140> some<00:02:27.530> over<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.400> ear<00:02:28.610> headphones<00:02:29.230> but<00:02:30.230> I

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
beat some over the ear headphones but I

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.620 
beat some over the ear headphones but I
didn't<00:02:30.560> have<00:02:30.650> enough<00:02:30.830> money<00:02:30.860> for<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.520> all<00:02:32.420> I

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
didn't have enough money for that all I

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.510 
didn't have enough money for that all I
had<00:02:32.830> $109<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:36.680> thing<00:02:36.980> right<00:02:37.220> here<00:02:37.250> I

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
had $109 and this thing right here I

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.960 
had $109 and this thing right here I
think<00:02:37.640> it's<00:02:37.940> supposed<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.500> clip<00:02:39.500> on<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:40.160> like

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
think it's supposed to clip on to like

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.210 
think it's supposed to clip on to like
the<00:02:41.300> earbuds<00:02:42.050> here<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.590> then<00:02:42.680> like<00:02:42.860> clip<00:02:43.010> onto

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
the earbuds here and then like clip onto

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.790 
the earbuds here and then like clip onto
your<00:02:43.490> shirt<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.390> that<00:02:44.420> way<00:02:44.720> like<00:02:44.990> you<00:02:45.620> won't

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
your shirt so that way like you won't

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.960 
your shirt so that way like you won't
have<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.100> put<00:02:46.220> in<00:02:46.370> your<00:02:46.490> pocket<00:02:46.610> or<00:02:46.910> something

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
have to put in your pocket or something

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.650 
have to put in your pocket or something
like<00:02:47.270> that<00:02:47.330> um<00:02:48.040> now<00:02:49.330> overall<00:02:50.330> these<00:02:50.540> are

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
like that um now overall these are

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.350 
like that um now overall these are
pretty<00:02:50.810> good<00:02:51.020> I<00:02:51.050> think<00:02:51.200> I'd<00:02:51.590> give<00:02:51.830> them<00:02:52.360> nine

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
pretty good I think I'd give them nine

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.440 
pretty good I think I'd give them nine
out<00:02:53.540> of<00:02:53.570> ten<00:02:53.900> or<00:02:54.550> five<00:02:55.550> hours<00:02:55.820> seven<00:02:56.330> out<00:02:56.420> of

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
out of ten or five hours seven out of

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.120 
out of ten or five hours seven out of
ten<00:02:56.660> around<00:02:57.080> there<00:02:57.290> um<00:02:58.210> now<00:02:59.210> the<00:02:59.270> cons<00:02:59.720> okay<00:03:00.170> I

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
ten around there um now the cons okay I

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.120 
ten around there um now the cons okay I
tested<00:03:02.090> these<00:03:02.270> earbuds<00:03:02.750> or<00:03:03.290> my<00:03:03.560> friend<00:03:03.890> date

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
tested these earbuds or my friend date

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.180 
tested these earbuds or my friend date
on<00:03:04.370> his<00:03:04.850> ipod<00:03:05.380> shuffle<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:06.500> he<00:03:06.650> has<00:03:06.770> a<00:03:07.010> very

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
on his ipod shuffle and he has a very

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.580 
on his ipod shuffle and he has a very
first<00:03:07.550> ipod<00:03:07.820> shuffle<00:03:08.240> in<00:03:08.390> that<00:03:08.540> all<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.320> songs

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
first ipod shuffle in that all the songs

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.550 
first ipod shuffle in that all the songs
were<00:03:10.280> like<00:03:10.490> slow<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.390> didn't<00:03:11.990> play<00:03:12.080> properly

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
were like slow and didn't play properly

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.740 
were like slow and didn't play properly
but<00:03:13.160> that<00:03:13.310> could<00:03:13.580> be<00:03:13.610> because<00:03:13.790> he<00:03:14.600> has<00:03:14.720> a

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
but that could be because he has a

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.620 
but that could be because he has a
different<00:03:15.590> ipod<00:03:15.890> like<00:03:16.100> not<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.280> newer<00:03:16.550> one<00:03:16.820> and

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
i have a new one one um and so that's
