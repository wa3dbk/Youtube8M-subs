00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
above it says is basically talking about

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.780 
above it says is basically talking about
how<00:03:28.170> this<00:03:28.290> guy<00:03:28.470> has<00:03:28.740> wire<00:03:29.070> coil<00:03:29.520> that's

connected<00:03:30.330> to<00:03:30.420> his<00:03:30.540> ear<00:03:30.960> and<00:03:31.080> he's<00:03:31.710> created

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
connected to his ear and he's created

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.980 
connected to his ear and he's created
some<00:03:32.490> kind<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:32.820> internal<00:03:33.240> headphones<00:03:33.780> he's

to<00:03:36.210> music<00:03:36.590> internally<00:03:37.590> which<00:03:37.709> is<00:03:37.830> very

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
to music internally which is very

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.280 
to music internally which is very
strange<00:03:38.250> but<00:03:38.459> this<00:03:38.580> next<00:03:38.910> paragraph<00:03:39.570> says<00:03:39.870> but

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
strange but this next paragraph says but

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.860 
strange but this next paragraph says but
his<00:03:40.470> experiments<00:03:41.190> go<00:03:41.430> far<00:03:41.850> beyond<00:03:42.209> sound<00:03:42.660> it

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
his experiments go far beyond sound it

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.590 
his experiments go far beyond sound it
is<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.110> sixth<00:03:43.560> sense<00:03:44.040> says<00:03:44.340> Lee<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:45.000> implants

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
is a sixth sense says Lee the implants

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.380 
is a sixth sense says Lee the implants
allow<00:03:45.959> me<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.380> detect<00:03:46.860> different<00:03:47.520> sensors<00:03:48.060> so

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
allow me to detect different sensors so

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.870 
allow me to detect different sensors so
I<00:03:48.420> can<00:03:48.690> hear<00:03:49.230> heat<00:03:49.680> from<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:50.070> distance<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.610> can

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
I can hear heat from a distance I can

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.960 
I can hear heat from a distance I can
detect<00:03:51.300> magnetic<00:03:51.690> fields<00:03:52.590> in<00:03:52.680> Wi-Fi<00:03:53.370> signals

into<00:04:25.530> his<00:04:25.680> eyeballs<00:04:26.190> earlier<00:04:26.669> this<00:04:26.850> week<00:04:26.910> this

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
into his eyeballs earlier this week this

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.360 
into his eyeballs earlier this week this
doesn't<00:04:27.630> seem<00:04:27.870> so<00:04:28.080> bad<00:04:28.110> in<00:04:28.440> fact<00:04:28.680> if<00:04:28.980> given<00:04:29.340> the

doesn't seem so bad in fact if given the
choice<00:04:29.640> we<00:04:30.000> definitely<00:04:30.570> do<00:04:30.750> something<00:04:31.200> like

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
choice we definitely do something like

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.110 
choice we definitely do something like
this<00:04:31.470> versus<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.190> whole<00:04:32.370> needle<00:04:32.669> in<00:04:32.910> the

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.150 
and was able to give it a virus to get
into<00:04:59.750> the<00:04:59.840> system<00:05:00.020> he<00:05:00.440> was<00:05:00.590> able<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:00.830> bypass

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
into the system he was able to bypass

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.480 
into the system he was able to bypass
security<00:05:02.530> checkpoints<00:05:03.530> and<00:05:03.710> it<00:05:04.100> just<00:05:04.310> gets

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
security checkpoints and it just gets

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.100 
security checkpoints and it just gets
even<00:05:04.730> more<00:05:04.760> interesting<00:05:05.240> it<00:05:05.540> basically<00:05:05.870> goes

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
even more interesting it basically goes

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.590 
even more interesting it basically goes
on<00:05:06.380> to<00:05:06.500> tell<00:05:06.680> that<00:05:07.160> this<00:05:07.340> chip<00:05:07.760> is<00:05:07.790> like<00:05:08.090> a<00:05:08.120> tiny

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
on to tell that this chip is like a tiny

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.390 
on to tell that this chip is like a tiny
computer<00:05:09.320> and<00:05:09.530> is<00:05:09.680> able<00:05:09.830> to<00:05:10.040> store

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
computer and is able to store

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.880 
computer and is able to store
information<00:05:10.610> at<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.450> sky<00:05:11.720> at<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.290> the<00:05:12.530> user

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
information at the sky at the the user

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.820 
information at the sky at the the user
is<00:05:13.340> seeing<00:05:13.910> or<00:05:14.570> hearing<00:05:14.630> and<00:05:15.470> things<00:05:15.680> like

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
is seeing or hearing and things like

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.880 
is seeing or hearing and things like
that<00:05:15.890> and<00:05:16.370> it's<00:05:16.790> really<00:05:17.240> a<00:05:17.390> powerful<00:05:17.810> thing<00:05:18.620> so

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
that and it's really a powerful thing so

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.250 
that and it's really a powerful thing so
I<00:05:18.920> can<00:05:19.250> definitely<00:05:19.550> see<00:05:20.210> this<00:05:20.450> being<00:05:20.960> the

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
I can definitely see this being the

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.650 
I can definitely see this being the
major<00:05:21.560> idea<00:05:22.340> in<00:05:22.550> black<00:05:22.790> ops<00:05:23.000> 3<00:05:23.120> kind<00:05:23.480> of<00:05:23.570> the

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
major idea in black ops 3 kind of the

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.420 
major idea in black ops 3 kind of the
philosophy<00:05:24.410> of<00:05:24.440> the<00:05:24.560> game<00:05:24.770> and<00:05:25.010> how<00:05:25.100> the<00:05:25.160> game

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
philosophy of the game and how the game

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.830 
philosophy of the game and how the game
is<00:05:25.580> going<00:05:25.610> to<00:05:25.970> work<00:05:26.210> and<00:05:26.420> what<00:05:26.570> we're<00:05:26.660> gonna<00:05:26.780> be

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
is going to work and what we're gonna be

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.780 
is going to work and what we're gonna be
seeing<00:05:27.200> both<00:05:27.590> in<00:05:27.800> multiplayer<00:05:28.430> but

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
seeing both in multiplayer but

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.510 
seeing both in multiplayer but
especially<00:05:29.060> in<00:05:29.600> campaign<00:05:30.380> I<00:05:30.650> can<00:05:31.070> definitely

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
especially in campaign I can definitely

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.760 
especially in campaign I can definitely
sing<00:05:31.730> this<00:05:31.880> see<00:05:32.390> this<00:05:32.540> in<00:05:32.750> the<00:05:33.050> game<00:05:33.350> as<00:05:33.560> the

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
sing this see this in the game as the

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.280 
sing this see this in the game as the
major<00:05:33.950> idea<00:05:34.730> so<00:05:35.030> very<00:05:35.270> interesting<00:05:35.810> stuff<00:05:36.080> I

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
major idea so very interesting stuff I

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.170 
major idea so very interesting stuff I
will<00:05:36.530> link<00:05:36.770> both<00:05:37.190> of<00:05:37.400> the<00:05:37.490> articles<00:05:38.000> that

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
will link both of the articles that

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.910 
will link both of the articles that
treyarch<00:05:38.690> linked<00:05:39.080> down<00:05:39.380> in<00:05:39.680> the<00:05:39.800> description

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:39.920

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.410 
treyarch linked down in the description
below<00:05:40.340> if<00:05:40.550> you<00:05:40.640> guys<00:05:40.670> want<00:05:40.970> to<00:05:41.030> check<00:05:41.060> those

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 
below if you guys want to check those

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.510 
below if you guys want to check those
out<00:05:41.660> I<00:05:42.050> would<00:05:42.260> definitely<00:05:42.410> recommend<00:05:42.710> it<00:05:43.340> on

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
out I would definitely recommend it on

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.120 
out I would definitely recommend it on
the<00:05:44.060> last<00:05:44.300> one<00:05:44.630> was<00:05:45.230> basically<00:05:45.620> it<00:05:45.800> says<00:05:45.920> if

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
the last one was basically it says if

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.200 
the last one was basically it says if
you<00:05:46.220> can't<00:05:46.490> get<00:05:46.610> over<00:05:46.730> the<00:05:46.820> idea<00:05:46.880> of<00:05:47.120> having

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
you can't get over the idea of having

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.000 
you can't get over the idea of having
something<00:05:47.510> injection<00:05:47.960> into<00:05:48.230> your<00:05:48.260> eyeball<00:05:48.740> we

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
something injection into your eyeball we

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.590 
something injection into your eyeball we
suppose<00:05:49.280> this<00:05:49.460> is<00:05:49.490> kind<00:05:49.790> of<00:05:49.880> cool<00:05:50.150> and<00:05:50.420> then

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
suppose this is kind of cool and then

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.660 
suppose this is kind of cool and then
there's<00:05:50.780> a<00:05:50.990> link<00:05:51.410> that<00:05:51.770> goes<00:05:51.830> on<00:05:52.190> to<00:05:52.340> basically

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.670 
there's a link that goes on to basically

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.150 
there's a link that goes on to basically
talk<00:05:53.030> about<00:05:53.380> biohackers<00:05:54.380> on<00:05:54.680> how<00:05:54.980> they<00:05:55.130> can

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
talk about biohackers on how they can

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.730 
talk about biohackers on how they can
inject<00:05:56.090> your<00:05:56.420> eyeballs<00:05:56.930> with<00:05:57.320> night<00:05:57.710> vision

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
inject your eyeballs with night vision

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.160 
inject your eyeballs with night vision
um<00:05:58.370> so<00:05:58.700> this<00:05:58.910> is<00:05:58.940> something<00:05:59.360> I<00:05:59.630> wouldn't<00:05:59.990> be

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
um so this is something I wouldn't be

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.710 
um so this is something I wouldn't be
surprised<00:06:00.680> if<00:06:00.950> we<00:06:01.160> see<00:06:01.490> like<00:06:01.850> directly<00:06:02.540> in

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
surprised if we see like directly in

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.630 
surprised if we see like directly in
black<00:06:03.140> ops<00:06:03.350> 3<00:06:03.530> I<00:06:03.770> don't<00:06:04.040> know<00:06:04.130> if<00:06:04.280> it<00:06:04.400> will<00:06:04.490> make

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
black ops 3 I don't know if it will make

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.060 
black ops 3 I don't know if it will make
its<00:06:04.880> way<00:06:05.030> to<00:06:05.350> multiplayer<00:06:06.350> but<00:06:06.590> I<00:06:06.770> guarantee

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
its way to multiplayer but I guarantee

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.850 
its way to multiplayer but I guarantee
we'll<00:06:07.670> be<00:06:07.820> seeing<00:06:08.120> this<00:06:08.240> in<00:06:08.450> campaign<00:06:09.320> so<00:06:09.650> this

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
we'll be seeing this in campaign so this

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.530 
we'll be seeing this in campaign so this
also<00:06:09.980> kind<00:06:10.310> of<00:06:10.430> goes<00:06:10.550> on<00:06:10.760> to<00:06:10.880> the<00:06:10.970> snapchat
