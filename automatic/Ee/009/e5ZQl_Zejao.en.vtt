environment of artists because most of
the<00:02:35.760> people<00:02:36.450> he<00:02:36.690> paints<00:02:37.080> there<00:02:37.260> are<00:02:37.350> other

the people he paints there are other

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.070 
the people he paints there are other
artists<00:02:38.100> either<00:02:38.280> dancers<00:02:38.940> or<00:02:39.209> writers<00:02:39.780> or

artists either dancers or writers or

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.330 
artists either dancers or writers or
painters<00:02:43.010> I'm<00:02:44.010> amazed<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.630> how<00:02:46.040> time<00:02:47.040> has

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
painters I'm amazed that how time has

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.949 
painters I'm amazed that how time has
made<00:02:47.520> that<00:02:47.760> painting<00:02:48.209> more<00:02:48.390> palatable

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
made that painting more palatable

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.140 
made that painting more palatable
because<00:02:49.530> when<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.040> was<00:02:50.190> new<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.430> was<00:02:50.610> really

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
because when it was new it was really

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.800 
because when it was new it was really
raw

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
raw

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.920 
raw
I<00:02:51.840> mean<00:02:52.650> people<00:02:53.549> liked<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.239> didn't<00:02:54.570> like<00:02:54.720> it

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
I mean people liked it didn't like it

I mean people liked it didn't like it
actions<00:02:55.860> was<00:02:56.130> very<00:02:56.400> violent<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:57.090> think<00:02:57.480> most<00:02:57.690> of

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
actions was very violent I think most of

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000

room<00:03:37.750> of<00:03:38.170> people<00:03:39.599> when<00:03:40.599> I<00:03:40.629> think<00:03:40.959> of<00:03:41.109> the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
room of people when I think of the

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.509 
room of people when I think of the
painting<00:03:42.370> he<00:03:42.489> did<00:03:42.730> in<00:03:43.530> 1964<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:45.069> man<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:45.459> a

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
painting he did in 1964 of a man and a

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.520 
painting he did in 1964 of a man and a
woman<00:03:45.909> and<00:03:46.150> then<00:03:46.269> he<00:03:46.450> repeated<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.109> painting

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
woman and then he repeated the painting

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.250 
woman and then he repeated the painting
30<00:03:47.799> years<00:03:48.099> later<00:03:48.280> and<00:03:48.819> now<00:03:49.810> these<00:03:50.049> two

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
30 years later and now these two

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.140 
30 years later and now these two
paintings<00:03:50.560> are<00:03:50.739> hanging<00:03:51.010> very<00:03:51.340> close<00:03:51.670> without

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
paintings are hanging very close without

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.199 
paintings are hanging very close without
any<00:03:53.129> space<00:03:54.129> in<00:03:54.370> between<00:03:54.720> I<00:03:55.920> think<00:03:56.920> those<00:03:57.069> are

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
any space in between I think those are

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:04.140 
any space in between I think those are
certain<00:03:58.209> highlights<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:03.519> first<00:04:03.760> looking<00:04:04.030> at

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
certain highlights the first looking at

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.390 
certain highlights the first looking at
other<00:04:04.299> stars<00:04:04.689> and<00:04:04.810> his<00:04:04.989> portraits<00:04:05.500> you<00:04:05.620> also

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
know that he left the painting on canvas

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.970 
know that he left the painting on canvas
and<00:04:12.060> transformed<00:04:13.060> it<00:04:13.239> into<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.989> kind<00:04:14.560> of<00:04:14.680> semi

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
and transformed it into a kind of semi

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.210 
and transformed it into a kind of semi
sculpture<00:04:15.790> so<00:04:16.000> he<00:04:16.120> used<00:04:16.389> aluminum<00:04:16.780> he<00:04:17.410> raised

it<00:04:18.549> away<00:04:19.239> from<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.690> wall<00:04:19.959> or<00:04:20.320> he<00:04:20.799> made

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
it away from the wall or he made

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.550 
it away from the wall or he made
freestanding<00:04:21.699> aluminum<00:04:22.389> structures<00:04:22.990> but

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
freestanding aluminum structures but

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.900 
freestanding aluminum structures but
they're<00:04:23.710> still<00:04:23.860> paintings<00:04:24.430> that<00:04:24.639> kind<00:04:24.849> of

they're still paintings that kind of
radical<00:04:25.120> paintings<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:26.020> this<00:04:26.199> was<00:04:26.349> a<00:04:26.380> very

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
radical paintings and this was a very

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.800 
radical paintings and this was a very
important<00:04:26.979> element<00:04:27.039> for<00:04:27.310> us<00:04:27.490> to<00:04:27.760> integrate<00:04:28.660> in

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
important element for us to integrate in

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.480 
important element for us to integrate in
this<00:04:28.930> show

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
this show

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.680 
this show
well<00:04:31.030> they<00:04:31.150> kind<00:04:31.360> of<00:04:31.830> had<00:04:32.830> to<00:04:32.979> do<00:04:33.130> with<00:04:33.690> the

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
well they kind of had to do with the

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.900 
well they kind of had to do with the
people<00:04:35.020> environment<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.039> the<00:04:36.460> idea<00:04:36.789> of

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
people environment and the idea of

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.180 
people environment and the idea of
life-size<00:04:37.419> and<00:04:37.870> there<00:04:38.650> are<00:04:38.800> things<00:04:38.979> of

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
life-size and there are things of

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.309 
life-size and there are things of
arbitrary<00:04:39.729> endings<00:04:40.319> you<00:04:41.319> know<00:04:41.410> once<00:04:42.340> you<00:04:43.319> say

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
arbitrary endings you know once you say

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.800 
arbitrary endings you know once you say
the<00:04:44.710> traditional<00:04:45.160> endings<00:04:46.150> on<00:04:46.330> paintings<00:04:46.720> are

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
the traditional endings on paintings are

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.189 
the traditional endings on paintings are
bust<00:04:47.080> or<00:04:47.770> neck<00:04:48.009> and<00:04:48.940> you<00:04:49.300> say<00:04:49.509> well<00:04:49.840> why<00:04:50.050> does

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
bust or neck and you say well why does

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:51.719 
bust or neck and you say well why does
it<00:04:50.319> have<00:04:50.440> to<00:04:50.500> enter<00:04:50.830> there<00:04:51.009> working<00:04:51.490> it<00:04:51.610> in

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
it have to enter there working it in

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.040 
it have to enter there working it in
this<00:04:51.940> way<00:04:52.180> or<00:04:52.900> that<00:04:52.960> way<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:54.220> so<00:04:54.599> it's<00:04:55.599> a
