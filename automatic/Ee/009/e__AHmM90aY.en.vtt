Shenandoah is a cultivar of the native

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.879 
Shenandoah is a cultivar of the native
switchgrass<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.179> it's<00:00:55.139> very<00:00:55.289> well<00:00:55.409> adapted

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:55.889 
switchgrass so it's very well adapted

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
switchgrass so it's very well adapted
for<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.550> Kansas<00:00:57.210> prairie<00:00:57.449> conditions

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
for the Kansas prairie conditions

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.910 
for the Kansas prairie conditions
another<00:00:59.909> interesting<00:01:00.659> grass<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.769> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
another interesting grass is a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.990 
another interesting grass is a
Miscanthus<00:01:03.019> census<00:01:04.019> strictest<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:05.070> porcupine

Miscanthus census strictest or porcupine

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.160 
Miscanthus census strictest or porcupine
grass<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.830> has<00:01:08.100> variations

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
grass and this has variations

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.320 
grass and this has variations
horizontally<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.530> leaves<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.490> little

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
horizontally on the leaves so little

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.770 
horizontally on the leaves so little
stripes<00:01:12.690> it<00:01:13.380> gets<00:01:13.670> fairly<00:01:14.670> tall<00:01:14.940> you<00:01:15.270> know<00:01:15.300> six

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
stripes it gets fairly tall you know six

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.410 
stripes it gets fairly tall you know six
feet<00:01:16.080> or<00:01:16.230> so<00:01:16.410> once<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.890> blooms<00:01:17.220> even<00:01:18.150> when<00:01:18.270> it's

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
feet or so once it blooms even when it's

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.170 
feet or so once it blooms even when it's
not<00:01:18.540> blooming<00:01:19.050> you<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.560> some<00:01:20.010> interest<00:01:20.820> with

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
not blooming you have some interest with

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.370 
not blooming you have some interest with
the<00:01:21.830> horizontal<00:01:22.830> striped<00:01:23.100> texture<00:01:23.550> and

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
the horizontal striped texture and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.160 
the horizontal striped texture and
another<00:01:25.380> kind<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.770> variation<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:27.170> vertical

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
another kind of variation is vertical

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.910 
another kind of variation is vertical
variation<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.070> another<00:01:29.430> type<00:01:29.760> of<00:01:29.790> Miscanthus

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
variation on another type of Miscanthus

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.130 
variation on another type of Miscanthus
census<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.610> silver<00:01:33.030> field<00:01:33.330> or<00:01:33.600> silver

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
census this is silver field or silver

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.980 
census this is silver field or silver
arrow<00:01:34.410> grass<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.060> has<00:01:36.300> white

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
arrow grass so this has white

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.220 
arrow grass so this has white
variegation<00:01:37.820> vertically<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.210> leaves<00:01:39.450> so

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
variegation vertically on the leaves so

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.560 
variegation vertically on the leaves so
it's<00:01:40.440> adding<00:01:40.650> some<00:01:41.070> nice<00:01:41.250> color<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.000> interest

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
it's adding some nice color and interest

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.790 
it's adding some nice color and interest
even<00:01:42.900> when<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.760> not<00:01:44.760> in<00:01:45.090> bloom<00:01:45.590> this<00:01:46.590> is

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
even when it's not in bloom this is

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.530 
even when it's not in bloom this is
another<00:01:47.190> perennial<00:01:47.580> grass<00:01:47.970> that's<00:01:48.300> called

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
another perennial grass that's called

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.500 
another perennial grass that's called
blue<00:01:48.900> dune<00:01:49.260> lime<00:01:50.010> grass<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.940> it's<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.300> cool

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
blue dune lime grass and it's a cool

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.120 
blue dune lime grass and it's a cool
season<00:01:51.720> grass<00:01:52.050> so<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.440> actually<00:01:52.620> started

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
season grass so it actually started

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.300 
season grass so it actually started
blooming<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:54.210> June<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.900> it's<00:01:55.050> been<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:56.070> kind

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
blooming in June and it's been it's kind

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.980 
blooming in June and it's been it's kind
of<00:01:56.400> past<00:01:56.610> its<00:01:56.850> prime<00:01:57.090> at<00:01:57.330> this<00:01:57.450> point<00:01:57.720> in<00:01:57.870> terms

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
of past its prime at this point in terms

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.960 
of past its prime at this point in terms
of<00:01:58.230> seed<00:01:58.470> heads<00:01:58.710> but<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.400> still<00:01:59.640> has<00:01:59.790> this

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
of seed heads but it still has this

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.280 
of seed heads but it still has this
spiky<00:02:00.570> blue<00:02:01.470> foliage<00:02:02.659> but<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.720> word<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.050> caution

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
spiky blue foliage but a word of caution

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.520 
spiky blue foliage but a word of caution
with<00:02:04.620> this<00:02:04.800> grass<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.909> spreads<00:02:06.420> very<00:02:06.840> fast

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
with this grass it spreads very fast

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.360 
with this grass it spreads very fast
with<00:02:08.310> rhizomes<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.929> plot<00:02:10.200> here<00:02:10.709> was

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
with rhizomes so this plot here was

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.720 
with rhizomes so this plot here was
planted<00:02:11.880> with<00:02:12.210> five<00:02:12.930> little<00:02:13.140> plants<00:02:13.730> three
