now let's move up to E minor seven to do

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.410 
now let's move up to E minor seven to do
the<00:00:50.850> same<00:00:51.090> thing

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:05.189 

right<00:00:55.420> this<00:00:55.570> hour<00:00:55.810> with

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.730 

mr.<00:01:06.070> g7

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.100 

here's<00:01:11.740> a<00:01:11.890> minor<00:01:12.160> sampling<00:01:12.610> to<00:01:12.670> get<00:01:12.790> a<00:01:12.820> lawyer

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.720 

now<00:01:18.680> of<00:01:18.770> course<00:01:18.830> you<00:01:19.070> can<00:01:19.190> do<00:01:19.280> it<00:01:19.400> with<00:01:19.520> Black

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
now of course you can do it with Black

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.710 
now of course you can do it with Black
Keys<00:01:19.970> as<00:01:20.210> well<00:01:20.260> let's<00:01:21.260> take<00:01:21.440> C<00:01:21.680> minor<00:01:21.920> 7

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.420 

and<00:01:26.290> it's<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:26.560> little<00:01:26.740> harder<00:01:27.100> because<00:01:27.190> you

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
and it's a little harder because you

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.100 
and it's a little harder because you
have<00:01:27.550> black<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.330> white<00:01:28.480> keys<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:29.020> your

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
have black and white keys and your

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.710 
have black and white keys and your
fingers<00:01:29.380> have<00:01:29.500> different<00:01:29.890> things<00:01:30.720> same

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
fingers have different things same

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.700 
fingers have different things same
principle<00:01:32.380> there's<00:01:33.330> a<00:01:34.330> flat<00:01:34.990> minor<00:01:35.260> seventh

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
principle there's a flat minor seventh

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.970 
principle there's a flat minor seventh
all<00:01:35.830> black<00:01:36.070> keys

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:58.780 

you<00:01:40.490> can<00:01:40.610> use<00:01:40.760> these<00:01:40.940> as<00:01:41.180> Phil's<00:01:42.790> example

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.060 

now<00:01:59.420> I<00:01:59.450> don't<00:01:59.720> mean<00:01:59.930> to<00:01:59.990> use<00:02:00.230> that<00:02:00.410> exclusively

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
now I don't mean to use that exclusively

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.650 
now I don't mean to use that exclusively
but<00:02:01.370> if<00:02:01.520> you're<00:02:01.670> looking<00:02:01.970> for<00:02:02.180> an<00:02:02.300> interesting

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
but if you're looking for an interesting

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.900 
but if you're looking for an interesting
fill<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.770> fill<00:02:03.800> up<00:02:04.160> let's<00:02:04.520> say<00:02:04.640> you're<00:02:04.760> playing

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
fill to fill up let's say you're playing

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:28.630 
fill to fill up let's say you're playing
a<00:02:05.090> song<00:02:05.300> like<00:02:05.480> this

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.650 

yeah<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:29.840> used<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.800> as<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.010> fill<00:02:31.400> not<00:02:31.700> as<00:02:32.210> part<00:02:32.570> of

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
yeah I used it as a fill not as part of

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.330 
yeah I used it as a fill not as part of
the<00:02:32.720> song<00:02:32.990> particularly<00:02:33.500> although<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:34.010> can

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
the song particularly although you can

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.560 
the song particularly although you can
do<00:02:34.520> that<00:02:34.670> once<00:02:34.850> in<00:02:34.940> a<00:02:35.060> while<00:02:35.180> what<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:37.450> can<00:02:38.450> do

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
do that once in a while what I can do

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:46.860

with

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.140 

probably<00:02:47.709> probably<00:02:48.129> tired<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:48.819> that<00:02:49.030> would

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
probably probably tired that that would

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.850 
probably probably tired that that would
be<00:02:49.269> overusing<00:02:50.019> them<00:02:50.110> but<00:02:50.319> that's<00:02:50.470> what<00:02:50.709> it's

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
be overusing them but that's what it's

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.920 
be overusing them but that's what it's
called<00:02:51.010> it's<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.430> four<00:02:51.670> note<00:02:51.879> straddle<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.690> once

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
called it's a four note straddle so once

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:17.970 
called it's a four note straddle so once
again<00:02:53.080> watch<00:02:53.890> as<00:02:54.040> I<00:02:54.159> play<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.489> slowly

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980
