00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 ladies can not talk so much 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.919
 sloping 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.450
 as well as start with the ball 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:18.529

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:20.430

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:25.410
 more tension 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.830
 You're so tense about your muscles 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.090
 more targeted are yes again at the beginning 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.460

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.410
 what if they are the ones from us 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:42.420
 You really face that, we want that 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:48.420

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:51.239
 right left is likely in the 5 6 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.390
 7 and 8 is a difficult one 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.300
 So topography is simply people 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:09.210
 provide yet set 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:10.229
 standard dances the claim to the rear 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.610
 the back thoma forward 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.590
 I'm a bit shocked by that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.909
 fitness condition because I'm right behind 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.170
 have seen proto heads and already have 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.960
 oh my god thought the tilt now 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.130
 here right out of your room out yes there have 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.130
 I really have a lot to do with that 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:46.080
 goes on commenting I do not want to 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:49.800
 something even south often that you are women 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.550
 no men yes and if you do something like that 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.010
 I do not care 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:59.030
 not something to me yes I want it 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.030
 soft is music now comes the movie 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.800
 ok, a group has now and 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.840
 Youth time starts now as you should 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:46.130
 Crew on the stage do not shine as 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:47.330
 solo right, I expect the girls 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.880
 they do not dance like me they do that 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.050
 internalize the next two and 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.420
 make it your own product 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:01.660
 It's time for the group to maria 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.130
 the rehearsed choreo show hello 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.450
 Ladies I hope you are ready us 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.070
 Let the girls perform and perform first 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.360
 in the end, we decide who to do 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.360
 then he starts 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.790
 the broadcast has a power and 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.800
 not expected amina was 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.030
 to move appealingly 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:41.010
 me it has not on it 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.930
 Unfortunately I did not realize that 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.400
 I'm never so mobile anymore 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.400
 I have already noticed that in front of us 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:53.030
 in the next group lie between 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.030
 becoming candidates for the candidates 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:12.180
 christin is still so right 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:14.159
 So not right now 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.079
 found how she wants to move 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.680
 I think I have the perhaps 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.680
 lost apple 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.630
 juventus 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:33.259
 at least now gnaw on each of the 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.680
 Participants doubt 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.340
 clearly there is much work here yet 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.659
 could 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.340
 I never thought so many 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.599
 people can move so well 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:47.560
 that surprised me so well 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:47.560
 so much hello hello 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.619
 today 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.619
 but who was that fearless? 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.229
 Hello 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.290
 The larissa is very much for me 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.450
 special case because I think the 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.760
 brings a lot of potential 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.070
 but it's just not a stop at all 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:43.050
 what do the jurors say in the body? 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:45.000
 to the last dance group to sabrina so 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.660
 You can not sue sabrina dancing 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.660
 this is fine 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.510
 I thought it was so cool together 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.030
 To stand by it is everyone 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.990
 case more casual and casual than when you 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.330
 alone stands 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:12.750
 because he thinks yes I still have 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:19.730
 a little bit seriously I think 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:19.730
 pauli netz does not work at all
