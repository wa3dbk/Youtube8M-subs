00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
the each handling works and how you can

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.619 
the each handling works and how you can
find<00:02:46.430> more<00:02:46.639> channels<00:02:47.000> through<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.239> air<00:02:47.389> by

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
find more channels through the air by

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.289 
find more channels through the air by
plugging<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.439> into<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.739> TV<00:02:49.090> setting<00:02:50.090> up<00:02:50.180> the

antenna with each television is quite

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.170 
antenna with each television is quite
simple<00:02:51.949> especially<00:02:52.189> if<00:02:52.549> you<00:02:52.639> have<00:02:52.730> an<00:02:52.849> HD

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180

we<00:02:58.939> just<00:02:59.000> have<00:02:59.239> they<00:02:59.329> plugged<00:02:59.629> in<00:02:59.750> a<00:02:59.810> TV<00:03:00.109> TV<00:03:00.469> and

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
we just have they plugged in a TV TV and

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.619 
we just have they plugged in a TV TV and
that's<00:03:00.859> a<00:03:00.919> sample<00:03:01.430> of<00:03:01.489> how<00:03:01.669> the<00:03:01.730> video<00:03:02.329> and

you<00:03:04.760> can<00:03:04.879> see<00:03:05.000> it's<00:03:05.120> relatively<00:03:05.419> sharp<00:03:05.689> and

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
you can see it's relatively sharp and

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.809 
you can see it's relatively sharp and
impressive<00:03:06.590> as<00:03:06.739> long<00:03:07.219> as<00:03:07.280> you're<00:03:07.370> locked<00:03:07.639> into
