almost faceted very similar to like but

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.210 
almost faceted very similar to like but
you<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.689> see<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.960> diamond<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.920> got<00:01:38.100> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
is your micro USB charging port here

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.880 
is your micro USB charging port here
which<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.190> nice<00:02:26.400> by<00:02:26.850> having<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.530> cover<00:02:28.530> here

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
which is nice by having this cover here

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.670 
which is nice by having this cover here
to<00:02:29.130> cover<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.790> back<00:02:30.090> charging<00:02:30.660> button<00:02:31.380> I<00:02:31.470> mean

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
to cover the back charging button I mean

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.920 
to cover the back charging button I mean
charging<00:02:32.130> port<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.550> for<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.390> fact<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.720> this

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
charging port is for the fact that this

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.460 
charging port is for the fact that this
is<00:02:34.170> IP<00:02:34.910> x5<00:02:35.910> which<00:02:36.360> means<00:02:36.630> it's<00:02:36.840> dust<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.290> water

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
is IP x5 which means it's dust and water

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.250 
is IP x5 which means it's dust and water
resistant<00:02:38.010> up<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.190> 1<00:02:39.180> meter<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.600> water<00:02:39.960> for<00:02:40.230> up

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
resistant up to 1 meter of water for up

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.210 
resistant up to 1 meter of water for up
to<00:02:40.350> 30<00:02:40.470> minutes<00:02:41.010> or<00:02:41.360> 3.3<00:02:42.360> feet<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:43.260> let's<00:02:43.620> go

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
to 30 minutes or 3.3 feet so let's go

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.470 
to 30 minutes or 3.3 feet so let's go
ahead<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.520> give<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.760> test<00:02:44.940> run<00:02:45.090> here

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
ahead and give it a test run here

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.750 
ahead and give it a test run here
there's<00:02:46.170> just<00:02:46.200> one<00:02:46.500> single<00:02:46.950> speaker<00:02:47.160> here<00:02:47.550> and

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
there's just one single speaker here and

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.600 
there's just one single speaker here and
it<00:02:48.090> sounds<00:02:48.360> amazingly<00:02:48.930> great<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.500> let's<00:02:50.400> go

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
it sounds amazingly great so let's go

00:02:50.610 --> 00:03:11.400 
it sounds amazingly great so let's go
ahead<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.970> pair<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.360> i<00:02:51.540> use<00:02:51.750> my<00:02:51.959> galaxy<00:02:52.860> note<00:02:52.890> 2

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:22.540 

ok<00:03:12.400> let's<00:03:12.700> try<00:03:12.850> it<00:03:12.970> again

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.130 

from<00:03:23.550> ok<00:03:23.820> made<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.090> little<00:03:24.270> few<00:03:24.450> sculptures<00:03:24.960> but

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
from ok made a little few sculptures but

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.020 
from ok made a little few sculptures but
I<00:03:25.410> tried<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.100> pair<00:03:26.280> dolly<00:03:26.460> and<00:03:26.580> I<00:03:26.670> guess<00:03:26.880> I

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
I tried to pair dolly and I guess I

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.330 
I tried to pair dolly and I guess I
stopped<00:03:27.300> in<00:03:27.510> between<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:28.080> just<00:03:28.980> going<00:03:29.250> into

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
stopped in between so just going into

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.600 
stopped in between so just going into
the<00:03:29.400> test<00:03:29.730> run<00:03:29.940> here<00:03:30.240> I'll<00:03:30.990> just<00:03:31.230> play<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.650> new

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
the test run here I'll just play the new

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.210 
the test run here I'll just play the new
Michael<00:03:32.910> Jackson<00:03:33.300> here<00:03:36.830> alright<00:03:37.830> that<00:03:38.070> sounds

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
Michael Jackson here alright that sounds

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:53.120 
Michael Jackson here alright that sounds
more<00:03:38.520> like<00:03:38.580> it<00:03:41.690> cut<00:03:42.690> up<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.930> little<00:03:43.020> bit<00:03:51.800> and<00:03:52.800> the

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
more like it cut up a little bit and the

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.040 
more like it cut up a little bit and the
good<00:03:53.310> thing<00:03:53.459> about<00:03:53.489> is<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.540> sound<00:03:54.840> is

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
good thing about is that the sound is

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.810 
good thing about is that the sound is
directional<00:03:55.470> some<00:03:55.980> people<00:03:56.250> might<00:03:56.400> not<00:03:56.430> like

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
directional some people might not like

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.580 
directional some people might not like
it<00:03:57.000> for<00:03:57.120> example<00:03:57.600> if<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:57.750> turned<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.050> this<00:03:58.170> way<00:03:58.380> a

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
it for example if I turned it this way a

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.880 
it for example if I turned it this way a
little<00:03:58.680> bit<00:03:59.520> louder<00:04:00.170> that<00:04:01.170> was<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.440> little<00:04:01.620> bit

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
little bit louder that was a little bit

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.470 
little bit louder that was a little bit
softer<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:03.440> all-in-all<00:04:04.440> I<00:04:05.130> like<00:04:05.970> it<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.270> works

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
softer so all-in-all I like it it works

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.500 
softer so all-in-all I like it it works
great<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:07.340> use<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.459> myself<00:04:08.640> a<00:04:08.940> lot<00:04:09.150> when<00:04:09.300> I'm<00:04:09.390> on

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
great I use it myself a lot when I'm on

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.970 
great I use it myself a lot when I'm on
side<00:04:09.750> watching<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.230> car<00:04:10.440> or<00:04:10.590> watching<00:04:10.920> the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
side watching the car or watching the

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.440 
side watching the car or watching the
trunk<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.370> just<00:04:11.610> set<00:04:11.790> it<00:04:11.910> out<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.209> I<00:04:12.239> don't<00:04:12.300> have

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
trunk I just set it out and I don't have

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.940 
trunk I just set it out and I don't have
to<00:04:12.540> worry<00:04:12.690> about<00:04:12.810> it<00:04:13.140> being<00:04:13.500> light<00:04:13.739> enough<00:04:13.920> to

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
to worry about it being light enough to

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.490 
to worry about it being light enough to
get<00:04:14.130> knocked<00:04:14.160> over<00:04:14.520> if<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:14.970> does<00:04:15.180> rain<00:04:15.510> or<00:04:15.870> die

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
get knocked over if it does rain or die

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.199 
get knocked over if it does rain or die
accidentally<00:04:16.980> over<00:04:17.280> spray<00:04:17.549> it<00:04:17.700> and<00:04:17.820> shoot

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
accidentally over spray it and shoot

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.819 
accidentally over spray it and shoot
with<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.419> water<00:04:18.600> I<00:04:18.959> went<00:04:19.410> out<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.590> worry<00:04:19.739> about

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
with the water I went out to worry about

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.980 
with the water I went out to worry about
killing<00:04:20.459> it<00:04:20.609> so<00:04:21.450> like<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:22.140> says<00:04:22.410> I<00:04:22.620> pee<00:04:22.680> x5<00:04:23.990> with

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
killing it so like I says I pee x5 with

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.890 
killing it so like I says I pee x5 with
the<00:04:25.220> dust<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.400> water<00:04:26.550> resistance<00:04:27.030> built-in

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
the dust and water resistance built-in

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.719 
the dust and water resistance built-in
