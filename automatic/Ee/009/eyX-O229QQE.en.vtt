go ahead and get started open up Xcode

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.550 
go ahead and get started open up Xcode
and<00:00:16.789> make<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.060> view<00:00:18.359> based<00:00:18.570> application<00:00:19.320> for

and make it a view based application for

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:33.670 
and make it a view based application for
iOS<00:00:21.380> i'm<00:00:22.380> going<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.710> call<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.980> tap<00:00:23.670> counter

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.170 

alright<00:00:34.680> let's<00:00:35.250> go<00:00:35.399> ahead<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.550> get<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:35.910> and

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
alright let's go ahead and get to it and

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.020 
alright let's go ahead and get to it and
the<00:00:36.989> dot<00:00:37.170> h<00:00:37.380> go<00:00:37.920> ahead<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.190> state<00:00:38.780> or<00:00:41.030> actually

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the dot h go ahead and state or actually

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.500 
the dot h go ahead and state or actually
need<00:00:42.149> anything<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:43.520> variable<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:44.760> accounting

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
need anything a variable for accounting

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.420 
need anything a variable for accounting
so<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.980> gets<00:00:47.760> stored<00:00:48.149> somewhere<00:00:49.280> so<00:00:50.280> every

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
so this gets stored somewhere so every

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.939 
so this gets stored somewhere so every
time<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:50.700> do<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.180> has<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.829> variable<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
time we do this it has it variable to

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.630 
time we do this it has it variable to
add<00:00:53.070> onto<00:00:53.250> or<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.539> subtract<00:00:54.930> from<00:00:55.370> ok<00:00:56.370> so

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
add onto or to subtract from ok so

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.970 
add onto or to subtract from ok so
integer<00:00:57.420> count<00:00:58.489> semicolon<00:00:59.489> here<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.480> go<00:01:00.980> that

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
integer count semicolon here we go that

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.310 
integer count semicolon here we go that
means<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.120> variable<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.899> we

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
means that we have a variable that we

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.940 
means that we have a variable that we
can<00:01:04.439> add<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.680> subtract<00:01:05.010> from<00:01:05.250> double<00:01:05.970> etc

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
can add and subtract from double etc

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.210 
can add and subtract from double etc

5 since you if you were to of added on

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.699 
5 since you if you were to of added on
to<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.709> earlier<00:02:56.090> this<00:02:57.090> will<00:02:57.360> add<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.840> one<00:02:58.500> to

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
to it earlier this will add and one to

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.920 
to it earlier this will add and one to
it<00:02:58.860> so<00:02:59.190> let's<00:02:59.340> say<00:02:59.810> account<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:01.170> five<00:03:02.930> then

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
it so let's say account is five then

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.350 
it so let's say account is five then
this<00:03:04.650> count<00:03:05.280> +<00:03:05.489> +<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:06.000> basically<00:03:07.640> 5+1<00:03:08.640> it's

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
this count + + is basically 5+1 it's

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.430 
this count + + is basically 5+1 it's
just<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.720> quicker<00:03:10.140> way<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.440> writing<00:03:10.709> at<00:03:12.140> for<00:03:13.140> it

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
just a quicker way of writing at for it

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.090 
just a quicker way of writing at for it
count<00:03:13.709> plus<00:03:14.220> one<00:03:14.780> ok<00:03:15.780> now<00:03:16.590> we're<00:03:16.650> going<00:03:17.010> to

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
count plus one ok now we're going to

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.960 
count plus one ok now we're going to
type<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.970> number<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.450> texts<00:03:19.670> so<00:03:20.670> we<00:03:20.850> are

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
type the number of texts so we are

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.449 
type the number of texts so we are
referring<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:21.890> so<00:03:22.890> we<00:03:23.040> have<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.190> way<00:03:23.370> of

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
referring to this so we have a way of

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.150 
referring to this so we have a way of
displaying<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:24.060> number<00:03:24.330> not<00:03:24.480> just<00:03:25.100> giving<00:03:26.100> it

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
displaying the number not just giving it

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.699 
displaying the number not just giving it
hidden<00:03:26.370> in<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:26.700> current<00:03:27.000> number<00:03:27.600> text<00:03:28.290> equals

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
hidden in the current number text equals

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.340 
hidden in the current number text equals

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
one reset count equals zero that way we

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.030 
one reset count equals zero that way we
are<00:04:10.410> making<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.430> actual<00:04:12.290> variable<00:04:13.290> count<00:04:13.680> and

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
are making the actual variable count and

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.750 
are making the actual variable count and
we're<00:04:14.730> setting<00:04:15.060> it<00:04:15.120> there<00:04:15.420> 20<00:04:16.459> double<00:04:17.459> will

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
we're setting it there 20 double will

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.409 
we're setting it there 20 double will
just<00:04:17.910> be<00:04:18.090> count<00:04:18.690> times<00:04:19.620> too<00:04:19.919> so<00:04:20.100> count<00:04:21.060> equals

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
just be count times too so count equals

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.200 
just be count times too so count equals
count<00:04:21.720> x<00:04:22.169> 2<00:04:22.440> for<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.039> multiplication<00:04:24.000> sign

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
count x 2 for the multiplication sign

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.810 
count x 2 for the multiplication sign
you<00:04:24.330> will<00:04:24.419> use<00:04:24.570> an<00:04:24.720> asterisk<00:04:24.900> for<00:04:25.820> opposite

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
you will use an asterisk for opposite

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.290 
you will use an asterisk for opposite
you<00:04:26.940> will<00:04:27.060> do

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
you will do

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.050 
you will do
count<00:04:27.479> equals<00:04:27.870> count<00:04:28.280> plus<00:04:29.280> or<00:04:29.699> minus<00:04:32.060> count

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
count equals count plus or minus count

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.890 
count equals count plus or minus count
times<00:04:33.780> too<00:04:34.259> so<00:04:36.050> that's<00:04:37.050> pretty<00:04:37.319> simple<00:04:38.900> so

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
times too so that's pretty simple so

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.830 
times too so that's pretty simple so
let's<00:04:40.139> say<00:04:40.259> count<00:04:40.500> Espada<00:04:40.830> that<00:04:41.039> would<00:04:41.129> be<00:04:41.220> a

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.540 

5-10<00:04:45.840> which<00:04:46.560> would<00:04:46.770> give<00:04:46.919> you<00:04:47.009> negative<00:04:47.159> five

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
5-10 which would give you negative five

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.040 
5-10 which would give you negative five
see<00:04:48.539> it's<00:04:48.690> ten<00:04:50.360> 10-20<00:04:51.360> which<00:04:51.629> would<00:04:51.840> be

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
see it's ten 10-20 which would be

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.730 
see it's ten 10-20 which would be
negative<00:04:52.289> 10<00:04:53.300> there<00:04:54.300> we<00:04:54.449> go<00:04:54.599> that<00:04:55.289> is<00:04:55.319> all<00:04:55.620> the
