00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:07.530
 hello youtube people how are you waiting 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.599
 well I present my third tutorial 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.639
 this is to help people 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:17.200
 that can not be downloaded and installed 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:19.900
 free taurus like I did 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.340
 because I saw a couple of tutorials but I 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.340
 they were a little 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:29.050
 chabÃ¡n then I discovered a way to 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.240
 do what he gave to explain it so that 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.010
 others can do it 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.440
 this is your program I guess what 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.170
 they know everything is here because they know 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.769
 of him 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.769
 you can create everything almost every company 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.560
 but this is the original page where 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.170
 can buy but we are going to 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.300
 take it out on you 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.199
 I 'm going to leave the download link in 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:59.890
 the information box see visits yz 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.629
 brush 46 bull plus age mega english el 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.100
 only living effect program is that what 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.530
 We will download in English and clearly 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.360
 you can not pass Spanish 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.540
 but bolt once it starts to 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.450
 handle it turns out easier we go up 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.430
 the threshold of the page here explains 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.710
 more or less how to download it to me is it 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.750
 he got confused so good 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.530
 in this part that says see link from 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.950
 voltages tensions now shows me 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.950
 as you see 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.939
 for a few seconds with an advertisement 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.159
 they allow 15 seconds to pass and they 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.859
 show the 4 download link 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.950
 I first of all download them 4 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.600
 because I did not know how was the subject I thought 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.840
 I needed the 42 I realized that 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.210
 There are four different options 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.420
 with the first you can serve 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.390
 people which serves more downloads is going to 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.820
 download a weird file 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.100
 it's not true here about I have the four 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.530
 part one lost entirely of four 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.650
 parts 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.690
 has the entire program 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.789
 they give him run they always try to give him 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.010
 as administrator 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:17.890
 to everything to avoid mistakes 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.890
 they will be opened to decompress 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.500
 First of all where they give him a ball 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.340
 two 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.690
 press here 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.010
 download 7 brush where when you 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.260
 open up for this one mind in 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.300
 intention to show when he opens the 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.660
 crack a little window where they have to 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.660
 put 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.870
 to decompress 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.800
 what you put in the congo and start 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.690
 extract once it is extracted it goes 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.770
 to start installing the program just you 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.590
 obviously they put him next 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.069
 next except next 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:28.480
 then they go to crack 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:31.269
 and van aken win-win exc 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.659
 is going to ask me for the code then a little 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.659
 to rock 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.470
 0 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.470
 and I put him to accept 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.490
 to compress and well I will open 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.760
 here is just what you s 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.200
 in the x that was to endow to vote 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.710
 to be able to transform 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.600
 recoder 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:03.020
 once you already have 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.020
 it's not true here they go and they open the program 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:11.940
 this picture will appear here as 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.940
 come 7 bruce you eat the whole screen 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.860
 so you can see the applications 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.860
 broad 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.260
 press the key 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.230
 there was the one I wanted 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.139
 let's go one that we have 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.460
 great doubt 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:39.090
 we select second button copy no 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:42.720
 let's minimize the good we can 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.669
 close petition enter activation code and 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.020
 now we are going to look like this little window 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.949
 that you did it cost me a lot 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.540
 understand why I do not know a lot of English 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:55.250
 then we stop them here on top of this 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.250
 window with the second button 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.529
 second 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:08.209
 not with controls like that with control sticks 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:11.779
 that's how I said good control of my 

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:15.750
 short and paste all the code that we have 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:17.940
 copied just there we can enter 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:22.490
 and let's see how it is starting to 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:27.969
 activate the free license so it is 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:30.639
 free good as you go 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:33.099
 accommodating me with this allows you to be 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.880
 very very very good I will go climbing 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:37.310
 tutorials to show 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.950
 more or less how to handle it in Spanish 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:43.700
 from the beginning I will show the 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:45.020
 doubts that I had and I have to calculate 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.000
 that are everyone's but already those 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.980
 they know how they already take it for granted that 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.370
 we will not have the ones that are all 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:55.370
 silly because they are not silly doubts because 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.660
 A small doubt can be worked for 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.960
 everything you want to start 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.910
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.830
 are understood by above all let me 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.750
 a comment 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.659
 I have another couple of other programs for 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.819
 to download 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:14.629
 I highly recommend that you visit candela 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:18.110
 but they are also program downloads 

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:20.150
 very good free some can 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.939
 have the broken links so if they have 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:25.520
 the introducer tell me and we see how 

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:27.680
 we solved and how we got it down 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.659
 I hope you guys liked it in a 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.659
