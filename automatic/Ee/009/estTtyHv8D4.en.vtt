approximately thirteen fourteen fifteen
hundred<00:00:15.240> pounds<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:15.719> never<00:00:16.260> weighed<00:00:16.470> him

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
hundred pounds I never weighed him

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.290 
hundred pounds I never weighed him
lately<00:00:17.490> but<00:00:17.869> he'll<00:00:18.869> be<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.320> region<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.430> a

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
lately but he'll be in that region and a

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.410 
lately but he'll be in that region and a
two<00:00:21.510> years<00:00:21.720> old<00:00:21.960> that's<00:00:22.140> relatively<00:00:23.420> good

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
two years old that's relatively good

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.070 
two years old that's relatively good
size<00:00:24.689> for<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.050> bottle<00:00:25.500> baby<00:00:25.710> but<00:00:26.869> he<00:00:27.869> will

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
size for a bottle baby but he will

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.490 
size for a bottle baby but he will
eventually<00:00:29.150> his<00:00:30.150> dad<00:00:30.420> actually<00:00:30.750> weighs<00:00:31.140> about

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
eventually his dad actually weighs about

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.520 
eventually his dad actually weighs about
2200<00:00:32.430> or<00:00:32.520> 2400<00:00:33.329> pounds<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.930> region<00:00:34.200> so

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
2200 or 2400 pounds in that region so

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.510 
2200 or 2400 pounds in that region so
when<00:00:35.370> he<00:00:35.489> grows<00:00:35.700> up<00:00:35.760> PT<00:00:36.360> lb<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.860> would

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
when he grows up PT lb I would

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.810 
when he grows up PT lb I would
guesstimate<00:00:39.090> around<00:00:39.770> 2022<00:00:40.770> 2,200<00:00:41.670> pounds

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
guesstimate around 2022 2,200 pounds

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.060 
guesstimate around 2022 2,200 pounds
they<00:00:42.690> grow<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.200> quite<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> number<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.800> years

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
they grow for quite a number of years

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.860 
they grow for quite a number of years
actually<00:00:44.460> some<00:00:44.969> people<00:00:45.120> say<00:00:45.510> they<00:00:45.690> grow<00:00:45.840> up

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
actually some people say they grow up

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.209 
actually some people say they grow up
till<00:00:46.200> 10<00:00:46.590> years<00:00:47.039> yeah<00:00:47.640> Bailey<00:00:47.969> was<00:00:49.160> when<00:00:50.160> I

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
till 10 years yeah Bailey was when I

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.029 
till 10 years yeah Bailey was when I

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
started Bailey out doing this he was

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.830 
started Bailey out doing this he was
quite<00:00:53.100> acceptable<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> idea<00:00:54.360> jumping

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
quite acceptable to the idea jumping

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.680 
quite acceptable to the idea jumping
into<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> car<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:57.059> know<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.210> put

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
little oats bucket up there so he had

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.100 
little oats bucket up there so he had
some<00:01:00.149> incentive<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.629> come<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.039> then

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
some incentive to come in then

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.600 
some incentive to come in then

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
and and after that fine was not a word

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.200 
and and after that fine was not a word
that<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:12.960> defined<00:01:13.400> what<00:01:14.400> happened<00:01:14.909> after

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
that really defined what happened after

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.490 
that really defined what happened after
that<00:01:15.390> but<00:01:15.799> he<00:01:16.799> got<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> little<00:01:17.159> excited<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.909> I

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
that but he got a little excited and I

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.060 
that but he got a little excited and I
of<00:01:19.500> course<00:01:19.860> got<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.310> little<00:01:20.520> excited<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:22.070> we

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
of course got a little excited and we we

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.570 
of course got a little excited and we we
settled<00:01:23.460> down<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.750> within<00:01:25.170> Oh<00:01:25.860> an<00:01:26.220> hour<00:01:26.400> I

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
settled down and and within Oh an hour I

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.130 
settled down and and within Oh an hour I
guess<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.119> had<00:01:27.299> him<00:01:27.450> where<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.600> could<00:01:27.720> travel<00:01:27.930> up

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
guess I had him where I could travel up

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.710

and<00:01:28.229> down<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> road<00:01:28.770> with<00:01:28.979> him<00:01:29.479> he<00:01:30.479> learns

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
and down the road with him he learns

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.840 
and down the road with him he learns
quite<00:01:30.990> fast<00:01:31.259> actually<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.670> having

enough<00:01:33.240> nerve<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.720> do<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:38.119> well<00:01:39.290> lots<00:01:40.290> of

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
enough nerve to do it well lots of

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.120 
enough nerve to do it well lots of

was something I want to try for number

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.510 
was something I want to try for number
years<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.600> course<00:01:51.810> when<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> had<00:01:52.350> Bailey<00:01:52.649> as
