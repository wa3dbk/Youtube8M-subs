00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
upgrade my defense one will do energy

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.730 
upgrade my defense one will do energy
one<00:05:19.310> and<00:05:19.580> we<00:05:19.850> will<00:05:20.030> do<00:05:20.180> attack<00:05:20.660> one<00:05:20.990> I'm<00:05:21.320> out<00:05:21.620> of

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
points there you go you can head out of

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.800 
points there you go you can head out of
there<00:05:24.260> I<00:05:24.790> got<00:05:25.790> some<00:05:25.910> experience<00:05:26.390> I<00:05:26.450> also<00:05:26.600> got

Valor Valor is very impressive I won
that<00:05:29.690> battle<00:05:29.930> I<00:05:30.170> could<00:05:30.320> attack<00:05:30.590> again<00:05:30.860> or<00:05:30.980> raid

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
that battle I could attack again or raid

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.500 
that battle I could attack again or raid
there's<00:05:31.790> a<00:05:31.820> little<00:05:32.000> bit<00:05:32.090> of<00:05:32.180> a<00:05:32.240> difference

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
there's a little bit of a difference

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.120 
there's a little bit of a difference
between<00:05:32.570> attacking<00:05:33.230> and<00:05:33.350> raiding<00:05:33.680> let's<00:05:33.950> see

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
between attacking and raiding let's see

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.520 
between attacking and raiding let's see
let's<00:05:34.340> raid<00:05:34.580> traveling<00:05:35.570> to<00:05:35.720> rival<00:05:36.050> base<00:05:36.260> and

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
let's raid traveling to rival base and

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.220 
let's raid traveling to rival base and
when<00:05:36.620> you<00:05:36.710> go<00:05:36.830> to<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:37.040> base<00:05:37.420> you<00:05:38.420> can<00:05:38.600> actually

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
when you go to the base you can actually

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.730 
when you go to the base you can actually
tap<00:05:39.950> on<00:05:40.250> different<00:05:41.170> buildings<00:05:42.170> so<00:05:42.410> if<00:05:42.500> I<00:05:42.590> want

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
tap on different buildings so if I want

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.830 
tap on different buildings so if I want
to<00:05:42.800> tap<00:05:43.040> on<00:05:43.250> there<00:05:43.490> I<00:05:43.700> can<00:05:43.730> blow<00:05:44.150> it<00:05:44.300> up<00:05:44.450> you<00:05:44.720> can

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
to tap on there I can blow it up you can

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.350 
to tap on there I can blow it up you can
take<00:05:45.320> it<00:05:45.440> apart<00:05:45.530> piece<00:05:45.920> by<00:05:45.980> piece<00:05:46.190> I<00:05:46.700> won<00:05:47.060> and

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
take it apart piece by piece I won and

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.800 
take it apart piece by piece I won and
so<00:05:47.410> on<00:05:48.410> so<00:05:48.740> I<00:05:48.980> can<00:05:49.490> grab<00:05:49.670> my<00:05:49.700> valor<00:05:50.150> for<00:05:50.540> doing

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
so on so I can grab my valor for doing

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.300 
so on so I can grab my valor for doing
that<00:05:50.990> and<00:05:51.290> that's<00:05:51.350> what<00:05:51.620> you<00:05:51.740> do<00:05:51.890> to<00:05:52.040> tear<00:05:52.220> up

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
that and that's what you do to tear up

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.550 
that and that's what you do to tear up
your<00:05:52.340> end<00:05:52.760> of<00:05:53.210> your<00:05:53.330> rivals<00:05:53.960> basis<00:05:54.380> and<00:05:54.530> that

to<00:06:19.910> build<00:06:20.060> or<00:06:20.270> upgrade<00:06:20.600> takes<00:06:20.840> time<00:06:21.140> to<00:06:21.350> expand

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
to build or upgrade takes time to expand

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.370 
to build or upgrade takes time to expand
takes<00:06:22.070> an<00:06:22.280> hour<00:06:22.580> or<00:06:22.910> more<00:06:23.210> to<00:06:23.510> expand<00:06:24.080> a<00:06:24.110> little

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.170 
takes an hour or more to expand a little
section<00:06:24.740> so<00:06:24.800> that's<00:06:25.520> it<00:06:25.760> you'll<00:06:25.910> need<00:06:26.090> to

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
section so that's it you'll need to

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.750 
section so that's it you'll need to
expand<00:06:26.480> to<00:06:26.630> build<00:06:26.840> more<00:06:27.050> and<00:06:27.350> so

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
expand to build more and so

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.600 
expand to build more and so
