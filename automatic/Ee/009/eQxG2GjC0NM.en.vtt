so<00:00:08.820> flip<00:00:09.030> it<00:00:09.150> over<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.360> start<00:00:09.809> removing<00:00:09.960> all

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
so flip it over and start removing all

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.230 
so flip it over and start removing all
the<00:00:10.620> screws<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.190> case<00:00:11.400> oh<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:12.059> here's<00:00:12.179> a

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
the screws to the case oh and here's a

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.490 
the screws to the case oh and here's a
little<00:00:12.420> tip<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.900> can<00:00:13.019> have<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.139> bunch<00:00:13.349> of

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
little tip you can have a bunch of

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.560 
little tip you can have a bunch of
screws<00:00:13.769> left<00:00:14.009> over<00:00:14.280> so<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.519> just<00:00:14.790> use<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> magnet

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
screws left over so I just use a magnet

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.000 
screws left over so I just use a magnet
to<00:00:15.719> scoop<00:00:15.990> them<00:00:16.109> all<00:00:16.260> up<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.650> hold<00:00:16.800> them<00:00:16.920> in

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
to scoop them all up and hold them in

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.410 
to scoop them all up and hold them in
place<00:00:17.039> now<00:00:17.640> once<00:00:17.820> you've<00:00:17.970> got<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.240> open

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
place now once you've got that open

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.670 
place now once you've got that open
you're<00:00:18.930> going<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.109> look<00:00:19.199> for<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.410> small

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
you're going to look for the small

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.830 
you're going to look for the small
circuit<00:00:20.100> board<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.520> remove<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.150> two<00:00:21.359> screws

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
circuit board and remove the two screws

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.779 
circuit board and remove the two screws
so<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.439> access<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.949> other<00:00:23.130> side<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.670> it

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
so we can access the other side of it

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.670 
so we can access the other side of it
we're<00:00:24.359> going<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.510> be<00:00:24.570> using<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> LED<00:00:25.470> that

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
we're going to be using the LED that

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.920 
we're going to be using the LED that
goes<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> scroll<00:00:26.640> lock<00:00:26.970> key<00:00:27.029> because

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
goes to the scroll lock key because

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.109 
goes to the scroll lock key because
that's<00:00:28.320> pretty<00:00:28.560> much<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.920> useless<00:00:29.250> key<00:00:29.640> now<00:00:29.910> if

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
that's pretty much a useless key now if

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.519 
that's pretty much a useless key now if
you<00:00:30.240> don't<00:00:30.330> have<00:00:30.570> one<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.929> could<00:00:31.080> also<00:00:31.199> use

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
you don't have one you could also use

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.889 
you don't have one you could also use
your<00:00:31.890> number<00:00:32.219> we're<00:00:33.090> going<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.300> desolder<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
your number we're going to desolder the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.020 
your number we're going to desolder the
LED<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.710> goes<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.190> scroll<00:00:35.460> lock<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
LED that goes to the scroll lock and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.569 
LED that goes to the scroll lock and
remove<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.660> LED<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.380> hang<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.280> put<00:00:38.489> it

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
remove the LED and hang on to it put it

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.740 
remove the LED and hang on to it put it
in<00:00:38.670> your<00:00:38.790> parts<00:00:38.969> bin<00:00:39.210> because<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.690> a

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
in your parts bin because it's a

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.080 
in your parts bin because it's a
perfectly<00:00:40.170> good<00:00:40.290> LED<00:00:41.010> now<00:00:41.670> you're<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:42.030> to
