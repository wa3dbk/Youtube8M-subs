00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.550
 or a very good all those who 

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:06.620
 they had made a purchase in magic 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:10.610
 trick and you have acquired the game in 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.070
 completely free promotion of the game 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.429
 of the cards of the devil you have 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.710
 found that one of the letters or 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.970
 better said two of the letters should 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.920
 have led to a vacancy and 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.080
 it turns out that not good was an error by 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.849
 part of me because I had forgotten the 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.220
 method of making such letters 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.279
 but that was just a small 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.530
 helps the elimination or possibility of 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.450
 elimination of some movements with 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.890
 which who has doubts about how 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.780
 execute them if they do not have land part 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.600
 here I am now to explain them 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.910
 to explain you sorry 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.519
 the method of realization that is very 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.129
 simple for those who have not 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:52.489
 made a purchase and want to acquire 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.039
 said game at zero price can do it 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.100
 and include that game that follows in 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.320
 Promotion in magic trick point is good 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.909
 they have received four cards with one side 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.060
 white three of them are with 366 or 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.799
 with a 6 each per letter evidently or 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.990
 well of spades or well of hearts and the 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.750
 another is with a back or red or blue 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.630
 it's an influence it's worth explaining the story 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.550
 that you explain and since he called you 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.429
 letters of something because the 36 are us 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.380
 they present the devil because the game 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.450
 are executed as follows must 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.819
 show only three cards at four 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.039
 that you have placed just go to 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:33.679
 need to make an optical account 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.509
 well when they are white well when not 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.490
 they are so that you proceed that 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.409
 game preparation explain your 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.869
 story and put the letters 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.479
 in this way 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.000
 face cards versus two or letter 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.360
 Turn around 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.250
 so that the three 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.140
 no back appears on the top 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.820
 so you draw your letters 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.290
 Case says write some letters 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.300
 white or explain what you want 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.600
 convenient and the samples in mind 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.979
 optics attached by the side 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.840
 short interior with the thumb and the short 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.509
 top with the middle finger and the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.590
 samples and accounts one and be in the 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.790
 superior two and external superior and three and 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.709
 leave it high 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.620
 here two letters but your audience should not 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.220
 view to avoid possible you see 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.440
 the letters but if you open according to how 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.140
 you do this because man will be worth 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.930
 then to the new entity of the cards 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.930
 obviously always arches a little 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.390
 and so it is already resolved in agreement 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.849
 always arching the cards deposited 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.440
 only high you explain that they were now 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.780
 the devil appears for what you believe 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.760
 convenient and extra is the superior for 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.129
 a 2 oy suite appears 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.409
 a back and that means that something is going to 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.819
 happen good what is going to happen then that 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.980
 let's convert everything they were 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.650
 white letters in printed letters 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.739
 back samples and accounts a samples 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.739
 250 the two samples 250 3 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.760
 and you've shown three face cards and 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.319
 back initially completely white and 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.160
 subsequently completely printed 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.430
 to rerun the game 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.920
 if I remember correctly to see if it comes out is 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.770
 deposit the letter fingers or down if you 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.170
 you go the letter fingers or up goes back to 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.800
 appear the carte blanche evidently 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.950
 we have covered the 6th you turn around and 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.160
 you execute the same movement as before 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.820
 this way there is no problem 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:44.000
 in doing it without anti-skidding like this 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.960
 easy to agree you do not need smaller 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.780
 practice for movement 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.350
 minimum very minimum thank you very much and up 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.350
 next video
