okay hello and welcome to my Joule thief
circuit<00:00:03.149> which<00:00:03.840> I<00:00:04.020> intentionally<00:00:04.650> spelled

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
circuit which I intentionally spelled

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.190 
circuit which I intentionally spelled
wrong<00:00:05.250> so<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.330> could<00:00:06.569> stand<00:00:06.870> out<00:00:07.020> on<00:00:07.170> the

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
wrong so I could stand out on the

okay<00:00:08.429> here<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:08.849> this<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.240> circuit

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
okay here it is this is a circuit

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.669 
okay here it is this is a circuit
well-known<00:00:10.530> circuit<00:00:11.090> it<00:00:12.090> uses<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.480> coil<00:00:12.809> which

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
well-known circuit it uses a coil which

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.820 
well-known circuit it uses a coil which
has<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.960> current<00:00:15.960> flowing<00:00:16.199> into<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.619> core

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
has the current flowing into the core

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.529 
has the current flowing into the core
going<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.340> opposite<00:00:17.699> directions<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.420> we'll

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
going in opposite directions and we'll

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.560 
going in opposite directions and we'll
talk<00:00:18.720> about<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.410> bit<00:00:19.770> just<00:00:20.390> to<00:00:21.390> see

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
talk about that in a bit just to see

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.460 
talk about that in a bit just to see
what<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.960> does

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
what it does

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.250 
what it does
Joule<00:00:22.890> thief<00:00:23.070> circuit<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.939> we<00:00:23.970> can<00:00:24.210> use<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> 1.5

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
Joule thief circuit so we can use a 1.5

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.769 
Joule thief circuit so we can use a 1.5
volt<00:00:25.529> battery<00:00:25.949> here<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.250> we<00:00:27.150> can<00:00:27.330> use<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.720> to

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
volt battery here and we can use that to

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.679 
volt battery here and we can use that to
light<00:00:28.199> an<00:00:28.470> array<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.830> LEDs<00:00:29.099> now<00:00:30.090> each<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.449> these

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
light an array of LEDs now each of these

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.659 
light an array of LEDs now each of these
LEDs<00:00:31.019> has<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.500> switch<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.920> voltage<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.430> three

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
LEDs has to switch on voltage of three

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.729 
LEDs has to switch on voltage of three
bulbs<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.390> if<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.719> were<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.200> put<00:00:34.440> an<00:00:34.590> LED

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
bulbs so if you were to put an LED

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.250 
bulbs so if you were to put an LED
across<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.610> battery<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.719> wouldn't<00:00:37.079> light

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
across this battery it wouldn't light

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.680 
across this battery it wouldn't light
but<00:00:37.950> when<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.160> use<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.700> circuit<00:00:39.239> you

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
but when you use it in this circuit you

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.319 
but when you use it in this circuit you
will<00:00:39.809> see<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.640> sorry<00:00:41.640> about<00:00:41.820> if<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.030> haven't

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
will see that sorry about if you haven't

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.959 
will see that sorry about if you haven't
actually<00:00:42.660> got<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> battery<00:00:43.860> holder<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.489> can't

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
actually got a battery holder so I can't

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.040 
actually got a battery holder so I can't
have<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:46.100> so<00:00:47.570> we'll<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:48.719> there<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
have this on so we'll get there in the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.689 
have this on so we'll get there in the
end<00:00:49.730> there<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> am<00:00:51.620> come<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.739> you're<00:00:53.250> got<00:00:53.460> Boyd

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
end there I am come on you're got Boyd

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.090 
end there I am come on you're got Boyd
right<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.539> they'll<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:54.750> up<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.469> all<00:00:55.739> lit<00:00:55.949> and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
right so they'll be up it's all lit and

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.549 
right so they'll be up it's all lit and
if<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.340> look<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> scope<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.510> see<00:00:57.750> it

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
if you look on the scope we can see it

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.510 
if you look on the scope we can see it
rapidly<00:00:59.100> switching<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.660> off<00:01:00.920> if<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.219> look

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
rapidly switching on and off if you look

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.890 
rapidly switching on and off if you look
on<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.910> scope<00:01:04.880> never<00:01:05.880> work<00:01:06.210> without<00:01:06.720> a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
on the scope never work without a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.679 
on the scope never work without a
battery<00:01:07.140> over<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> pool<00:01:08.330> yeah<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.570> look

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
battery over the pool yeah if you look

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.350 
battery over the pool yeah if you look
on<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> scope<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.619> see<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.360> circuit

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
on the scope you can see the circuit

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.690 
on the scope you can see the circuit
switching<00:01:13.080> rapidly<00:01:13.590> on/off<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.430> if<00:01:14.549> you

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
switching rapidly on/off and if you

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.490 
switching rapidly on/off and if you
listen<00:01:14.880> very<00:01:15.060> closely<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.320> hear<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.890> tone

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
listen very closely you can hear a tone

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.249 
listen very closely you can hear a tone
and<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.710> tone<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.729> core<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:24.140> sort<00:01:25.140> of

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
and that tone is the core of the sort of

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.490 
and that tone is the core of the sort of
transformer<00:01:26.040> thing<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.880> core

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
transformer thing here it's a core

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.460 
transformer thing here it's a core
vibrating<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.939> sympathy<00:01:29.939> with<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.570> rise<00:01:31.229> and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
vibrating in sympathy with the rise and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.140 
vibrating in sympathy with the rise and
fall<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.979> magnetic<00:01:32.280> field<00:01:33.439> okay<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.970> this

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
fall of a magnetic field okay so in this

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.999 
fall of a magnetic field okay so in this
led<00:01:36.630> their<00:01:36.900> only<00:01:37.439> array<00:01:37.950> we've<00:01:38.220> got<00:01:38.400> 60<00:01:38.939> LEDs<00:01:39.420> I

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
led their only array we've got 60 LEDs I

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.100 
led their only array we've got 60 LEDs I
actually<00:01:41.009> got<00:01:41.369> bored<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.880> doing<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:43.049> I

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
actually got bored of doing it but I

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.719 
actually got bored of doing it but I
would<00:01:43.530> imagine<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:44.009> could<00:01:44.159> go<00:01:44.280> even<00:01:44.549> further

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
would imagine you could go even further

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.039 
would imagine you could go even further
you'd<00:01:45.180> need<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.799> insanely<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.720> was<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> low

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
you'd need a insanely I was a low

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.960 
you'd need a insanely I was a low
boredom<00:01:49.470> threshold<00:01:49.619> comment<00:01:50.369> which<00:01:50.490> one<00:01:50.700> I

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
boredom threshold comment which one I

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.050 
boredom threshold comment which one I
don't<00:01:51.390> matter<00:01:51.540> than<00:01:51.689> right<00:01:51.840> because<00:01:52.909> so<00:01:53.909> here

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
don't matter than right because so here

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.800 
don't matter than right because so here
we<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.479> circuit<00:01:55.579> we<00:01:56.579> got<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> 1.5<00:01:57.299> volt

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
we have the circuit we got a 1.5 volt

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.889 
we have the circuit we got a 1.5 volt
battery<00:01:58.170> here<00:01:58.409> we've<00:01:59.130> got<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.369> 220<00:02:00.329> on<00:02:00.450> variable

battery here we've got a 220 on variable
resistor<00:02:01.409> now<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.890> won't<00:02:02.670> make<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:02.969> quick<00:02:03.329> so

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
resistor now I won't make this quick so

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.080 
resistor now I won't make this quick so
I'm<00:02:04.079> not<00:02:04.200> going<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.469> demonstrate<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:05.939> if

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
I'm not going to demonstrate this but if

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.880 
I'm not going to demonstrate this but if
you<00:02:06.240> change<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.750> value<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.259> resistor<00:02:07.799> at

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.320 
small the change in current is usually
relatively<00:04:30.050> large<00:04:30.440> so<00:04:30.860> we<00:04:30.890> can<00:04:31.130> get<00:04:31.280> a<00:04:31.550> nice

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
relatively large so we can get a nice

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.720 
relatively large so we can get a nice
big<00:04:32.660> voltage<00:04:33.110> spike<00:04:33.410> there<00:04:33.740> and<00:04:34.520> that's

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
big voltage spike there and that's

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.460 
big voltage spike there and that's
basically<00:04:35.240> how<00:04:35.360> it<00:04:35.630> works<00:04:35.840> that's<00:04:36.080> how<00:04:36.230> you're

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
basically how it works that's how you're

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.880 
basically how it works that's how you're
able<00:04:36.620> to<00:04:36.830> light<00:04:37.100> so<00:04:37.370> many<00:04:37.520> LEDs<00:04:38.030> from<00:04:38.390> a<00:04:38.890> 1.5

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
able to light so many LEDs from a 1.5

able to light so many LEDs from a 1.5
volt<00:04:40.130> battery<00:04:40.580> I'll<00:04:41.480> just<00:04:41.720> do<00:04:41.840> this<00:04:41.930> one<00:04:42.020> bit

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560
