00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
the kindling the primary kindling anyway

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.000 
the kindling the primary kindling anyway
you<00:01:09.600> know<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.869> thin<00:01:10.049> stuff<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.590> need<00:01:10.799> to

and you're pretty much ready to go and
this<00:01:21.090> definitely<00:01:22.049> applies<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.680> situations

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
this definitely applies in situations

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.340 
this definitely applies in situations
where<00:01:23.400> you're<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.759> into<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> forest<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:25.229> if

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
where you're going into a forest like if

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.539 
where you're going into a forest like if
it's<00:01:25.470> an<00:01:25.530> old-growth<00:01:25.830> forest<00:01:26.369> or<00:01:26.490> something

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
it's an old-growth forest or something

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.120 
it's an old-growth forest or something
like<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.240> lot<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.869> times<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> edges<00:01:28.920> on

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
like that a lot of times on the edges on

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.069 
like that a lot of times on the edges on
the<00:01:29.579> way<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.479> what's<00:01:30.689> called<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:31.049> a

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
the way in you have what's called like a

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.140 
the way in you have what's called like a
transition<00:01:31.680> zone<00:01:31.890> where<00:01:32.820> you'll<00:01:32.970> have

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
transition zone where you'll have

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.600 
transition zone where you'll have
smaller<00:01:33.600> trees<00:01:34.049> like<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.619> with<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> lot<00:01:35.579> of

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
smaller trees like this with a lot of

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.219 
smaller trees like this with a lot of
the<00:01:35.790> small<00:01:36.030> pencil<00:01:36.299> add<00:01:36.540> stuff<00:01:36.780> but<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:37.049> once

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
the small pencil add stuff but then once

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.160 
the small pencil add stuff but then once
you<00:01:37.380> get<00:01:37.590> into<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.549> established<00:01:39.060> forest<00:01:39.570> you

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
you get into the established forest you

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.649 
you get into the established forest you
don't<00:01:40.350> find<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.770> as<00:01:40.979> much<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:42.119> that's

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
don't find that as much and so that's

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.630 
don't find that as much and so that's
why<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.869> technique<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.530> kind<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.549> know

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
why this technique is kind of a you know

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.190 
why this technique is kind of a you know
a<00:01:44.670> good<00:01:44.909> technique<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> do<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.750> grab<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.110> as

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
a good technique to do just grab it as

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.510 
a good technique to do just grab it as
you're<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.350> along<00:01:46.590> stick<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.369> your<00:01:47.460> pocket

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
you're going along stick in your pocket

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.010 
you're going along stick in your pocket
and<00:01:47.970> then<00:01:48.119> you'll<00:01:48.240> be<00:01:48.329> good<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.509> go<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.869> you

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and then you'll be good to go and you

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.440 
and then you'll be good to go and you
build<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.649> fire<00:01:49.829> later<00:01:50.070> on<00:01:50.250> same<00:01:51.119> thing<00:01:51.149> goes

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
build the fire later on same thing goes

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.420 
build the fire later on same thing goes
with<00:01:51.659> tinder<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.649> know<00:01:52.770> if<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:52.979> see<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> good

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
with tinder you know if you see a good

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.209 
with tinder you know if you see a good
