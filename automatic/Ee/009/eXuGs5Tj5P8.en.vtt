00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:46.179 
about me you don't see because I think

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:51.189 
about me you don't see because I think
historically<00:05:48.939> the<00:05:49.939> church<00:05:50.269> has<00:05:50.569> used<00:05:50.990> the

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
historically the church has used the

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.139 
historically the church has used the
Bible<00:05:51.769> and<00:05:52.419> as<00:05:53.419> I<00:05:53.689> said<00:05:53.749> a<00:05:53.930> lap<00:05:54.229> a<00:05:54.529> lamppost<00:05:55.189> for

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:56.149 
Bible and as I said a lap a lamppost for

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:58.779 
Bible and as I said a lap a lamppost for
someone<00:05:56.539> to<00:05:57.289> support<00:05:57.559> their<00:05:58.009> position<00:05:58.039> not

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
someone to support their position not

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.779 
someone to support their position not
really<00:05:59.119> to<00:05:59.300> illuminate<00:05:59.899> what's<00:06:00.199> really<00:06:00.499> bad

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
really to illuminate what's really bad

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.270 
really to illuminate what's really bad
and<00:06:01.789> so<00:06:02.329> because<00:06:02.629> we<00:06:03.079> don't<00:06:03.289> illuminate

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
and so because we don't illuminate

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.690 
and so because we don't illuminate
there<00:06:04.580> we<00:06:04.820> don't<00:06:05.060> see<00:06:05.780> that<00:06:06.080> the<00:06:06.290> crux<00:06:06.650> of<00:06:07.010> the

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
there we don't see that the crux of the

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.240 
there we don't see that the crux of the
Christian<00:06:08.090> faith<00:06:08.120> anyway<00:06:08.810> is<00:06:09.320> based<00:06:09.770> on<00:06:09.980> love

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
Christian faith anyway is based on love

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.600 
Christian faith anyway is based on love
and<00:06:10.490> acceptance<00:06:11.330> and<00:06:11.600> inclusion<00:06:12.110> and<00:06:12.800> so

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
and acceptance and inclusion and so

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.900 
and acceptance and inclusion and so
that's<00:06:14.030> the<00:06:14.240> problem<00:06:14.480> the<00:06:14.780> church<00:06:15.050> had<00:06:15.910> so

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
that's the problem the church had so

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.340 
that's the problem the church had so
would<00:06:17.120> you<00:06:17.270> say<00:06:17.300> that<00:06:18.040> various<00:06:19.040> cultures<00:06:20.350> up

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
would you say that various cultures up

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.980 
would you say that various cultures up
until<00:06:21.830> today<00:06:22.419> have<00:06:23.419> used<00:06:23.750> the<00:06:24.080> Bible<00:06:25.990> boys

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
until today have used the Bible boys

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.320 
until today have used the Bible boys
weapons<00:06:27.800> as<00:06:28.150> opposed<00:06:29.150> to<00:06:31.330> supportive

weapons as opposed to supportive

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.840 
weapons as opposed to supportive
instruments<00:06:33.139> but<00:06:34.010> you<00:06:34.130> have<00:06:34.250> to<00:06:34.490> remember

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850 
instruments but you have to remember

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:21.129 
able to take the literal interpretation

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:23.519

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 
position that they have and it really

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:28.649 
position that they have and it really
gets<00:07:26.379> to<00:07:26.589> the<00:07:26.710> power<00:07:27.129> dynamics<00:07:27.759> of<00:07:27.879> society<00:07:28.449> in

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:28.659 
gets to the power dynamics of society in

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:30.209 
gets to the power dynamics of society in
general<00:07:28.689> and<00:07:29.349> that's<00:07:29.589> why<00:07:29.710> I<00:07:29.770> talked<00:07:30.009> about

00:07:30.209 --> 00:07:30.219 
general and that's why I talked about

00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:32.639 
general and that's why I talked about
patriarchy<00:07:30.939> it<00:07:31.509> gets<00:07:31.779> to<00:07:31.960> the<00:07:32.050> place<00:07:32.289> the

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:32.649 
patriarchy it gets to the place the

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:34.980 
patriarchy it gets to the place the
point<00:07:32.949> that<00:07:33.129> people<00:07:33.909> who<00:07:34.059> are<00:07:34.180> in<00:07:34.419> control<00:07:34.839> of

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:34.990 
point that people who are in control of

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.010 
point that people who are in control of
a<00:07:35.680> situation<00:07:36.119> don't<00:07:37.119> want<00:07:37.419> to<00:07:37.479> give<00:07:37.629> up<00:07:37.659> that

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.020 
a situation don't want to give up that

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.989 
a situation don't want to give up that
control<00:07:38.499> and<00:07:38.740> don't<00:07:39.189> want<00:07:39.369> any<00:07:39.520> cougar<00:07:39.789> other

00:07:39.999 --> 00:07:42.209 
control and don't want any cougar other
people<00:07:40.509> because<00:07:40.990> then<00:07:41.379> they<00:07:41.529> have<00:07:41.680> to<00:07:41.710> let<00:07:42.009> go

00:07:42.209 --> 00:07:42.219 
people because then they have to let go
