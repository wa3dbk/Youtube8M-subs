00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
alright so right now I'm putting the

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.610 
alright so right now I'm putting the
siding<00:00:03.560> into<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.710> van<00:00:05.810> I've<00:00:06.810> got<00:00:07.109> these<00:00:07.350> two

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
siding into the van I've got these two

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.120 
siding into the van I've got these two
pieces<00:00:07.890> up<00:00:08.280> so<00:00:08.610> far<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:10.710> have<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.010> do

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
pieces up so far and I have to do

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.950 
pieces up so far and I have to do
separate<00:00:11.550> pieces<00:00:11.759> on<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.210> top<00:00:12.450> because<00:00:12.840> of

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
separate pieces on the top because of

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.730 
separate pieces on the top because of
these<00:00:13.080> things<00:00:13.440> right<00:00:13.710> here<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:14.389> think<00:00:15.389> their

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
these things right here I think their

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.779 
these things right here I think their
seatbelt<00:00:16.740> mounts<00:00:18.500> or<00:00:19.500> hook<00:00:19.830> mounts<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.490> see<00:00:20.760> a

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
seatbelt mounts or hook mounts I see a

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.009 
seatbelt mounts or hook mounts I see a
hook<00:00:21.029> mounted<00:00:21.510> right<00:00:21.689> here<00:00:22.699> but<00:00:23.990> it<00:00:24.990> looks

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
hook mounted right here but it looks

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.900 
hook mounted right here but it looks
like<00:00:25.320> they<00:00:25.560> come<00:00:25.800> out<00:00:25.949> just<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.490> about<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
like they come out just to about the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.209 
like they come out just to about the
same<00:00:27.119> point<00:00:27.510> as<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.810> edge<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> wood<00:00:29.420> so<00:00:30.420> I

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
same point as the edge of the wood so I

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.790 
same point as the edge of the wood so I
should<00:00:32.219> be<00:00:32.250> able<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.700> what<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> plywood<00:00:33.800> just

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
should be able to what the plywood just

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.920 
should be able to what the plywood just
go<00:00:34.950> across<00:00:35.190> here<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:38.660> putting<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.780> piece<00:00:40.110> in

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
go across here and putting this piece in

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:50.540 
go across here and putting this piece in
right<00:00:42.930> here<00:00:43.579> and<00:00:46.820> what<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:47.850> do<00:00:47.969> here<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.550> first

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
right here and what I do here is I first

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.130 
right here and what I do here is I first
drill<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> hole<00:00:51.590> with<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.800> drill<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:54.140> this

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
drill a hole with this drill and this

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.599 
drill a hole with this drill and this
drill<00:00:55.440> bit<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.100> little<00:00:56.399> bit<00:00:58.250> is<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
drill bit is just a little bit is the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.020 
drill bit is just a little bit is the
same<00:00:59.850> size<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> inside<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:03.500> this<00:01:04.500> screw

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
same size as the inside of this screw

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.630 
same size as the inside of this screw
and<00:01:07.610> once<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.760> drill<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> hole<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:10.400> screw<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.430> in

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and once I drill the hole I screw it in

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.580 
and once I drill the hole I screw it in
with<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.830> drill<00:01:13.830> right<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.320> use

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
with this drill right here and I use

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.789 
with this drill right here and I use
that<00:01:16.619> cutter<00:01:17.549> tool<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.270> cut<00:01:18.900> these<00:01:19.140> strips<00:01:19.650> to

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
that cutter tool to cut these strips to

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.210 
that cutter tool to cut these strips to
the<00:01:19.890> side<00:01:20.159> sighs<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:22.310> also<00:01:23.310> use<00:01:23.810> wd-40<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.220> I

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
the side sighs I also use wd-40 and I

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.440 
the side sighs I also use wd-40 and I
use<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:28.640> make<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.820> easier<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.270> cut

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
use that to make it easier to cut

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.330 
use that to make it easier to cut
through<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.840> metal<00:01:31.229> right<00:01:31.710> here<00:01:33.979> I'm<00:01:34.979> still

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
through this metal right here I'm still

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.890 
through this metal right here I'm still
figuring<00:01:35.520> out<00:01:35.700> what<00:01:35.880> i'm<00:01:36.000> going<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
figuring out what i'm going to do on the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.130 
figuring out what i'm going to do on the
bottom<00:01:37.259> because<00:01:37.409> there's<00:01:37.890> no<00:01:39.140> perpendicular

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
bottom because there's no perpendicular

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.219 
bottom because there's no perpendicular
surface<00:01:40.619> except<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.700> back<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.509> mount<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.840> I

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
surface except in the back to mount to I

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.160 
surface except in the back to mount to I
might<00:01:44.040> end<00:01:44.220> up<00:01:44.310> putting<00:01:44.369> something<00:01:44.880> down<00:01:48.170> put

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
might end up putting something down put

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.240 
might end up putting something down put
vertical<00:01:50.119> posts<00:01:51.119> down<00:01:51.600> like<00:01:51.960> here<00:01:52.320> here<00:01:52.799> here

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
vertical posts down like here here here

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.509 
vertical posts down like here here here
and<00:01:53.479> then<00:01:54.979> secure<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.210> pilot<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.329> way
