got<00:01:38.229> a<00:01:38.289> loaded<00:01:38.590> float<00:01:39.039> one<00:01:39.759> of<00:01:39.849> the<00:01:39.910> John<00:01:40.119> body

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
got a loaded float one of the John body

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.389 
got a loaded float one of the John body
models<00:01:40.720> with<00:01:40.869> it<00:01:40.989> with<00:01:41.170> a<00:01:41.200> flight<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:42.220> that's

models with it with a flight and that's
slide<00:01:42.670> in<00:01:42.849> between<00:01:43.149> float<00:01:43.569> stops<00:01:43.869> this<00:01:44.470> allows

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
slide in between float stops this allows

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.320 
slide in between float stops this allows
me<00:01:45.009> to<00:01:45.039> search<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.520> layers<00:01:45.819> should<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.149> fish

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330

want<00:01:46.509> to<00:01:46.660> drop<00:01:46.840> down<00:01:47.050> if<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.709> wind<00:01:47.920> picks<00:01:48.009> up

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
want to drop down if the wind picks up

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.040 
want to drop down if the wind picks up
generally<00:01:48.910> the<00:01:49.060> fish'll<00:01:49.390> drop<00:01:49.629> in<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.840> layers

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
generally the fish'll drop in the layers

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.990 
generally the fish'll drop in the layers
a<00:01:50.200> little<00:01:50.229> bit<00:01:50.440> that's<00:01:51.129> when<00:01:51.280> I<00:01:51.399> put<00:01:51.610> this<00:01:51.729> rig

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
a little bit that's when I put this rig

rig down pick this rod up and I'm

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.040 
rig down pick this rod up and I'm
straight<00:01:54.640> back<00:01:54.879> in<00:01:55.090> fishing<00:01:55.479> anything<00:01:55.810> up<00:01:55.929> to

straight back in fishing anything up to
sort<00:01:56.229> of<00:01:56.289> six<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.649> eight<00:01:56.769> foot<00:01:57.009> with<00:01:57.190> this<00:01:57.310> rod

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:57.519 
sort of six to eight foot with this rod

00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:00.540 
sort of six to eight foot with this rod
I've<00:01:58.479> caught<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.780> few<00:01:58.989> on<00:01:59.140> this<00:01:59.229> already<00:01:59.560> and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
I've caught a few on this already and

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.729 
I've caught a few on this already and
regular<00:02:01.420> feeding<00:02:01.840> has<00:02:01.959> meant<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:02.379> they've

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:02.739 
regular feeding has meant that they've

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:04.350 
regular feeding has meant that they've
come<00:02:03.009> really<00:02:03.399> high<00:02:03.550> up<00:02:03.729> in<00:02:03.849> the<00:02:03.940> water<00:02:04.090> now

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
come really high up in the water now

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.089 
come really high up in the water now
obviously<00:02:05.170> it's<00:02:05.289> the<00:02:05.319> first<00:02:05.590> bit<00:02:05.800> of<00:02:05.890> blue<00:02:06.069> sky

00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:06.099 
obviously it's the first bit of blue sky

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:08.729 
obviously it's the first bit of blue sky
we've<00:02:06.550> seen<00:02:06.789> for<00:02:07.179> about<00:02:07.929> a<00:02:08.019> year<00:02:08.379> it<00:02:08.500> feels

and<00:03:10.830> I<00:03:10.980> found<00:03:11.280> over<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.090> course<00:03:12.330> of<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
and I found over the course of the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.670 
and I found over the course of the
session<00:03:12.840> it's<00:03:13.680> best<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.950> drop<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.280> float<00:03:14.519> in

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
session it's best to drop you float in

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:29.090 
session it's best to drop you float in
feed<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:18.030> then<00:03:18.630> cast<00:03:18.930> out<00:03:19.170> into<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.709> feed

easily<00:03:39.460> and<00:03:39.960> obviously<00:03:40.960> we're<00:03:41.110> using<00:03:41.790> beefed

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
easily and obviously we're using beefed

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.170 
easily and obviously we're using beefed
up<00:03:43.030> gear<00:03:43.390> eeeh<00:03:43.600> so<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:45.370> strength<00:03:45.700> lines
