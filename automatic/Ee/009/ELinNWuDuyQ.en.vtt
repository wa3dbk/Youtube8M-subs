00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.920
 [Music] 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.380
 hello friends welcome again here 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.900
 to my channel in this video I'm going to 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.760
 teach for those people who 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.590
 have an ipad or iphone and maybe even 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.940
 possibly just 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:25.420
 are experiencing this is again their 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.010
 new ipad or iphone and I'll teach you 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.080
 how can you erase messages from 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.630
 facebook and messenger that are easy way 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.840
 that this is nothing new or that it has 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.000
 something that is barely there there and has 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.620
 invented recently and everybody knows 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.860
 but you know that every day 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.980
 it is always a new method of how 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.280
 do ok for people who already 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.410
 they know well 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.750
 and I already know that and that's why I want 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.430
 share with people who do not yet 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.620
 they know or they just have not been given 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.570
 account of how to do it then only 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.879
 obviously to do this we are going to open 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.630
 facebook ok and being here on facebook 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:09.470
 we go here when they send a message 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.470
 disappears around here 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.479
 where it appears but in this case 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.680
 example here I have a number and how 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.030
 red color out there is the messenger 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.670
 you know that today to send 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.770
 messages on facebook need to install 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.810
 the messenger or otherwise can not 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.600
 send messages or see the messages that 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.750
 his friends sent them ok we're going to 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.290
 open then the messenger ok we say 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.540
 click there and as you can see here in the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.420
 left side we have a column here 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.090
 of or a list of friends with 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.940
 who with whom I have sent 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.610
 messages or who is chatting with 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.160
 what do you want to call it you ok 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.710
 so 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:00.289
 what is done regularly on an ipad or 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.289
 on an iphone is that you have to give 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.570
 and you have to click on the name 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.520
 of the person for example in this case 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.239
 if I click here 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:15.050
 and there appears the entire list of the 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:17.870
 of the messages and what is done 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.590
 regularly is to click on the 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.959
 messages and one by one it says delete by 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.170
 example here if I'm going to erase this you 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:30.080
 I click on the message and it gives me the 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.330
 options to erase and I give you delete as 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.970
 can you see gives me the option says it's going to 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.530
 erase I give him yes and he goes 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.870
 disappearing one by one but 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.200
 imagine being erasing all that 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.650
 message like that one by one 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.170
 like it takes a little more time 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.630
 possibly this possibly exists 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.940
 another new method of how to do it but 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.220
 in this case we are going to do another 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.770
 way 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.750
 again we are on facebook we give 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.240
 where the message arrives here in the 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.810
 Messenger will open the messenger and 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.430
 here the name or the list of 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.890
 people with whom we have 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.930
 chateado and possibly around there 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.690
 someone that you do not want to click 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.030
 want someone to see the messages that 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.480
 have been because they have been chatting 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.260
 Well, you just have to go to 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.250
 what they have to do is 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.989
 give it to have to give it to the side 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.700
 left over the name of the person 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.849
 for example let's look for a message 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.740
 that we want to erase for example we are going to 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.500
 delete 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.990
 the message here we are going to give you here 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.770
 look for the name of the people of the 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.390
 person with whom you have been 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.970
 texting and wants to make that 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.120
 conversation is not going to erase him 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.130
 the facebook friend is not going to 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.700
 delete the message the messages that have 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:00.180
 state to text we no longer give you we give 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.930
 we slide to the left side and we will 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.330
 to these options as you can see 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.070
 can we what we want is to erase 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.230
 the message then we give to this 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.120
 red color that goes where it says delete 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.660
 which is in English but we 're going 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.200
 to be wet they say to delete ok and here 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.390
 the data gives us another another second 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.630
 opportunity to power if we want 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:27.150
 delete it and here it says that care of 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.330
 that these mean once you once 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.600
 age use or erase what the 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.730
 messages will be permanently deleted 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.870
 there will be no way to recover the 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.210
 messages 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.030
 because that's what you want then 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.070
 we give where it says delete conversation and 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.930
 you will see what happens here on the side 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.910
 left will disappear the name of 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.830
 the person who in the conversation does not 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.520
 there is more as you can see there 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:57.780
 disappeared it already know easy simply 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.940
 slide to the left side and say delete 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.050
 we give him here he gives us another second 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.050
 opportunity where it says 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:10.039
 where he says yes if you delete the 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:13.400
 permanently deletes messages ok 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:16.759
 then we give it where it says 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:20.300
 erase conversation and truth what happens 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:22.610
 there is erasing ok ok friends like that 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.220
 easy is how messages are deleted 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.440
 here in messenger on facebook on an ipad 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.300
