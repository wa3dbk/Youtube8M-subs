00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.530
 good for this meny tutorial how to do anything bottle sandoval enterito 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.909
 agreements with employers because there is uhlenbrock 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:18.510
 entering the ivic mouche if I am here 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.419
 conquering the mayor 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.140
 against 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.190
 there we will simply save the ones that are not the cult that appear to us 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:30.779
 with your first 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.090
 we tell him to erase everything 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.360
 and then we go to but the control key and while we keep it pressed 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.460
 let's read clicks to show us 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.240
 the vertices say 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.540
 the bottle 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.810
 we have to home half profile 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.090
 of the fork 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.320
 and you have to have us finished 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.760
 i the profile 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.220
 let's see 7 s 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.250
 we tell you that the cursor goes to the selection the selection was the last 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.830
 last vertex that we create 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.570
 then we select everything 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.570
 with 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.730
 here habit in the stud studies in the morning tools 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.860
 the staff used to make a 360 degree turn is expected a turn 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.430
 complete 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.220
 Let's see how many face steps are going to be generated 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.630
 remember that between more faces madriz toilet to see the figure but himself 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.970
 the development is going to be much more complicated 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.940
 We read spin and it generates the top view in this case 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.149
 and we already have presumed rum a bottle to the similar set 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.410
 min 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.150
 Hindu 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.680
 once we have that it reads 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.460
 and we just read to select for ohl pear 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.380
 selected 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.940
 double out 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.120
 if we say remove doubles 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.940
 with that market and what we do is 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.240
 take it off 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.730
 iii the repeated vertices 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.550
 i 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.539
 that are generated when you sprint 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.489
 let's read so much 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.890
 and only for 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.610
 prove to you we are going to place until 20n your moment 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.790
 in navarra there are materials we have the color Christian were placed fire color 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:28.929
 then we just get abal if we want to cut him to moseley 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:34.359
 but as we want April he began to cure him to be 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.359
 a 3d studio 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:44.699
 and we open a small touch screen very similar to gortari 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:47.689
 where 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:51.119
 in let's put him 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:53.189
 bottle 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.189
 pepa by the client 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.159
 that will be exported to 3d studio 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.099
 min 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.459
 sounded in that we just open tep accuracy that ChÃ¡vez had previously 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.969
 open sale 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.039
 let's read open 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:11.099
 we look for it in ponte we keep it in this case the discovery 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:14.909
 let's see 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.629
 percent 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.079
 bottles challenges heals and sell 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.340
 if you see Perez this little picture that on your computer does not fly 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.370
 the jet always minds that sometimes our faces appear upside down 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.449
 how should 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.829
 that is, they appear like this as soon as they open 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.090
 in that case it would not make him prepare the faces who said organized 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.489
 with the color and the erection that we need is taking care of evils but in 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.269
 this case like me and he say 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.699
 noble wanted 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.779
 as you see simply amen we are na 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:55.209
 the sumo watching them crowe and if we want broken we give him right click sharp 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:58.749
 and rotate mosset and let's see the figure 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.499
 simply 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:02.289
 let's read a folk 

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:04.269
 and he does not generate 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.290
 the development of the figure as we need it 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.880
 in the case that we do not like 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.419
 the young man like this 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.799
 we simply have several options 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.310
 and we say a folk we say that equator of the folds that it has if the cuts that 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.680
 he is driving 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.740
 and here is a scalpel 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.779
 with which we can simply talking clicks 

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:29.740
 decide 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.340
 where it's going to be cut 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.150
 a 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.150
 the figure 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.050
 to verify that everything is left 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.020
 according to what we need 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.020
 min then we can try again 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.789
 and we can go correcting those way 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.729
 i maybe sometimes 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.409
 the best 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.409
 separate the with the section is having the figure 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:16.059
 and we can do that by keeping 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:22.889
 a pretty interesting style ikea a lot better 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.830
 Yes Yes 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.270
 be separating 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.270
 well in another way 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.509
 good is that we already have on the campus but yes 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:41.349
 in we simply have many options to avoid it then we can 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.330
 enea add more images but we'll see that
