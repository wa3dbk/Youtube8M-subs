of<00:01:41.880> course<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.210> very<00:01:42.420> good<00:01:42.780> defensive

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
of course a very good defensive

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.249 
of course a very good defensive
midfielder<00:01:44.549> as<00:01:44.700> well<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.479> they<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.990> lot

of<00:01:46.290> answers<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.979> defense<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.850> think<00:01:48.060> if

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
of answers in defense and I think if

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.429 
of answers in defense and I think if
they're<00:01:48.299> going<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.720> early<00:01:49.110> season

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
they're going to have early season

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.749 
they're going to have early season
success<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:50.040> going<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.310> because<00:01:50.610> they

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
success it's going to be because they

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.969 
success it's going to be because they
built<00:01:50.970> from<00:01:51.360> back<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.630> front<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.470> if<00:01:52.560> they<00:01:52.710> can

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
built from back to front so if they can

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.700 
built from back to front so if they can
defend<00:01:53.399> if<00:01:53.640> they<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:54.110> instill<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.229> beautiful

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
defend if they can instill the beautiful

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.859 
defend if they can instill the beautiful
game<00:01:55.950> how<00:01:56.399> high<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.759> their<00:01:57.270> ceiling<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.810> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
game how high is their ceiling this is a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.060 
game how high is their ceiling this is a
team<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.500> missed<00:01:58.740> out<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
team that just missed out of the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.770 
team that just missed out of the
playoffs<00:01:59.399> last<00:01:59.549> year<00:01:59.820> yeah<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.060> think<00:02:00.299> they're

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
playoffs last year yeah I think they're

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.840 
playoffs last year yeah I think they're
at<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.020> mark<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:02.009> year<00:02:02.070> as<00:02:02.460> well<00:02:02.640> if

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
at that mark this year as well if

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.520 
at that mark this year as well if
everything<00:02:03.450> goes<00:02:03.600> right<00:02:03.719> they<00:02:04.049> they<00:02:04.229> could

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
everything goes right they they could

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.560 
everything goes right they they could
end<00:02:04.710> up<00:02:05.009> qualifying<00:02:05.369> pretty<00:02:05.790> comfortably<00:02:06.210> but

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
end up qualifying pretty comfortably but

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.600 
end up qualifying pretty comfortably but
literally<00:02:06.990> everything<00:02:07.500> has<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.099> go<00:02:08.129> right<00:02:08.429> and

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
literally everything has to go right and
