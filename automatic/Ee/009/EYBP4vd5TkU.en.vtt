00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
me so it's kind of a good thing but it's

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.590 
me so it's kind of a good thing but it's
also<00:01:27.530> bad<00:01:27.890> because<00:01:27.920> I<00:01:28.700> don't<00:01:29.119> know<00:01:29.179> I'm<00:01:29.360> so

something oh well um I think that's

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.620 
something oh well um I think that's

basically it I was talking to my
orthodontist<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.500> right<00:02:12.799> now<00:02:13.090> he<00:02:14.090> said<00:02:14.450> that

orthodontist and right now he said that

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.410 
orthodontist and right now he said that
if<00:02:15.350> my<00:02:15.680> scheduling<00:02:16.280> works<00:02:16.519> out<00:02:16.760> right<00:02:17.000> like

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
if my scheduling works out right like

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.940 
if my scheduling works out right like
trying<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.900> come<00:02:18.079> back<00:02:18.230> from<00:02:18.290> school<00:02:18.769> and

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
trying to come back from school and

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.130 
trying to come back from school and
everything<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.519> I<00:02:19.549> could<00:02:20.030> have<00:02:20.329> my<00:02:20.690> braces

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
everything that I could have my braces

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.949 
everything that I could have my braces
off<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:22.310> end<00:02:22.519> of<00:02:22.760> December<00:02:23.239> so<00:02:23.510> it'd<00:02:23.630> be<00:02:23.780> like

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
off the end of December so it'd be like

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.080 
off the end of December so it'd be like
my<00:02:24.109> Christmas<00:02:24.590> present<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.160> I'm<00:02:25.370> hoping

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
my Christmas present so I'm hoping

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.640 
my Christmas present so I'm hoping
hoping<00:02:26.390> hoping<00:02:26.630> that's<00:02:27.140> what<00:02:27.290> happens

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
hoping hoping that's what happens

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.009 
hoping hoping that's what happens
otherwise<00:02:28.609> they<00:02:29.060> will<00:02:29.180> probably<00:02:29.329> come<00:02:29.720> off<00:02:29.810> in

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
otherwise they will probably come off in

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.289 
otherwise they will probably come off in
January<00:02:30.170> but<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.639> just<00:02:31.760> depends<00:02:32.120> how<00:02:32.180> many

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
January but it just depends how many

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.349 
January but it just depends how many
times<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:32.840> can<00:02:33.019> come<00:02:33.230> back<00:02:33.350> in<00:02:33.590> town<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:34.970> he

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
times I can come back in town so that he

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.620 
times I can come back in town so that he
can<00:02:35.540> start<00:02:35.810> settling<00:02:36.410> my<00:02:36.590> teeth<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.910> filling

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
can start settling my teeth and filling

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.180 
can start settling my teeth and filling
the<00:02:38.720> gaps<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.230> just<00:02:39.410> making<00:02:39.590> sure<00:02:39.859> everything

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
the gaps and just making sure everything

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.740 
the gaps and just making sure everything
but<00:02:40.370> it's<00:02:40.489> nice

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
but it's nice

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.580 
but it's nice
I<00:02:42.520> think<00:02:43.520> that's<00:02:43.790> basically<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:44.870> um<00:02:45.170> I

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
I think that's basically it um I

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.950 
I think that's basically it um I
remember<00:02:46.580> someone<00:02:46.820> asked<00:02:47.270> me<00:02:47.330> about<00:02:47.690> the

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
remember someone asked me about the

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.690 
remember someone asked me about the
hooks<00:02:48.170> that<00:02:48.380> I<00:02:48.410> had<00:02:48.650> in<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:48.890> front<00:02:49.100> on<00:02:49.370> these

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
hooks that I had in the front on these

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.220 
hooks that I had in the front on these
front<00:02:50.030> port<00:02:50.780> teeth

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
front port teeth

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.710 
front port teeth
the<00:02:51.650> surgical<00:02:52.070> hooks<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.670> they<00:02:53.360> were<00:02:53.480> saying

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
the surgical hooks and they were saying

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.240 
the surgical hooks and they were saying
if<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.900> could<00:02:54.050> get<00:02:54.200> them<00:02:54.350> off<00:02:54.500> after<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:55.040> first

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
if I could get them off after the first

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.850 
if I could get them off after the first
six<00:02:55.490> weeks<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:56.060> mine<00:02:56.960> didn't<00:02:57.320> come<00:02:57.440> off<00:02:57.620> until
