00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
a CSV format that Ecotec can read I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.030 
a CSV format that Ecotec can read I
simply<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.159> save<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> location<00:01:13.040> such

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
simply just save this to a location such

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.090 
simply just save this to a location such
as<00:01:14.100> my<00:01:15.090> desktop<00:01:16.820> it<00:01:17.820> does<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.270> for<00:01:18.659> me<00:01:18.780> now

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
analysis 2011 weather data now what's

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.130 
analysis 2011 weather data now what's
interesting<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.420> these<00:02:27.600> are<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.870> ones<00:02:28.050> that

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
interesting is these are the ones that

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.570 
interesting is these are the ones that
come<00:02:28.320> out<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.590> box<00:02:28.800> so<00:02:29.070> it's<00:02:29.220> very

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
come out of the box so it's very

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.340 
come out of the box so it's very
important<00:02:30.240> that<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.420> give<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.930> unique<00:02:31.140> name

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
important that I give it a unique name

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:43.760 
important that I give it a unique name
so<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:36.720> doesn't<00:02:37.050> get<00:02:37.140> overwritten<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:43.470> save

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
so it doesn't get overwritten and I save

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.450 
so it doesn't get overwritten and I save
now<00:02:44.690> after<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.720> close<00:02:46.050> this<00:02:46.350> I'll<00:02:46.980> be<00:02:47.040> able<00:02:47.280> to
