now<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.239> again<00:03:51.269> on<00:03:51.720> obviously<00:03:52.260> certain

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
now and again on obviously certain

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.620 
now and again on obviously certain
things<00:03:53.070> that's<00:03:53.310> always<00:03:53.430> good<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.760> have<00:03:53.910> reboot

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
things that's always good to have reboot

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.680 
things that's always good to have reboot
or<00:03:55.200> Brie<00:03:55.410> spring<00:03:55.769> I<00:03:56.010> always<00:03:56.760> reboot<00:03:57.209> my<00:03:57.360> device

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
or Brie spring I always reboot my device

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.539 
or Brie spring I always reboot my device
but<00:03:58.410> it's<00:03:58.500> best<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.799> have<00:03:58.829> that<00:03:59.070> installed<00:03:59.340> as

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
but it's best to have that installed as

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.509 
but it's best to have that installed as
well<00:04:00.470> so<00:04:01.470> what<00:04:01.560> we'll<00:04:01.709> do<00:04:01.829> we'll<00:04:02.010> just<00:04:02.220> let

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
well so what we'll do we'll just let

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.000 
well so what we'll do we'll just let
this<00:04:02.670> boot<00:04:02.940> up<00:04:03.120> here<00:04:03.390> and<00:04:05.239> hopefully<00:04:07.010> because

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
this boot up here and hopefully because

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.920 
this boot up here and hopefully because
it<00:04:08.280> obviously<00:04:08.430> is<00:04:08.760> still<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.180> few<00:04:09.720> teething

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
it obviously is still a few teething

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.870 
it obviously is still a few teething
problems<00:04:11.450> with<00:04:12.450> it<00:04:13.250> but<00:04:14.250> hopefully<00:04:14.400> we'll<00:04:14.760> be

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
problems with it but hopefully we'll be

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.350 
problems with it but hopefully we'll be
able<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.150> get<00:04:15.329> it<00:04:15.770> it<00:04:16.770> will<00:04:16.890> Oh<00:04:17.010> get<00:04:17.520> sword

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.339 

but<00:04:22.360> there's<00:04:22.509> always<00:04:22.599> teething<00:04:22.990> problems

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
but there's always teething problems

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:26.040 
but there's always teething problems
with<00:04:23.440> things<00:04:23.620> like<00:04:23.710> this<00:04:23.949> so<00:04:24.690> because<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.840> is

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
with things like this so because it is

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.960 
with things like this so because it is
probably<00:04:26.379> it's<00:04:26.889> in<00:04:27.009> such<00:04:27.220> high<00:04:27.370> demand<00:04:27.400> and

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
probably it's in such high demand and

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.189
