00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
don't use high temperature lube as the

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.060 
don't use high temperature lube as the
lube<00:00:32.390> will<00:00:32.540> get<00:00:32.689> warm<00:00:32.900> it'll<00:00:33.530> melt<00:00:33.710> right<00:00:33.890> out

lube will get warm it'll melt right out
of<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:34.250> gearbox<00:00:34.670> so<00:00:34.880> it's<00:00:35.000> very<00:00:35.180> important<00:00:35.630> to

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
of the gearbox so it's very important to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.660 
of the gearbox so it's very important to
use<00:00:35.870> high<00:00:36.050> temperature<00:00:36.560> lube<00:00:36.770> we<00:00:37.340> have<00:00:37.520> these

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
use high temperature lube we have these

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.069 
use high temperature lube we have these
canisters<00:00:38.060> available<00:00:38.630> they're<00:00:38.750> not<00:00:38.870> much

the gearbox here this is where all the
lube<00:01:27.920> is<00:01:28.130> for<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.430> machine<00:01:28.729> there's<00:01:29.210> just<00:01:29.390> two

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
lube is for the machine there's just two

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.179 
lube is for the machine there's just two
Phillips<00:01:29.899> screws<00:01:29.930> on<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.380> top<00:01:30.469> there<00:01:30.890> you

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
Phillips screws on the top there you

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.840 
Phillips screws on the top there you
want<00:01:31.369> to<00:01:31.430> loosen<00:01:31.700> them<00:01:33.399> once<00:01:34.399> you<00:01:34.520> get<00:01:34.640> them

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
want to loosen them once you get them

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.709 
want to loosen them once you get them
loosen<00:01:36.850> then<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:37.969> can<00:01:38.119> actually<00:01:38.420> pull<00:01:38.600> the
