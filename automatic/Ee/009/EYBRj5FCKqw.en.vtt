00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:07.740
 Hello people have information for 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.920
 tankers I kind of rested 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.920
 tanks and went to play the other day 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.220
 a little and basically nothing so desire 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.810
 play refreshed became more interesting 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.520
 how many months will it be so 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.609
 periodically break for half a year of tanks 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.140
 I do them and unnecessary truths in general 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.119
 Now I went to ride in principle 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.360
 nothing like the funny thing still want 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.160
 say now I have changed in general 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.230
 desire to do video on youtube and 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.390
 time has changed for me and graphic 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.690
 payment 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.250
 big different changes happen 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.039
 so now it's not quite up to you i'm there 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.950
 sent for now is coming soon 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.530
 will end and I don't know if there will be any 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.059
 new video promoted to 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.719
 because honestly altar hunt 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.780
 still relax in the ditch I played enough 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:03.809
 enough hard sat 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.200
 on this typhus server it was fun but 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.340
 teach comfortably how is the break just as 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.850
 that's from the tanks 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.780
 and then we'll see if we can play some more 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.490
 eat in time will make a little bit 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.380
 play around with something serious 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.090
 engage in reluctance of the type there take place in 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:28.229
 far cry 4 is still like this 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.189
 not planned for me until the situation is not 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.090
 nothing will stabilize 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.740
 but maybe there will be tanks 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.030
 overall ride looked not sensitive 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.970
 funny randomly changed a little 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.610
 I'll make another video about it separately 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.929
 I want to talk about random skills 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.280
 players remember how it was before 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.439
 Now I have already accumulated several 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.789
 replays there at the tenth levels were 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:03.479
 funny fights general tanks principle 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.219
 quite good good game to question 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.450
 I didn’t have enough time very real 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:12.569
 a large number of battles there now 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:17.609
 42,000 remember brushes in general then fuck she 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:20.010
 rode so that infa important for tankers 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.810
 video only on tanks i never 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.090
 will they never had any 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.080
 constantly will not be that is periodically 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.330
 may there be such moments 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.740
 and when i play tanks that is and 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:39.130
 graph grids did not get it for four 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:42.680
 the year she was on the box and became better than worse 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.600
 probably in small parts resurrected in 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.940
 this series sign laz nasty master well 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.680
 how will the master be likely 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.870
 I will make a video boldly criminals 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.840
 well technician so between in the hero still 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.800
 left if all masters are going 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.860
 there are a few hundred more then I know 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:05.420
 that in the tundra there was an American branch 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:10.930
 tanning catfish in the tundra bends us 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.930
 about the tundra about the tundra and 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.580
 There is no big desire in this 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:21.220
 tundra play combine again two games 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:23.590
 I don't want anyway different in the tundra yet 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.420
 I will not play there is no such desire but 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.360
 I will surely see what it is 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:33.780
 american tanks 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:36.490
 how it feels 32m t in the top 103 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.830
 frankly, I ’ll probably go to the tundra with 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.280
 a great desire once masha what 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.130
 the situation will change to the Germans that is, I 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:49.620
 still waiting for this fucking series when 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.620
 lead e75 and either something else 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.550
 Well, as I kind of understand the developers 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.500
 all the same bend but not already 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.660
 bend that is, initially did not want 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.470
 there to tanks were only realistic 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.450
 to the sense that were put into series in 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.660
 production 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.190
 Now this lipstick is all gone to 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.010
 such a game is hard to do. 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.320
 playing such an arcade simulator on and cause 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.620
 there is stupid only for the historicity of the real 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:21.280
 the machine is extremely difficult to balance there 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.410
 so from the balance of all I put it this way 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.740
 what i believe and hope 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.660
 I want to believe that there will be curls the mouse will be in 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.760
 tundra mouse i'm on it 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.590
 ride because it's very interesting 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.790
 ride a little here in that physics 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:39.320
 which table is nonsense because 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:41.210
 in the world of tanks everything is clear here everything 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.120
 standard here there really would be me 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.410
 interesting ride 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.750
 in short, the world of tanks will be now 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.420
 occasionally swim out if any 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.950
 interesting fights or I will be that 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:58.940
 say any tim and do it well 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:03.860
 something like that about lobster and 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:06.560
 Yes, and the protection will be shorter, do not think not 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.270
 plan no promise see but 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.670
 tanks will periodically be why 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.320
 because he is so sissy on your game 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.810
 15 minutes, that is, periodically possible 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.280
 go there a few fights take you away 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.980
 this time will be possible so nothing 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.270
 terrible does not happen here something like this 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:26.510
 if someone was waiting for tanks then they rejoice 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:30.110
 here they will be a little video and who wants 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.660
 we 'll see the prize in Islam we will stop 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:38.110
 revise old maybe new 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.110
 then it will be when I do not know wait and see
