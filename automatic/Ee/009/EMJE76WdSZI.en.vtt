00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the way it's set up because when you

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.020 
the way it's set up because when you
pull<00:01:27.300> out<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.570> tray<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.230> get<00:01:29.040> all<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.760> stuff

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.640 
the top so then you put the icing in the
tray<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.540> that's<00:01:57.750> where<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> house<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.380> going

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
tray and that's where the house is going

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.950 
tray and that's where the house is going
to<00:01:58.830> sit<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.100> then<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.000> put<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.300> icing<00:02:00.720> on<00:02:00.840> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
to sit on then you put the icing on the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.770 
to sit on then you put the icing on the
house<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.440> put<00:02:01.830> them<00:02:01.920> together<00:02:02.160> I<00:02:02.780> would

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
house and put them together I would

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.930 
house and put them together I would
strongly<00:02:04.170> suggest<00:02:04.320> put<00:02:05.010> more<00:02:05.220> icing<00:02:05.670> than<00:02:05.820> I

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
strongly suggest put more icing than I

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.270 
strongly suggest put more icing than I
just<00:02:05.970> did<00:02:06.300> because<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.440> kind<00:02:07.650> of<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:07.860> fell

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
just did because it kind of like fell

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.030 
just did because it kind of like fell
apart<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:08.790> the<00:02:08.850> middle<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.360> little<00:02:09.390> bit<00:02:09.810> but<00:02:10.440> so

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
apart in the middle a little bit but so

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.560 
apart in the middle a little bit but so
if<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.250> put<00:02:11.430> more<00:02:11.580> icing<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.120> think<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.450> will

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
if you put more icing I think it will

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.660 
if you put more icing I think it will
stick<00:02:12.810> better<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.290> now<00:02:14.160> I'm<00:02:14.220> putting<00:02:14.430> the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
stick better and now I'm putting the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.970 
stick better and now I'm putting the
back<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.120> house<00:02:15.330> together<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:16.050> just<00:02:16.709> give

a<00:03:06.420> lot<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:06.720> precision<00:03:07.440> stuff<00:03:07.739> so<00:03:08.370> i<00:03:08.610> made<00:03:09.000> some

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
a lot of precision stuff so i made some

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.250 
a lot of precision stuff so i made some
windows<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:09.780> kind<00:03:09.989> of<00:03:10.050> looks<00:03:10.320> like<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.500> ninja

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
windows it kind of looks like a ninja

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.339 
windows it kind of looks like a ninja
she'll<00:03:11.920> for<00:03:12.250> some<00:03:12.400> reason<00:03:12.760> but<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.720> by<00:03:14.290> the

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
she'll for some reason but and by the

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.839 
she'll for some reason but and by the
way<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:14.680> think<00:03:15.069> you<00:03:15.159> should<00:03:15.340> decorate<00:03:15.549> the

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
way I think you should decorate the

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.520 
way I think you should decorate the
house<00:03:16.030> before<00:03:16.299> you<00:03:16.510> put<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.900> front<00:03:17.140> door<00:03:17.319> but

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
house before you put the front door but

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.410 
house before you put the front door but
I<00:03:17.560> kind<00:03:17.769> of<00:03:17.890> thought<00:03:18.069> so<00:03:18.280> all<00:03:19.060> right<00:03:19.269> so

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
I kind of thought so all right so

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.170 
I kind of thought so all right so
there's<00:03:19.629> my<00:03:19.810> gingerbread<00:03:20.170> man<00:03:20.549> and<00:03:21.549> then<00:03:21.909> I

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:26.439 
decided to give him some hair and then I

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.809
