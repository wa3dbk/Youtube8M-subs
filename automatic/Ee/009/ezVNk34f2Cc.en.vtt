did<00:00:12.719> sent<00:00:12.960> flying<00:00:13.349> into<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.740> air<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:14.219> showed<00:00:15.210> on

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
did sent flying into the air I showed on

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.510 
did sent flying into the air I showed on
the<00:00:15.450> map<00:00:15.660> there<00:00:15.990> where<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.560> location<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.100> and

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
the map there where the location is and

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:36.040 
the map there where the location is and
try<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.060> few<00:00:18.090> times<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.600> actually<00:00:18.869> works

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.120 

I'll<00:00:37.050> keep<00:00:37.170> going<00:00:37.440> straight<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.739> here<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:38.100> a

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
I'll keep going straight in here for a

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.920 
I'll keep going straight in here for a
little<00:00:38.250> bit<00:00:38.370> how<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.670> can<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.690> have<00:00:39.809> to

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
little bit how you can do it you have to

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.470 
little bit how you can do it you have to
hit<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.320> spot<00:00:40.470> just<00:00:41.070> right<00:00:41.309> not<00:00:41.910> hit<00:00:42.210> too

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
hit that spot just right not hit too

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.180 
hit that spot just right not hit too
much<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.840> left<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.290> right<00:00:43.680> or<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.920> might<00:00:44.129> end

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
much to left it right or you might end

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.040 
much to left it right or you might end
up<00:00:44.370> flying<00:00:44.730> off<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> few<00:00:45.300> times<00:00:45.329> like<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.840> showed

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
up flying off a few times like I showed

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.340 
up flying off a few times like I showed
but<00:00:47.010> once<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.820> down<00:00:47.850> here<00:00:48.480> how<00:00:49.140> now

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
but once you get it down here how now

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:20.170 
but once you get it down here how now
that<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.830> actually<00:00:49.980> do<00:00:50.220> it<00:00:50.339> anywhere

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.540 

and<00:01:21.180> again<00:01:21.630> best<00:01:22.620> way<00:01:22.800> is<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.979> make<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.310> work

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
and again best way is to make this work

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.250 
and again best way is to make this work
you<00:01:24.090> need<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> bike<00:01:24.510> with<00:01:24.690> some<00:01:24.870> good<00:01:25.020> speed<00:01:25.200> to

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
you need a bike with some good speed to

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.170 
you need a bike with some good speed to
it<00:01:25.500> need<00:01:26.190> to<00:01:26.340> really<00:01:26.610> before<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.030> hit<00:01:27.120> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
it need to really before you hit the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.910 
it need to really before you hit the
staircase<00:01:27.690> and<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.110> need<00:01:28.260> to<00:01:28.380> keep<00:01:28.650> bullying

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
staircase and you need to keep bullying

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.800 
staircase and you need to keep bullying
after<00:01:29.580> you<00:01:29.670> hit<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.880> staircase<00:01:30.300> and<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:30.600> hit

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
after you hit the staircase and then hit

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.630 
after you hit the staircase and then hit
up<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.020> building<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.590> you'll<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.520> be

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
up the building and you'll just be

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.930 
up the building and you'll just be
launched<00:01:32.880> straight<00:01:33.180> into<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.360> air<00:01:34.820> you<00:01:35.820> will

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
launched straight into the air you will

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:47.440 
launched straight into the air you will
even<00:01:36.000> survive<00:01:36.360> too

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.030 

and<00:01:48.450> as<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.690> can<00:01:48.810> demonstrate<00:01:49.020> here<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.710> can't

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
and as I can demonstrate here you can't

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.640 
and as I can demonstrate here you can't
do<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.340> here<00:01:50.550> but<00:01:51.120> it<00:01:51.690> harder<00:01:52.080> than<00:01:52.260> doing<00:01:52.470> it

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
do it here but it harder than doing it

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.990 
do it here but it harder than doing it
anywhere<00:01:52.980> else<00:01:53.010> or<00:01:53.490> some<00:01:53.640> reason<00:01:53.790> this

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
anywhere else or some reason this

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.700 
anywhere else or some reason this
building<00:01:54.360> which<00:01:54.480> is<00:01:54.510> captured<00:01:55.050> by<00:01:55.200> coops<00:01:55.590> and

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
building which is captured by coops and

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.470 
building which is captured by coops and
then<00:01:55.860> not<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.340> you'll<00:01:56.940> be<00:01:57.060> left<00:01:57.210> without<00:01:57.330> a

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
then not and you'll be left without a

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.750 
then not and you'll be left without a
bike<00:01:59.390> some<00:02:00.390> weird<00:02:01.110> GTA<00:02:01.590> buildings<00:02:02.190> to<00:02:02.490> go<00:02:02.610> with

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
bike some weird GTA buildings to go with

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.310 
bike some weird GTA buildings to go with
your<00:02:02.970> weird<00:02:03.540> gt86<00:02:04.290> right<00:02:04.650> now<00:02:06.170> one<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.260> the

your weird gt86 right now one of the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.690

best of outside sounds is actually in

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.029 
best of outside sounds is actually in
rockford<00:02:09.060> hills<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.810> fire<00:02:10.500> department<00:02:10.979> in

the shopping center if you get a good

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.370 
the shopping center if you get a good
num<00:02:13.380> speed<00:02:13.680> two<00:02:14.580> pillars<00:02:14.850> here<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:16.050> actually

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
num speed two pillars here you actually

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.530 
num speed two pillars here you actually
get<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> fair<00:02:17.070> bit<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.310> speed<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.820> land<00:02:18.090> just

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
get a fair bit of speed and land just

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:30.930 
get a fair bit of speed and land just
fine<00:02:19.040> most<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.190> them

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:03:13.210 

fuck

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.400 

and<00:03:14.220> again<00:03:14.580> best<00:03:15.090> technique<00:03:15.450> make<00:03:16.170> sure<00:03:16.200> you

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
and again best technique make sure you

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.660 
and again best technique make sure you
have<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> good<00:03:16.650> bit<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:16.950> speed<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.430> didn't

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
have a good bit of speed and I didn't

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.850 
have a good bit of speed and I didn't
like<00:03:17.760> keep<00:03:18.600> yourself<00:03:18.930> wheeling<00:03:19.319> before<00:03:19.740> you

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
like keep yourself wheeling before you

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.890 
like keep yourself wheeling before you
hit<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.040> staircase<00:03:20.490> and<00:03:20.730> then<00:03:21.660> right<00:03:21.870> after

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
hit the staircase and then right after

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.390 
hit the staircase and then right after
hitting<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.319> staircase<00:03:22.740> you<00:03:23.040> need<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.280> eat

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
hitting the staircase you need to eat

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.040 
hitting the staircase you need to eat
something<00:03:23.430> else<00:03:23.940> which<00:03:24.540> will<00:03:24.720> launch<00:03:24.810> you

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
something else which will launch you

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.650 
something else which will launch you
straight<00:03:25.830> in<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:25.950> air<00:03:26.040> for<00:03:26.790> some<00:03:27.720> reason<00:03:29.660> GTA

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
straight in the air for some reason GTA

00:03:30.660 --> 00:04:31.470 
straight in the air for some reason GTA
logic<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:31.320> guess

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.900 

so<00:04:32.480> it's<00:04:32.690> nothing<00:04:33.320> too<00:04:33.740> crazy<00:04:33.920> but<00:04:34.460> hopefully

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
so it's nothing too crazy but hopefully

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.340 
so it's nothing too crazy but hopefully
