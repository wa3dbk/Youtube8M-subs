your ideas but the kind I like to use
the<00:02:13.989> most<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.470> one<00:02:14.830> like<00:02:15.040> this<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.550> it's<00:02:15.940> got

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
the most is one like this and it's got

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.960 
the most is one like this and it's got
tone<00:02:16.959> paper<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.920> what<00:02:18.069> it<00:02:18.160> enables<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.730> do

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
tone paper and what it enables you to do

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.270 
tone paper and what it enables you to do
is<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.630> go<00:02:19.780> back<00:02:19.959> in<00:02:20.170> with<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.350> color<00:02:20.650> pencil<00:02:20.890> or

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
is to go back in with a color pencil or

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.340 
is to go back in with a color pencil or
a<00:02:21.340> milky<00:02:21.819> pen<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:22.870> can<00:02:23.019> add<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.230> whole

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
a milky pen and you can add a whole

a milky pen and you can add a whole
nother<00:02:23.739> dimension<00:02:24.100> of<00:02:24.550> depth<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.940> your

nother dimension of depth to your

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.240 
nother dimension of depth to your

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
drawing what kind of stuff do you draw

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.040 
drawing what kind of stuff do you draw
in<00:02:27.340> your<00:02:27.459> sketchbook<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:28.540> answer<00:02:28.870> is

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
in your sketchbook the answer is

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.979 
in your sketchbook the answer is
anything<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.920> everything<00:02:30.850> for<00:02:31.390> example<00:02:31.480> I

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
anything and everything for example I

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.320 
anything and everything for example I
like<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:32.440> draw<00:02:32.650> monsters<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.310> dinosaurs<00:02:33.850> but

like to draw monsters and dinosaurs but

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.180 
like to draw monsters and dinosaurs but
in<00:02:34.480> addition<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.989> just<00:02:35.170> creating<00:02:35.769> them<00:02:35.920> out<00:02:36.069> of

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
in addition to just creating them out of

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.430 
in addition to just creating them out of
my<00:02:36.340> head<00:02:36.640> I'll<00:02:36.910> visit<00:02:37.450> museums<00:02:37.959> where<00:02:38.350> they

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
my head I'll visit museums where they

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.229 
my head I'll visit museums where they
have<00:02:38.560> dinosaur<00:02:39.130> bones<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.610> draw<00:02:40.000> them<00:02:40.209> from

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239

life<00:02:40.630> studying<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.830> skeletal<00:02:42.370> structure

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
life studying the skeletal structure

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.400 
life studying the skeletal structure
helps<00:02:43.120> me<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.480> understand<00:02:43.989> how<00:02:44.200> these

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
helps me to understand how these

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.009 
helps me to understand how these
creatures<00:02:44.769> work<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.519> move<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:46.090> course<00:02:46.780> it's

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
creatures work and move of course it's

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.420 
creatures work and move of course it's
also<00:02:47.230> fun<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.650> just<00:02:47.950> use<00:02:48.160> your<00:02:48.310> imagination

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
also fun to just use your imagination

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.240 
also fun to just use your imagination

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.180 
remember exactly how chewy looked so
well<00:04:00.640> I<00:04:00.970> decided<00:04:01.420> to<00:04:01.810> make<00:04:01.990> up<00:04:02.140> a<00:04:02.230> border<00:04:02.680> so<00:04:03.160> I

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
well I decided to make up a border so I

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.610 
well I decided to make up a border so I
was<00:04:03.459> only<00:04:03.670> drawing<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.300> portion<00:04:04.990> of<00:04:05.020> Chuy's

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
was only drawing a portion of Chuy's

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.320 
was only drawing a portion of Chuy's
face<00:04:05.890> this<00:04:06.430> actually<00:04:06.970> makes<00:04:07.180> the

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
face this actually makes the

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.380 
face this actually makes the
illustration<00:04:07.930> more<00:04:08.170> designed<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:09.060> iconic<00:04:10.060> if

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
illustration more designed and iconic if

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.170 
illustration more designed and iconic if
you<00:04:10.540> will<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:11.020> drew<00:04:11.830> in<00:04:11.980> Chuy's<00:04:12.340> doglike<00:04:12.880> nose

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
you will I drew in Chuy's doglike nose

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.900 
you will I drew in Chuy's doglike nose
and<00:04:13.450> sharp<00:04:13.990> canine<00:04:14.440> teeth<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:15.250> next<00:04:15.550> step<00:04:15.730> is

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
and sharp canine teeth the next step is

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.090 
and sharp canine teeth the next step is
just<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:16.150> fill<00:04:16.450> in<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.720> fur<00:04:16.959> notice<00:04:17.769> how<00:04:17.950> I'm

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
just to fill in the fur notice how I'm

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.310 
just to fill in the fur notice how I'm
primarily<00:04:18.459> adding<00:04:19.239> fur<00:04:19.450> around<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:19.930> edges

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
primarily adding fur around the edges

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.440 
primarily adding fur around the edges
this<00:04:20.739> greatly<00:04:21.190> helps<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.760> make<00:04:21.970> it<00:04:22.000> look<00:04:22.300> like

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
this greatly helps to make it look like

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.560 
this greatly helps to make it look like
the<00:04:22.600> fur<00:04:22.810> continues<00:04:23.560> under<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:24.130> borders

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
the fur continues under the borders

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.270 
the fur continues under the borders
three-dimensionally<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:25.950> there<00:04:26.950> you<00:04:27.100> have

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
three-dimensionally and there you have

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.090 
three-dimensionally and there you have
it<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.640> custom<00:04:28.360> wookie<00:04:28.780> drawing<00:04:29.110> with<00:04:29.410> no<00:04:29.710> photo

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
it a custom wookie drawing with no photo

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:41.460 
it a custom wookie drawing with no photo
reference<00:04:30.610> I<00:04:30.850> think<00:04:31.150> it's<00:04:31.240> amazing

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.040 

am<00:04:41.830> I<00:04:42.010> sure
