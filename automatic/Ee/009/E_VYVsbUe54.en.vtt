00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.460
 Hello 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.099
 can't 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.800
 here's another bike we 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:31.210
 collected from a great customer this joanne 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.280
 battleship 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.250
 such a success . at the goblin 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.170
 icons not by amount equipment 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.420
 did we put a little 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.870
 electric motor and velmi not some 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.750
 principle is not particularly noticeable that it 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.620
 no ordinary sleeve assol it is compatible with 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.769
 disc brake conventional 6 bolts 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.079
 freewheel 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:01.940
 there is a cassette of stars on 8 stars on 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.030
 cad he is very light as usual 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.360
 bushings spun and the wheel continues 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.360
 rotate 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.740
 from the engine we have cable 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.220
 controller controller is located 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.790
 small handbag 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.930
 The battery is very compact and very 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:29.470
 easily removed for this insert the key 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.869
 Now turn the battery we like 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.700
 note u battery is very 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.030
 high quality gold plated connectors 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.039
 there is a number of his removal settings not 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.729
 will affect the quality of contacts 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.799
 enough durable system and 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.539
 keeps it very tight vibration 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.110
 excluded 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:53.649
 By the way, the battery is mounted on ordinary 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.750
 two mounting bolts for ga holder 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.259
 though they need to take a little longer 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.670
 What is Zavadsky because WESU 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.890
 here we put in recorded all 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.259
 Batteries are not removed here with us 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.330
 charge connector charging from 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.530
 laptop on everything is very similar 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.530
 operating principle . 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:19.690
 we have installed on the steering wheel, we 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.270
 control panel on the control panel 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.099
 plus or minus we can increase 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.560
 reduce 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:31.150
 reduce the power of our assistant 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:34.690
 pedals and further we can if we put 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.940
 on 0 then the controller does not respond to 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.410
 pedaling we can just ride 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.190
 like a regular bike 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:46.380
 if we put one or more by at 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.380
 pedaling turns on the engine 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.580
 the more power correspondingly 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.580
 he is more powerful 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:04.030
 the display shows us the percentage and charge 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:08.940
 battery level pass this assistant 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.230
 pedals speed the biggest numbers 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.590
 thirty four and a half kilometers to 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.200
 hour in limbo in real 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.720
 life under load it will be somewhere 32 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.700
 kilometer an hour when fully charged and here 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.340
 when we arrived about sleep 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.920
 calculate how much charge we have 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.660
 in this mode, that is, at the maximum 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.680
 20 percent speed would be enough for us 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:37.540
 another 6 kilometers in the corner 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.940
 right run for one trip if we 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.880
 we clamp on the control panel right 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.790
 bottom key then we switch to 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.970
 home mode only have it run for 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:53.310
 all the time to reset mileage 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:57.660
 for one trip switch to mode 3 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.280
 minus we reach zero and clamp minus 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.430
 Here we have zero run for one 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.650
 the trip 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.810
 the gas knob the harder we press 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.939
 faster we can not click I just 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:14.010
 put the sensor pass on the one we need 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:16.530
 level and it will help us how much 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.930
 you need here's how it looks on the steering wheel then 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.930
 everything is pretty beautifully composed 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.240
 connectors are very compact everything looks 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.110
 well worth it 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.880
 by the way 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.820
 who cares what the sensor looks like on 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.610
 pedals here it is 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.880
 on the right side the sensor comes out of it 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:56.630
 the wire is fastened under the carriage nut 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.900
 and on the left is a plastic washer with magnets 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.830
 here it turns past the sensor and so 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.380
 way 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:13.850
 gives a signal to the controller that we twist 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:16.870
 pedals so i can demonstrate how 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:22.720
 he picks up speed 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:27.730
 if we don't pedal here yasir 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.730
 push the gas go 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:42.060
 a little uncomfortable with one hand is all 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:44.640
 do of course here we pedal on 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:49.230
 C grade I easily easily spin the pedals but he 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.930
 it speeds me up quietly enough that's all 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:56.560
 works 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.560
 very soft and intuitive 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.860
 thank you all see you soon
