this<00:05:21.370> big<00:05:21.580> holiday<00:05:22.000> coming<00:05:22.360> and<00:05:22.510> we<00:05:22.600> wanted<00:05:22.840> to

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
this big holiday coming and we wanted to

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.380 
this big holiday coming and we wanted to
make<00:05:23.140> sure<00:05:23.170> we<00:05:23.440> could<00:05:23.620> do<00:05:23.800> as<00:05:24.280> many<00:05:25.030> things<00:05:25.090> as

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
make sure we could do as many things as

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.610 
make sure we could do as many things as
we<00:05:25.450> wanted<00:05:25.810> to<00:05:25.870> do<00:05:26.110> while<00:05:26.320> we<00:05:26.470> were<00:05:26.560> here<00:05:26.830> and

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
we wanted to do while we were here and

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.440 
we wanted to do while we were here and
so<00:05:29.620> we<00:05:29.770> have<00:05:29.920> a<00:05:29.950> budget<00:05:30.520> that<00:05:30.760> we're<00:05:31.060> kind<00:05:31.390> of

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
so we have a budget that we're kind of

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.090 
so we have a budget that we're kind of
sticking<00:05:31.840> to<00:05:32.050> but<00:05:32.230> we<00:05:32.320> found<00:05:32.620> that<00:05:32.770> if<00:05:32.950> you

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100

stay kind of outside of the city centers

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.400 
stay kind of outside of the city centers

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.440 
like any big city some hotels are very
very<00:05:38.740> expensive<00:05:39.100> and<00:05:39.430> others<00:05:39.730> I'm<00:05:40.030> much<00:05:40.240> more

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
very expensive and others I'm much more

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.270 
very expensive and others I'm much more
reasonable<00:05:40.960> and<00:05:41.020> this<00:05:41.200> is<00:05:41.380> a<00:05:41.590> very<00:05:42.100> reasonable

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
reasonable and this is a very reasonable

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.280 
reasonable and this is a very reasonable
case<00:05:42.700> this<00:05:42.940> day<00:05:43.150> just<00:05:43.420> regarding<00:05:43.900> what

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
case this day just regarding what

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.610 
case this day just regarding what
happened<00:05:44.620> earlier<00:05:44.920> in<00:05:45.070> the<00:05:45.160> year<00:05:45.310> that<00:05:46.410> if<00:05:47.410> it

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
happened earlier in the year that if it

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.580 
happened earlier in the year that if it
was<00:05:47.740> less<00:05:48.430> expensive<00:05:48.640> to<00:05:49.030> get<00:05:49.180> here<00:05:49.480> then<00:05:50.110> more

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
was less expensive to get here then more

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.950 
was less expensive to get here then more
people<00:05:50.920> definitely<00:05:51.130> would<00:05:51.610> be<00:05:51.790> here<00:05:52.030> and<00:05:52.210> even

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
people definitely would be here and even

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.620 
people definitely would be here and even
for<00:05:53.260> me<00:05:53.440> it's<00:05:54.010> a<00:05:54.130> time<00:05:54.370> factor<00:05:54.790> as<00:05:54.880> well<00:05:55.060> it

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
for me it's a time factor as well it

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.590 
for me it's a time factor as well it
took<00:05:55.990> me<00:05:56.140> 24<00:05:56.500> hours<00:05:56.560> to<00:05:56.950> get<00:05:57.040> here<00:05:57.600> certainly

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
took me 24 hours to get here certainly

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.300 
took me 24 hours to get here certainly
in<00:05:58.930> the<00:05:59.080> immediate<00:05:59.560> months<00:05:59.860> following<00:06:00.190> the

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
disaster many hotels tour operators and

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.550 
disaster many hotels tour operators and
Airlines<00:06:03.310> were<00:06:03.790> offering<00:06:04.240> good<00:06:04.450> deals<00:06:04.780> but

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
Airlines were offering good deals but

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.190 
Airlines were offering good deals but
now<00:06:05.830> they're<00:06:06.490> harder<00:06:06.880> to<00:06:06.910> come<00:06:07.180> by

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
now they're harder to come by

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.460 
now they're harder to come by
deal<00:06:10.310> no<00:06:11.310> I<00:06:11.640> did<00:06:11.850> a<00:06:11.880> lot<00:06:12.060> of<00:06:12.090> I<00:06:12.720> did<00:06:13.230> a<00:06:13.260> lot<00:06:13.440> of

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
shopping around but as far as Costco

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.490 
shopping around but as far as Costco
I<00:06:17.340> think<00:06:17.790> things<00:06:18.210> were<00:06:18.390> pretty<00:06:18.690> much<00:06:19.050> relative

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
I think things were pretty much relative

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.040 
I think things were pretty much relative
to<00:06:19.680> the<00:06:19.860> first<00:06:20.070> time<00:06:20.250> I<00:06:20.280> went<00:06:20.580> so<00:06:20.880> in<00:06:21.660> fact<00:06:21.900> I

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
to the first time I went so in fact I

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.020 
to the first time I went so in fact I
tried<00:06:22.290> to<00:06:22.410> ask<00:06:22.590> for<00:06:22.890> deals<00:06:23.280> and<00:06:23.580> they<00:06:23.730> they

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
tried to ask for deals and they they

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.300 
tried to ask for deals and they they
wouldn't<00:06:24.300> do<00:06:24.390> it<00:06:24.540> so<00:06:24.890> places<00:06:25.890> to<00:06:26.070> stay<00:06:26.280> and

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
wouldn't do it so places to stay and

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.620 
wouldn't do it so places to stay and
stuff<00:06:26.580> like<00:06:26.730> that<00:06:26.880> they<00:06:27.000> wouldn't<00:06:27.210> go<00:06:27.360> for<00:06:27.600> it

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630

time to see the newly unveiled Sky Tree
in<00:06:41.880> May<00:06:43.490> so<00:06:44.490> we<00:06:44.940> in<00:06:45.180> fact<00:06:45.360> transformed<00:06:46.080> the

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.170 
in May so we in fact transformed the

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.290 
in May so we in fact transformed the
tower<00:06:46.410> from<00:06:46.740> a<00:06:46.830> triangle<00:06:47.460> at<00:06:47.640> the<00:06:47.670> base<00:06:47.940> to

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
tower from a triangle at the base to

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.330 
tower from a triangle at the base to
circular<00:06:48.930> as<00:06:49.110> you<00:06:49.200> go<00:06:49.350> up<00:06:49.380> which<00:06:49.830> is<00:06:50.070> quite

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
circular as you go up which is quite

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.310 
circular as you go up which is quite
unique<00:06:50.760> from<00:06:51.360> this<00:06:51.480> angle<00:06:51.660> that<00:06:51.840> looks<00:06:51.900> quite

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
unique from this angle that looks quite

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.810 
unique from this angle that looks quite
symmetrical<00:06:52.860> but<00:06:53.100> depending<00:06:53.460> on<00:06:53.580> where<00:06:53.730> you

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:53.820 
symmetrical but depending on where you

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.790 
symmetrical but depending on where you
look<00:06:53.940> at<00:06:54.090> the<00:06:54.150> tower<00:06:54.360> from<00:06:54.780> it's<00:06:55.410> somewhat

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
look at the tower from it's somewhat

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.520 
look at the tower from it's somewhat
irregular

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.070 

and<00:07:01.530> so<00:07:01.740> Japan<00:07:01.949> too<00:07:02.490> has<00:07:02.790> taken<00:07:03.240> an<00:07:03.449> irregular

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
and so Japan too has taken an irregular

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.720 
and so Japan too has taken an irregular
approach<00:07:04.530> in<00:07:04.770> trying<00:07:05.280> to<00:07:05.430> regain

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:05.730 
approach in trying to regain

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.689 
approach in trying to regain
international<00:07:06.630> visitors<00:07:07.110> free<00:07:08.070> flights<00:07:08.400> or

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:08.699 
international visitors free flights or

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:11.240 
international visitors free flights or
tourist<00:07:09.330> tees<00:07:09.630> it's<00:07:10.020> a<00:07:10.470> scheme<00:07:10.800> that

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
tourist tees it's a scheme that

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:17.439 
tourist tees it's a scheme that
certainly<00:07:11.820> grabs<00:07:12.210> the<00:07:12.540> world's<00:07:12.930> attention

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:17.449
