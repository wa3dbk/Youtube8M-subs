00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.290
 What's up, people? Who's talking? 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.929
 apache order are very welcome more 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.480
 a personal video name of today I'm here 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.490
 with my future affection swim here 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.090
 Romans drift crazy as you see the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.830
 title sim galera mode tokyo drift is on 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.289
 Truth this video is a profit video 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.810
 it's not because I'm going to talk about the mod a 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.420
 new way to launch a drift mode and 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.699
 I'm going while trying to ash 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.969
 replace the mod and do a facelift here 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.130
 a drift video for you guys 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.260
 to compare the two, such as the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.790
 drift it is already possible to do gta 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.620
 How do you lower your car? 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.989
 putting airfoil shift so 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.600
 usually the car and it will pick up 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.760
 this cindy thani scheme on the wheel 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.950
 is also important in the case using the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.140
 also tanya wheel is you 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.100
 do these things you can do 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.620
 a car that is prone to drift is not there 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.940
 comes a personal mod therefore leaves 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.530
 I see if I can make a curve that 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.530
 cool, I already managed to do something but it's 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.420
 very hard, you're on time now it's 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.590
 stay tuned to the Portuguese 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.960
 failing right 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.810
 and then the next, the gringos in 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.360
 have cast a new mold on the mold of 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.540
 drift a tokyo way drift the face 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.520
 said that it is very difficult to 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.009
 control the car is semi type 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.720
 impossible to control the car but the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.759
 result is very cool and very 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.290
 satisfactory he said that face that 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.240
 can now produce a very 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.829
 of drift and especially for 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.869
 who produces content that will make 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.700
 those distant from such will now 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.680
 with this way of making the videos 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.869
 destinations is also pretty cool old witch 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.360
 It is very difficult to accept in this game of giving 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.530
 the guys is that you take a skinny well from 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.180
 normal time to go wrong 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.820
 Ah I really like that fast and 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.409
 furious drift curious 3 's then 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.540
 whenever I see something like that I 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.399
 I really like trying to leave, this is the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.860
 ideal time to train it looks to a 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.380
 the training time he has and he has already 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.210
 take it from here and it's going but we'll see if 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.430
 I get the next speed 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.760
 and if I can send an hour dribble 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.760
 here o 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.160
 the election now was the time whoa same 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.860
 crazy hour staff is so 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.480
 It's difficult to leave the video of this mode and I 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.430
 I'm not using not know if it gives to 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.620
 understand that I am not 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.630
 using mode I'm just commenting and 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.140
 trying without gta because the mold is for 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.239
 who has xbox is j tegra those 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.739
 differentiated xbox treatments 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:37.080
 sadly, the pope left parked and 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.060
 who has those changes 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.800
 necessary and so has to make a 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.780
 grace that I think may not be 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.370
 always being necessary to make a 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.980
 lifting yes since you lower the 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.590
 car as long as you capriche in your 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.489
 image of the girl car you can do 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.320
 a zoom a slight drift is with the car not 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.970
 nothing is very good especially because I think 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.530
 the video gets a bit exaggerated 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.769
 point to sort 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.200
 It is difficult to control the car if you 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.420
 this 13 calculating horses that the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.150
 noise is good, it's cool, it's a joke 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.910
 cool especially for those who like 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.269
 to record video distant such then is the 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.010
 he admits the drift he faces the court 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.730
 It's actually he has hit more on the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.230
 curve 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.230
 now a good thing here 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.200
 the player had not gone over 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.630
 of manias and order 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.520
 the volume is more a cool thing here 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.790
 yesterday a truck full of curves here 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.020
 It's cool, it 's nice that's the drift peak. 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.489
 the itv 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.130
 The wan network pull has to be 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.769
 very light and so this quitna moralzinha 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.069
 was sent r 1 and in the middle of the curve he alone 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.500
 will use you and you end curves 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.500
 né great welcome that gives you if in the movie 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.180
 let's go too 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.170
 let me take another legal curve here 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.049
 Personal flash is itá 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:07.870
 I think it 's a little bit in the sights. 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:11.940
 the opi one more pole here is to give this here 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.870
 to accept it only goes on time 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.640
 Wow, I'm busted in the car at 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.530
 all walls possible never good 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.600

 so you can send us your comments 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.060
 who makes the most sense is a look 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.970
 to see if the other subscribers do not 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.100

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.080

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.850
 One more video I hope you have 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.890
 I really do not want to quote any of it. 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.720
 limit is hope you like the 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.510
 has no way to install it. 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.129
 install and tells me then as a step is 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:56.509
 rock at the time mind 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:05:00.559
 but the omega guy quick and see the staff 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:02.599
 and this is every speech I liked the same theme 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:03.589
 or if you like to watch also gives 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.929
 a look at the comments I have 

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:09.080
 certain that some in the public with 

00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:10.339
 sure does video drift and if you 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.599
 Did you forget to rate the video of 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:13.219
 show the young man at his favorite if 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.629

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:17.239
 content again thank you very much 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:19.849
 for the support of all of you sell in these 

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:22.610
 channel steps is very 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:24.830
 asking product bringing sunshine and 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.649
 It's a simple answer, we 're kind of 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.019
 no games to bring lately I 'm 

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:31.969
 playing only the gta and at most sometimes 

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:34.699
 some part of the other from fifa these days 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:36.439
 I downloaded that mickey that's in line but it's 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:38.509
 a noise of a 0K bike on the curve does not 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:41.360
 There's nothing very interesting about it then. 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:43.939
 so the focus of gta is really no 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.279
 by not over playing with 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:48.529
 launching new things to do in 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:50.209
 other games beauty so eager yet 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:52.639
 I think within a week of having a 

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:55.009
 the 101 seems like a week or two is 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.439
 after that at the end of the month we will have the 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.089
 art of the obvious so there's a lot of stuff 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:01.550
 still good to happen stay 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:04.039
 Calm down, you will always be 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.360

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:08.329
 win the channel always with the best 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.339
