lifting<00:00:16.740> straps<00:00:17.039> right<00:00:17.250> here<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.609> reason<00:00:17.730> I'm

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
lifting straps right here the reason I'm

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.849 
lifting straps right here the reason I'm
doing<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.539> because<00:00:18.570> my<00:00:19.050> traps<00:00:19.380> are<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> lot

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
doing this is because my traps are a lot

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.859 
doing this is because my traps are a lot
stronger<00:00:20.130> than<00:00:20.310> my<00:00:20.490> grips<00:00:20.760> running<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.689> this

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
stronger than my grips running so this

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.330 
stronger than my grips running so this
allows<00:00:22.140> made<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.560> look<00:00:22.650> really<00:00:22.980> heavy<00:00:23.160> weight

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
allows made to look really heavy weight

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.950 
allows made to look really heavy weight
and<00:00:23.400> put<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> lot<00:00:23.910> more<00:00:23.939> overload<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.570> my<00:00:24.660> traps

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960
