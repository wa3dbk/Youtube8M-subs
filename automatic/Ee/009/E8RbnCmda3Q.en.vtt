 I did it, I did it right but I think 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.369
 What I did I think I did right is 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.899
 get promises to pass the point was 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.979

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:00.820
 point a thousand years right problem in the car 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:03.759

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.959
 people when I 'm going to make that balance 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.430
 I will even have to put problems or 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.720
 when you make a balance there, that's when 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.660
 I'm going with kalac already. 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.790

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.380
 prudent preparation in the first person 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.970
 because otherwise it will be very complicated 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.740
 Until the second lap I'll have to 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.000

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.190

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.340

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.079

 first and then nobody second in 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.129
 cause of the first spiral and because of 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:15.129
 South decided to stay in third and this 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.919
 Very crazy race, it's very difficult. 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:20.949
 Even we enjoy staying in the poor and the 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:36.039
 end of the race in 2 seconds use is 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:40.470

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.680
 every one comes here, the Russian facing 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.620
 This is the use and your fault of using the increase 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.199
 the already robust mother was partner is necessary 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.060
 learning everything we still have 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.070
 things have adjusted our homes 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.860
 leaving the race ii was very much like 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:05.060

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.949
