out like this so I'll just start so so
we<00:00:17.250> start<00:00:17.699> with<00:00:17.970> your<00:00:18.390> base<00:00:18.570> 82<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.920> these

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
we start with your base 82 of these

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.150 
we start with your base 82 of these
uniform<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.840> one<00:00:22.170> but<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.500> don't<00:00:22.740> have<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:22.980> I

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you need these parts a six by one for my

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.590 
you need these parts a six by one for my
10<00:00:58.620> 3<00:00:58.980> by<00:00:59.160> 1<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.670> 2<00:00:59.730> by<00:01:00.210> 2<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.780> 4<00:01:01.440> by<00:01:01.649> 2<00:01:01.710> into<00:01:02.340> x<00:01:02.370> 1<00:01:02.600> so

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
10 3 by 1 a 2 by 2 of 4 by 2 into x 1 so

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.780 
10 3 by 1 a 2 by 2 of 4 by 2 into x 1 so
you<00:01:03.660> put<00:01:03.930> distillate<00:01:04.680> i'll<00:01:05.040> put<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.700> at

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
you put distillate i'll put this on at

for you get at 265 ones at 24 by twos

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.179 
for you get at 265 ones at 24 by twos
and<00:01:43.799> they<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.310> buy<00:01:44.670> one<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:46.079> put<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> four<00:01:46.770> by

and they to buy one so you put a four by

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.460 
and they to buy one so you put a four by
two<00:01:47.450> their<00:01:48.500> ipod<00:01:49.549> they<00:01:50.549> put<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:50.939> one<00:01:51.180> here

white ones to put one right on there a
one<00:02:58.730> white<00:02:59.120> one<00:02:59.150> there<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.760> then<00:03:01.910> diversity

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
one white one there and then diversity

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.440 
one white one there and then diversity
is<00:03:02.570> how<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.810> fit<00:03:03.140> it<00:03:03.170> up<00:03:03.550> and<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:05.000> last<00:03:05.180> time<00:03:05.330> i

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
is how to fit it up and the last time i

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.880 
is how to fit it up and the last time i
will<00:03:05.600> quote<00:03:05.780> least<00:03:06.140> i<00:03:06.260> went<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.650> a<00:03:06.680> wall

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
will quote least i went to a wall

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.340 
will quote least i went to a wall
because<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:07.490> could<00:03:07.910> not<00:03:08.390> figure<00:03:08.780> out<00:03:09.070> how<00:03:10.070> to

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
because it could not figure out how to

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.320 
because it could not figure out how to
do<00:03:12.350> that<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:13.040> i<00:03:13.070> hope<00:03:13.490> go<00:03:13.790> like<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:14.300> time<00:03:15.070> and

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
do that so i hope go like this time and

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.970 
do that so i hope go like this time and
it<00:03:17.330> has<00:03:17.630> now<00:03:18.110> so<00:03:18.470> that<00:03:18.680> this<00:03:18.950> is<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:20.060> black

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
it has now so that this is the black

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.910 
it has now so that this is the black
it's<00:03:21.980> now<00:03:22.130> it's<00:03:22.310> time<00:03:22.610> to<00:03:22.880> make<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.920> trigger

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
it's now it's time to make the trigger

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.449 
it's now it's time to make the trigger
