00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.280
 you can know anything 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.420
 it is clear that some kind of micro tweezers than 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:11.550
 do not know what to collect there 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:14.310

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.630
 they understand 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.270
 original and unoriginal like this is linux 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.130

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.340
 rivets 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:25.440
 all shabby maybe I donâ€™t wear 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:29.650
 honestly i like the smelly choice 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:32.040
 probably worth it because even if the code 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.040
 on a little bit 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:44.949

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:47.669

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:47.669
 I did not see 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:56.319

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:22.430
 Well, the addition to this was dragging a kick 

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:30.069
 eight Zhardin not even more of this 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:34.150
 I do not hope that there will not be yet 

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:38.210
 so what else to say well 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:40.960
 In short, all quarrel over voice 

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.960
