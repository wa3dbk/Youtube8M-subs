00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 on television more also more than 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:11.090
 never and we are happy to greet 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.090
 Mr. chiquini chiquini good morning 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.520
 there are two companies globally very 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.779
 important ones that are dedicated to evaluate the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.250
 vehicle safety on issues of 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.920
 collisions both rear frontal 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.619
 side impacts that the damage that 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.630
 can suffer the is to study the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.270
 impact the impact and injuries that 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.500
 can happen in our two these like this 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.300
 is and this is done through these 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.809
 famous crack tests or tests 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.070
 shock where in the inner part they go 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.410
 dominate these domains the amount very 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.539
 important of sensors that obviously 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.579
 Well, they are reporting the possible 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.219
 injuries that could somehow 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.350
 have a same occupant in the case of a 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.340
 contact and good a few days ago good 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.780
 for three years 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.250
 the encup that is one of the most 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.860
 important and that normally has its 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.380
 work in europe 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.840
 a subsidiary in Latin america latin in 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.670
 cap and this latina is somehow 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.990
 responsible for evaluating the safety of 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.540
 vehicles but for what it is 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.840
 Latin America clear and good for the first 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.250
 Once evaluated vehicles that have 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.200
 work or that somehow compete 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.420
 somehow they are sold in territory 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.280
 Mexican and from these evaluations there 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.830
 the first truly amazing things 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.570
 that the safest vehicle in these 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.729
 evaluations that were made and by 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.130
 first time the Latin in cap awarded five 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.250
 stars that is maximum security 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.130
 that is granted in these evaluations is 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.780
 they gave it to the new seat lion a vehicle 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.180
 that just launched just two ago 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.119
 months already and this vehicle has two 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.190
 with five security stars in 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.590
 damage this exterior and five stars 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.810
 for what is the inside part here 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.210
 amazing surprising these tests 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.369
 the impact is made more or less those 66 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.350
 kilometers per hour not and if you notice the 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.330
 impacts are not completely frontal 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.680
 are slightly angled towards one of 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.259
 the sides that is one of the realities 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.000
 that happens in the real and normally 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.820
 of course we said that one of the biggest 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.030
 mechanics of an accident is here where 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.470
 we see but see nothing more as 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.480
 everything that is the front absorbs 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.910
 the blow and the cockpit is almost 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.920
 intact that is, there is not a single movement 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.780
 Everything is designed so that the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.010
 vehicle collapse but do not touch the 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.320
 part of the passenger compartment that is where they go 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.790
 obviously the occupants and yet 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.320
 is of the new generation obviously in 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.330
 the inner part is also evaluated how 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.160
 They are subject chairs Babies 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.430
 impact or damage that may be suffered by 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.209
 babies in my bunk the moment of a 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.920
 a sinister like these but in a way 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.989
 opposite of a vehicle that 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.600
 unfortunately it came out very badly delivered in 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.950
 these tests that were done and is a 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.840
 vehicle that is sold in Mexico and is one 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.850
 of the big sellers in Mexico that 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.090
 is the south of the nissan brand the south of 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.760
 the nissan brand got zero stars in 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.070
 the outer part what are impacts 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.810
 both front and side without 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.370
 However, it could not be evaluated or could not be 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.989
 continue with the evaluation because as no 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.570
 has harnesses to hold the 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.190
 baby chair just did not do the 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.120
 inside test and with this obviously 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.819
 Well, I do not know 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.739
 to see if we can or can return to the 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.379
 impact scene so you can see how it 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.290
 completely modifies the interior of the 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.610
 south and if you present how nothing is done 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.459
 how it is done 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.379
 look here you will see how the cabin 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:35.690
 it's all the inside part but it's like 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:37.310
 one way and therefore it is almost 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.260
 absorbing the impact completely the 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.930
 driver here is one of the scenes 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.609
 much more representative of how it 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.180
 modify all of the more the space that 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.109
 stay between the steering wheel 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.120
