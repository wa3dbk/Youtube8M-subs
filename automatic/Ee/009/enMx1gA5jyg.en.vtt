00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.780
 or the frog is fought welcome to another 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.290
 new video and how they saw it in the 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:11.320
 big title fauto 5 tlc groups tweet 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.630
 ok stories and this was a topic in which 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.640
 I wanted to play today but before 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.890
 that there is nothing to try to get in this 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.199
 video to the amount of 500 likes as 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.850
 possible fast that would appreciate it a 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.710
 heap and I would realize that they 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.080
 like this content to follow 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.020
 doing it and improving it so we're going to 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.900
 start since recently a user 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.819
 with some American youtubers he has 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.579
 sent some files a bit 

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:38.319
 strange not which indicated that the 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.199
 official wikipedia page in the 

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:44.710
 missing large pass to all 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:47.620
 the saga came out to him that in the year 2015 and 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.530
 I was going to take out a game which was great 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.129
 five stories cars the grove street 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.069
 ok and this title was going to be based more or 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.989
 less a few episodes of what was san 

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:01.030
 andreas something like what was done with 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.489
 big 4d car that were the episodes 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.970
 of liberty city ​​because this was going to be 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.220
 something similar not below we can 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.930
 viewing the image in which it is presented 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.510
 what there is here as they see it as it is 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.970
 the wikipedia page and it says in the year 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.220
 2015 the group street will be taken out 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.130
 stories not going to be for play 4 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.190
 xbox 360 and xbox one like the play 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.490
 3 and windows ok and everything is not confirmed and 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.080
 you leave something like that I think this can 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.240
 be photoshop but also be the 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.150
 I wanted to bring as a form of concept 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.980
 and little else although I say I see it out 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.320
 a little bit of this now we see something 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.060
 interesting here place we see another 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.310
 text that according to came in this from 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.369
 wikipedia and says that a new version 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.800
 of what is doing big car 5 is going to 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.110
 receive a dlc so story that you 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.560
 going to call cropper street stories ok 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.630
 was going to be for the consoles obviously 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.690
 first for playstation four and two 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.729
 weeks for xbox one and computer ok and 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.520
 as they see it is confirmed that it would be 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.009
 this year according to what he's saying in 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.440
 said image what I already tell you that this 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.750
 image can be from photoshop but the 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.840
 first thing that I'm convinced 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.230
 that this photo is a montage 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.760
 is for the simple fact that it is 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.680
 contradictory because because the first 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.810
 image confirms to us that it would leave for 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.730
 all the consoles either the ones of the trip 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.860
 generation new generation and 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.629
 computer and in the second only we 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.819
 says that it will first go out for playstation 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.400
 four and two weeks later he would leave 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.310
 for xbox one ipc no and which is 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.950
 would receive on September 22, 2015 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.720
 no, and since they see this, it means that 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.489
 have congruence and see that they are 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.170
 totally false information because 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.959
 first they tell us that it would come out for all 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.060
 the consoles and then not and now if 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.670
 we are heading right towards what 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.890
 that is doing the wikipedia section 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.829
 of great lack we can see this image 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.110
 and as we can see here we are 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.720
 in a screenshot of what 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.030
 would be currently this large sector 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.459
 auto as he sees it takes us out to the grand 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.430
 theft auto 5 but it does not take anything out 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.680
 more of all this here there were two theories 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.180
 the first and the easiest to believe is 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.760
 that all this was a montage of 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.260
 photoshop pretty well created and the other 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.200
 is that 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.840
 the wikipedia page had added 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.579
 this as a confirmation type but 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.340
 I doubt it very much, although at the same time 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.650
 can happen and I do not rule it out, but more 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.560
 that nothing this I think that right now it can be 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.569
 a montage and it can not be anything real but 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.209
 Now what I wanted to say obviously 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.099
 that is neither confirmed nor is anything real 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.170
 I say it's a montage and it's no longer 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.480
 because if we put them in today, that's 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.090
 been like erased or more than anything ever 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.739
 has existed so I say no 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.930
 they believe in this thing but now if what 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.599
 I want to tell you is that this had 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.090
 happened a few years before with the 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.639
 supposed title great auto san andreas 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.620
 stories which was never known if 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.569
 rockstar was producing it not what 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.510
 was producing as I had had 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.760
 some titles recently something 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.889
 similar not as it was big fauto 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.840
 bay city stories and also liberty city 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.430
 stories not in which also 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.159
 they were for the portable consoles 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.310
 ok but this big title for auto 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:20.190
 san andreas stories was something father of 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.800
 done they did some very good assemblies 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.530
 that they used a portable playstation 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.210
 and it was that he emulated and they did a boxing 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.879
 of said title although the said title 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.129
 he never came out then he could not 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:34.020
 that in some future we have that san 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:36.150
 andreas stories for consoles 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.129
 new generation and maybe that title 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.020
 can contain us the other cities 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.550
 lost of what is the state of san 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.949
 andreas not as this can be 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.569
 burial and the ventures and is a subject that 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.419
 you have already touched before as it can be 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:50.370
 quite possible since the company's 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.409
 rock star game maybe I would not book 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.419
 So this idea since it already has 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.849
 made with other titles also like 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.650
 the predecessor of big auto 5 the grand 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.289
 Theft Auto 4 if you are remembered 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.360
 pretty good in that title what there was 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.000
 it was that we had the stories not 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.159
 maybe in this title we can have 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.930
 apart a city of sixth because 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.669
 you also have to take into account that the 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.039
 Big point 5 was designed to 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.110
 playstation3 and not for the playstation 4 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.240
 and if they want to make a big title 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.120
 auto for the new generation obviously 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.919
 they will take it almost to the limit and they will 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.479
 expand it very much not then the voice 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.610
 this was something I wanted to tell you the day 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.409
 today I think that what had been 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.490
 rumored talk is something totally 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:31.470
 false 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.479
 although you also do not have to rule out 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.639
 idea that it would be pretty good and such 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.680
 Once rockstargames could develop it 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.050
 in some future not since there were 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.970
 Unfinished data you already know characters 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.400
 protagonists of said san title 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.199
 andreas and little more than ever 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.210
 unveil a new one there are also exist in 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.949
 the ministries and besides that it would be 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.020
 pretty good you have to know what happened 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.819
 with the other cities that were the 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.620
 state of san andreas so kids
