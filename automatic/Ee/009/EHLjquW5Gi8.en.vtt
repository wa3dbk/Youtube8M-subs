00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
this this is a select realized machine

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.819 
this this is a select realized machine
you<00:01:01.969> can<00:01:02.239> change<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.960> wave<00:01:03.140> with<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.379> pan<00:01:03.649> I've

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
you can change the wave with a pan I've

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.770 
you can change the wave with a pan I've
got<00:01:03.980> it<00:01:04.159> on<00:01:04.250> a<00:01:04.280> fairly<00:01:04.670> light<00:01:05.000> weight<00:01:05.269> so<00:01:05.479> I<00:01:05.570> can

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
got it on a fairly light weight so I can

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.350 
got it on a fairly light weight so I can
just<00:01:05.960> continue<00:01:06.439> to<00:01:06.470> do<00:01:06.740> nice<00:01:07.549> repetitions

just continue to do nice repetitions

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.600 
just continue to do nice repetitions
this<00:01:08.899> machine<00:01:09.290> also<00:01:09.530> will<00:01:09.950> go<00:01:10.100> and<00:01:10.280> reverse

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
this machine also will go and reverse

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.969 
this machine also will go and reverse
and<00:01:10.880> become<00:01:11.119> a<00:01:11.149> peck<00:01:11.570> reverse<00:01:12.409> back<00:01:12.710> stack

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
and become a peck reverse back stack

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.340 
and become a peck reverse back stack
machine<00:01:13.369> to<00:01:14.000> work<00:01:14.149> your<00:01:14.360> back<00:01:14.539> so<00:01:15.140> you'll<00:01:15.259> have

during my offseason it would be about

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.609 
during my offseason it would be about
six<00:02:07.090> repetitions<00:02:07.330> you've<00:02:07.990> much<00:02:08.200> heavier
