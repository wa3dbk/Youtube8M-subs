00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:10.730
 This is how much I introduced to you this time 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:18.720
 This jellyfish was found for the first time in Japan in the sea of ​​this kudzu Fukushima 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:22.080
 The first discoverer is actually this is my discovered in the last year of March 27 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.380
 The characteristics of this jellyfish have grown to eight 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:31.050
 Feeling of radiation 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:33.090
 It is a part called yellow gonads and it is a very beautiful jellyfish when looking at it like this 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.460
 Spend one year 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.690
 And I was able to breed the jellyfish at the end of trial and error somehow 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:49.450
 We are exhibiting at this aquarium now 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:54.160
 In fact, this name has not been decided yet because it was compared for the first time to wear this jellyfish in Japan 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:57.790
 I 'm looking forward to what this name of jellyfish will be 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.950
 It is this jellyfish that I want to introduce next 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:04.830
 This jellyfish is called octopus jellyfish 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:11.950
 If you look at it, it looks like an alternative 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:18.549
 There are 8 feet in the past , but there are 8 places that look like this foot even with this plastic 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.890
 It has a very caressed movement and has a polka dot pattern on the umbrella and is very cute 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.190
 is 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.950
 This Tako Jellyfish comes with lots 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.980
 Considerably compared to the other water tank, but I'm a jellyfish, which is expected to be in the summer 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:39.090
 We strongly light 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:45.750
 That is why this octopus jellyfish runs in the body called order layer 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.010
 The fish is living in the body The fish is raising light and is actually absorbing the photosynthetic nutrients 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:54.080
 I will 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:58.820
 In order to promote its photosynthesis, you make the light stronger than other hydrogens 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:03.320
 The jellyfish introduced this time are exhibited in the laboratory 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.260
