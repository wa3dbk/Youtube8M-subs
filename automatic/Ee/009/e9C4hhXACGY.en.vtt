hybrid case for ipad to notice carbon
fiber<00:00:08.280> look<00:00:08.639> will<00:00:08.820> also<00:00:09.150> work<00:00:09.690> with<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
fiber look will also work with the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.530 
fiber look will also work with the
sleep/wake<00:00:10.950> function<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:12.150> magnets

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
sleep/wake function the magnets

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.580 
sleep/wake function the magnets
basically<00:00:12.960> like<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.740> smart<00:00:13.980> cover<00:00:15.410> so<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.500> have

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
basically like a smart cover so you have

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.620 
basically like a smart cover so you have
multiple<00:00:16.800> ways<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.340> prop<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.609> up<00:00:17.760> it's<00:00:18.510> also

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
multiple ways to prop it up it's also

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.359 
multiple ways to prop it up it's also
have<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.900> hand<00:00:19.080> grip<00:00:19.230> their<00:00:19.939> infamous<00:00:20.939> for

let's get a closer look here it is a

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.859 
let's get a closer look here it is a
carbon<00:00:28.800> fiber<00:00:29.099> look<00:00:29.429> hard<00:00:30.029> shell<00:00:30.330> now<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
carbon fiber look hard shell now the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.510 
carbon fiber look hard shell now the
back<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.320> first<00:00:31.710> thing<00:00:31.830> I'll<00:00:31.980> interested<00:00:32.369> the

one solid piece covering the front and
the<00:01:15.570> panel<00:01:17.540> will<00:01:18.540> spine<00:01:18.869> down<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> back<00:01:21.140> so

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the panel will spine down the back so

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.410 
the panel will spine down the back so
the<00:01:22.320> ports<00:01:22.590> are<00:01:22.710> open<00:01:22.820> its<00:01:23.820> own<00:01:23.970> little<00:01:24.119> grill

the ports are open its own little grill
for<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.659> speaker<00:01:25.049> hard<00:01:25.979> protection<00:01:26.490> it's

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
for the speaker hard protection it's

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.370 
for the speaker hard protection it's
actually<00:01:27.330> like<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.509> plastic<00:01:27.750> grill<00:01:28.170> right

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
actually like a plastic grill right

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.030 
actually like a plastic grill right
there<00:01:29.900> ports<00:01:30.900> are<00:01:31.020> open<00:01:31.100> easily<00:01:32.100> accessible

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040

I'm going to kind of pop it open there
again<00:01:44.970> use<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:45.330> hand<00:01:45.960> grip<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:47.360> got<00:01:48.360> two<00:01:48.510> little

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
again use the hand grip I got two little

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.150 
again use the hand grip I got two little
grooves<00:01:49.020> right<00:01:49.200> here<00:01:49.770> that's<00:01:50.580> for<00:01:51.950> over<00:01:52.950> these

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
grooves right here that's for over these

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.880 
grooves right here that's for over these
corners<00:01:54.860> make<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.010> spine<00:01:56.340> open<00:01:56.640> up<00:01:56.730> again<00:01:57.890> you

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
corners make the spine open up again you

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.100 
corners make the spine open up again you
can<00:01:59.300> prop<00:02:00.300> this<00:02:00.480> up<00:02:00.540> into<00:02:00.870> different

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
can prop this up into different

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.300 
can prop this up into different
positions<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:02.040> prop<00:02:02.940> it<00:02:02.970> real<00:02:03.300> low<00:02:04.790> like<00:02:05.790> so

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
positions and prop it real low like so

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.410 
positions and prop it real low like so
prop<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.429> up<00:02:08.490> but<00:02:08.820> that<00:02:09.060> way<00:02:10.310> like<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.520> way<00:02:11.700> so
