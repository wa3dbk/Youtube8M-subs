00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
think yes and you get to two infernal

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.970 
think yes and you get to two infernal
break<00:02:38.280> each<00:02:38.460> go<00:02:39.180> ahead<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.390> collect<00:02:39.600> that

break each go ahead and collect that
okay<00:02:40.980> then<00:02:41.880> after<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.240> get<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.450> infernal

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
okay then after you get the infernal

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.030 
okay then after you get the infernal
bricks<00:02:43.020> what<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.380> want<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.590> do<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:43.890> want

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
bricks what you want to do is you want

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.890 
bricks what you want to do is you want
to<00:02:44.100> put<00:02:44.250> them<00:02:44.370> in<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.520> cross<00:02:44.820> formation<00:02:45.510> putting

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
to put them in a cross formation putting

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.480 
to put them in a cross formation putting
the<00:02:46.020> magma<00:02:46.320> cream<00:02:46.530> in<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.740> center<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.250> then

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
the magma cream in the center and then

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.550 
the magma cream in the center and then
you<00:02:47.580> get<00:02:47.670> four<00:02:48.060> blast<00:02:48.390> furnace<00:02:48.810> each<00:02:49.020> which

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
you get four blast furnace each which

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.860 
you get four blast furnace each which
gives<00:02:49.800> you<00:02:49.920> 36<00:02:50.220> blast<00:02:50.640> furnace<00:02:51.000> that's<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.630> more

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
gives you 36 blast furnace that's a more

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.930 
gives you 36 blast furnace that's a more
like<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.320> guess<00:02:52.560> longer<00:02:53.010> way<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.220> make<00:02:53.520> it<00:02:53.700> but

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
like I guess longer way to make it but

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.690 
like I guess longer way to make it but
that's<00:02:54.600> all<00:02:54.810> about<00:02:54.930> preference<00:02:55.410> really<00:02:55.700> okay

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
that's all about preference really okay

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.590 
that's all about preference really okay
so<00:02:57.030> we<00:02:57.360> set<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.600> up<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.960> same<00:02:58.760> one<00:02:59.760> two<00:03:00.120> three

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
so we set it up the same one two three

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.240 
so we set it up the same one two three
four<00:03:01.470> remember<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.040> for<00:03:02.340> high<00:03:03.980> okay<00:03:05.010> we'll

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
four remember it's for high okay we'll

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.030 
four remember it's for high okay we'll
build<00:03:05.460> a<00:03:05.550> wall<00:03:05.790> first<00:03:06.380> we'll<00:03:07.380> build<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.710> bottom

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
build a wall first we'll build a bottom

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:20.180 
build a wall first we'll build a bottom
part<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:17.330> damn<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.690> works<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.500> you'll<00:03:20.070> know

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
part and damn it works and you'll know

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.500 
part and damn it works and you'll know
when<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.489> build<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:20.790> correctly<00:03:20.820> when<00:03:21.270> you<00:03:21.360> see

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
when you build it correctly when you see

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.199 
when you build it correctly when you see
this<00:03:21.630> little<00:03:21.780> panel<00:03:22.050> right<00:03:22.290> here<00:03:22.580> okay<00:03:23.580> so

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
this little panel right here okay so

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.640 
this little panel right here okay so
let's<00:03:24.390> say<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.600> want<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:24.959> start<00:03:25.200> cooking<00:03:25.320> some

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
let's say you want to start cooking some

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.520 
let's say you want to start cooking some
steel<00:03:26.040> but<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.670> don't<00:03:26.850> know<00:03:26.940> how<00:03:27.209> well<00:03:27.959> in

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
steel but you don't know how well in

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.290 
steel but you don't know how well in
blast<00:03:28.890> furnace<00:03:29.070> logic<00:03:29.910> it's<00:03:30.060> kind<00:03:30.239> of

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
blast furnace logic it's kind of

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.120 
blast furnace logic it's kind of
different<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.900> what<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.260> need<00:03:31.410> is<00:03:31.530> charcoal

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
different you what you need is charcoal

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.380

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
so let me get some charcoal real quick

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.630 
so let me get some charcoal real quick
char<00:03:36.390> should<00:03:37.230> be<00:03:37.320> right<00:03:37.470> here<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.830> don't<00:03:38.520> know

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
char should be right here I don't know

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.340 
char should be right here I don't know
why<00:03:38.760> but<00:03:38.910> it<00:03:39.030> doesn't<00:03:39.300> take<00:03:39.480> any<00:03:39.750> coal

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
why but it doesn't take any coal

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.590 
why but it doesn't take any coal
it<00:03:40.560> just<00:03:40.770> takes<00:03:40.950> charcoal<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:42.150> need<00:03:42.360> iron

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
it just takes charcoal and you need iron

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.270 
it just takes charcoal and you need iron
so<00:03:43.380> let's<00:03:43.530> get<00:03:43.680> some<00:03:43.800> iron<00:03:45.920> alright<00:03:46.920> so<00:03:47.160> what

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
so let's get some iron alright so what
