Florida manatee is nearly entirely
herbivorous<00:04:18.389> which<00:04:18.810> means<00:04:19.079> it<00:04:19.229> feeds<00:04:19.500> on

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
herbivorous which means it feeds on

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.339 
herbivorous which means it feeds on
aquatic<00:04:20.039> plants<00:04:20.639> and<00:04:20.849> they've<00:04:21.750> very<00:04:22.049> very

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
aquatic plants and they've very very

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.529 
aquatic plants and they've very very
partial<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.979> something<00:04:23.460> called<00:04:23.640> seagrass<00:04:24.270> and

partial to something called seagrass and
