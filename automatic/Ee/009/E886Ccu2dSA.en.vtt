00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
pores makes is what the dirts I mean

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.179 
pores makes is what the dirts I mean
gets<00:00:30.449> stuck<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.779> there<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.140> then<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.560> lot<00:00:32.160> of

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
gets stuck in there and then a lot of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.370 
gets stuck in there and then a lot of
bacteria<00:00:32.790> such<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.390> grow<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.750> create<00:00:33.870> happen

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
bacteria such to grow to create happen

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.660

again<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> biggest<00:00:34.980> problem<00:00:35.309> myself<00:00:35.430> I

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
again it's the biggest problem myself I

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.130 
again it's the biggest problem myself I
always<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:36.000> really<00:00:36.239> oily<00:00:36.360> skin<00:00:36.780> until<00:00:37.020> I've

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
day I ran on the boat with him was that

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.480 
day I ran on the boat with him was that
have<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.930> funds<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.259> currently<00:01:40.950> go<00:01:41.220> out<00:01:41.340> and

the<00:03:16.000> skin<00:03:16.180> which<00:03:16.329> I<00:03:16.480> actually<00:03:16.540> don't<00:03:16.930> need<00:03:17.319> now

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
the skin which I actually don't need now

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.379 
the skin which I actually don't need now
once<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.280> get<00:03:18.370> older<00:03:18.609> usually<00:03:18.879> the<00:03:19.000> biotin

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
once you get older usually the biotin

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.439 
once you get older usually the biotin
seems<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.780> level<00:03:20.019> out<00:03:20.139> hopefully

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
seems to level out hopefully

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.360 
seems to level out hopefully
yeah<00:03:22.449> okay<00:03:22.989> but<00:03:23.049> I'm<00:03:23.739> not<00:03:23.859> getting<00:03:23.980> too<00:03:24.220> far

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
into the science about this but yeah for

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.720 
into the science about this but yeah for
myself<00:03:26.650> this<00:03:26.889> is<00:03:27.010> what's<00:03:27.190> worked<00:03:27.370> best<00:03:27.430> I've

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
myself this is what's worked best I've

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.970 
myself this is what's worked best I've
tried<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:28.000> lot<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.389> crap<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.690> try<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.500> give<00:03:29.889> it<00:03:29.919> a

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
tried a lot of crap to try and give it a

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.159 
tried a lot of crap to try and give it a
back<00:03:30.220> after<00:03:30.609> a<00:03:30.760> ton<00:03:31.239> of<00:03:31.269> different<00:03:31.599> creams<00:03:31.840> the

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
proactive and all that my stuff didn't

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.580 
proactive and all that my stuff didn't
work<00:03:33.609> I<00:03:34.000> mean<00:03:34.599> it<00:03:34.690> helped<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:34.989> a<00:03:35.049> degree<00:03:35.169> it

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
work I mean it helped to a degree it

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.860 
work I mean it helped to a degree it
seemed<00:03:35.739> to<00:03:35.829> keep<00:03:35.949> it<00:03:36.069> clear<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.609> he'll<00:03:36.870> never

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
seemed to keep it clear that he'll never

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.360 
seemed to keep it clear that he'll never
took<00:03:38.139> it<00:03:38.290> away<00:03:38.379> or<00:03:38.650> just<00:03:38.680> got<00:03:38.949> rid<00:03:39.129> of<00:03:39.190> it<00:03:39.280> I've

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
took it away or just got rid of it I've

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.369 
took it away or just got rid of it I've
got<00:03:39.489> to<00:03:39.579> maintain<00:03:39.730> it<00:03:40.000> fairly<00:03:40.329> heavily<00:03:40.599> now

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
got to maintain it fairly heavily now

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:42.720 
got to maintain it fairly heavily now
there's<00:03:41.620> other<00:03:41.799> things<00:03:41.859> you<00:03:42.010> can<00:03:42.129> also<00:03:42.280> do<00:03:42.609> to

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
that that helped a bit when I did that

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:53.699 
that that helped a bit when I did that
instead<00:03:52.690> of<00:03:52.750> like<00:03:52.900> once<00:03:53.139> or<00:03:53.199> twice<00:03:53.349> a<00:03:53.409> week<00:03:53.620> I

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
instead of like once or twice a week I

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.319 
instead of like once or twice a week I
do<00:03:53.769> about<00:03:53.919> four<00:03:54.159> or<00:03:54.250> five<00:03:54.430> if<00:03:54.849> you<00:03:54.940> want<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.150> try
