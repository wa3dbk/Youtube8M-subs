00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.110
 Ardent greetings to all this is not 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.160
 only a lot of experience and accelerated pumping 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.330
 crew 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.250
 but also the domination of servers by civilians 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.010
 civilians enjoy 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.590
 just from being in combat and therefore 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.870
 very rarely take an active part in 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.150
 fighting 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.390
 therefore less experienced players in 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.870
 such days are easy enough comfortable 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.110
 play 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.840
 tank and do a lot of damage here 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.540
 only no one is immune from what 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.690
 in your team of civilians will 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.920
 more than the enemy team therefore 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.950
 stock time 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.220
 it is a time of epic victories and no less 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.979
 epic plums and not for anyone of us 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.399
 the secret is that in this game there are so many 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.950
 different tanks have tanks situation 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:13.890
 for example, those that can be very long 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.009
 live in the environment and put at the same time 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.350
 a lot of damage and there are tanks of cards 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.220
 who on one card feels 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.800
 excellent 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.069
 she's just not capable of anything else 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.610
 efficient to do so if you play 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:32.880
 on a tank situation or on a tank map and 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.149
 your team does not drag him to me 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.850
 lucky not the situation of the name with the cards you 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.420
 do not avoid a series of plums and say 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.690
 fair 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.119
 There are very few people who can 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.209
 keep cool and full 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.090
 calm generally i consider myself 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:54.450
 calm enough person but even 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.789
 I am upset by the series of plums and not 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.970
 I'm not so upset about plums 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.789
 how much that I absolutely can not 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.880
 realize your tank situation because 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.399
 inappropriate actions of the allies therefore 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.099
 I have several tanks in the hangar 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.709
 which I call antidepressants and 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.360
 one of them is the Soviet medium tank 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.770
 vi 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.600
 level t-54 the thing is that this tank 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.780
 versatile enough 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.580
 he has good 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.640
 disguise that is he not enough 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.610
 I noticed his good damage per minute in 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.880
 he has good breakdown he has good armor 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.940
 he has good speed he can quickly 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.910
 change positions tank damage 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.150
 that is, the tank is quite versatile 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.950
 that is, the tank is so good 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.440
 balanced that even dying he 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.520
 hero dies it all happens 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.069
 because the t-54 is able to render 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.900
 decent resistance in any situation 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.230
 and on any map 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.350
 so even if you are not alone 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.239
 so this is all critical because even 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.250
 left alone you don't care 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.640
 able to provide decent resistance 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.950
 and looking after combat statistics 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.650
 you can calm yourself 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.430
 say well and good at least i 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.220
 did everything that was required of me more 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.750
 I would like to note that when situations 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.250
 you will be alone on such tanks as 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.250
 t-54 will be much less 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.230
 the thing is that this tank can and 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.019
 likes to be on the front line 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.680
 which means that you will shine that 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.370
 you will tank and your allies and 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.920
 i will just have to go ahead and 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.769
 take damage for you if you can 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.560
 play correctly on t-54 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.600
 then you can trap damage and this 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.900
 Damage will not get your 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.720
 allies well and it seems to me not even worth it 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.019
 draw attention to the fact that playing on 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.810
 front line you will also be also 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:08.930
 shine very well and so all your 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.209
 other residents who so love you to stand 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.230
 in the bushes at the base will not miss that 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:17.389
 do also want to note that the t-54 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.440
 does not give special load on your 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:23.060
 savings ie this tank is enough 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.320
 feels comfortable and on 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.560
 armor-piercing shells 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.050
 Of course carry with cumulative 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.630
 projectiles need also like me for example 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.419
 did at the very beginning I saw us 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.910
 meets IS-7 and immediately the hall charged 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.650
 cumulative projectile because ordinary 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.930
 armor piercing his punch in the forehead 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.240
 almost impossible well really 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.150
 of course like many of us I immediately 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.610
 I forgot that I switched to cumulative 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.979
 shells and for some time shot at 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.010
 cardboard targets such as for example in 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.330
 amx 50b 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.580
 cumulative shells though how are you 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.350
 understand quite calmly I could 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.650
 do it and armor piercing 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.750
 but fortunately I noticed that it was suspicious 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.850
 some flashes appear project 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.220
 hits and switched back to 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.200
 armor piercing shells basically i 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.510
 I play them almost all the time and 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.820
 I have no particular discomfort 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.070
 Well the truth is if you do not meet some really 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.920
 juice super armored 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.020
 opponents of course i would like 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.590
 especially note the moment that 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.230
 despite the fact that the tank loves and can 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.290
 playing on the front line doesn't mean 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:36.080
 that in every battle you must ololo fly 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.050
 forward and want to say that for 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.600
 most players especially 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.310
 unprepared such tactics 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.100
 will end just a quick return to 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.310
 hangar so it is imperative to learn 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.620
 correctly evaluate your opponent’s setup 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.640
 correctly evaluate the map and its role in 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.790
 specific battle 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.640
 but the most important thing is to learn to watch 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.220
 for situations on the battlefield and their correct 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.520
 make a decision at one time or another 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.940
 and still very important to know the cards and not 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.230
 to use the avtopriplem 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.420
 I don’t use Brest gun 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.040
 when making some maneuvers 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.770
 about this ledge on this map i 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.060
 completely forgot why I commit 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:22.190
 beautiful flight that costs me heaps hp 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:25.100
 wounded crew members and other things 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.410
 other things fortunately repairing the gunner and 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.540
 I quickly get the last fragment 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.410
 what brings me 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.780
 medal of a warrior in this battle in the aftermath 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.100
 there are no statistics any special 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.770
 achievements 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.930
 not much damage and I dealt all 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.690
 four and a half thousand this tank 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:47.930
 and capable of more 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:51.860
 got a little more than 5,700 promotional 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:54.110
 experience and in principle I think that the battle 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.680
 nothing special stands out except 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.900
 the fact that he interrupted a series of plums raised 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.100
 I am in a better mood 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.040
 like clockwork 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:07.480
 if suddenly someone else does not know the subscription 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.480
 evil and see you soon
