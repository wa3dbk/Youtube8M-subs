00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.150 
to turn all the traktor kontrol stuff
off<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.260> bit<00:00:19.410> damp<00:00:19.650> when<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.859> fancy

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.070 
off it's a bit damp when you fancy
letting<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.460> move<00:00:20.550> around<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:21.000> bit<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.300> then

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
letting it move around a bit and then

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:32.290 
letting it move around a bit and then
you<00:00:22.199> set<00:00:22.439> off

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.550 

as<00:00:33.020> you<00:00:33.200> can<00:00:33.290> see<00:00:33.440> this<00:00:33.559> is<00:00:33.649> very<00:00:33.800> fun

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.490 

just<00:00:40.340> concentrate<00:00:40.640> on<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.480> lack<00:00:41.750> of<00:00:41.780> steering

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
just concentrate on the lack of steering

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.670 
just concentrate on the lack of steering
angle<00:00:43.160> years<00:00:43.610> it's<00:00:44.600> a<00:00:44.690> fastrak<00:00:45.080> just<00:00:45.470> 2<00:00:45.650> turns

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
angle years it's a fastrak just 2 turns

paddles<00:00:48.410> you<00:00:49.100> really<00:00:49.310> don't<00:00:49.460> need<00:00:49.550> to<00:00:49.610> cross

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
paddles you really don't need to cross

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.120 
paddles you really don't need to cross
your<00:00:50.240> hands<00:00:50.420> everything<00:00:51.080> happens<00:00:51.500> on<00:00:51.740> the

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
your hands everything happens on the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:01:05.250 
your hands everything happens on the
steering<00:00:52.340> or<00:00:52.550> even<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:52.940> indicators

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:19.990 

Oh

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.410 

and<00:01:20.780> this<00:01:21.080> is<00:01:21.410> what<00:01:21.560> it's<00:01:21.680> all<00:01:21.860> about

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
and this is what it's all about

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.500 
and this is what it's all about
second-year<00:01:23.420> hairpin<00:01:28.180> great<00:01:29.180> traction

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
second-year hairpin great traction

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.360 
second-year hairpin great traction
coming<00:01:29.870> out<00:01:29.930> of<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.140> corner<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:30.920> up<00:01:31.070> through

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
coming out of the corner and up through

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.250 
coming out of the corner and up through
the<00:01:31.430> gears<00:01:31.700> down<00:01:31.880> this<00:01:32.090> straight<00:01:32.420> braking

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
the gears down this straight braking

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:42.460 
the gears down this straight braking
hard<00:01:33.290> into<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:33.979> right-hander<00:01:41.050> I'm<00:01:42.050> not<00:01:42.290> sure<00:01:42.380> I

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
hard into a right-hander I'm not sure I

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:57.230 
hard into a right-hander I'm not sure I
company<00:01:42.800> better<00:01:42.950> than<00:01:43.160> this

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.960 

and<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.439> what<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.799> 458<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.430> about<00:01:59.729> on

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
and so this is what the 458 is about on

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.090 
and so this is what the 458 is about on
the<00:02:00.210> road<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.659> about<00:02:00.930> power<00:02:01.470> and<00:02:01.799> torque

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the road it's about power and torque

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.920 
the road it's about power and torque
surprising<00:02:02.880> amount<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.270> torque<00:02:03.509> given<00:02:03.810> that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
surprising amount of torque given that

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.950 
surprising amount of torque given that
it<00:02:04.020> reps<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.350> 9000<00:02:04.890> rpm<00:02:05.280> it's<00:02:06.180> about<00:02:06.240> precision

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
it reps a 9000 rpm it's about precision

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.999 
it reps a 9000 rpm it's about precision
accuracy<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.420> covering<00:02:09.420> ground<00:02:09.660> as<00:02:09.929> a

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
accuracy and covering ground as a

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.700 
accuracy and covering ground as a
remarkable<00:02:11.009> rate

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.770
