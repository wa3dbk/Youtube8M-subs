00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.490
 that in here 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.130
 from a backpack so that they are not 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.029
 saying that having everything 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.720
 nexus wrote the team that gave him 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.519
 google to the thousands of visitors of the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.750
 past google fair 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.610
 in san francisco which is the nexus that 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.470
 It's a very good question because 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.730
 unquestionably the design is 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.710
 awesome this tour 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.430
 they have after many connectors and here 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.840
 inside let's see what the 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.440
 quick start guide 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.590
 the cable d 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.690
 current together with the team they gave us 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.680
 this cable that came in there in a 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.400
 small card that is from the mini set 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.570
 hdmi and displayport you have to read this in 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.060
 the back part 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.000
 richard we read perfect and now three 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.600
 ways to connect the speaker ports ok 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.920
 for horns and ships is a prototype 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.440
 banana with this is 15 watts rms for 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.180
 optical output that you use for a system 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.300
 of audio and video that you use an output 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.640
 optical and micro hdmi to use a 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.520
 television you use a micro hdmi cable 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.100
 connect it from your android 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.600
 per tablet open the nexus that one can 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.979
 see the installed application from here of the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.979
 play be there is the current 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:53.820
 is the micro hdmi that we are going to connect it 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:56.220
 and that's it if this is the usb cable 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.810
 banana plugs for audio cable 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.170
 network that we're not going to use because it's here 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.270
 wifi and optical cable for everything 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.050
 is the audio for your audio system 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.920
 now this brings us to an exit that is 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.920
 the display ports 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.799
 it's an hdmi I thought it was a display port 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.769
 but we're going to connect this to the 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:20.890
 tele and we see that it comes out in the store in 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:23.650
 google play that is here and not 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.329
 we found the application available in 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.450
 mexico but let's see if we can 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.709
 load the direct to rest ready already 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.400
 we have here the application is called 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.980
 nexus that we work in a lexus 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.280
 phone model nexus and gonzÃ¡lez click 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.879
 good to touch it from where you 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.290
 formspring nexus that is confirmed 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:50.170
 google with google apps wifi ethernet ok 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.150
 ok then if you want do not you feel 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.840
 when the finished sector is off 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.349
 automatically perfect that pledge 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.329
 ok yes turn on the bluetooth that 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:05.680
 nothing more to be already found by 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:09.659
 bluetooth this is the nexus cue ready 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.659

 study already connects is happening 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.670
 by bluetooth it was connected here and 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.400
 he is finishing it he is passing the 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.560
 data as a password of the key white 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.560
 of the language and everything by bluetooth here 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.310
 okay 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.380
 your mind is ready to be used and 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.640
 anyone who connects to your 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.510
 wifi network 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.120
 you can put on TV music or watch 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.580
 videos from youtube com here we are by 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.590
 first time knowing this and what I 'm going 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.540
 to do is that I die and I say that 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.140
 I want to enter the office that is this month 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.810
 that is here and crystal with the number 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.080
 of the brightness the subject that I want that 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.670
 appear in this case the status screen 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.960
 seeing that it is there 1 we are going to put 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.370
 for example a howard that is going to 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.280
 change the subject right now in about 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.740
 seconds I think that here he puts them 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.230
 advance and hdmi is well walk what 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.690
 it's on we can turn off the optics 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.130
 consell what is that already for the cable 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.680
 optical audio connection have it 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.050
 we had put and ready 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.690
 ok we will be here to google play and 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.630
 we go to google playmobil I do not know how to put 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:37.040
 here the transformers and 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.040
 I do not see it conflict 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.530
 we already saw that the video of transformers and 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.300
 everything that will be google play serves us 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.400
 here in mexico but let's watch videos 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.870
 on YouTube and let's put my cousins 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.540
 I say some ladies are called the 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.050
 brain I just give you play here 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.540
 indicates that this link is already connected 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.880
 ski court in this case this machine 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:02.880
 I give him play and automatically what 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.880
 happens is that the reproduction starts there 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.839
 if you want to upload 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.650
 so dj 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:17.050
 and well obviously this is being done 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.930
 our arrival from the internet to this 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.660
 phone and the phone passes 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.699
 I imagine that via wifi here to the team 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.380
 it could be that on the internet it happens 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.419
 directly here that will not be necessary 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.050
 study it very well but good that's 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:35.259
 basically the first function of this one 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:40.050
 what is the nexus that looks like 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:42.669
 enormously to this that will be in functions 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.470
 this already has more content including 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.740
 Mexico is available now you can rent 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:51.039
 movies and buy movies and music 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.349
 see music listen to music the lexus that 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:56.229
 is a bit the google response to 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:58.270
 these streaming or streaming systems 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.500
 content reproduction and I what 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.930
 yes I'm sure it will work well 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.449
 besides this is the music here is 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.699
 this matter of google music in this case 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:08.470
 from google but I have these discs 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:11.039
 uploaded in my part of the cloud not 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.039
 will serve 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:16.750
 yes 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:20.070
 rebellion 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.070
 and automatically 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:27.900
 I want here and send it 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:30.630
 to the box mount more box open to the 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.060
 wait for a link is father display and 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.510
 puts you there 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.730
 and of course a playlist and so on 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.490
 you play and anyone who 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.680
 come with your android download to your house 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.900
 and downloaded this application to the office 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.300
 nexus I was going to use this that is 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.540
 precisely the center of reproduction 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.540
 multimedia 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.780
 to sell or you can not browse 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.370
 internet or not and I understand that still 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.800
 do not 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.210
 is going to stick down, it contained everything 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.430
 There is depends on the content 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.770
 here the secret is not the hardware is 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.389
 part of the secret the most important thing the 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.850
 content that you can see on the screen 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:15.520
 in this play store automatically between 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:19.479
 applications you saw that we use this 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:22.060
 with a phone in the usa and enters 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:24.400
 another type of content automatically 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:27.180
 but here applications like 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.750
 this play movice antv and there it is 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.750
 proven as an option 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:37.050
 when I want to see being so look 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:40.820
 crystal I want to open it with placed now 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.820
 so it's not in our country 

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:47.900
 s 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:49.910
 so oranges that not here is not and is 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.860
 an issue that does not have as much to do 

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.780
 with google are googles of google that 

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.360
 work faster but basically it's 

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:59.270
 the owner of digital rights 

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:01.960
 not so good this is the demo of 

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:04.710
 this is called 

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.710
 nexus 

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.780
 we'll see when I get to Mexico and 

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:12.930
 others and I'm seeing it here for 

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:16.400
 course in matuk puntocom 

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.400
 to a point
