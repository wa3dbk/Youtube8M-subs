00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
new talent to be discovered in this work

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.640 
new talent to be discovered in this work
because<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:36.059> think<00:00:37.550> Brazil<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:38.730> well<00:00:39.589> would<00:00:40.589> be

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
because I think Brazil as well would be

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.680 
because I think Brazil as well would be
a<00:00:40.829> force<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.339> reckon<00:00:41.489> with<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.409> it<00:00:43.409> might<00:00:43.589> be<00:00:43.650> a

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
a force to reckon with so it might be a

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.510 
a force to reckon with so it might be a
great<00:00:45.690> chance<00:00:45.930> now<00:00:46.199> for<00:00:46.230> name<00:00:46.710> artist<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.399> his

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
great chance now for name artist and his

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:56.819 
great chance now for name artist and his
authority<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.300> well<00:00:48.680> so<00:00:49.910> I'm<00:00:50.910> looking<00:00:51.270> forward

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.009 

well<00:00:57.829> I<00:00:57.859> think<00:00:58.010> Germany<00:00:58.940> have<00:00:59.420> always<00:00:59.660> done

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
well I think Germany have always done

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.329 
well I think Germany have always done
well<00:01:00.289> in<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.649> World<00:01:00.860> Cup<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.280> I<00:01:02.239> think<00:01:03.339> the

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
well in the World Cup and I think the

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.359 
well in the World Cup and I think the
underground<00:01:05.000> work<00:01:05.269> that<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.810> pudding<00:01:06.409> in<00:01:07.250> the

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
underground work that the pudding in the

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.870 
underground work that the pudding in the
past<00:01:07.810> 10<00:01:08.810> to<00:01:08.840> 12<00:01:09.290> years<00:01:09.590> are<00:01:09.799> paying<00:01:10.310> dividends

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
past 10 to 12 years are paying dividends

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.780 
past 10 to 12 years are paying dividends
now<00:01:11.210> so<00:01:11.920> there<00:01:12.920> will<00:01:13.009> be<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.220> force<00:01:13.580> to<00:01:13.640> reckon

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
now so there will be a force to reckon

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.859 
now so there will be a force to reckon
with<00:01:14.149> and<00:01:14.600> of<00:01:15.320> course<00:01:16.600> players<00:01:17.600> like<00:01:18.130> will

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
with and of course players like will

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.950 
with and of course players like will
also<00:01:21.729> stay<00:01:22.729> there<00:01:22.970> and<00:01:23.090> now<00:01:23.270> there<00:01:23.539> are<00:01:23.630> even

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
also stay there and now there are even

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.630 
also stay there and now there are even
more<00:01:24.229> experience<00:01:24.860> so<00:01:25.250> I<00:01:26.119> think<00:01:27.280> they<00:01:28.280> are<00:01:28.430> one

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
more experience so I think they are one

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.090 
more experience so I think they are one
of<00:01:28.789> my<00:01:29.420> favorites

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.580 

well<00:01:36.100> I<00:01:36.130> think<00:01:36.580> personally<00:01:37.360> I've<00:01:37.480> got<00:01:37.720> bad

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
well I think personally I've got bad

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.070 
well I think personally I've got bad
memories<00:01:39.130> I<00:01:39.160> have

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
memories I have

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.140 
memories I have
Argentina<00:01:42.010> because<00:01:42.370> I've<00:01:42.550> played<00:01:42.670> them<00:01:42.880> twice

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
Argentina because I've played them twice

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.720 
Argentina because I've played them twice
and<00:01:43.660> the<00:01:43.870> World<00:01:44.080> Cup<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.920> we<00:01:45.130> lost<00:01:45.430> the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
and the World Cup and and we lost the

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.580 
and the World Cup and and we lost the
window<00:01:48.120> narrow<00:01:49.120> defeat<00:01:49.570> you<00:01:50.080> know<00:01:50.230> it's<00:01:50.410> not

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
window narrow defeat you know it's not

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.450 
window narrow defeat you know it's not
always<00:01:51.550> good<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:52.390> lose<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:55.560> I'm<00:01:56.560> also<00:01:56.800> in<00:01:57.040> a<00:01:57.220> way

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
always good to lose so I'm also in a way

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.070 
always good to lose so I'm also in a way
might<00:01:57.940> be<00:01:58.350> another<00:01:59.350> chance<00:01:59.680> for<00:01:59.830> us<00:02:00.190> to<00:02:01.050> get<00:02:02.050> a

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
might be another chance for us to get a

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.860 
might be another chance for us to get a
revenge<00:02:02.560> you<00:02:03.040> know<00:02:03.280> but<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.180> good<00:02:04.420> news<00:02:04.450> is

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
revenge you know but the good news is

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.790 
revenge you know but the good news is
that<00:02:04.900> we<00:02:05.200> have<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.560> play<00:02:05.830> to<00:02:06.820> other<00:02:07.030> weaker

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
that we have to play to other weaker

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.800 
that we have to play to other weaker
so-called<00:02:08.800> weaker<00:02:09.220> teams<00:02:09.580> in<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.240> group<00:02:10.420> or

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
so-called weaker teams in the group or

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.630 
so-called weaker teams in the group or
weaker<00:02:11.290> countries<00:02:11.500> in<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:11.980> group<00:02:12.250> before

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
weaker countries in the group before

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.560 
weaker countries in the group before
until<00:02:13.090> not<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.480> by<00:02:14.140> that<00:02:14.350> time<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.770> think<00:02:14.830> our

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
until not so by that time I think our

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.790 
until not so by that time I think our
first<00:02:16.570> faith<00:02:17.170> must<00:02:17.500> have<00:02:17.709> been<00:02:17.920> decided

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.670 

well<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.880> don't<00:02:24.030> know<00:02:24.420> how<00:02:24.690> Nigeria<00:02:25.230> can<00:02:25.410> stop

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
well I I don't know how Nigeria can stop

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.500 
well I I don't know how Nigeria can stop
massive<00:02:26.220> what<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.700> think<00:02:29.030> we<00:02:30.030> should<00:02:30.060> focus

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
massive what I think we should focus

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.760 
massive what I think we should focus
more<00:02:30.750> on<00:02:31.580> our<00:02:32.580> game<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.150> know<00:02:33.540> if<00:02:33.690> we<00:02:33.870> can<00:02:34.530> get

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
more on our game you know if we can get

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.620 
more on our game you know if we can get
a<00:02:36.890> good<00:02:37.890> game<00:02:38.160> plan<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.850> know<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.120> stick<00:02:39.450> to

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
a good game plan you know and stick to

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.070 
a good game plan you know and stick to
it

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
it

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.850 
it
I<00:02:40.110> think<00:02:41.450> we'll<00:02:42.450> do<00:02:42.720> well<00:02:42.750> because<00:02:43.260> we've

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
I think we'll do well because we've

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.590 
I think we'll do well because we've
played<00:02:44.070> against<00:02:44.490> him<00:02:44.670> before<00:02:44.880> during<00:02:45.480> the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
played against him before during the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.210 
played against him before during the
last<00:02:46.170> World<00:02:46.440> Cup<00:02:46.790> Argentina<00:02:48.950> was<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.100> our

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
last World Cup Argentina was in our

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.130 
last World Cup Argentina was in our
group<00:02:50.520> you<00:02:50.760> know<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.270> think<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.600> boys<00:02:51.840> did

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
group you know and I think the boys did

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.910 
group you know and I think the boys did
a<00:02:52.170> good<00:02:52.440> job<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:53.390> we<00:02:54.390> always<00:02:54.570> come<00:02:55.500> up<00:02:55.530> with<00:02:55.680> a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
a good job so we always come up with a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.010 
a good job so we always come up with a
plan<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.280> stop<00:02:56.520> import<00:02:57.210> first<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.720> all<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.960> think

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
plan to stop import first of all I think

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.000 
plan to stop import first of all I think
the<00:02:58.830> main<00:02:59.070> team<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.520> as<00:02:59.760> a<00:03:00.300> group<00:03:00.600> we<00:03:01.050> should<00:03:01.320> be

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
the main team is as a group we should be

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.910 
the main team is as a group we should be
able<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.810> come<00:03:03.810> up<00:03:03.930> with<00:03:04.110> a<00:03:04.140> game<00:03:04.410> plan<00:03:04.470> on<00:03:04.860> how

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
able to come up with a game plan on how

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.730 
able to come up with a game plan on how
to<00:03:05.100> win<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:05.610> game<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:06.030> not<00:03:06.380> focus<00:03:07.380> on<00:03:07.500> just

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
to win the game and not focus on just

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.290 
to win the game and not focus on just
one<00:03:07.980> player<00:03:08.220> because<00:03:08.580> they've<00:03:08.760> got<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> lot<00:03:09.270> of

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
one player because they've got a lot of

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.500 
one player because they've got a lot of
talented<00:03:10.260> players<00:03:10.470> also

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.350

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
I think Nigeria qualifying for the next

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.670 
I think Nigeria qualifying for the next
World<00:03:20.569> Cup<00:03:20.659> means<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.890> great<00:03:22.400> deal<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.879> us

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680
