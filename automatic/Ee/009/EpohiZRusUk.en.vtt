00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:04.540 
okay so I tack welded that initial piece

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.220 
okay so I tack welded that initial piece
then<00:00:04.839> you<00:00:05.230> can<00:00:05.410> see<00:00:05.620> there<00:00:05.999> then<00:00:06.999> I<00:00:07.299> put<00:00:08.200> my

then you can see there then I put my
string<00:00:08.800> down<00:00:09.340> here<00:00:09.760> I<00:00:10.380> found<00:00:11.380> my<00:00:12.370> angle<00:00:12.820> okay<00:00:13.780> I

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
string down here I found my angle okay I

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.800 
string down here I found my angle okay I
put<00:00:14.440> a<00:00:14.500> piece<00:00:14.650> of<00:00:14.680> tin<00:00:14.950> on<00:00:14.980> this<00:00:15.280> pin<00:00:15.520> because<00:00:15.810> I

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
put a piece of tin on this pin because I

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.390 
put a piece of tin on this pin because I
really<00:00:17.350> don't<00:00:17.470> want<00:00:17.710> to<00:00:17.770> start<00:00:17.980> cooking<00:00:18.130> that

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
really don't want to start cooking that

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.890 
really don't want to start cooking that
epoxy<00:00:18.760> that<00:00:19.120> I<00:00:19.150> epoxy<00:00:19.720> that<00:00:19.930> rod<00:00:20.200> on<00:00:20.500> with<00:00:20.820> so

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
epoxy that I epoxy that rod on with so

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.810 
epoxy that I epoxy that rod on with so
anyway<00:00:23.730> I'm<00:00:24.730> sending<00:00:25.240> it<00:00:25.330> on<00:00:25.420> my<00:00:25.600> Center<00:00:25.960> mark

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
anyway I'm sending it on my Center mark

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.990 
anyway I'm sending it on my Center mark
okay

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
okay

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.930 
okay
I<00:00:28.560> took<00:00:29.560> my<00:00:29.949> angle<00:00:30.310> finder<00:00:31.679> see<00:00:32.679> right<00:00:33.609> on<00:00:33.760> that

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
I took my angle finder see right on that

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.349 
I took my angle finder see right on that
center<00:00:34.149> that<00:00:34.359> nail<00:00:34.749> look<00:00:36.120> see<00:00:37.120> that<00:00:37.300> pin<00:00:37.569> boom

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:39.359 
center that nail look see that pin boom

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:45.180 
center that nail look see that pin boom
and<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:43.239> is<00:00:43.390> the<00:00:43.510> heart<00:00:43.719> of<00:00:43.809> 1/2<00:00:44.199> the<00:00:44.769> edge<00:00:44.920> of

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
and this is the heart of 1/2 the edge of

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.809 
and this is the heart of 1/2 the edge of
this<00:00:45.309> has<00:00:45.639> to<00:00:45.819> be<00:00:45.909> the<00:00:46.059> center<00:00:46.359> of<00:00:46.629> this<00:00:46.719> pipe

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:47.819 
this has to be the center of this pipe

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:55.910 
this has to be the center of this pipe
okay<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.530> you<00:00:51.460> can<00:00:51.639> see<00:00:51.670> I<00:00:52.829> marked<00:00:53.829> this<00:00:54.760> piece

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
okay so you can see I marked this piece

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.410 
okay so you can see I marked this piece
okay<00:00:56.920> this<00:00:57.760> is<00:00:57.940> cut<00:00:58.239> on<00:00:58.449> the<00:00:58.629> disk<00:00:58.839> sander<00:00:59.019> flat

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
okay this is cut on the disk sander flat

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.149 
okay this is cut on the disk sander flat
well<00:01:01.420> then<00:01:01.780> that's<00:01:02.019> that's<00:01:02.469> all<00:01:02.649> I<00:01:02.679> start

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
well then that's that's all I start

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.569 
well then that's that's all I start
remember<00:01:03.459> I<00:01:03.489> want<00:01:03.819> to<00:01:03.909> be<00:01:03.999> 90%<00:01:04.809> there<00:01:05.310> so<00:01:06.310> once

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:06.579 
remember I want to be 90% there so once

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:11.340 
remember I want to be 90% there so once
I<00:01:06.759> lay<00:01:06.939> it<00:01:07.090> in<00:01:07.860> no<00:01:09.719> after<00:01:10.719> you<00:01:10.810> do<00:01:10.960> this<00:01:11.110> while

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
I lay it in no after you do this while

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.080 
I lay it in no after you do this while
you<00:01:11.530> don't<00:01:11.890> even<00:01:12.070> need<00:01:12.159> to<00:01:12.219> mark<00:01:12.520> it<00:01:12.729> because

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
you don't even need to mark it because

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.840 
you don't even need to mark it because
you<00:01:13.689> know<00:01:14.020> that<00:01:14.079> there's<00:01:14.469> just<00:01:14.710> an<00:01:14.829> arc<00:01:15.100> right

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
you know that there's just an arc right

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.660 
you know that there's just an arc right
well<00:01:16.479> you<00:01:16.570> can<00:01:16.750> take<00:01:16.930> your<00:01:17.109> your<00:01:17.979> marker<00:01:18.460> and

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
well you can take your your marker and

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.859 
well you can take your your marker and
draw<00:01:19.509> a<00:01:19.630> little<00:01:19.810> arc<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:21.340> I<00:01:21.549> basically<00:01:22.090> well

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
draw a little arc but I basically well

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:23.789 
draw a little arc but I basically well
heck<00:01:23.079> let's<00:01:23.320> just<00:01:23.500> do<00:01:23.649> it

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
heck let's just do it

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:30.270 
heck let's just do it
I<00:01:25.289> basically<00:01:26.289> take<00:01:26.560> this<00:01:26.799> disc<00:01:27.100> sander<00:01:29.280> okay

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
I basically take this disc sander okay

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:46.140 
I basically take this disc sander okay
which<00:01:31.149> I<00:01:31.299> do<00:01:31.359> this<00:01:31.509> in<00:01:31.659> one<00:01:31.840> hand

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.590 

tubes<00:01:47.150> are<00:01:47.300> round<00:01:47.510> not<00:01:48.370> not<00:01:49.370> glad<00:01:50.150> of<00:01:50.360> course

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
tubes are round not not glad of course

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.070 
tubes are round not not glad of course
so<00:01:51.880> now<00:01:52.880> there's<00:01:53.120> another<00:01:53.300> operation<00:01:53.870> I<00:01:53.930> have

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
so now there's another operation I have

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.950 
so now there's another operation I have
to<00:01:54.200> do<00:01:54.320> yet<00:01:54.530> remember<00:01:55.400> there's<00:01:55.730> two<00:01:55.940> curves<00:01:56.300> on

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
to do yet remember there's two curves on

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.520 
to do yet remember there's two curves on
a<00:01:56.990> circle<00:01:57.470> so<00:01:57.680> you<00:01:58.280> can<00:01:58.490> see<00:01:58.880> I'm<00:01:59.530> slowly

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
a circle so you can see I'm slowly

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.170 
a circle so you can see I'm slowly
closing<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.550> I'm<00:02:01.700> making<00:02:01.970> some<00:02:02.150> progress

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
closing and I'm making some progress

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.120 
closing and I'm making some progress
okay<00:02:03.250> so<00:02:04.250> my<00:02:04.520> arc<00:02:05.500> needs<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.650> be<00:02:06.740> a<00:02:06.770> tighter

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
okay so my arc needs to be a tighter

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.500 
okay so my arc needs to be a tighter
radius<00:02:07.760> no<00:02:08.540> problem<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.260> got<00:02:09.890> extra<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:10.640> cut<00:02:11.390> it

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
radius no problem I got extra I cut it

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.410 
radius no problem I got extra I cut it
long<00:02:11.630> okay<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.320> want<00:02:13.070> this<00:02:13.280> really<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.270> be<00:02:14.390> a

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
long okay I want this really to be a

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.770 
long okay I want this really to be a
nice<00:02:14.630> looking<00:02:14.930> fitting<00:02:15.320> so<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:16.450> created<00:02:17.450> an<00:02:17.570> arc

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
nice looking fitting so I created an arc

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.910 
nice looking fitting so I created an arc
here<00:02:18.550> but<00:02:19.550> when<00:02:19.700> I'm<00:02:19.850> done<00:02:20.230> I'm<00:02:21.230> gonna<00:02:21.410> have<00:02:21.710> to

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
here but when I'm done I'm gonna have to

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.330 
here but when I'm done I'm gonna have to
take<00:02:22.160> this<00:02:22.460> piece<00:02:23.420> cut<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.440> radius<00:02:24.920> here<00:02:25.880> and

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
take this piece cut a radius here and

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.850 
take this piece cut a radius here and
here<00:02:28.340> on<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.730> tip<00:02:29.230> because<00:02:30.230> it's<00:02:30.890> it's<00:02:32.680> why<00:02:33.680> is

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
here on the tip because it's it's why is

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.550 
here on the tip because it's it's why is
this<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.220> hard<00:02:34.340> with<00:02:34.640> one<00:02:34.670> half<00:02:35.000> right<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:36.290> sits

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
this so hard with one half right it sits

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.860 
this so hard with one half right it sits
on<00:02:36.710> here<00:02:37.010> so<00:02:37.340> obviously<00:02:38.030> that's<00:02:38.270> not<00:02:38.390> flat

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
on here so obviously that's not flat

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.200 
on here so obviously that's not flat
that<00:02:39.170> edge<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.980> that's<00:02:40.670> what<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:40.970> hand

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
that edge and that's what that hand

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.900 
that edge and that's what that hand
grinders<00:02:41.660> for<00:02:42.020> so<00:02:42.770> I<00:02:42.800> create<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.340> arc<00:02:43.550> on<00:02:43.880> the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
grinders for so I create the arc on the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.510 
grinders for so I create the arc on the
outside<00:02:44.390> with<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.020> disc<00:02:45.230> sander<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:45.800> then<00:02:46.430> I

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
outside with the disc sander and then I

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.690 
outside with the disc sander and then I
touch<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.210> inside<00:02:47.920> with<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:48.950> Griner<00:02:49.340> and

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
touch the inside with the Griner and

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.030 
touch the inside with the Griner and
it's<00:02:49.850> done
