three<00:01:49.680> weeks<00:01:49.860> he<00:01:50.250> should<00:01:50.760> be<00:01:51.090> back<00:01:51.270> to

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
was really rough and it was hard on his

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.960 
was really rough and it was hard on his

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
should deal with the heat but it's all

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.289 
should deal with the heat but it's all
about<00:02:03.860> learning<00:02:04.100> how<00:02:04.369> my<00:02:04.520> body<00:02:04.729> reacts<00:02:05.150> on
