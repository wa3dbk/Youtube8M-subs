00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.380
 welcome friends this channel tuning body 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.480
 and your coach Denis eyes and today I 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.370
 I would like to tell you about three mistakes 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.210
 which people allow during 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.699
 slimming 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.100
 the first mistake is that everyone wants to lose weight 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.130
 quickly and try to find some super 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.470
 pills super supplements super fat burners 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.140
 tea and coffee slimming bar for 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.410
 losing weight and thinking that now I drink 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.860
 pills drink coffee do nothing 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.140
 I will be losing weight but it is not it is not 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.020
 it works all that you show on 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.149
 TV and advertises on the Internet is 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.620
 just a marketing ploy for 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.129
 to get as much out of you 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.500
 money is not work-work right 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.640
 food and works well built 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.230
 training program 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.770
 training program you can 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.420
 look at my channel I wrote it down 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.820
 the second is that people start to resort 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.859
 some kind of extreme diets which 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.729
 finds on the internet something like 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.830
 eat one apple to 5 half a cup of coffee 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.270
 in the evening eat three gum and you will 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.140
 happiness and you lose weight 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.420
 again this scheme does not work 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.460
 our body is a very delicate thing and 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.950
 so that he began to give away subcutaneous fat and 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.350
 I need to set it up again 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.869
 done by proper nutrition and good and 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.250
 country training programs 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.920
 case if you start resorting to 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.880
 this kind of diets the body is experiencing 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.740
 big stress 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.110
 he starts thinking something is happening 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.720
 not so you probably don't have enough money 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.479
 on food or something else and he starts 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.310
 multi marina put off subcutaneous fat 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.300
 even from this one apple 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.830
 and the layer ceases to spend therefore not 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.930
 This scheme works 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.500
 I assure you and the third people who want 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.390
 lose weight 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.970
 begin to exclude strength training 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.679
 their programs start to run a lot 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.539
 start a new bike ride 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.399
 maybe starting to eat right 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.190
 think they will lose weight 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.700
 they lose weight but not quite so than 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.940
 wanted to 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.800
 because no one wants to lose weight 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.630
 muscles and leave subcutaneous fat and all 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.560
 happens just like that I will bring small 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:20.540
 example for example, guests come to you 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:22.040
 live in your day live in your 234 week 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.560
 eat at your expense 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.049
 but do nothing to do with 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.950
 these guests of course you expel them 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:33.400
 the same thing happens and muscle and 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.500
 if you are only running it will involve 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.810
 at least the number of muscles does not work 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.209
 large mouse groups do not work pectoral 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.300
 back doesn't work i'm working but by 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.849
 minimum so the body starts 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.650
 eat these muscles he doesn't need these 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.569
 unnecessary guests who need to constantly 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.790
 feed and that do nothing 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.569
 so he tries his best 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.900
 leave subcutaneous fat and eat your 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.000
 muscles therefore exercise correctly 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.790
 do power loads don't believe in any 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.290
 what super drugs and super diets and 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.970
 everything will be fine 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.860
 about the training program you can 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.560
 look I wrote down on this 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.780
 video so if you liked it 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.670
