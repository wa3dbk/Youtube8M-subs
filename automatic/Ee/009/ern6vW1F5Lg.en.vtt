00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.639

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
leaves of this and typically I would

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.750 
leaves of this and typically I would
take<00:00:43.510> off<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:44.020> stems<00:00:44.519> because<00:00:45.519> they're<00:00:45.730> a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
take off the stems because they're a

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.549 
take off the stems because they're a
little<00:00:45.910> bit<00:00:46.059> fibrous<00:00:46.690> but<00:00:46.929> you<00:00:47.109> can<00:00:47.260> leave<00:00:47.410> on

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.459 
little bit fibrous but you can leave on
a<00:00:47.590> little<00:00:47.890> bit<00:00:48.039> of<00:00:48.160> stem<00:00:48.370> if<00:00:48.519> you<00:00:48.640> want<00:00:48.850> and<00:00:49.469> you

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
a little bit of stem if you want and you

a little bit of stem if you want and you
can<00:00:50.620> see<00:00:50.769> here<00:00:50.949> I'm<00:00:51.039> actually<00:00:51.309> developing<00:00:51.640> a

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
can see here I'm actually developing a

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.189 
can see here I'm actually developing a
salad<00:00:52.570> as<00:00:52.780> we<00:00:53.019> go<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:55.600> through<00:00:55.750> a<00:00:55.780> few<00:00:56.050> in

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
salad as we go just through a few in

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.900 
salad as we go just through a few in
here<00:00:56.500> now<00:00:56.649> this<00:00:56.769> is<00:00:56.949> a<00:00:56.980> mild<00:00:57.249> green<00:00:57.489> it's<00:00:57.850> not

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
here now this is a mild green it's not

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.139 
here now this is a mild green it's not
bitter<00:00:58.269> it's<00:00:58.690> not<00:00:58.899> sour<00:00:59.230> it's<00:01:00.160> not<00:01:00.339> pungent<00:01:00.879> in

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
bitter it's not sour it's not pungent in

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.350 
bitter it's not sour it's not pungent in
any<00:01:01.390> way<00:01:01.660> so<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:03.370> will<00:01:03.519> give<00:01:03.670> us<00:01:03.699> a<00:01:03.909> good<00:01:04.059> base

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
any way so this will give us a good base

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.450 
any way so this will give us a good base
for<00:01:04.989> a<00:01:05.019> salad<00:01:05.440> and<00:01:05.650> you<00:01:05.770> know<00:01:05.890> so<00:01:06.070> many<00:01:06.190> of<00:01:06.370> us

mustards which have a pungent flavor if

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.539 
mustards which have a pungent flavor if
you<00:03:29.450> can<00:03:29.629> hold<00:03:29.720> this<00:03:29.900> again<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.440> then<00:03:31.400> we've

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
you can hold this again and then we've

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.720 
you can hold this again and then we've

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
they look like you could buy them in a

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:39.429 
they look like you could buy them in a
supermarket

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:39.439 
supermarket

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.439 
supermarket
and<00:04:39.559> we're<00:04:40.219> actually<00:04:40.309> not<00:04:40.639> even<00:04:40.939> going<00:04:41.239> to<00:04:41.300> use

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
and we're actually not even going to use

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:42.850 
and we're actually not even going to use
this<00:04:41.659> much<00:04:41.899> because<00:04:42.110> we're<00:04:42.259> only<00:04:42.319> making<00:04:42.529> one

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
this much because we're only making one

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.159 
this much because we're only making one
small<00:04:43.189> salad<00:04:43.550> I'll<00:04:44.239> probably<00:04:44.539> just<00:04:44.959> use<00:04:45.050> a

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
small salad I'll probably just use a

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.040 
small salad I'll probably just use a
couple<00:04:45.559> of<00:04:45.649> leaves<00:04:45.830> worth<00:04:46.189> and<00:04:46.749> we'll<00:04:47.749> chop

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
couple of leaves worth and we'll chop

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.589 
couple of leaves worth and we'll chop
these<00:04:48.289> up<00:04:48.619> and<00:04:48.889> make<00:04:49.429> small<00:04:49.759> pieces<00:04:49.999> out<00:04:50.360> of<00:04:50.389> it

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
these up and make small pieces out of it

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:52.570 
these up and make small pieces out of it
because<00:04:51.110> you<00:04:51.379> don't<00:04:51.529> want<00:04:51.679> too<00:04:51.949> much<00:04:52.189> bitter

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580

what<00:05:02.059> is<00:05:02.149> this<00:05:02.269> this<00:05:02.569> step<00:05:02.779> you're<00:05:02.929> doing<00:05:03.110> now

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
what is this this step you're doing now

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.439 
what is this this step you're doing now
well<00:05:03.860> we're<00:05:04.219> taking<00:05:04.369> dandelions<00:05:05.119> which<00:05:05.239> are<00:05:05.419> a

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
well we're taking dandelions which are a

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.019 
well we're taking dandelions which are a
bitter<00:05:05.929> green<00:05:06.019> in<00:05:06.679> the<00:05:07.249> raw<00:05:07.429> form<00:05:07.849> at<00:05:07.999> least

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:08.029 
bitter green in the raw form at least

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:10.899 
bitter green in the raw form at least
and<00:05:08.539> we're<00:05:09.439> chopping<00:05:09.949> it<00:05:10.279> into<00:05:10.399> smaller

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:10.909 
and we're chopping it into smaller

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.299 
and we're chopping it into smaller
pieces<00:05:11.409> because<00:05:12.409> we<00:05:12.439> don't<00:05:12.739> want<00:05:13.039> it<00:05:13.189> to

00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:13.309 
pieces because we don't want it to

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:15.279 
pieces because we don't want it to
overpower<00:05:13.639> the<00:05:14.119> salad<00:05:14.629> so<00:05:14.809> I'm<00:05:14.899> going<00:05:15.050> to<00:05:15.079> add

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
overpower the salad so I'm going to add

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.929 
overpower the salad so I'm going to add
this<00:05:15.669> to<00:05:16.669> the<00:05:17.389> salad<00:05:17.869> sort<00:05:18.110> of<00:05:18.199> like<00:05:18.349> a<00:05:18.379> spice

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:18.939 
this to the salad sort of like a spice

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:22.269 
this to the salad sort of like a spice
so<00:05:19.939> now<00:05:20.119> I<00:05:20.509> think<00:05:20.569> we'll<00:05:21.499> just<00:05:21.709> add<00:05:21.889> a<00:05:21.949> little

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:22.279 
so now I think we'll just add a little

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:25.059 
so now I think we'll just add a little
bit<00:05:22.429> of<00:05:22.610> garnish<00:05:22.879> here<00:05:23.449> just<00:05:24.439> to<00:05:24.589> add<00:05:24.739> some

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:25.069

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:27.769 
color to the cell this is the wild

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:29.709 
color to the cell this is the wild
mustard<00:05:28.129> flowers<00:05:28.669> that<00:05:28.969> we<00:05:29.089> were<00:05:29.209> looking<00:05:29.389> at
