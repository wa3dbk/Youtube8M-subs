00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
too bad and there's the other side with

too bad and there's the other side with
the<00:02:52.319> Gatling<00:02:52.920> gun<00:02:52.950> right<00:02:53.700> there<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.530> they<00:02:55.530> are

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
the Gatling gun right there and they are

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.100 
the Gatling gun right there and they are
compatible<00:02:57.569> with<00:02:57.870> Lego<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:59.569> the<00:03:00.569> plastic

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
compatible with Lego and the plastic

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.970 
compatible with Lego and the plastic
almost<00:03:01.500> feels<00:03:01.739> like<00:03:03.560> Mega<00:03:04.560> Bloks<00:03:06.830> and<00:03:07.830> that's

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
almost feels like Mega Bloks and that's

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.600 
almost feels like Mega Bloks and that's
what<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.310> side<00:03:08.520> looks<00:03:08.820> like

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
what the side looks like

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.500 
what the side looks like
right<00:03:11.390> there<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:12.620> it<00:03:13.370> has<00:03:13.490> landing<00:03:14.000> gear<00:03:14.210> and

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
right there and it has landing gear and

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.290 
right there and it has landing gear and
the<00:03:14.660> landing<00:03:15.020> gear<00:03:15.080> kind<00:03:15.470> of<00:03:15.590> looks<00:03:15.740> like

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
the landing gear kind of looks like

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.170 
the landing gear kind of looks like
Playmobil<00:03:18.730> landing<00:03:19.730> gear<00:03:22.030> nothing<00:03:23.030> too

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
Playmobil landing gear nothing too

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.000 
Playmobil landing gear nothing too
spectacular<00:03:23.450> but<00:03:26.590> that's<00:03:27.590> what<00:03:27.770> it<00:03:27.830> looks

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
spectacular but that's what it looks

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.990 
spectacular but that's what it looks
like<00:03:28.190> right<00:03:28.430> there

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
like right there

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.300 
like right there
and<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:30.500> has<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.890> little<00:03:31.130> engines<00:03:31.550> just<00:03:31.880> like

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
and it has the little engines just like

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:43.540 
and it has the little engines just like
the<00:03:34.310> a-10<00:03:34.760> would<00:03:34.940> have<00:03:37.000> right<00:03:38.000> there<00:03:42.280> this<00:03:43.280> is

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
the a-10 would have right there this is

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.780 
the a-10 would have right there this is
really<00:03:43.880> big<00:03:44.240> airplane<00:03:45.220> know<00:03:47.110> and<00:03:48.110> they<00:03:48.230> just

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
really big airplane know and they just

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.650 
really big airplane know and they just
accidentally<00:03:49.790> bumped<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.630> engine<00:03:50.959> oops<00:03:52.660> and

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
accidentally bumped the engine oops and

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.050 
accidentally bumped the engine oops and
that's<00:03:53.810> what<00:03:53.990> looks<00:03:54.110> like<00:03:54.230> on<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.620> back<00:03:55.060> and

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
that's what looks like on the back and

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.670 
that's what looks like on the back and
the<00:03:56.990> top<00:03:57.790> it's<00:03:58.790> really<00:03:58.850> hard<00:03:59.240> to<00:03:59.470> hold<00:04:00.470> this

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
the top it's really hard to hold this

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.310 
the top it's really hard to hold this
thing<00:04:00.740> it's<00:04:01.190> so<00:04:01.310> huge

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
thing it's so huge

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.250 
thing it's so huge
that's<00:04:03.320> the<00:04:03.470> back<00:04:03.709> of<00:04:03.740> it<00:04:04.570> basically<00:04:05.570> it<00:04:06.050> looks

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
that's the back of it basically it looks

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.100 
that's the back of it basically it looks
similar<00:04:06.920> to<00:04:07.220> Legos<00:04:07.400> but<00:04:07.820> it's<00:04:07.970> not<00:04:08.209> and<00:04:08.600> the

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
similar to Legos but it's not and the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.990 
similar to Legos but it's not and the
reason<00:04:09.380> why<00:04:09.500> there's<00:04:09.740> so<00:04:09.950> many<00:04:10.100> pieces<00:04:10.490> like

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
reason why there's so many pieces like

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.540 
reason why there's so many pieces like
right<00:04:11.270> here<00:04:11.660> is<00:04:12.530> because<00:04:12.800> you<00:04:13.100> can<00:04:13.250> make<00:04:13.400> it

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
right here is because you can make it

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.890 
right here is because you can make it
into<00:04:13.790> ten<00:04:14.150> drift<00:04:14.390> ten<00:04:15.080> different<00:04:16.359> modes<00:04:18.040> and

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
into ten drift ten different modes and

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.150 
into ten drift ten different modes and
I'll<00:04:20.900> show<00:04:21.140> you<00:04:21.200> the<00:04:21.410> bottom<00:04:21.769> of<00:04:21.890> it<00:04:22.010> real

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
I'll show you the bottom of it real

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.450 
I'll show you the bottom of it real
quick

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
quick

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.440 
quick
they<00:04:25.460> look<00:04:25.700> like<00:04:25.880> Legos<00:04:26.390> but<00:04:26.660> they're<00:04:26.870> not

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
they look like Legos but they're not

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.740 
they look like Legos but they're not
right<00:04:29.450> there
