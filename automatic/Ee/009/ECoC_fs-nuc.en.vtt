was making this rather complex fish dish
so<00:03:08.859> I<00:03:08.890> thought<00:03:09.129> we<00:03:09.220> should<00:03:09.280> have<00:03:09.430> some<00:03:09.579> very

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.140 
so I thought we should have some very
simple<00:03:10.510> little<00:03:11.170> salad<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.590> go<00:03:11.829> with<00:03:11.859> it<00:03:12.159> with

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150

sweet onions radishes and avocado and

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.539 

well<00:03:32.500> maybe<00:03:32.709> we<00:03:32.859> should<00:03:33.010> just<00:03:33.099> go<00:03:33.340> right<00:03:33.489> to

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549
