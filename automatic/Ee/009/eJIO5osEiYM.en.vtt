of<00:00:04.799> my<00:00:04.920> opponents<00:00:05.400> played<00:00:06.080> c5<00:00:07.080> immediately<00:00:07.710> so

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
of my opponents played c5 immediately so

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.640 
of my opponents played c5 immediately so
we<00:00:08.460> got<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.910> same<00:00:09.150> position<00:00:09.630> so<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.440> got

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
we got the same position so I got

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.290 
we got the same position so I got
against<00:00:10.950> Jones<00:00:11.219> by<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.460> slightly<00:00:12.090> different

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
against Jones by a slightly different

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.560 
against Jones by a slightly different
move<00:00:12.660> order<00:00:12.990> they<00:00:13.769> should<00:00:13.920> do<00:00:14.099> 792<00:00:15.000> castles

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.769 
move order they should do 792 castles
castles<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.350> now<00:00:16.770> c5<00:00:17.520> but<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.270> problem<00:00:18.660> with

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
castles and now c5 but the problem with

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.439 
castles and now c5 but the problem with
this<00:00:18.930> move<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.890> white<00:00:20.130> can<00:00:20.490> take<00:00:20.789> on<00:00:21.000> c5

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
this move is that white can take on c5

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.450 
this move is that white can take on c5
and<00:00:21.840> now<00:00:22.260> black<00:00:22.500> has<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.859> take<00:00:23.039> with<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.279> D

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
and now black has to take with the D

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.240 
and now black has to take with the D
pawn<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:24.960> turn<00:00:25.199> means<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:26.010> e

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
pawn and this in turn means that this e

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.130 
pawn and this in turn means that this e
for<00:00:26.640> pawn<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.680> free<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.859> advance<00:00:29.689> okay<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:30.929> I

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
for pawn is free to advance okay so I

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.080 
for pawn is free to advance okay so I
played<00:00:31.410> 'if<00:00:31.710> I've<00:00:31.980> driving<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.610> night<00:00:32.730> away

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
pawn with f4 and black probably did the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.139 
pawn with f4 and black probably did the
best<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.620> he<00:00:40.770> could<00:00:40.920> do<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.670> undermining

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149

this ePHI pawn straight away is the best
chance<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.250> should<00:00:47.309> imagine<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> don't

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719

particularly<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:49.350> Blacks<00:00:49.829> game<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.399> I

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
particularly like Blacks game here I

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.510 
particularly like Blacks game here I
have<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.760> say<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.860> drove<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.010> knight<00:00:53.160> back<00:00:53.370> with

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
have to say I drove the knight back with

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.840 
have to say I drove the knight back with
h3<00:00:54.000> he<00:00:54.809> went<00:00:55.020> Knight<00:00:55.289> h6<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.280> took<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.000> f6<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.850> he

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
took back with the pawn and now I played

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.200 
took back with the pawn and now I played
Knight<00:01:02.460> bc3<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.920> it<00:01:04.920> could<00:01:05.220> be<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.670> blacks
