this is I've got this new LTT monitor

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.550 
this is I've got this new LTT monitor
sitting<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:27.930> front<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.230> me

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
sitting in front of me

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.620 
sitting in front of me
it<00:00:28.740> only<00:00:29.010> has<00:00:29.310> my<00:00:29.730> guitar<00:00:30.060> going<00:00:30.330> through<00:00:30.539> it

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
it only has my guitar going through it

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.260 
it only has my guitar going through it
so<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.439> get<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.740> feedback<00:00:32.270> interaction

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
so I can get that feedback interaction

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.030 
so I can get that feedback interaction
between<00:00:33.390> speaker<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.500> guitar<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:35.010> you

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
between speaker and guitar that you

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.560 
between speaker and guitar that you
normally<00:00:35.250> wouldn't<00:00:35.640> get<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:36.059> using<00:00:36.420> these

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
normally wouldn't get just using these

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.959 
normally wouldn't get just using these
and<00:00:36.930> I've<00:00:37.710> just<00:00:37.890> incorporated<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.790> love

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
and I've just incorporated this I love

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.340 
and I've just incorporated this I love
it<00:00:39.120> because<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.570> gives<00:00:39.660> me<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.840> sustain

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
it because it gives me the sustain

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.900 
it because it gives me the sustain
without<00:00:40.649> having<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.010> turn<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.309> gain<00:00:41.520> way<00:00:41.730> up

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
without having to turn the gain way up

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.479 
without having to turn the gain way up
