00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
let's open it up in a month it looked

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.040 
let's open it up in a month it looked
like<00:02:00.580> it<00:02:00.730> kind<00:02:00.940> of<00:02:01.030> spilled<00:02:01.450> over<00:02:01.690> or

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
like it kind of spilled over or

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.080 
like it kind of spilled over or
something<00:02:02.410> during<00:02:02.680> shipping<00:02:02.980> which<00:02:03.700> kind<00:02:04.030> of

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
something during shipping which kind of

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.070 
something during shipping which kind of
sucks<00:02:04.330> but<00:02:04.660> still<00:02:05.170> a<00:02:05.200> good<00:02:05.560> nail<00:02:06.430> polish<00:02:07.080> as

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
sucks but still a good nail polish as

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.499 
sucks but still a good nail polish as
you<00:02:08.170> can<00:02:08.319> see<00:02:08.500> it's<00:02:08.649> pretty<00:02:09.039> thick<00:02:09.509> it's

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
you can see it's pretty thick it's

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.530 
you can see it's pretty thick it's
taking<00:02:10.750> forever<00:02:10.869> just<00:02:11.319> to<00:02:11.500> drop<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.300> like

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
taking forever just to drop so I like

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.780 
taking forever just to drop so I like
the<00:02:13.690> consistency<00:02:14.019> it's<00:02:14.769> a<00:02:15.220> little<00:02:15.430> bit<00:02:15.519> easier

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
the consistency it's a little bit easier

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.030 
the consistency it's a little bit easier
to<00:02:15.849> work<00:02:16.150> with<00:02:16.209> because<00:02:16.989> when<00:02:17.920> you're

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
to work with because when you're

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.809 
to work with because when you're
painting<00:02:18.280> your<00:02:18.400> nails<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:20.080> doesn't<00:02:20.739> run<00:02:21.400> like

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
painting your nails it doesn't run like

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.600 
painting your nails it doesn't run like
some<00:02:22.000> other<00:02:22.150> nail<00:02:22.390> polishes<00:02:22.959> do<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.470> stays<00:02:24.069> and

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
some other nail polishes do it stays and

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.670 
some other nail polishes do it stays and
it<00:02:25.150> really<00:02:25.360> helps<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:25.870> control<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.500> nail

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
it really helps you control the nail

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.790 
it really helps you control the nail
polish<00:02:27.129> better<00:02:27.459> so<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:27.909> way<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.090> can<00:02:28.450> avoid

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
polish better so that way you can avoid

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.380 
polish better so that way you can avoid
going<00:02:29.800> over<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.250> edge<00:02:30.430> like<00:02:30.819> I<00:02:30.940> did<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.269> a<00:02:31.360> few

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
going over the edge like I did in a few
