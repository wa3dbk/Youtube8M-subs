00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
color and pretty far but not all the way

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.380 
color and pretty far but not all the way
down<00:02:01.870> into<00:02:02.500> my<00:02:02.650> tears<00:02:03.130> I'm<00:02:03.490> you<00:02:03.730> know<00:02:03.820> stopping

always use so that's what I'm going to
use<00:04:14.680> right<00:04:14.860> now<00:04:14.890> my<00:04:15.430> favorite<00:04:15.760> one<00:04:15.910> for<00:04:16.120> this

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
use right now my favorite one for this

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.260 
use right now my favorite one for this
is<00:04:16.480> the<00:04:16.660> make<00:04:16.840> up<00:04:16.989> for<00:04:17.020> ever<00:04:17.230> aqua<00:04:17.620> eyes<00:04:18.070> in<00:04:18.430> and

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
is the make up for ever aqua eyes in and

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.789 
is the make up for ever aqua eyes in and
I<00:04:19.330> think<00:04:19.510> this<00:04:19.570> one<00:04:19.750> is<00:04:19.780> just<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:20.470> color<00:04:20.680> is

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
I think this one is just the color is

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.700 
I think this one is just the color is
just<00:04:20.859> black<00:04:21.250> it's<00:04:21.489> not<00:04:21.640> like

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
just black it's not like

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.400 
just black it's not like
anything<00:04:23.370> fancy<00:04:23.880> nah<00:04:24.300> I<00:04:24.479> don't<00:04:24.569> think<00:04:24.690> so<00:04:24.810> this

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
anything fancy nah I don't think so this

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.999 
anything fancy nah I don't think so this
is<00:04:25.560> just<00:04:25.680> what<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:25.889> looks<00:04:26.100> like<00:04:27.800> so<00:04:28.800> I'm<00:04:28.889> going

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
is just what it looks like so I'm going

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.939 
is just what it looks like so I'm going
to<00:04:29.039> go<00:04:29.190> ahead<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.490> apply<00:04:30.000> that<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.720> my<00:04:31.530> lower

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
to go ahead and apply that to my lower

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.880 
to go ahead and apply that to my lower
lash<00:04:32.280> line

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.059 

and<00:04:37.890> then<00:04:38.160> to<00:04:38.400> my<00:04:38.520> tight<00:04:38.760> line

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:42.069 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.290 

I<00:04:43.069> really<00:04:43.399> think<00:04:43.520> that<00:04:43.610> helps<00:04:43.939> to<00:04:44.059> make<00:04:44.179> your

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
I really think that helps to make your
