this<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> new<00:01:36.090> motor<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.509> horizon<00:01:36.630> hommies

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
this is a new motor that horizon hommies

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.990 
this is a new motor that horizon hommies
scent<00:01:37.439> means<00:01:37.590> -<00:01:39.229> 444<00:01:40.229> 4<00:01:40.409> th<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:41.520> last<00:01:41.640> when<00:01:41.909> the

there we go

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.060 
there we go
the<00:04:01.930> motor<00:04:02.110> should<00:04:02.320> move<00:04:02.470> back<00:04:02.710> and<00:04:02.860> forth

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
the motor should move back and forth

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.220 
the motor should move back and forth
freely<00:04:03.250> in<00:04:03.520> the<00:04:03.610> frame<00:04:03.850> holes<00:04:04.150> so<00:04:04.630> for<00:04:04.870> when<00:04:05.110> we

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
freely in the frame holes so for when we

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.670 
freely in the frame holes so for when we
set<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.650> gear<00:04:05.830> mesh<00:04:08.220> moves<00:04:09.220> back<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.550> forth

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
set the gear mesh moves back and forth

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.860 
set the gear mesh moves back and forth
okay<00:04:11.680> oh<00:04:11.950> my<00:04:12.670> now<00:04:13.240> I'm<00:04:13.360> gonna<00:04:13.540> install<00:04:13.690> the

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
of the frame there and the wiring goes

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.310 
of the frame there and the wiring goes
up<00:04:29.950> facing<00:04:30.580> towards<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:30.940> motor<00:04:31.150> and<00:04:31.960> you<00:04:32.020> have

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
up facing towards the motor and you have

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.500 
up facing towards the motor and you have
it<00:04:32.530> takes<00:04:32.740> a<00:04:32.860> little<00:04:33.130> bit<00:04:33.250> of<00:04:33.370> jiggling<00:04:33.790> kind

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
it takes a little bit of jiggling kind

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.070 
it takes a little bit of jiggling kind
of<00:04:34.630> get<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:34.960> in<00:04:35.080> there<00:04:36.600> but<00:04:37.600> eventually<00:04:37.870> you

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
of get it in there but eventually you

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.040 
of get it in there but eventually you
should<00:04:38.140> be<00:04:38.350> able<00:04:38.410> to<00:04:38.560> just<00:04:38.740> kind<00:04:38.860> of<00:04:39.930> slip<00:04:40.930> it

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
should be able to just kind of slip it

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.930 
should be able to just kind of slip it
in<00:04:41.140> a<00:04:41.230> spot<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:41.980> make<00:04:42.340> sure<00:04:42.460> you<00:04:42.550> don't<00:04:42.700> pinch

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
in a spot and make sure you don't pinch

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.350 
in a spot and make sure you don't pinch
the<00:04:43.090> wires<00:04:44.040> and<00:04:45.040> there's<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:45.610> sin<00:04:45.910> and<00:04:46.210> now

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
the wires and there's that sin and now

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.130 
the wires and there's that sin and now
we're<00:04:46.540> gonna<00:04:46.690> take<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.020> two<00:04:47.140> screws<00:04:47.530> and

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
we're gonna take the two screws and

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.600 
we're gonna take the two screws and
screw<00:04:50.140> that<00:04:50.440> in<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:50.950> then<00:04:51.070> we're<00:04:51.250> gonna<00:04:51.340> do

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
screw that in and then we're gonna do

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.110 
screw that in and then we're gonna do
that<00:04:51.760> for<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.180> same<00:04:53.110> two<00:04:53.290> servos<00:04:53.650> up<00:04:53.830> here<00:04:54.120> in

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
that for the same two servos up here in

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.450 
that for the same two servos up here in
the<00:04:55.360> frame<00:04:55.570> here<00:04:58.860> okay<00:04:59.860> so<00:04:59.919> now<00:05:00.220> we're<00:05:00.400> gonna

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
the frame here okay so now we're gonna

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.659 
the frame here okay so now we're gonna
install<00:05:00.790> the<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:02.560> aileron<00:05:03.100> and<00:05:03.130> they<00:05:03.400> pitch

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
install the the aileron and they pitch

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.850 
install the the aileron and they pitch
servos<00:05:04.570> that's<00:05:05.080> what<00:05:05.169> you<00:05:05.290> want<00:05:05.440> to<00:05:05.500> call<00:05:05.620> them

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
servos that's what you want to call them

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.390 
servos that's what you want to call them
here<00:05:06.130> these<00:05:07.060> only<00:05:07.270> go<00:05:07.360> in<00:05:07.630> one<00:05:07.660> way<00:05:08.040> here

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
here these only go in one way here

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.640 
here these only go in one way here
at<00:05:09.850> least<00:05:10.090> with<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.480> stock<00:05:10.750> configuration<00:05:11.500> of

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
at least with the stock configuration of

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.990 
at least with the stock configuration of
the<00:05:11.890> saw<00:05:12.280> servos<00:05:12.760> there<00:05:13.000> is<00:05:13.090> a<00:05:13.210> small<00:05:15.000> there's

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
the saw servos there is a small there's

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.560 
the saw servos there is a small there's
a<00:05:16.090> notch<00:05:16.330> here<00:05:17.669> whoops<00:05:18.669> of<00:05:19.120> a<00:05:19.180> screw<00:05:19.419> there

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
a notch here whoops of a screw there

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.130 
a notch here whoops of a screw there
there's<00:05:20.140> a<00:05:20.230> notch<00:05:20.380> here<00:05:21.630> and<00:05:22.630> there's<00:05:22.900> one<00:05:23.110> on

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
there's a notch here and there's one on

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.070 
there's a notch here and there's one on
the<00:05:23.410> other<00:05:23.530> side<00:05:23.650> underneath<00:05:24.520> it<00:05:24.780> and<00:05:25.780> that

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
the other side underneath it and that

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.990 
the other side underneath it and that
kind<00:05:26.200> of<00:05:26.290> indicates<00:05:26.560> which<00:05:27.400> way<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.610> servo

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
kind of indicates which way the servo

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.659 
kind of indicates which way the servo
goes<00:05:28.240> in<00:05:28.990> this<00:05:29.169> instance<00:05:30.419> the<00:05:31.419> bottom<00:05:31.870> servo

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
goes in this instance the bottom servo

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.500 
goes in this instance the bottom servo
faces<00:05:33.669> this<00:05:33.880> direction<00:05:36.060> so<00:05:37.060> we're<00:05:37.270> just<00:05:37.300> gonna

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
faces this direction so we're just gonna

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.500 
faces this direction so we're just gonna
stick<00:05:37.780> the<00:05:37.930> wire<00:05:38.110> right<00:05:38.410> through<00:05:38.470> here

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
stick the wire right through here

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.200 
stick the wire right through here
now<00:05:40.510> this<00:05:40.660> does<00:05:40.840> take<00:05:41.050> a<00:05:41.080> little<00:05:41.410> uh<00:05:41.440> a<00:05:42.100> little

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.550 

playing<00:05:46.210> around<00:05:46.509> what<00:05:46.690> to<00:05:46.870> get<00:05:47.020> it<00:05:47.110> to<00:05:47.199> seat<00:05:47.440> in

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
playing around what to get it to seat in

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.869 
playing around what to get it to seat in
there<00:05:47.680> correctly<00:05:47.800> but<00:05:48.220> you<00:05:48.250> kind<00:05:48.520> of<00:05:48.550> put<00:05:48.759> it

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:48.879 
there correctly but you kind of put it

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:54.089 
there correctly but you kind of put it
at<00:05:49.000> an<00:05:49.120> angle<00:05:49.569> like<00:05:51.210> that<00:05:52.470> you<00:05:53.470> push<00:05:53.770> it<00:05:53.919> in<00:05:54.069> and

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
at an angle like that you push it in and

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.070 
at an angle like that you push it in and
then<00:05:54.520> kind<00:05:54.940> of<00:05:55.030> twist<00:05:55.419> it<00:05:55.569> down<00:05:55.599> a<00:05:55.780> little<00:05:55.930> bit

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
then kind of twist it down a little bit

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.029 
then kind of twist it down a little bit
and<00:05:56.800> what<00:05:57.009> that<00:05:57.190> does<00:05:57.400> is<00:05:57.669> allows<00:05:57.970> the<00:05:58.240> wire<00:05:59.039> on

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
and what that does is allows the wire on

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:01.890 
and what that does is allows the wire on
the<00:06:00.159> other<00:06:00.340> end<00:06:00.610> to<00:06:00.879> rest<00:06:01.150> in<00:06:01.360> that<00:06:01.599> little

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
the other end to rest in that little

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.460 
the other end to rest in that little
hole<00:06:02.199> right<00:06:02.500> there<00:06:02.940> she's<00:06:03.940> a<00:06:03.970> little<00:06:04.470> gonna

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
hole right there she's a little gonna

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.680 
hole right there she's a little gonna
bend<00:06:05.680> it<00:06:05.740> back<00:06:05.889> too<00:06:06.069> far<00:06:06.340> but<00:06:06.580> just<00:06:07.449> underneath

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
bend it back too far but just underneath

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.300 
bend it back too far but just underneath
that<00:06:07.900> y-you<00:06:08.319> can<00:06:08.440> still<00:06:08.680> see<00:06:08.830> the<00:06:08.949> hole<00:06:09.099> little

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
that y-you can still see the hole little

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.760 
that y-you can still see the hole little
bit<00:06:09.460> right<00:06:09.580> there<00:06:10.110> so<00:06:11.110> that<00:06:11.259> rest<00:06:11.500> in<00:06:11.650> there

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
bit right there so that rest in there

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:19.430 
bit right there so that rest in there
like<00:06:11.919> that<00:06:14.460> and<00:06:16.020> then<00:06:17.020> the<00:06:17.440> other<00:06:18.009> server<00:06:18.520> goes

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
like that and then the other server goes

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:39.540 
like that and then the other server goes
in<00:06:20.440> the<00:06:20.530> opposite<00:06:20.949> direction<00:06:38.130> I'm<00:06:39.130> gonna<00:06:39.280> put

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
in the opposite direction I'm gonna put

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.709 
in the opposite direction I'm gonna put
the<00:06:39.699> wire<00:06:39.940> going<00:06:40.479> through<00:06:40.900> this<00:06:41.110> direction

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:42.719 
the wire going through this direction

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:47.909 
the wire going through this direction
and<00:06:45.780> it's<00:06:46.780> gonna<00:06:46.990> go<00:06:47.199> this<00:06:47.409> one<00:06:47.590> takes<00:06:47.800> a

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 
and it's gonna go this one takes a

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:50.010 
and it's gonna go this one takes a
little<00:06:47.949> bit<00:06:48.340> more<00:06:48.400> career<00:06:48.909> coercion<00:06:49.690> because

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
little bit more career coercion because

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.379 
little bit more career coercion because
you<00:06:50.259> don't<00:06:50.440> have<00:06:50.620> the<00:06:51.400> space<00:06:51.639> necessary<00:06:52.270> to

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:52.389 
you don't have the space necessary to

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:54.930 
you don't have the space necessary to
turn<00:06:52.599> it<00:06:53.400> diagonally<00:06:54.400> so<00:06:54.490> you<00:06:54.580> kind<00:06:54.729> of<00:06:54.789> just

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
turn it diagonally so you kind of just

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.969 
turn it diagonally so you kind of just
give<00:06:55.180> it<00:06:55.270> a<00:06:55.330> little<00:06:56.050> push<00:06:56.289> in<00:06:56.500> like<00:06:56.680> that<00:06:56.919> and

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:56.979 
give it a little push in like that and

00:06:56.979 --> 00:06:58.559 
give it a little push in like that and
you<00:06:57.250> should<00:06:57.280> set<00:06:57.699> right<00:06:57.729> in<00:06:57.909> there<00:06:58.240> and<00:06:58.509> again

00:06:58.559 --> 00:06:58.569 
you should set right in there and again

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:03.749 
you should set right in there and again
now<00:06:59.500> on<00:06:59.740> this<00:06:59.889> side<00:07:01.380> the<00:07:02.380> wire<00:07:02.590> is<00:07:02.979> in<00:07:03.340> this

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 
now on this side the wire is in this

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:08.610 
now on this side the wire is in this
little<00:07:04.349> hole<00:07:05.349> on<00:07:05.949> this<00:07:06.159> side<00:07:06.219> right<00:07:06.639> here<00:07:07.620> so

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
little hole on this side right here so

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.219 
little hole on this side right here so
you<00:07:09.340> install<00:07:09.699> all<00:07:09.909> the<00:07:10.029> screws<00:07:10.360> and<00:07:10.690> the

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:11.229 
you install all the screws and the

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:14.279 
you install all the screws and the
servos<00:07:11.620> would<00:07:11.740> be<00:07:11.860> interested
