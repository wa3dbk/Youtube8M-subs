00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.570
 ah 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.030
 Hi, I'm Sarah, welcome, I 'm talking about 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.160
 decathlon passion tennis in the video 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.510
 today we are going to talk about the serve as you know 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.400
 the serve is one of the most 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.410
 Tennis important because it is the blow 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.850
 of the beginning of the point today 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.190
 we are going to focus on the position of 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.080
 the feet and the ball throw to 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.850
 it has given us a couple of tricks to 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.160
 that your serve is perfect 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.510
 they started with the exercises as we have 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.669
 said this is one of the most 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.620
 important in tennis but at the same time 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.350
 the most complex for that reason we're going to 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.410
 to do is to do it step by step 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.870
 located on the bottom line 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.950
 let's put a little bit on the side what 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.530
 first we have to take into account 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.230
 is that we should never step on the line of 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.970
 background because our serve would be wrong 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.710
 and it would not be very important to have in 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.540
 mind that the foot can never be 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.910
 right more ahead than the left 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.530
 because because in this way at the time 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.390
 of hitting I do not have any kind of 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.430
 balance let's see it with an example 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.519
 if my right foot is placed in front 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.160
 from the left at the time of taking out 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.560
 I have stability for it if I delayed it 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.290
 a little bit always being comfortable 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.090
 provide more support with what I'm going 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.890
 to be able to print much more power what 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.910
 that this ball once we have the 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.430
 placement 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.930
 let's see how to throw the ball to 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.869
 do not make us work to take into account 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.690
 that we have to place the 10 degrees and 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.000
 let's drop the ball at the height of 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.520
 the eyes to the throne we are is the moment in 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.009
 that I start releasing it now let's 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.590
 see it with an example of with the ball 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.990
 I take the ball and I'll start 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.890
 jump now at this height as you see the 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.890
 height of the eyes 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.440
 there I would start to jump work 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.560
 let's make it complete the ball loose 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.960
 As you can see, my hand has remained high 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.520
 because because this will bring a greater 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.520
 stability in the blow 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.250
 how can I train this very easy 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.009
 operate a couple of tricks that can 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.590
 serve to practice at home 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.569
 we would leave the racket on the ground and 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.850
 we would place our left foot in the 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:17.060
 position of serve preparations more 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.180
 to the height in soho as you see works 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.340
 little in school through there we have a 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.400
 correct release last we are going to 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.280
 see the triumph that is the triumph that 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.810
 would raise arms while 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.780
 make the displacements 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.720
 in this way the arms of the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.150
 same way staying up at two 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.980
 as it would be badly done he threw the ball and 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.310
 when it 's alive is then when I go up 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.110
 arm 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.470
 agree let's see it well done 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.140
 badly done 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.420
 the difference for once uses that 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.940
 complete to know the steps that we have 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.030
 followed with the left foot pointing 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.890
 while the right post toe 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.530
 right it points to the fence always a 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.420
 little bit more behind the left foot 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.340
 we draw the ball at the height of 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.350
 eyes while we raise the position of 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.350
 triumph is worth prepared 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.500
 good guys that's all for today we're going to 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.120
 remember the arranged as followed the 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.280
 position of the feet treats that is at 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.170
 navel height let go of the ball to the 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.700
 height of the eyes and we raise the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.170
 win position to get 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.390
 hit the ball as high as possible 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.310
 print the maximum power our ball 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.810
 and remember for any query not 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.190
 doubt in visiting our tennis blog 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.190
 decathlon passion until then
