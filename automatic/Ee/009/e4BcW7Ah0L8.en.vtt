00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
than a more pedestrian tire but the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.270 
than a more pedestrian tire but the
advantage<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.769> makes<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.100> car

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
advantage of that is it makes the car

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.000 
advantage of that is it makes the car
handle<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.270> bolted<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> floor<00:01:07.140> so
