00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.480
 with your readers because it's a career 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.610
 which must be done with operating 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.920

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.789
 I love myself, I was worth it, I mean, 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.680
 I love it very much because if 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.210
 aesthetically added 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.289
 basic let's give it street and super thing 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.699
 over it and let's see if what 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.230
 we get for the moment still perfectly 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.420
 and please that seems perfect 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.000
 kid like the balbin guys counter 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.820
 it's two laps and see why 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.309
 moment to this motorcycle here already runs less 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.170
 vale vale vale point worth my name there 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.780
 to turn around and criticized this 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.370
 mutual because I fall in love look if you have 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.950
 passed as a male the hair stripe with 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.629
 your wheels okay come on let's go as 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.120
 here we follow the first of the multiple 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.489
 through the second so many removed 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.820
 because I think he wants to win me I think 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.379
 it's just I think let's go we jump 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.780
 He has not even arrived 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.270
 Every kid I had nothing more kids 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.540
 it's hard to get there but we're going to 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.910
 try 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.720
 let's do like this let's hit a jump 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.430
 lateral there yes yes yes there is here and for 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.120
 what is dying but please yes 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.120
 there is one meter away 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.330
 We brake here, there's no need to accelerate 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.850
 not so much and I'm stuck on the limit 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.830
 like the movie attraction to what I 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.080
 I think that eye is the second eye that 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.729
 this is the second and can not win 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.530

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.720
 denying me every Mexican vega la dig 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.790
 of the Antarctic is the Lord nor do I know 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.729
 what did you just overtake and that's something 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.140
 that I do not like anything at all comes through 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.140
 your daddy if I arrive I say 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.610
 ask me please do not ask 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.610
 because I have no answers worth 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:07.010
 you have to press you have to press it there 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:11.090
 that tighten a little bit we are 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:18.590
 making the sad try while 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:21.200
 he will hit a smack because he does not 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.360
 I have no idea if it's perfect or that I 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.710
 but first let's go motito let's go my line 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:31.330

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.850
 to reduce around me 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.770
 Worth asking question 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.930

 them very few times that I had these 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.460
 typical reactions that I fall a 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.260
 heap with the bike that he usually 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.880
