they just support every kind of calm and

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.070 
they just support every kind of calm and
even<00:03:48.550> if<00:03:48.610> they're<00:03:48.730> not<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:49.000> even<00:03:49.720> sometimes<00:03:49.870> are

really<00:05:27.200> cool<00:05:27.380> I<00:05:27.590> think<00:05:27.980> as<00:05:28.190> time<00:05:28.400> goes<00:05:28.580> right

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
really cool I think as time goes right

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.010 
really cool I think as time goes right
they<00:05:28.880> continue<00:05:29.180> have<00:05:29.300> comedy<00:05:29.600> or<00:05:29.720> sure<00:05:29.900> will

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
they continue have comedy or sure will

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.150 
they continue have comedy or sure will
grow<00:05:30.260> and<00:05:30.470> it'll<00:05:30.620> get<00:05:30.710> bigger<00:05:30.830> a<00:05:31.010> lot<00:05:31.100> bigger

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160

with it but I think they think of Stan

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.880 
with it but I think they think of Stan
in<00:06:16.300> a<00:06:16.390> certain<00:06:16.570> way<00:06:16.690> and<00:06:17.020> there's<00:06:17.410> like<00:06:17.590> a<00:06:17.740> lot

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
in a certain way and there's like a lot

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:18.930 
in a certain way and there's like a lot
of<00:06:17.920> Stan<00:06:18.220> of<00:06:18.310> communities<00:06:18.610> that<00:06:18.670> want<00:06:18.790> to

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
of Stan of communities that want to

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.660 
of Stan of communities that want to
expose<00:06:19.270> a<00:06:19.600> crowd<00:06:20.380> to<00:06:20.860> stand<00:06:21.160> up<00:06:21.220> comedy<00:06:21.550> that's

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:21.670 
expose a crowd to stand up comedy that's

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.400 
expose a crowd to stand up comedy that's
not<00:06:21.910> I<00:06:22.240> think<00:06:22.630> that<00:06:22.750> more<00:06:22.930> more<00:06:23.080> people<00:06:23.320> are

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
not I think that more more people are

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.870 
not I think that more more people are
realizing<00:06:23.440> that<00:06:23.950> comedy<00:06:24.310> is<00:06:24.340> not<00:06:24.430> just<00:06:24.760> like

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
realizing that comedy is not just like

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.000 
realizing that comedy is not just like
club<00:06:25.390> as<00:06:25.540> Club<00:06:25.840> is<00:06:25.990> they<00:06:26.440> might<00:06:26.620> think<00:06:26.830> it<00:06:26.920> is

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
club as Club is they might think it is

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.800 
club as Club is they might think it is
so<00:06:27.220> that's<00:06:27.670> why<00:06:27.790> maybe<00:06:28.060> it's<00:06:28.210> a<00:06:28.240> good<00:06:28.330> match<00:06:28.540> is

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
so that's why maybe it's a good match is

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.200 
so that's why maybe it's a good match is
that<00:06:29.320> there's<00:06:30.190> a<00:06:30.370> whole<00:06:30.640> audience<00:06:30.820> out<00:06:31.180> there

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210
