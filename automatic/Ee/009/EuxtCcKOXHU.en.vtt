00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
 yes 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.980
 danielle there is no story so 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.620
 successful throughout the automotive industry 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.379
 world as the corolla and the truth 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.959
 which is a very good story 40 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.419
 million cars sold in 47 years of 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.790
 history is the best-selling car in the 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:20.700
 guinness book as record and really 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.890
 is the eleventh generation has a 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.560
 very very good design balance 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.290
 equipment and features that I think 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.910
 gives us enough hope to 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.740
 to continue fighting the leadership of 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.440
 market 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.660
 if you had to say two or three points 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.270
 keys of this new model what would be 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.770
 I believe that from the point of view of 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.530
 design has a much more design 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.290
 emotional what we call the 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.390
 I smell what makes you feel the pleasure and 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.610
 the heart beating because one is 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.530
 having fun from the point of view of 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.269
 benefits incorporating a 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.580
 7 variable transmission case 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.199
 marches I think it's a very very advance 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.809
 good and in terms of equipment 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.970
 It has all the exterior design features 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:06.560
 a lot of equipment from 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.780
 security and comfort that has improved it and 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.930
 I think it's a very, very good evolution 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.880
 of the act 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.340
 this new one for now really is a 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.290
 very important player to continue the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.290
 success that toyota had throughout all 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.330
 2003 if for us in 2013 it was a year 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.550
 record but we always have to 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.350
 keep on surpassing this segment of the 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.200
 medium is a very very segment 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.840
 competitive and we believe that with this car 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.510
 with this new design with this new 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.850
 equipment can leave us 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.410
 competed on equal terms with 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.390
 other models that may have had 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.950
 a much closer renovation 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.590
 working is not a little outside of 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.270
 crown and toyota in general was announced 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.370
 recently a very important investment 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.010
 that will really strengthen the future 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.350
 Argentine student if our idea is 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.990
 make toyota argentino a base 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.420
 exporter leaves hilux and sw4 for all 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.100
 Latin America with which with 800 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.619
 million dollars we are going to prepare 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.860
 our plant to manufacture 140 thousand 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.200
 units of those 140 thousand the 80 by 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.090
 there are hundreds of exports and to have 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.709
 the comic data of the one who does not 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.380
 is very aware of what it is to produce 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.600
 a car at that time is going to leave a hi 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.519
 Lux finished in our plant every 90 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.310
 seconds since the project started 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:24.250
 Argentina's Argentine export 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.989
 today you can consume 30 thousand hi lux and 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.320
 we are planning to manufacture 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.140
 140,000 and in turn when one has a 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.570
 export business and it is distributed 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.310
 in all the countries of Latin America one 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.350
 makes a much more sustainable project 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.140
 because already 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.540
 one of the joints does not depend 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.970
 cyclical you may have in some country and 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.310
 You can compensate your business with other 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.340
 parts even even profitability 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.770
 and costs of having a whole region like 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.630
 place of sale of our products the 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.500
 idea is in 2014 and must be 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.780
 list in June in the plant of axes and 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.370
 chassis is that today they were made in brÃ¡sil and 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.430
 they will be brought to manufacture in the 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.430
 Argentina 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.630
 the preparation for what is the increase 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.670
 volume and about the end of the year will be 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.170
 list our new line of paint that 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.920
 it was a little bit the bottleneck for 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.470
 the printing of our plant 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.150
 and finally to finish a panorama 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.400
 of what we can expect from the 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.010
 Argentine automotive industry in what 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.010
 the rest of the year and I think this year the 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.650
 industry is going to have a fall we estimate 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.340
 a market of around 750 thousand 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.440
 units while it is not good for 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.209
 964 thousand that were last year I think 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.030
 which is not a negligible market either 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.220
 its good market that you have to take care of it is 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.950
 a conjuncture and I think that in the long 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.630
 term we can get back to being 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.630
 close to one million units
