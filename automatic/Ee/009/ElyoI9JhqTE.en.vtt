00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.910
 you and I have already been through our 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:09.070
 the outer is our inner then 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.150
 It is all that we have inside of it 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.869
 projected 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:17.470
 and our inner materializes 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:21.030
 becomes matter matter around us 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.050
 all that we think we feel inside 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.840
 we hear see everything inside 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:30.640
 accordingly comes out here and we each 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:33.700
 day we see a panorama of a mirror of everything 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.590
 of what we have inside sometimes 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.800
 it seems unfair that it seems that I 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.540
 such white fluffy threw me here 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.120
 it is not clear what family is offending me 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.120
 beat there does something to me yes sometimes 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.630
 so it seems that how is the same god 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:55.710
 why so unfair well that is 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:01:01.690
 why is my life like that? 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:05.859
 such a rough my life before I'm here 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:11.439
 all good tour to do me mean here 

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:14.590
 we do bad all the time and get out 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.880
 sense of pity she so underestimates 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.819
 your inner 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.609
 that the universe is forced repeatedly 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:22.920
 fulfill your desires that is if you 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:25.509
 feel pity 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.279
 accordingly she needs something for you 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.799
 do either you 

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:32.649
 cottage to burn his car drive it either 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.630
 something else to do that is 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:38.729
 crank up some trick so you still 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.729
 times and had the opportunity to regret for yourself 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.919
 this one part of the population lives by this 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:48.219
 performance 2 another part of the population is waiting 

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:49.329
 by binding lives that is, so far good 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.549
 all is well 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:55.240
 the mood is normal exactly steel 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.909
 take a little bit of something there 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.869
 from the hands you float away the man begins 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.850
 crying upset how is it like that 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:08.479
 there is something 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:13.850
 and took something they stole there spoiled 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.230
 still somehow smashed that is on 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.450
 today we need 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.840
 the balance of what happens during 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.350
 internal to its external when we look 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.640
 in the eyes of the court we observe 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.890
 you must always understand what it is 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.120
 internal display that is 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.940
 claims to the outside can not be 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.300
 just a mirror of what you are not kind not 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.280
 see inside yourself if in the outside 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.750
 something is wrong and you don't like something 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.650
 in the outer eyes we shut off 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.550
 from the outside 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:53.450
 and dive into the internal we look that there 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.670
 us in the inner not so here to this 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.890
 Thoughts need to bring large enough 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.620
 the number of people who are all the time with 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.870
 windmills we fight and 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.500
 can not understand that the universe 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.519
 playing with us a variety of games 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.910
 gives us the opportunity 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.880
 enjoy all the feelings and emotions 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:21.170
 but you and I also went through with you 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:23.810
 over remind let's take our 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.600
 economy then we are well aware that 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.140
 our economy is built from ours 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.290
 internal abundance if we have inside 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.310
 there is always that is, we understand that 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.310
 we always have 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.700
 when it was a long time ago 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.950
 periodically some kind of fear 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.870
 angels there now something ends there 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.870
 does not run out of clothes ends still 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.810
 something ends the angel will have time on time 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.989
 give all that i need and such fear 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:04.390
 periodically it was a long time ago 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:06.890
 no less it was so there is a time 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.959
 it was necessary to work with these thoughts 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.870
 that is, the time needed to clean it up 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.489
 fear bring him back yes yes I accept 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.540
 your fear that the angels will not have time and 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:19.100
 you will not do anything 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.150
 with this fear all the time it was necessary 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.340
 something to do with working with him was possible 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.800
 it means our economy first of all 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.850
 built from our sense of pity 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:36.040
 from our sense of ingratitude and from 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:39.610
 our fear that something will not be 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.240
 since people play collectively 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.230
 accordingly this 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:48.170
 these groups are formed on the basis of 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.210
 vibrations ie in one country alone 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.430
 people live in another country other people 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.310
 live that is vibrations of some people 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.070
 practically the same each 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.590
 parties why sometimes it seems that everything 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.750
 people are the same but you come to that country 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.560
 and you see the feeling that everything 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.530
 people are the same it is that vibration 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:15.470
 collects a handful of it people let's say 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:18.050
 on vibrations people gather therefore 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.830
 economy of each side it is built from 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.400
 from emotions and feelings 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.400
 each person
