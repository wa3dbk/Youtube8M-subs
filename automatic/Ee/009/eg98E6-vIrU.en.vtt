ok guys so as I mentioned we bought four

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.880 
ok guys so as I mentioned we bought four
of<00:01:02.489> these<00:01:02.579> lights<00:01:03.409> we've<00:01:04.409> got<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> couple<00:01:04.739> of

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
of these lights we've got a couple of

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.080 
of these lights we've got a couple of
projects<00:01:05.220> we're<00:01:05.339> going<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> work<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.850> that

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
projects we're going to work on that

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.850 
projects we're going to work on that
require<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.140> little<00:01:07.350> bit<00:01:07.470> more<00:01:07.590> lights

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
require just a little bit more lights

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.609 
require just a little bit more lights
but<00:01:08.780> let's<00:01:09.780> take<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> look<00:01:10.140> at<00:01:10.229> what's<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
but let's take a look at what's in the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.280 
but let's take a look at what's in the
box<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.939> got<00:01:12.060> some<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.450> warranty<00:01:13.049> stuff

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
box here we got some just warranty stuff

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.810 
box here we got some just warranty stuff
and<00:01:13.710> some<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.970> user<00:01:15.390> guide<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:16.049> comes<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:16.409> it

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
and some a user guide that comes with it

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.240 
and some a user guide that comes with it
I<00:01:18.170> believe<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.500> little<00:01:19.770> locking

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
I believe this is a little locking

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.859 
I believe this is a little locking
mechanism<00:01:20.850> because<00:01:21.030> these<00:01:21.390> lights<00:01:21.689> are

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
mechanism because these lights are

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.820 
mechanism because these lights are
stackable<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.369> can't<00:01:23.729> order<00:01:24.830> multiple

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
stackable so you can't order multiple

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.960 
stackable so you can't order multiple
ones<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.159> put<00:01:26.280> them<00:01:26.340> all<00:01:26.520> together<00:01:26.670> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
ones and put them all together and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.200 
ones and put them all together and
create<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.450> big<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:27.900> if<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:29.060> there's<00:01:30.060> a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
create one big one if you like there's a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.910 
create one big one if you like there's a
lot<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.479> options<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.890> with

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
lot of options that you can do with

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.520 
lot of options that you can do with
these<00:01:32.189> things<00:01:32.729> there's<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.659> plastic<00:01:34.079> cover<00:01:34.229> so

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
these things there's a plastic cover so

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.020 
these things there's a plastic cover so
to<00:01:34.590> keep<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.220> from<00:01:35.310> getting<00:01:35.430> scratched<00:01:35.729> which

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
to keep it from getting scratched which

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.830 
to keep it from getting scratched which
is<00:01:36.180> great

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
full power again the great thing about

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.560 
full power again the great thing about
this<00:03:59.900> guy's<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:00.800> see<00:04:00.920> it's<00:04:01.670> dimmable<00:04:02.030> you<00:04:02.390> can

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
this guy's you see it's dimmable you can

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.250 
this guy's you see it's dimmable you can
lower<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.380> strength<00:04:03.650> on<00:04:03.830> it<00:04:04.060> you<00:04:05.060> can<00:04:05.260> power

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
lower the strength on it you can power

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.200 
lower the strength on it you can power
it<00:04:06.470> up<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:06.830> really<00:04:07.370> blind<00:04:07.640> somebody<00:04:08.060> so

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
imagine three or four these stacked

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.190 
imagine three or four these stacked
together<00:04:10.150> you've<00:04:11.150> got<00:04:11.390> more<00:04:11.630> power<00:04:11.930> than<00:04:12.080> the

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
together you've got more power than the

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.920 
together you've got more power than the
Sun<00:04:12.440> these<00:04:12.740> little<00:04:13.040> things<00:04:13.070> I'm<00:04:13.930> being

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
Sun these little things I'm being

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.830 
Sun these little things I'm being
slightly<00:04:15.230> executive<00:04:16.030> but<00:04:17.030> anyways<00:04:17.450> as<00:04:17.690> you

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
slightly executive but anyways as you

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.440 
slightly executive but anyways as you
can<00:04:17.989> see<00:04:18.170> great<00:04:18.950> little<00:04:19.250> device<00:04:19.609> you<00:04:20.299> can

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
can see great little device you can

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.560 
can see great little device you can
stack<00:04:20.840> them<00:04:21.049> together<00:04:21.170> sideways<00:04:22.100> or<00:04:22.460> on<00:04:23.060> top<00:04:23.360> I

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
stack them together sideways or on top I

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.620 
stack them together sideways or on top I
believe<00:04:23.870> or<00:04:24.440> maybe<00:04:24.680> just<00:04:24.830> sideways<00:04:25.340> so<00:04:26.270> again

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
believe or maybe just sideways so again

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.900 
believe or maybe just sideways so again
it's<00:04:26.840> pretty<00:04:27.260> good<00:04:27.470> well<00:04:27.830> you<00:04:28.280> could<00:04:28.460> stand<00:04:28.700> it

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
it's pretty good well you could stand it

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.520 
it's pretty good well you could stand it
up<00:04:29.000> like<00:04:29.150> this<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.360> stack<00:04:29.720> them<00:04:29.840> on<00:04:29.960> top<00:04:30.020> or

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
up like this and stack them on top or

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.220 
up like this and stack them on top or
put<00:04:31.490> them<00:04:31.550> this<00:04:31.700> way<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.060> stack<00:04:32.270> them<00:04:32.419> off<00:04:32.630> to

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
put them this way and stack them off to

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.640 
put them this way and stack them off to
the<00:04:33.290> side<00:04:33.820> again<00:04:34.820> here's<00:04:35.090> little<00:04:35.450> adapter<00:04:36.260> for

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
ok guys so now we're done testing that I

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.490 
ok guys so now we're done testing that I
just<00:05:30.539> wanted<00:05:30.780> to<00:05:30.810> leave<00:05:30.990> you<00:05:31.020> guys<00:05:31.229> with<00:05:31.289> a

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
just wanted to leave you guys with a

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.350 
just wanted to leave you guys with a
couple<00:05:31.800> of<00:05:31.889> points<00:05:32.220> here<00:05:32.430> with<00:05:32.910> this<00:05:33.120> light

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
couple of points here with this light

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.749 
couple of points here with this light
although<00:05:33.690> it<00:05:34.229> is<00:05:34.319> a<00:05:34.350> fantastic<00:05:34.740> length<00:05:35.550> we

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 
although it is a fantastic length we

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.400 
although it is a fantastic length we
just<00:05:36.090> realized<00:05:36.449> a<00:05:36.599> couple<00:05:36.870> of<00:05:36.960> things<00:05:37.199> with

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
just realized a couple of things with

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.550 
just realized a couple of things with
this<00:05:37.789> if<00:05:38.789> you're<00:05:39.180> running<00:05:39.840> low<00:05:39.990> on<00:05:40.020> battery

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
this if you're running low on battery

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.110 
this if you're running low on battery
you're<00:05:40.800> going<00:05:41.009> to<00:05:41.099> see<00:05:41.250> a<00:05:41.280> substantial<00:05:41.580> amount

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
you're going to see a substantial amount

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.960 
you're going to see a substantial amount
of<00:05:42.360> flickering<00:05:42.979> and<00:05:43.979> you<00:05:44.160> might<00:05:44.370> have<00:05:44.550> to<00:05:44.729> dial

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
of flickering and you might have to dial

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.969 
of flickering and you might have to dial
it<00:05:45.150> back<00:05:45.180> a<00:05:45.479> little<00:05:45.660> bit<00:05:45.990> just<00:05:46.199> to<00:05:46.380> compensate

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
it back a little bit just to compensate

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.950 
it back a little bit just to compensate
for<00:05:47.160> that<00:05:47.190> so<00:05:47.789> if<00:05:47.849> you're<00:05:48.000> dialed<00:05:48.360> up<00:05:48.419> all<00:05:48.660> the

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
for that so if you're dialed up all the

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.749 
for that so if you're dialed up all the
way<00:05:49.139> you<00:05:50.009> will<00:05:50.220> start<00:05:50.460> to<00:05:50.520> see<00:05:50.610> some

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 
way you will start to see some

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:52.700 
way you will start to see some
fluttering<00:05:51.360> but<00:05:51.599> if<00:05:51.720> you<00:05:51.810> come<00:05:52.080> back<00:05:52.259> just<00:05:52.620> a

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
fluttering but if you come back just a

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.499 
fluttering but if you come back just a
little<00:05:52.740> bit<00:05:53.009> you<00:05:53.520> the<00:05:53.699> fluttering<00:05:54.090> will<00:05:54.300> stop

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509 
little bit you the fluttering will stop

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.480 
little bit you the fluttering will stop
on<00:05:54.690> this<00:05:54.900> but<00:05:55.440> on<00:05:55.560> a<00:05:55.590> full<00:05:55.860> charge<00:05:55.889> a<00:05:56.340> nice

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009 
power flicker but that was one little

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:07.010 
power flicker but that was one little
downside<00:06:05.340> that<00:06:05.610> I<00:06:05.759> saw<00:06:06.030> on<00:06:06.240> a<00:06:06.330> review<00:06:06.720> and<00:06:06.900> I

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
downside that I saw on a review and I

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.980 
downside that I saw on a review and I
got<00:06:07.289> to<00:06:07.410> experience<00:06:07.650> it<00:06:07.949> for<00:06:07.979> myself<00:06:08.130> just<00:06:08.990> how

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
got to experience it for myself just how

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.689 
got to experience it for myself just how
much<00:06:10.229> it<00:06:10.380> can<00:06:10.500> flicker<00:06:10.800> another<00:06:11.490> thing<00:06:11.669> you

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 
much it can flicker another thing you

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:13.279 
much it can flicker another thing you
guys<00:06:11.880> might<00:06:12.120> want<00:06:12.300> to<00:06:12.389> pay<00:06:12.509> attention<00:06:12.539> to<00:06:13.080> is

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
guys might want to pay attention to is

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:14.930 
guys might want to pay attention to is
fluorescent<00:06:13.979> lighting<00:06:14.340> if<00:06:14.610> you're<00:06:14.759> around

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
fluorescent lighting if you're around

fluorescent lighting if you're around
fluorescent<00:06:15.570> lighting<00:06:15.720> you're<00:06:15.990> filming

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
fluorescent lighting you're filming

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.110 
fluorescent lighting you're filming
around<00:06:16.530> fluorescent<00:06:17.250> lighting<00:06:17.430> and<00:06:17.699> you're

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
around fluorescent lighting and you're

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.570 
around fluorescent lighting and you're
using<00:06:18.330> these<00:06:18.570> lights<00:06:18.840> you<00:06:19.530> might<00:06:19.830> see<00:06:20.400> some

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
using these lights you might see some

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.189 
using these lights you might see some
flickering<00:06:21.000> as<00:06:21.180> well<00:06:21.360> and<00:06:21.599> it<00:06:21.750> may<00:06:21.930> not<00:06:22.139> be

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 
flickering as well and it may not be

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:24.200 
flickering as well and it may not be
because<00:06:22.620> of<00:06:23.130> your<00:06:23.250> lights<00:06:23.460> it<00:06:23.880> could<00:06:24.090> be

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
because of your lights it could be

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.670 
because of your lights it could be
because<00:06:24.360> of<00:06:24.569> the<00:06:24.780> fluorescent<00:06:25.500> lights

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
because of the fluorescent lights

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.610 
because of the fluorescent lights
fluorescent<00:06:26.460> lights<00:06:26.610> flicker<00:06:27.210> naturally<00:06:27.840> so

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
fluorescent lights flicker naturally so

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.870 
fluorescent lights flicker naturally so
if<00:06:28.710> you're<00:06:28.830> filming<00:06:29.159> and<00:06:29.460> you<00:06:29.520> do<00:06:29.699> see

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
if you're filming and you do see

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.270 
if you're filming and you do see
flickering<00:06:30.389> usually<00:06:30.780> to<00:06:31.590> compensate<00:06:32.099> for

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
flickering usually to compensate for

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.740 
flickering usually to compensate for
that<00:06:32.310> you<00:06:32.580> increase<00:06:32.909> your<00:06:33.060> shutter<00:06:33.419> speed<00:06:33.509> to

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
that you increase your shutter speed to

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.879 
that you increase your shutter speed to
about<00:06:33.990> 60<00:06:34.680> I<00:06:34.860> know<00:06:35.639> the<00:06:35.880> rule<00:06:36.030> of<00:06:36.060> thumb<00:06:36.300> is<00:06:36.889> 50

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:37.889 
about 60 I know the rule of thumb is 50

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:39.860 
about 60 I know the rule of thumb is 50
no<00:06:38.130> less<00:06:38.370> than<00:06:38.610> 30<00:06:38.909> when<00:06:39.150> you<00:06:39.270> shoot<00:06:39.479> you<00:06:39.570> film

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
no less than 30 when you shoot you film

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.649 
no less than 30 when you shoot you film
so<00:06:40.169> you<00:06:40.889> might<00:06:41.130> want<00:06:41.400> to<00:06:41.550> consider<00:06:42.270> that<00:06:42.419> as

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:42.659 
so you might want to consider that as

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:44.350 
so you might want to consider that as
well<00:06:42.810> but<00:06:42.990> rules<00:06:43.349> are<00:06:43.469> meant<00:06:43.590> to<00:06:43.710> be<00:06:43.770> broken<00:06:43.889> so

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
well but rules are meant to be broken so

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.730 
well but rules are meant to be broken so
if<00:06:45.360> you<00:06:45.870> want<00:06:46.289> to<00:06:46.380> get<00:06:46.500> rid<00:06:46.620> of<00:06:46.680> that

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
if you want to get rid of that

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.050 
if you want to get rid of that
flickering<00:06:47.219> then<00:06:47.430> just<00:06:47.639> increase<00:06:47.940> your

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
flickering then just increase your

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.640 
flickering then just increase your
shutter<00:06:48.300> speed<00:06:48.389> but<00:06:49.320> in<00:06:49.409> this<00:06:49.469> particular

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650 
shutter speed but in this particular

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.219 
shutter speed but in this particular
case<00:06:50.190> these<00:06:50.430> lights<00:06:50.699> are<00:06:50.880> working<00:06:50.909> well<00:06:51.389> there

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:52.229 
case these lights are working well there

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:53.930 
case these lights are working well there
are<00:06:52.349> things<00:06:52.620> you<00:06:52.770> can<00:06:52.979> do<00:06:53.190> to<00:06:53.219> make<00:06:53.490> sure<00:06:53.669> the
