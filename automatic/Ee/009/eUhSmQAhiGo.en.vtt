here<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.130> now<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.670> production<00:00:30.420> and

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
here we have the now in production and

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:40.400 
here we have the now in production and
deployed<00:00:31.520> directly<00:00:32.520> HR<00:00:35.630> 3421<00:00:36.630> box<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:39.410> it

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
deployed directly HR 3421 box and it

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.380 
deployed directly HR 3421 box and it
basically<00:00:41.160> pulls<00:00:41.700> all<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.030> directory

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390

to have an our view enabled client in

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.650 
to have an our view enabled client in
the<00:00:58.140> home<00:00:58.609> DirecTV<00:00:59.609> will<00:00:59.820> install<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.539> main

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
the home DirecTV will install the main

server box and provide the customer at
the<00:01:03.539> appropriate<00:01:04.019> points<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> home<00:01:04.680> with

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
the appropriate points in the home with

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.859 
the appropriate points in the home with
converter<00:01:05.939> boxes<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.810> one<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.830> add

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
converter boxes like this one to add

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.399 
converter boxes like this one to add
Ethernet<00:01:09.869> devices<00:01:10.280> to<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.700> MOCA<00:01:11.970> Network<00:01:12.409> so

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
Ethernet devices to the MOCA Network so

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.640 
Ethernet devices to the MOCA Network so
in<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.590> case<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.500> client<00:01:16.500> which

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
in this case we have a client which

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.649 
in this case we have a client which
would<00:01:16.920> potentially<00:01:17.189> be<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> second<00:01:18.420> room

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
would potentially be in the second room

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.130 
would potentially be in the second room
of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.869> home<00:01:19.080> which<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.979> Samsung<00:01:20.640> TV<00:01:21.240> with

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
of the home which is a Samsung TV with

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.920 
of the home which is a Samsung TV with
the<00:01:22.350> our<00:01:22.439> view<00:01:22.619> functionality<00:01:23.369> built<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.930> so

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the our view functionality built in so

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.550 
the our view functionality built in so
DirecTV<00:01:25.860> would<00:01:26.720> check<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> MOCA<00:01:28.140> connection

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
DirecTV would check the MOCA connection

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.700 
DirecTV would check the MOCA connection
to<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> second<00:01:29.189> room<00:01:29.340> they<00:01:29.700> would<00:01:29.880> put<00:01:30.119> this

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
to the second room they would put this

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.800 
to the second room they would put this
converter<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:32.009> behind<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.790> TV<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.329> convert<00:01:33.659> to

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
converter in behind the TV to convert to

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.240 
converter in behind the TV to convert to
Ethernet<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> Ethernet<00:01:34.710> cable<00:01:35.040> goes

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
Ethernet and the Ethernet cable goes

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.399 
Ethernet and the Ethernet cable goes
directly<00:01:35.729> into<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.090> television<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:37.170> it's<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
directly into the television so it's a

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.190 
directly into the television so it's a
no<00:01:37.590> set-top<00:01:38.070> box<00:01:38.280> solution<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.930> our<00:01:40.020> view

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
no set-top box solution for the our view

interestingly<00:01:53.960> Samsung<00:01:54.960> has<00:01:55.079> chosen<00:01:55.350> to

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
interestingly Samsung has chosen to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.469 
interestingly Samsung has chosen to

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
obvious server just looks like an input

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.350 
obvious server just looks like an input
to<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.300> TV<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.660> will<00:02:23.989> be<00:02:24.110> treated<00:02:24.290> as<00:02:24.590> such<00:02:25.360> so

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
to the TV and will be treated as such so

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.910 
to the TV and will be treated as such so
what<00:02:26.510> I'm<00:02:26.600> able<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.900> do<00:02:27.170> since<00:02:27.620> we're<00:02:27.770> already

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
what I'm able to do since we're already

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.330 
what I'm able to do since we're already
playing<00:02:28.340> video<00:02:28.700> in<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.150> our<00:02:29.270> view<00:02:29.420> experience

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
playing video in the our view experience

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.400 
playing video in the our view experience
because<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.370> input<00:02:31.760> is<00:02:32.030> selected<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.720> can<00:02:33.140> use

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
because that input is selected I can use

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.080 
because that input is selected I can use
the<00:02:33.560> remote<00:02:33.800> control<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:34.190> pull<00:02:34.670> up<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.880> guide

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
the remote control to pull up the guide

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:43.730 
the remote control to pull up the guide
I<00:02:36.430> can<00:02:37.430> scroll<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.880> guide

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:55.660 

I<00:02:43.800> can<00:02:44.520> select<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:45.060> new<00:02:45.210> channel

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.530 

and<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.420> on<00:02:56.569> I<00:02:56.840> can<00:02:57.500> pull<00:02:57.650> up<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.860> playlist<00:02:58.540> and

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
and so on I can pull up the playlist and

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.650 
and so on I can pull up the playlist and
in<00:02:59.720> this<00:02:59.840> case<00:03:00.080> we<00:03:00.260> have<00:03:01.060> five<00:03:02.060> items<00:03:02.090> in<00:03:02.600> the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
in this case we have five items in the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.690 
in this case we have five items in the
playlist<00:03:03.110> so<00:03:03.890> really<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.250> have<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.490> full

much less wiring and it's an overall

would have been on a directly set-top
box<00:03:38.110> which<00:03:39.110> obviously<00:03:39.350> gives<00:03:39.500> consistent

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.660 
experience and that's a great value to
DIRECTV<00:03:43.989> so<00:03:44.989> that's<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.590> new<00:03:45.680> rc7<00:03:46.160> to<00:03:46.400> remote

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
DIRECTV so that's the new rc7 to remote

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.370 
DIRECTV so that's the new rc7 to remote
the<00:03:46.880> Samsung<00:03:47.330> TV<00:03:47.750> which<00:03:47.959> is<00:03:48.110> now<00:03:48.230> in

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
the Samsung TV which is now in

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.580 
the Samsung TV which is now in
production<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:49.930> what<00:03:50.930> I've<00:03:51.019> also<00:03:51.170> got<00:03:51.410> in<00:03:51.500> the

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
production and what I've also got in the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.400 
production and what I've also got in the
setup<00:03:51.830> here<00:03:52.160> is<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.480> second<00:03:53.480> Samsung<00:03:53.870> TV<00:03:54.200> with

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
setup here is a second Samsung TV with

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.350 
setup here is a second Samsung TV with
our<00:03:54.440> view<00:03:54.769> inside<00:03:55.100> but<00:03:55.940> what<00:03:56.060> I'm<00:03:56.150> going<00:03:56.330> to

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
our view inside but what I'm going to

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.190 
our view inside but what I'm going to
show<00:03:56.570> you<00:03:56.630> is<00:03:56.870> that<00:03:56.900> it<00:03:57.610> is<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:58.790> solution

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
show you is that it is the solution

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.160 
show you is that it is the solution
where<00:04:00.579> the<00:04:01.579> television<00:04:02.060> in<00:04:02.269> the<00:04:02.540> third<00:04:02.959> or

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
where the television in the third or

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.440 
where the television in the third or
fourth<00:04:03.440> room<00:04:03.650> doesn't<00:04:04.070> have<00:04:04.280> our<00:04:04.549> view<00:04:05.090> inside

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
fourth room doesn't have our view inside

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.560 
fourth room doesn't have our view inside
so<00:04:06.170> in<00:04:06.260> this<00:04:06.350> case<00:04:06.850> certainly<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:08.000> TV<00:04:08.299> can

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
so in this case certainly the TV can

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.030 
so in this case certainly the TV can
connect<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:09.019> the<00:04:09.110> our<00:04:09.200> view<00:04:09.380> source<00:04:09.650> directly

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
connect to the our view source directly

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.940 
connect to the our view source directly
but<00:04:10.760> I've<00:04:10.910> chosen<00:04:11.150> instead<00:04:11.660> to<00:04:11.930> connect<00:04:12.739> it<00:04:12.920> to

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
but I've chosen instead to connect it to

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.670 
but I've chosen instead to connect it to
HDMI<00:04:13.670> one<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.239> what<00:04:14.900> we<00:04:15.019> have<00:04:15.170> connected<00:04:15.560> two
