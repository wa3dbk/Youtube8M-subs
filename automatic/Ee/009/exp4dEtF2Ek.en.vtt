00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.379
 Hello dear friends with you I am 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.139
 grew was lighting as you know 26 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.280
 numbers I flew to Minsk to meet the authors 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.670
 channel here's a fan 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.100
 and watching the golden league final and these are mine 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.199
 impressions of how it was 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.640
 I want to immediately say that I do not have 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.070
 good camcorder 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.849
 And the camera has a problem recording 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.349
 sound so there will be only pictures 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.900
 probably start immediately from the moment 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.300
 Arrival in Minsk at the airport waited 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.530
 a man who took us on a minibus 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.690
 president hotel 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.450
 when we arrived at Astra tell my 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.640
 good friend and part-time 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.530
 Chief Vladislav Suldin was pleased with him 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.460
 see once again live before 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.100
 By this I saw him only on Igromir 2013 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.230
 year, we received wonderful gifts and 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.020

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.579
 it includes a cup with an image 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.000
 bison cup holder 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.030
 book and mouse sticker on car poster 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.390
 huge rug icon and 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.140

 straight and pz 2 j german imba second 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.560
 level 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.049
 I did not do boxing as I did 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.330
 I think almost all authors on the channel he 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.509
 and so it will be as far as I know from the slera 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.570
 crane and mouse they already have so who 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.420
 It's interesting to see them after the presentation 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.729
 gifts we were settled in the rooms I lived 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.390
 with ilja this groan numbers 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.090
 it's just something two huge beds on 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.960
 which sleep is a pleasure plasma 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.689
 bath 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.390
 sizes like half my room and this 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.479
 all in such a rich and beautiful style 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.970
 after a light start from the rooms and 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.490
 searches how to turn on the damn light in this 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.130
 we threw things over the room and drove to 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.369
 line of stalin which is 20 km 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.040
 from Minsk on it we had a tour 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.149
 we visited dota and her 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.219
 which dota 2 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.810
 but in that which was an important object 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.569
 able to resist German 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.790
 soldiers the hallmark of this 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.340
 places had the opportunity to touch everything 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.530
 by hands 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.170
 remember the inscriptions in museums do not hand 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.660
 touch so here it is not if 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.090
 worth the anti-aircraft gun on it, you can sit down and 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.220
 send to your friend if it is worth 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.400
 the tank is probably on him too 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.040
 climb to the word about tanks after the first 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.319
 of the trips we have been waiting two monster on 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.330
 which we were supposed to ride you 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.730
 you know the game is not visible to your size 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.010
 cars and everything is impossible to feel 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.010
 its power and when you are on top 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.440
 tank and has every chance of falling too and 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.650
 if you don't hold on tight it gives 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.329
 a very strong adrenaline rush and 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.730
 great delight of what is happening 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.890
 after skating we take a little pofotkalis 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.769
 and went to the field kitchen and after 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.829
 shoot from a different type of weapon further 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.049
 we are all years of riding in tanks and from the sea 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.180
 impressions go back to their hotel from 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.129
 we were literally 30 minutes of personal 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.379
 the time for which we brought ourselves in 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.480
 order a little rest and went on 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.910
 first floor to meet subscribers 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.730
 I personally did not expect that there will be so much 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.549
 people but for the golden league final them 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.319
 gathered very , very much by itself 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.569
 with him considering that I rarely make videos where 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.910
 trade face so to speak and if i 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.920
 doing it on my personal channel 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.889
 on wot-fan, I have not used my 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.319
 the person in general approached me not so 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.780
 many people but still it was nice when 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.750
 some people recognized you 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.660
 guys like moraz got more of it 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.150
 shaved head and beard of a terrorist find out 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.609
 from afar and instantly around it 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.919
 spawned crowd of people who wanted 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.049
 get a photo or autograph after 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:52.419
 meetings with subscribers I personally have a little 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.260
 watched the games from the final and already needed 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.569
 go to the banquet 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.389
 and the next day we went to the museum 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.099
 of great patriotic war honest 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.319
 it was very interesting 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.019
 fries that it was impossible to climb on the tank 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.690
 but if you want to know exactly more 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.630
 detailed war history here for you 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.180
 there will be tons of information after visiting 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.400
 the museum we had a personal time and after 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.600
 what we went to look at the final game 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.120
 golden leagues 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.970
 by the way there they gave us each 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.700
 T-shirts with scarf ipad 2 bonus code 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.160
 which I gave to my friends they are so 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.960
 asked to bring them something and now 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.910
 I want to touch on a very ambiguous 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.500
 the topic with the ending itself i'm like a man 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.810
 who plays a team battle and does 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.090
 The transfer of this can understand why in 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.670
 final meeting navi vs unity 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.740
 This is exactly what happened, but the whole problem 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.780
 that players typically play 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.180
 random battles and most could not 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.120
 understand what all the time the players are worth 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.420
 bushes i play mostly two games this 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.570
 tanks and dota and when people watched here 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.330
 same international 2014 they could somehow 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.790
 compare what is happening on the screen with 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.890
 what happens when they play 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.740
 and in tanks the trouble is that many do not 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.170
 watch games of the cyber sports part and they 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.750
 just don't understand why seven tanks 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.390
 what a strange lineups and why sim 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.490
 cards in a row was a draw i'm a man who 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.680
 understands that 50 thousand is at stake 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.810
 bucks namely get so much 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.970
 the winner can understand why na'vi not 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.370
 after all they went on the attack 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.130
 mistake then lose the advantage of one 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.130
 point and maybe they can not see this money 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.260
 unity also did not do so because 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.400
 if they lose, then everything will be 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.950
 finished and 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.560
 they will not see victory in the end all the cards 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:41.080
 the guys played extremely carefully were 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.300
 interesting moments but they were extremely 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.430
 little yet in the same dota goes 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.310
 constant action and chopper 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.230
 but here is not a sight for everyone 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.090
 should revise the rules for example 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.520
 after two threads tue card comes 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.430
 defense attack or even enter some 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.500
 rules for more action in any 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.790
 case, as they say , people should be given 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.580
 Meal'n'Real 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.950
 They are 7 nobody in a row but as I said 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.710
 I personally understand why the teams arrived 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.990
 just so and not otherwise they are not all 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.720
 quite liked it and the next 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.450
 the day I flew back to myself with a huge 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.910
 package of impressions and new friends 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.550
 You know, I think that the organizers of this 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:24.280
 the trip have achieved their goal all who were 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.370
 at the meeting have not just seen voices 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.470
 which speak video and people with whom 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.840
 can i communicate something i will come 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.240
 in general and in a sense have become more 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.430
 friendly and now I think that work 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.800
 will be even better and more fun 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.720
 in the end I want to say thanks to everyone who 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.790
 arranged a trip for us and 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.580
 scheduled entertainment 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:48.010
 also to those guys who staged this 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.890
 gorgeous golden league final on 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:53.320
 which was a lot of cool people 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:54.340
 thank you personally 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.890
 I will not forget 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.410
 but on this I have everything thank you all for 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.330
