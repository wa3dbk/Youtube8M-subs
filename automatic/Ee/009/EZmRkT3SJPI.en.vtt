00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
over here to the left to see how I made

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.740 
over here to the left to see how I made
the<00:00:27.990> five<00:00:28.260> gallon<00:00:28.680> containers<00:00:29.449> so<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.480> they

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
the five gallon containers so that they

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.520 
the five gallon containers so that they
are<00:00:30.990> self<00:00:31.320> watering<00:00:32.540> and<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.840> link<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.290> over

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
are self watering and that link is over

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.520 
are self watering and that link is over
to<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.680> left<00:00:35.059> and<00:00:38.329> these<00:00:39.329> are<00:00:39.660> basically<00:00:40.020> self

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
to the left and these are basically self

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.580 
to the left and these are basically self
watering<00:00:41.000> pots<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.450> cucumbers<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.469> them

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
watering pots with cucumbers in them

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.770 
watering pots with cucumbers in them
they<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> five<00:00:45.510> gallon<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.539> can't

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
they have a five gallon and you can't

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.660 
they have a five gallon and you can't
see<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.260> there<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:49.680> there's<00:00:49.890> water<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.489> there

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
see in there but there's water in there

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.119 
see in there but there's water in there
and<00:00:51.030> if<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.719> could<00:00:52.140> see<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.590> would<00:00:52.710> see<00:00:52.920> all

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
and if you could see you would see all

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.670 
and if you could see you would see all
the<00:00:53.370> root<00:00:53.640> systems<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> cucumber's<00:00:55.110> that

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the root systems of the cucumber's that

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.650 
the root systems of the cucumber's that
have<00:00:55.800> grown<00:00:56.070> through<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> holes<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.480> five

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
have grown through the holes in the five

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.299 
have grown through the holes in the five
gallon<00:00:57.899> bucket<00:00:58.469> and<00:01:01.100> basically<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.280> a

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
gallon bucket and basically have a

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.729 
gallon bucket and basically have a
constant<00:01:02.940> supply<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.270> water<00:01:03.600> now<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:04.710> have

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
constant supply of water now you do have

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.210 
constant supply of water now you do have
to<00:01:04.860> refill<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.519> because<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:06.110> for<00:01:07.220> three

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
to refill it because I have for three

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.210 
to refill it because I have for three
cucumber<00:01:08.820> plants<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.330> here<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.950> they<00:01:10.950> SAP

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
cucumber plants in here and they SAP

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.030 
cucumber plants in here and they SAP
quite<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> bit<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.850> water<00:01:12.409> got<00:01:13.409> them<00:01:13.530> growing<00:01:13.770> up

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
quite a bit of water got them growing up

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.310 
quite a bit of water got them growing up
my<00:01:14.189> fence<00:01:15.590> here<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.880> watermelon<00:01:18.140> they<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.290> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
my fence here is watermelon they have a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.109 
my fence here is watermelon they have a
smaller<00:01:19.770> bucket<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.400> they're<00:01:20.549> not<00:01:20.670> doing<00:01:21.000> as

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
smaller bucket so they're not doing as

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.670 
smaller bucket so they're not doing as
well<00:01:21.150> definitely<00:01:22.049> needs<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.320> little<00:01:22.560> bit

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
well definitely needs a little bit

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.740 
well definitely needs a little bit
larger<00:01:23.250> bucket<00:01:25.549> here's<00:01:26.549> some<00:01:26.820> more<00:01:27.030> cucumbers

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
larger bucket here's some more cucumbers

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.730 
larger bucket here's some more cucumbers
they<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> small<00:01:29.729> water<00:01:30.119> bottle

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
they just have a small water bottle

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.130 
they just have a small water bottle
instead<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.000> milk<00:01:33.000> jug<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.810> didn't

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
instead of a milk jug and that didn't

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.319 
instead of a milk jug and that didn't
work<00:01:34.170> as<00:01:34.470> well<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.579> definitely<00:01:35.700> suggest<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
work as well so I definitely suggest the

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.429 
work as well so I definitely suggest the
milk<00:01:36.570> jug<00:01:36.840> over<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.259> smaller<00:01:37.590> water<00:01:37.950> bottle

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
milk jug over the smaller water bottle

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.789 
milk jug over the smaller water bottle
here<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.619> corn<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:42.210> bucket<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.439> has<00:01:43.590> done

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
here is corn in a bucket and it has done

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.830 
here is corn in a bucket and it has done
well<00:01:44.030> I<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.450> not<00:01:45.689> have<00:01:45.899> any<00:01:46.399> water<00:01:47.600> jugs<00:01:48.600> in

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
well I do not have any water jugs in

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.330 
well I do not have any water jugs in
there<00:01:49.579> they<00:01:50.579> don't<00:01:50.790> require<00:01:51.299> as<00:01:51.570> much<00:01:51.780> water

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
there they don't require as much water

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.460 
there they don't require as much water
but<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.820> still<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.810> water<00:01:54.990> I'm<00:01:55.229> pretty

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
but I still have to water I'm pretty

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.550 
but I still have to water I'm pretty
often<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:56.369> because<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.969> small<00:01:57.869> thing<00:01:58.380> of

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
often just because it's a small thing of

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.120 
often just because it's a small thing of
dirt<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.540> it<00:02:00.540> dries<00:02:00.780> out<00:02:00.960> quickly<00:02:01.170> but

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
dirt and it dries out quickly but

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.469 
dirt and it dries out quickly but
they've<00:02:02.369> been<00:02:02.579> doing<00:02:02.729> well<00:02:03.030> we've<00:02:03.240> had<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.390> lot

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
they've been doing well we've had a lot

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.260 
they've been doing well we've had a lot
of<00:02:03.630> rain<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.229> that's<00:02:05.189> eased<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.790> burden<00:02:05.820> of

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
of rain and that's eased the burden of

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.089 
of rain and that's eased the burden of
watering<00:02:06.659> and

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
watering and

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.789 
watering and
another<00:02:09.579> little<00:02:09.849> one<00:02:10.060> over<00:02:10.179> here<00:02:10.659> he's<00:02:11.650> got

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
another little one over here he's got

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.759 
another little one over here he's got
some<00:02:12.069> corn<00:02:12.430> on<00:02:12.670> him<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:13.930> this<00:02:14.109> is<00:02:14.230> just<00:02:14.349> kind<00:02:14.469> of

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
some corn on him so this is just kind of

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.140 
some corn on him so this is just kind of
a<00:02:15.010> different<00:02:15.760> way<00:02:15.909> of<00:02:16.379> gardening<00:02:17.379> in<00:02:18.150> less

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
a different way of gardening in less

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.619 
a different way of gardening in less
space<00:02:20.129> here's<00:02:21.129> some<00:02:21.280> more<00:02:21.400> corn<00:02:21.790> there's<00:02:22.390> some

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
space here's some more corn there's some

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.990 
space here's some more corn there's some
beans<00:02:22.989> growing<00:02:23.799> there<00:02:24.569> but<00:02:25.569> just<00:02:26.439> an<00:02:26.620> idea<00:02:27.000> for

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
beans growing there but just an idea for

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.290 
beans growing there but just an idea for
gardening<00:02:28.569> in<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.900> city
