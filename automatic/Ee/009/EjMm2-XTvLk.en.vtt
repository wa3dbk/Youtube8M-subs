00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.830
 officer sat down and the players of the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.019
 inter were over what officiated fell on 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.760

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.280

 a good international player are 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.559
 returning 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.320
 Someone from Corinthians who seems to me 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.680
 douglas gets there and talks without cristian 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.449
 you are hurt and kindly helped 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:57.239
 retail grew 121 beijing 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:59.789
 now I always try to understand the climate the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.969
 environment the adrenaline the desire to come 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:07.409
 leaving a goal with 30 minutes back 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:12.240
 hope and the cristian was that the rest 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:16.380
 all else push pull looks at 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.270
 confusion that happened there is better 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.340
 doing corinthians or because the marking 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.909
 was wrong because the passage did not know 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.909
 what was going to happen 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.659
 alessandro 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.360
 so what was the profit that was 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.330
 Take out the confusion, this is what it is now 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.000
 clear will want to take someone with someone 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.159
 in case he looked like William who is there 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.190
 Quiet is not wanting to get into the 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.810
 confusion alessandro runs up 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.990
 But I did not hit anyone, either. 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.009
 running and body players look at the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.390
 cool and it was not so cold 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.360
 not reacting 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.060
 At no time I'm sorry for the bug 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.830
 trying to take away alessandro 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.289
 the corinthians players are a shame 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.020
 I was now at last I was going to catch 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.060
 I do not know how Christ was and was already 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.269
 replaced back pro game 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.190
 back to the field beats mouth again 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.350
 complete with which he had already discussed 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.450
 some time ago 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:23.090
 some still common sense try to separate 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.160
 but it's always an image you do not need 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.410
 have final game of the championship 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.870
 The problem now is a lot of blood because the 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.670
 case of the bug he fell fell too 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.350
 longer the replacement than the fire 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.480
 was playing well and the posture of the 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.580
 alessandro it is inconceivable that a player 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.200
 experienced is a player who left the 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.420
 aggression set out to fight 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.040
 Kiss necessarily a beautiful game of 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.140
 football in the state so far and 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.000
 unfortunately the bridge episodes is 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.450
 sad to the fan we like 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.190
 football is always bad staying never 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.090
 then no one makes a bridge informed the 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.800
 people missed 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.590
 we're going to tell you that the 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.120
 referee did this made the film not be 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.050
 This is good or bad. 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.420
 fernandes and white band gave nothing 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.310
 justifies athletes but I think the 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.890
 tendency unfortunately for nervousness 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.290
 Inter players in the first half 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.760
 that's exactly what could happen more 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.850
 I want to congratulate you, you see. 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.060
 the image means oh oh oh oh do 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.310
 William and he went there and it's no wonder he's 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.440
 a leading striker with a solid back 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.450
 face that's the thermometer of the team's 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.160
 corinthians is the reliable player of the 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.450
 It was like this in the club it has been like this. 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.980
 in corinthians you see the 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.140
 d'alessandro that the confusion at all 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.030
 moment at any moment it incites the 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.280
 violence, it comes out precisely to avoid 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.470
 this conclusion and the excuse posture 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.820
 player's posture in the French curriculum 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.760
 it was not because they did not retaliate 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:50.260
 they got out of the mess and left 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.260
 alessandro do all this role
