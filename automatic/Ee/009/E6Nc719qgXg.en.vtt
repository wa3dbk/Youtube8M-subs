it has triple waterproofing on the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.040 
it has triple waterproofing on the
inside<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.610> LEDs<00:00:35.969> are<00:00:36.180> waterproof<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
inside the LEDs are waterproof to the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.959 
inside the LEDs are waterproof to the
heatsink<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.590> then<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.399> course<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.790> have

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
heatsink and then of course you have

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.510 
heatsink and then of course you have
your<00:00:39.020> encapsulants<00:00:40.020> clear<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.040> case<00:00:41.100> and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
your encapsulants clear in this case and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.490 
your encapsulants clear in this case and
then<00:00:41.969> wrapped<00:00:42.270> around<00:00:42.450> by<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.840> sealed<00:00:43.200> box

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
then wrapped around by the sealed box

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.979 
then wrapped around by the sealed box
which<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.920> silicon<00:00:44.340> with<00:00:44.940> black<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.450> sealer<00:00:45.840> all

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
which is silicon with black a sealer all

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.959 
which is silicon with black a sealer all
the<00:00:46.079> way<00:00:46.170> around<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.430> idea<00:00:47.730> being

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
the way around that so the idea being

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.729 
the way around that so the idea being
that<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.780> want<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.200> run<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> long

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
that you want this to run for a long

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.330 
that you want this to run for a long
time<00:00:50.059> no<00:00:51.059> matter<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.480> happens<00:00:51.809> underwater

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
time no matter what happens underwater

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.770 
time no matter what happens underwater
while<00:00:53.340> some<00:00:53.640> water<00:00:53.820> may<00:00:54.030> come<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.629> and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
while some water may come up here and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.709 
while some water may come up here and
drop<00:00:54.930> some<00:00:55.110> water<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:56.090> take<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.210> out<00:00:57.329> put<00:00:57.570> it

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
drop some water on it take it out put it

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.840 
drop some water on it take it out put it
into<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> tank<00:00:58.140> sometimes<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:59.640> doesn't

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
into the tank sometimes it doesn't

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.569 
into the tank sometimes it doesn't
really<00:01:00.059> matter<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.600> should<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.050> fine<00:01:01.579> one

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
really matter it should be just fine one

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.270 
really matter it should be just fine one
of<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.789> neat<00:01:02.940> things<00:01:03.210> about<00:01:04.280> floating

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
of the neat things about floating

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.670 
of the neat things about floating
surface<00:01:05.939> scrubbers<00:01:06.479> like<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
surface scrubbers like this is the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.920 
surface scrubbers like this is the
ability<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.040> feed<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:08.490> fish<00:01:08.750> sometimes<00:01:09.750> it

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
ability to feed your fish sometimes it

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.570 
ability to feed your fish sometimes it
gets<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.320> full<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.710> algae<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.100> you'll<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.549> a

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
gets so full of algae that you'll have a

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.340 
gets so full of algae that you'll have a
little<00:01:11.820> bit<00:01:11.939> growing<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.420> your<00:01:12.540> light<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.320> I

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
little bit growing on your light so I

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.679 
little bit growing on your light so I
like<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:13.830> pick<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.310> off<00:01:14.490> here<00:01:14.939> maybe<00:01:15.390> rub

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
like to just pick it off here maybe rub

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.330 
like to just pick it off here maybe rub
it<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> fingernails<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.650> throw<00:01:17.189> that

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
it with the fingernails and throw that

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.190 
it with the fingernails and throw that
to<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> fish<00:01:17.790> or<00:01:18.119> maybe<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:18.780> drop<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.990> down

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
to the fish or maybe just drop that down

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200 
to the fish or maybe just drop that down
and<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.159> fish<00:01:20.340> will<00:01:20.490> start<00:01:20.700> eating<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.060> right

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
and the fish will start eating it right

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.090 
and the fish will start eating it right
off<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.750> light<00:01:22.049> they'll<00:01:22.650> actually<00:01:22.860> start

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
off of the light they'll actually start

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.219 
off of the light they'll actually start
associating<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.119> red<00:01:24.270> light<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.750> being<00:01:24.990> fed

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
associating the red light with being fed

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.620 
associating the red light with being fed
so<00:01:25.409> that's<00:01:25.590> pretty<00:01:25.830> neat<00:01:26.000> so<00:01:27.000> anyway<00:01:27.390> that

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
so that's pretty neat so anyway that

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.289 
so that's pretty neat so anyway that
that's<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.710> light<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.159> if<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.909> set<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
that's the light and if you set the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.179 
that's the light and if you set the
light<00:01:30.479> down<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.680> get<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.040> your

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
light down like to get it out of your

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.060 
light down like to get it out of your
way<00:01:32.840> don't<00:01:33.840> turn<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.259> upside<00:01:34.530> down<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:34.860> this

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
way don't turn it upside down like this

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.280 
way don't turn it upside down like this
because<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:36.240> want<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.509> heatsink<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.140> in

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
because you want the heatsink to be in

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.380 
because you want the heatsink to be in
the<00:01:37.380> air<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.820> set<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.150> something

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the air so I just set it on something

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.440 
the air so I just set it on something
like<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.840> or<00:01:40.280> hold<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.460> or<00:01:41.700> put<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.360> you're

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
like this or hold it or put it if you're

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.179 
like this or hold it or put it if you're
gonna<00:01:42.540> put<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:42.930> your<00:01:43.049> carpet<00:01:43.409> after<00:01:43.740> it's

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
gonna put it on your carpet after it's

outlets<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:20.550> can't<00:03:20.880> really<00:03:21.180> have<00:03:21.450> too<00:03:21.660> much

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
outlets you can't really have too much

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.140 
outlets you can't really have too much
air<00:03:22.110> all<00:03:22.709> right<00:03:22.770> if<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.220> pump<00:03:23.520> in<00:03:23.730> huge

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
air all right if you pump in huge

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.840 
air all right if you pump in huge
amounts<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.660> air<00:03:25.070> you'll<00:03:26.070> see<00:03:26.280> water<00:03:26.550> come<00:03:26.820> out

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
amounts of air you'll see water come out

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.510 
amounts of air you'll see water come out
of<00:03:27.090> here<00:03:27.330> but<00:03:27.870> that's<00:03:28.530> about<00:03:28.830> that's<00:03:29.340> not

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
of here but that's about that's not

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.650 
of here but that's about that's not
gonna<00:03:29.610> hurt<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.940> growth<00:03:30.150> that's<00:03:30.420> just<00:03:30.570> gonna

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
gonna hurt the growth that's just gonna

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.110 
gonna hurt the growth that's just gonna
be<00:03:30.840> bothering<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.380> so<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:32.520> pump<00:03:32.880> that<00:03:32.940> we

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
be bothering you so the pump that we

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.180 
be bothering you so the pump that we
still<00:03:33.330> has<00:03:33.480> an<00:03:33.630> adjustment<00:03:34.020> to<00:03:34.170> put<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.100> the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
still has an adjustment to put it to the

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.880 
still has an adjustment to put it to the
level<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.459> you<00:03:35.580> want<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:37.290> floating<00:03:37.650> level

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
level that you want the floating level

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.290 
level that you want the floating level
in<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.040> water<00:03:38.160> should<00:03:38.459> be<00:03:38.520> right<00:03:38.760> about<00:03:38.970> the

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
in the water should be right about the

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.330 
in the water should be right about the
middle<00:03:39.570> of<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.720> foam<00:03:39.990> here<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:40.530> that's<00:03:41.190> going

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
middle of the foam here and that's going

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.570 
middle of the foam here and that's going
to<00:03:41.400> put<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:41.760> right<00:03:42.330> about<00:03:42.510> here<00:03:43.580> one

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
to put it right about here one

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.670 
to put it right about here one
interesting<00:03:45.180> thing<00:03:45.290> because<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.440> growth

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
interesting thing because the growth

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.250 
interesting thing because the growth
gets<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.220> thick<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:47.820> traps<00:03:48.450> air<00:03:48.690> bubbles<00:03:49.080> in

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
gets so thick it traps air bubbles in

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.930 
gets so thick it traps air bubbles in
the<00:03:49.440> growth<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.950> starts<00:03:50.190> lifting<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.730> thing

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
the growth and starts lifting the thing

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.090 
the growth and starts lifting the thing
up<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.810> although<00:03:52.170> when<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:52.470> first<00:03:52.680> put<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:52.950> in

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
up so although when you first put it in

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.760 
up so although when you first put it in
your<00:03:53.250> water<00:03:53.430> it's<00:03:54.000> gonna<00:03:54.209> appear<00:03:54.750> if<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.500> go

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
your water it's gonna appear if you go

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.610 
your water it's gonna appear if you go
like<00:03:55.980> this<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.930> then<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.110> float<00:03:58.350> it<00:03:58.500> like

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
like this and then you float it like

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.500 
like this and then you float it like
that<00:03:58.800> and<00:03:59.070> you<00:03:59.220> kind<00:03:59.580> of<00:03:59.610> like<00:03:59.760> looking<00:04:00.120> inside

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
that and you kind of like looking inside

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.540 
that and you kind of like looking inside
you'll<00:04:01.260> see<00:04:01.350> that<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.709> water<00:04:01.920> seems<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.430> go

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
you'll see that the water seems to go

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.640 
you'll see that the water seems to go
too<00:04:02.610> high<00:04:03.000> once<00:04:03.690> it<00:04:03.780> starts<00:04:03.989> filling<00:04:04.200> up<00:04:04.410> that

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
too high once it starts filling up that

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.440 
too high once it starts filling up that
algae<00:04:05.250> will<00:04:05.370> start<00:04:05.550> pulling<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:05.940> up<00:04:06.030> like<00:04:06.209> this

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
algae will start pulling it up like this

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.570 
algae will start pulling it up like this
and<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:07.500> actual<00:04:07.709> float<00:04:08.130> level<00:04:08.430> will<00:04:08.550> probably

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
and the actual float level will probably

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.510 
and the actual float level will probably
drop<00:04:09.150> down<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:09.780> it's<00:04:10.590> designed<00:04:11.100> to<00:04:11.370> be

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
drop down so it's designed to be

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.910 
drop down so it's designed to be
variable<00:04:12.030> based<00:04:12.300> on<00:04:12.480> how<00:04:12.630> much<00:04:12.810> growth<00:04:13.709> you

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
variable based on how much growth you

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.610 
variable based on how much growth you
have<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:14.780> don't<00:04:15.780> try<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:16.020> change<00:04:16.260> anything

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
have and don't try to change anything

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.020 
have and don't try to change anything
until<00:04:17.010> you've<00:04:17.100> run<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:17.400> for<00:04:17.549> quite<00:04:17.730> a<00:04:17.790> while

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
until you've run it for quite a while

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.210 
until you've run it for quite a while
many<00:04:18.480> months<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:19.020> get<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.560> feel<00:04:19.799> for<00:04:19.830> how<00:04:20.100> it

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
many months you get a feel for how it

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.620 
many months you get a feel for how it
floats<00:04:20.459> when<00:04:20.669> it's<00:04:20.790> empty<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.180> when<00:04:21.479> it's

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
floats when it's empty and when it's

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.270 
floats when it's empty and when it's
full<00:04:22.310> so<00:04:24.110> as<00:04:25.110> far<00:04:25.320> as<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.620> rest<00:04:25.800> goes<00:04:26.070> it's

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
full so as far as the rest goes it's

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
full so as far as the rest goes it's
pretty<00:04:26.310> simple<00:04:26.820> here

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
pretty simple here

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.300 
pretty simple here
really<00:04:28.139> no<00:04:28.259> maintenance<00:04:28.470> required<00:04:31.310> comes

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
really no maintenance required comes

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.540 
really no maintenance required comes
with<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.639> tubing<00:04:33.800> with<00:04:34.800> these<00:04:35.039> little<00:04:35.250> clips

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
with the tubing with these little clips

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.450 
with the tubing with these little clips
to<00:04:35.789> keep<00:04:36.479> the<00:04:36.720> tubing<00:04:37.560> together<00:04:37.740> here<00:04:38.310> and

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
to keep the tubing together here and

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.050 
to keep the tubing together here and
here<00:04:39.680> these<00:04:40.680> little<00:04:41.039> attachments<00:04:41.729> here<00:04:41.910> are

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
here these little attachments here are

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.939 
here these little attachments here are
designed<00:04:42.509> that<00:04:42.780> so<00:04:43.080> that<00:04:43.289> if<00:04:43.410> you<00:04:43.560> do<00:04:43.710> need<00:04:43.830> to

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
designed that so that if you do need to

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.620 
designed that so that if you do need to
take<00:04:44.099> it<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.520> sink<00:04:44.759> or<00:04:44.970> remove<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.389> or<00:04:45.479> get

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
take it to the sink or remove it or get

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.629 
take it to the sink or remove it or get
it<00:04:45.720> out<00:04:45.810> of<00:04:45.930> your<00:04:46.020> way<00:04:46.169> all<00:04:46.919> you<00:04:47.069> need<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.280> do<00:04:47.430> is

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
it out of your way all you need to do is

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.700 
it out of your way all you need to do is
detach<00:04:48.270> these<00:04:48.720> with<00:04:48.990> your<00:04:49.169> thumb<00:04:49.470> and<00:04:49.650> then

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
detach these with your thumb and then

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.650 
detach these with your thumb and then
the<00:04:50.250> whole<00:04:50.400> thing<00:04:50.639> can<00:04:50.940> just<00:04:50.970> come<00:04:51.330> out<00:04:51.449> of<00:04:51.479> the

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
the whole thing can just come out of the

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.650 
the whole thing can just come out of the
water<00:04:51.870> and<00:04:52.080> it's<00:04:52.229> can<00:04:52.770> get<00:04:52.919> out<00:04:53.009> of<00:04:53.099> your<00:04:53.160> way

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
water and it's can get out of your way

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:03.649 
water and it's can get out of your way
so<00:04:54.660> let's<00:04:54.900> see<00:04:55.050> what<00:04:55.380> else<00:05:01.789> if<00:05:02.789> you<00:05:03.479> are

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
so let's see what else if you are

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:06.080 
so let's see what else if you are
setting<00:05:04.110> this<00:05:04.199> into<00:05:04.530> your<00:05:04.680> sink<00:05:04.949> let's<00:05:05.940> say

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
setting this into your sink let's say

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.969 
setting this into your sink let's say
you<00:05:06.150> do<00:05:06.360> get<00:05:06.509> dark<00:05:06.840> growth<00:05:07.169> black<00:05:07.680> growth

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
you do get dark growth black growth

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.110 
you do get dark growth black growth
because<00:05:08.220> you<00:05:08.340> have<00:05:08.460> extremely<00:05:08.940> high

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
because you have extremely high

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.510 
because you have extremely high
nutrients<00:05:09.810> you<00:05:10.409> take<00:05:10.620> this<00:05:10.740> to<00:05:10.919> your<00:05:10.949> sink<00:05:11.280> and

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
nutrients you take this to your sink and

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.490 
nutrients you take this to your sink and
you<00:05:11.699> want<00:05:11.880> to<00:05:12.030> use<00:05:12.360> a<00:05:12.389> toothbrush<00:05:12.960> to<00:05:13.169> clean<00:05:13.199> it

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
you want to use a toothbrush to clean it

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.860 
you want to use a toothbrush to clean it
that's<00:05:14.490> fine<00:05:14.759> the<00:05:14.940> first<00:05:15.090> couple<00:05:15.389> of<00:05:15.449> times<00:05:15.509> to

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
that's fine the first couple of times to

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.839 
that's fine the first couple of times to
get<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.110> black<00:05:16.380> growth<00:05:16.860> I<00:05:17.069> mean<00:05:17.280> black<00:05:17.520> like

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
get the black growth I mean black like

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.570 
get the black growth I mean black like
tar<00:05:17.900> black<00:05:18.900> like<00:05:19.139> this<00:05:19.409> you<00:05:20.130> do<00:05:20.250> want<00:05:20.430> to<00:05:20.460> get

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
tar black like this you do want to get

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.529 
tar black like this you do want to get
that<00:05:20.699> out<00:05:20.759> with<00:05:20.970> a<00:05:21.000> toothbrush<00:05:21.449> because

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
that out with a toothbrush because

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:22.820 
that out with a toothbrush because
that's<00:05:21.780> going<00:05:21.930> to<00:05:21.990> block<00:05:22.139> light<00:05:22.440> from<00:05:22.470> hitting

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
that's going to block light from hitting

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.249 
that's going to block light from hitting
the<00:05:22.949> rest<00:05:23.220> of<00:05:23.370> your<00:05:23.720> attachment<00:05:24.720> surfaces

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
the rest of your attachment surfaces

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.320 
the rest of your attachment surfaces
here<00:05:25.470> and<00:05:26.190> you<00:05:26.370> take<00:05:26.520> it<00:05:26.669> to<00:05:26.729> the<00:05:26.759> sink<00:05:27.030> and<00:05:27.180> set

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
here and you take it to the sink and set

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.700 
here and you take it to the sink and set
it<00:05:27.419> into<00:05:27.720> the<00:05:27.810> sink<00:05:28.050> just<00:05:28.380> keep<00:05:28.530> in<00:05:28.680> mind

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
it into the sink just keep in mind

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.439 
it into the sink just keep in mind
you've<00:05:29.039> got<00:05:29.069> these<00:05:29.430> air<00:05:29.729> tubes<00:05:30.000> down<00:05:30.180> there

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
you've got these air tubes down there

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:31.580 
you've got these air tubes down there
and<00:05:30.539> you<00:05:30.630> don't<00:05:30.720> want<00:05:30.900> to<00:05:30.990> squash<00:05:31.199> them<00:05:31.409> too

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
and you don't want to squash them too

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.540 
and you don't want to squash them too
much<00:05:31.770> okay

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
much okay

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.730 
much okay
so<00:05:33.030> set<00:05:33.240> it<00:05:33.270> down<00:05:33.479> take<00:05:33.840> a<00:05:33.870> tooth<00:05:34.169> brush<00:05:34.380> and

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
so set it down take a tooth brush and

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.800 
so set it down take a tooth brush and
then<00:05:35.250> just<00:05:35.280> clean<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.789> sides<00:05:36.000> clean<00:05:36.360> all<00:05:36.570> the

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
then just clean the sides clean all the

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.330 
then just clean the sides clean all the
black<00:05:36.990> stuff<00:05:37.320> off<00:05:37.590> you<00:05:37.800> don't<00:05:37.919> ever<00:05:38.070> want

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
black stuff off you don't ever want

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.330 
black stuff off you don't ever want
black<00:05:38.639> stuff<00:05:38.969> on<00:05:39.210> your<00:05:39.830> attachments<00:05:40.830> or<00:05:41.039> your

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
black stuff on your attachments or your

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.040 
black stuff on your attachments or your
ribbons<00:05:41.729> so<00:05:42.360> you'll<00:05:42.479> just<00:05:42.509> have<00:05:42.690> to<00:05:42.840> kind<00:05:42.990> of

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
ribbons so you'll just have to kind of

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.659 
ribbons so you'll just have to kind of
go<00:05:43.169> like<00:05:43.380> this<00:05:43.560> to<00:05:43.770> get<00:05:43.889> the<00:05:44.009> black<00:05:44.190> stuff<00:05:44.430> off

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669

go like this to get the black stuff off
and<00:05:44.909> that<00:05:45.360> black<00:05:45.599> stuff<00:05:45.900> if<00:05:46.289> you<00:05:46.500> have<00:05:46.650> had

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
and that black stuff if you have had

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.529 
and that black stuff if you have had
extremely<00:05:47.400> high<00:05:47.550> nutrients<00:05:48.150> in<00:05:48.240> your<00:05:48.270> tank

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
extremely high nutrients in your tank

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.170 
extremely high nutrients in your tank
for<00:05:48.750> years<00:05:48.990> or<00:05:49.289> decades<00:05:49.520> that<00:05:50.520> means<00:05:50.880> the

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
for years or decades that means the

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.879 
for years or decades that means the
black<00:05:51.389> stuff<00:05:51.659> is<00:05:51.900> pulling<00:05:52.259> the<00:05:52.349> nutrients<00:05:52.800> out

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
black stuff is pulling the nutrients out

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:54.709 
black stuff is pulling the nutrients out
of<00:05:53.039> the<00:05:53.099> water<00:05:53.310> and<00:05:53.550> it's<00:05:54.240> going<00:05:54.419> and

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:54.719 
of the water and it's going and

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:57.080 
of the water and it's going and
attaching<00:05:55.169> here<00:05:55.380> so<00:05:55.710> by<00:05:55.889> using<00:05:56.490> a<00:05:56.699> toothbrush

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
attaching here so by using a toothbrush

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.540 
attaching here so by using a toothbrush
into<00:05:57.360> the<00:05:57.569> sink<00:05:57.810> it's<00:05:58.229> going<00:05:58.560> to<00:05:58.740> be<00:05:59.310> pulling

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
into the sink it's going to be pulling

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.129 
into the sink it's going to be pulling
the<00:05:59.699> nutrients<00:06:00.090> out<00:06:00.180> of<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.360> water<00:06:00.599> and

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
the nutrients out of the water and

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.260 
the nutrients out of the water and
eventually<00:06:01.560> eventually<00:06:02.069> you'll<00:06:02.430> see<00:06:02.699> that

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
eventually eventually you'll see that

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.260 
eventually eventually you'll see that
the<00:06:03.930> green<00:06:04.199> will<00:06:04.409> overtake<00:06:04.830> the<00:06:05.130> black<00:06:05.490> okay

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
the green will overtake the black okay

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.149 
the green will overtake the black okay
even<00:06:06.840> sometimes<00:06:07.229> in<00:06:07.409> the<00:06:07.530> same<00:06:07.740> unit<00:06:08.039> you'll

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159 
even sometimes in the same unit you'll

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.800 
even sometimes in the same unit you'll
have<00:06:08.310> some<00:06:08.490> black<00:06:08.669> on<00:06:08.880> the<00:06:08.969> bottom<00:06:09.120> and<00:06:09.419> the

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
have some black on the bottom and the

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.390 
have some black on the bottom and the
green<00:06:09.990> will<00:06:10.199> overtake<00:06:10.560> it<00:06:10.770> and<00:06:10.949> start<00:06:11.159> filling

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
green will overtake it and start filling

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.219 
green will overtake it and start filling
it<00:06:11.580> in<00:06:11.729> in<00:06:12.240> that<00:06:12.360> case<00:06:12.599> you<00:06:12.780> can<00:06:12.930> just<00:06:12.960> maybe

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
it in in that case you can just maybe

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:14.899 
it in in that case you can just maybe
get<00:06:13.469> a<00:06:13.500> little<00:06:13.560> bit<00:06:13.919> of<00:06:14.039> the<00:06:14.130> black<00:06:14.340> off<00:06:14.580> and

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:14.909 
get a little bit of the black off and

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:17.300 
get a little bit of the black off and
leave<00:06:15.180> the<00:06:15.330> green<00:06:15.680> so<00:06:16.680> I<00:06:16.710> think<00:06:16.800> that's<00:06:17.130> it

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
leave the green so I think that's it

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.700 
leave the green so I think that's it
enough<00:06:17.639> for<00:06:17.849> now<00:06:17.969> just<00:06:18.810> leave<00:06:19.380> the<00:06:19.500> light<00:06:19.680> on

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
enough for now just leave the light on

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.029 
enough for now just leave the light on
put<00:06:20.250> on<00:06:20.280> a<00:06:20.370> timer<00:06:20.759> for<00:06:21.030> 12<00:06:21.719> to<00:06:21.930> 22<00:06:22.289> hours<00:06:22.469> a<00:06:22.800> week

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
put on a timer for 12 to 22 hours a week

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:25.520 
put on a timer for 12 to 22 hours a week
and<00:06:23.250> you<00:06:24.030> can<00:06:24.150> start<00:06:24.360> around<00:06:24.630> 18<00:06:24.930> hours<00:06:25.259> is

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
and you can start around 18 hours is

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.050 
and you can start around 18 hours is
probably<00:06:25.949> a<00:06:26.069> good<00:06:26.219> one<00:06:26.400> the<00:06:26.490> instructions<00:06:26.940> are

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
probably a good one the instructions are

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.370 
probably a good one the instructions are
