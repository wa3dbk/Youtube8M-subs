00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
all this extra space I have and then

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.460 
all this extra space I have and then
another<00:01:06.420> thing<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.960> do<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.350> can

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
another thing you can do is you can

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.030 
another thing you can do is you can
reshape<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.320> messed<00:01:10.560> up<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.890> little

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
reshape the if you messed up a little

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.380 
reshape the if you messed up a little
bit<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:11.549> go<00:01:11.760> ahead<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.000> reshape

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
bit you can just go ahead and reshape

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.620 
bit you can just go ahead and reshape
because<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:12.810> coloring<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.200> black<00:01:13.439> anyways

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
because it's coloring in black anyways

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.270 
because it's coloring in black anyways
so<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.049> continue<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.860> color<00:01:17.100> in

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
so you can just continue and color in

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:26.160 
so you can just continue and color in
the<00:01:17.369> whole<00:01:17.640> thing

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:38.310 

I'm<00:01:27.170> almost<00:01:27.380> done<00:01:27.740> here

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.400 

and<00:01:39.310> there<00:01:39.520> you<00:01:39.580> go<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:40.000> then<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.870> next<00:01:41.200> part

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
and there you go and then the next part

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.630 
and there you go and then the next part
we're<00:01:41.800> going<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:41.950> draw<00:01:42.190> two<00:01:42.730> little<00:01:43.090> dot<00:01:43.750> eyes

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
we're going to draw two little dot eyes

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.850 
we're going to draw two little dot eyes
just<00:01:45.640> like<00:01:45.880> that<00:01:46.090> one<00:01:46.330> on<00:01:46.450> each<00:01:46.690> eyebrow<00:01:47.530> I

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
just like that one on each eyebrow I

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.820 
just like that one on each eyebrow I

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
guess and then for the beak which is the

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.190 
guess and then for the beak which is the
last<00:01:51.040> part<00:01:51.280> here<00:01:51.690> we're<00:01:52.690> just<00:01:52.870> going<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.050> want
