00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 just now frédéric antonetti was 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.650
 in the attack and he reminded 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.759
 louis there twenty years first 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.570
 final league cup 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.950
 I had Sebastian and Bastia had done 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.230
 to smoke with a goal of drogba gnac 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.700
 valid refused Toul and was 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.410
 recalled that this match had been 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.570
 totally party organized by the psg 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.830
 stayed at the park and the father is by 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.199
 example of a rose a finality to holds to 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.480
 people for the locker room draw 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.769
 people like that who have spread this 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.570
 is playing but next to that in Paris 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.530
 had largely dominated that time he 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.680
 had scored a fabulous goal 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.270
 as for the final at the park of the princes 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.890
 it's true that it was like that and that 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.910
 it was a little surprising but it is 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.820
 plays in the park of princes who was the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.200
 psg stage that is played in paris that have 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.730
 the habit of things that it is abnormal 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.020
 Do not be fooled 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.320
 denis 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.390
 that is, it is rather a small 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.380
 little 6 inch tv his shirt and paris is the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.960
 even on people who do not know 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.850
 Paris and the psg say it I want 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.050
 like roland who insist with that and 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.970
 then even according to him proves by a + 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.230
 drink he does not care what to say is that 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.880
 it's not like that but then no but 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.580
 it's not the same contact was not happening 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.810
 names but daniel that you have to 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.250
 understand one thing is that for 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.140
 someone from a region 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.570
 French who is not the age he wants 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:26.080
 to say I love paris I was born there how 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:28.090
 paris gilbert barth united how am i 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.260
 okay here the Parisians you do 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.880
 the final martigues 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.880
 you do not use it, you understand 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.750
 yes but no I do not see overestimating 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.660
 the end of the mouths of the rhone mouths 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.660
 of the rhone it is marseille at the head of turkish 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.450
 frankly I'm scared by your 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.530
 are crazy how does one say at the height of 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.360
 view minute we look you 're not going 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.170
 not studied sociology before speaking 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.950
 supporters in seine saint denis 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.479
 historically there are more supporters 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.920
 of the om that paris Saint-Germain already 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.700
 if you do not know that you do not know 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:14.710
 nothing and secondly so we are 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:18.390
 cons elsewhere scene denis is that in 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.390
 do you understand you 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.330
 ok no but continues and to his hit 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.099
 parades are in the commentary of 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.500
 France in knee foot analysis 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.599
 that before finally it suffices dd com - 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.120
 should we continue in your nonsense I 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.120
 I'm scared by what you say that 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.090
 laughs at telling you things we've seen 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.380
 it's crazy but we're just eight 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.780
 minutes of after so if we do ten 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.760
 minutes the fall was zero in history 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.769
 and geography it took me years 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.200
 later roland tell me i 'm going 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.150
 explain to you Roland located in the stadium 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.560
 Spanish is a trick because 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.170
 I was younger will not benefit 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.819
 barcelona you know that by leaving I 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.360
 prefer the game tonight I do not care 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.160
 no but you do not care norman and that 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.599
 closer to marseille than paris it him 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.959
 makes the final to the cat should benefit 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.959
 the 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:22.010
 it's not true no I 'm under the label 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:26.150
 hovering he is too smart 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.920
 get all the stuff because I like it 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.660
 I'm listening to you, family banon tribune 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.490
 so much that I'm counting on 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.680
 explain to me that we did not know a 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.100
 second to paris club that plays in St. 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.510
 denis 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.250
 since you want to make the comparison 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.540
 between espanyol barcelona that's what you 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.760
 go tell me bah then you go with toulon 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.060
 it's better with toulon we talk about the 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.740
 match 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.860
 right now I did not know that there 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.370
 from paris denis b gentlemen for you 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.890
 to agree on 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.240
 listen to that very very complicated very very 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.709
 very complicated for these two teams I 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.180
 think that the team that will receive will have 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:58.250
 maybe more at home to play 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.660
 at home you want it is roland in 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.430
 england the finals are played at 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.450
 wembley no london club has ever 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.450
 been favored to play at wembley 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.750
 until now explain to us that now 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.100
