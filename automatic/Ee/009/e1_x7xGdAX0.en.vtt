00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
toothpick and you want to drag the edges

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.370 
toothpick and you want to drag the edges

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
okay so I pushed out the edges down this

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.090 
okay so I pushed out the edges down this
is<00:01:42.540> what<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.780> looks<00:01:42.960> like<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.439> don't<00:01:43.950> know<00:01:44.009> if

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
is what it looks like I don't know if

is what it looks like I don't know if
you<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.310> see<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:44.850> there's<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> little

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
you can see but there's like a little

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.700 
you can see but there's like a little
cracking<00:01:46.500> effect<00:01:46.890> um<00:01:47.659> here<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.680> see

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
cracking effect um here so you can see

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.030 
cracking effect um here so you can see
this<00:01:49.920> little<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.369> cracks<00:01:50.790> kind<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:52.020> um<00:01:52.799> it

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
this little like cracks kind of so um it

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.289 
this little like cracks kind of so um it
doesn't<00:01:53.220> matter<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.610> has<00:01:53.729> those<00:01:53.939> because

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
doesn't matter if it has those because

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.179 
doesn't matter if it has those because
you<00:01:54.899> kind<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.140> wanted<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.500> have<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.070> it

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
you kind of wanted to have it so it

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.209 
you kind of wanted to have it so it
looks<00:01:56.460> more<00:01:56.719> realistic<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.259> then<00:01:58.710> what<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.040> do

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
looks more realistic and then what I do

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.840 
looks more realistic and then what I do
is<00:01:59.250> get<00:01:59.640> your<00:01:59.729> tin<00:01:59.939> foil<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.770> texture<00:02:01.850> around

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
is get your tin foil and texture around

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.560 
is get your tin foil and texture around
the<00:02:03.060> screen<00:02:03.290> so<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.469> wanted<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.860> bit<00:02:05.040> around

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
the screen so I just wanted a bit around

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.240 
the screen so I just wanted a bit around
and<00:02:06.570> if<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.290> don't<00:02:07.469> want<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.649> use<00:02:07.770> foil<00:02:07.979> you

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
and if you don't want to use foil you

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.919 
and if you don't want to use foil you

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
can use sandpaper because that works

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.030 
can use sandpaper because that works
perfectly<00:02:10.470> fine<00:02:10.739> as<00:02:10.950> well<00:02:11.099> so

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
ball and then stick it into this creep

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.229 
ball and then stick it into this creep
this<00:03:00.099> will<00:03:00.280> just<00:03:00.310> make<00:03:00.459> a<00:03:00.579> more<00:03:00.819> secure<00:03:01.150> and

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
this will just make a more secure and

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
you'll stay better so once you put the

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.670 
you'll stay better so once you put the
two<00:03:04.150> pieces<00:03:04.180> then<00:03:04.780> you<00:03:04.989> want<00:03:05.169> to<00:03:05.260> use<00:03:05.560> your

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
two pieces then you want to use your

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.089 
two pieces then you want to use your
foil<00:03:05.980> again<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.639> texture<00:03:07.150> there<00:03:07.299> is<00:03:07.389> as<00:03:07.599> well

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
foil again and texture there is as well
