position of rods and your position rod

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.839 
position of rods and your position rod
is<00:00:13.769> very<00:00:13.980> very<00:00:14.190> important<00:00:14.580> while<00:00:14.700> you're

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
is very very important while you're

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.730 
is very very important while you're
fishing<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.450> there's<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.960> few<00:00:16.139> simple<00:00:16.379> things

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
fishing and there's a few simple things

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.099 
fishing and there's a few simple things
you<00:00:16.890> could<00:00:17.070> do<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.430> know<00:00:17.850> this<00:00:18.449> rods<00:00:18.690> got<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.930> nice

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
you could do I know this rods got a nice

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.370 
you could do I know this rods got a nice
cork<00:00:19.410> handle<00:00:19.800> here<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.369> might<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:21.150> might

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
cork handle here and you might you might

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.929 
cork handle here and you might you might
feel<00:00:22.380> obligated<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:23.070> hold<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.550> there<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.850> that

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
feel obligated to hold it there in that

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.380 
feel obligated to hold it there in that
position<00:00:24.180> but<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.050> really<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> look<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.640> a

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
position but that really is a look is a

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.720 
position but that really is a look is a
poor<00:00:27.779> position<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.529> picked<00:00:29.099> up<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.310> rock<00:00:29.340> there

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
poor position I picked up a rock there

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.120 
poor position I picked up a rock there
is<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.210> poor<00:00:30.570> position<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:31.590> hold<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.949> rod

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
is a poor position to hold the rod

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.069 
is a poor position to hold the rod
because<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.059> gives<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.329> less<00:00:33.480> leverage<00:00:33.899> for

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
because it gives you less leverage for

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.290 
because it gives you less leverage for
hook<00:00:34.230> setting<00:00:34.590> look<00:00:35.040> now<00:00:35.280> if<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.910> hold<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.239> up

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
hook setting look now if you hold it up

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.540 
hook setting look now if you hold it up
front<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.739> gives<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.160> little<00:00:38.460> more

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
front here it gives you a little more

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.420 
front here it gives you a little more
power<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:39.270> your<00:00:39.540> rip<00:00:39.780> jigging<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.219> rip

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
power if your rip jigging you can rip

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.459 
power if your rip jigging you can rip
jig<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.629> that's<00:00:42.930> really<00:00:43.290> good

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
jig like so and that that's really good

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.799 
jig like so and that that's really good
but<00:00:43.770> some<00:00:44.100> people<00:00:44.460> with<00:00:44.610> bigger<00:00:44.820> hands<00:00:45.360> might

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
but some people with bigger hands might

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.930 
but some people with bigger hands might
have<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.020> tendency<00:00:46.530> for<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.190> bail<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.640> hit<00:00:47.760> your

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
have a tendency for the bail to hit your

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.990 
have a tendency for the bail to hit your
knuckles<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:49.010> that<00:00:50.010> can't<00:00:50.219> sometimes<00:00:50.610> that's

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
knuckles and that can't sometimes that's

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.529 
knuckles and that can't sometimes that's
not<00:00:51.180> fun

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
not fun

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.569 
not fun
so<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.739> best<00:00:52.920> ways<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:53.399> to

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
so one of the best ways that I like to

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.490 
so one of the best ways that I like to
hold<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> rod<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.300> basically<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:55.440> between

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
hold the rod is basically in between

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.220 
hold the rod is basically in between
those<00:00:56.100> two<00:00:56.309> fingers<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.329> slide<00:00:57.600> you

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
those two fingers I like the slide you

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.040 
those two fingers I like the slide you
see<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> rod<00:00:58.800> right<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.730> there<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.600> put

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
see the rod right in there like so I put

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.529 
see the rod right in there like so I put
my<00:01:01.170> thumb<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.820> cork<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> rod

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
my thumb on the on the cork of the rod

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.179 
my thumb on the on the cork of the rod
like<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.290> then<00:01:04.409> I'm<00:01:04.559> now<00:01:04.739> I'm<00:01:04.890> ready<00:01:05.100> to

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189

fish and once you've done that the first

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.859 
fish and once you've done that the first
thing<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.060> should<00:01:09.090> always<00:01:09.330> do<00:01:09.659> when<00:01:09.840> you're

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
want to have that drag set tight for the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.310 
want to have that drag set tight for the
hook<00:01:20.759> set<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.540> I'm<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.750> going<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.930> tighten<00:01:22.259> up

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
hook set so I'm just going to tighten up

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.120 
hook set so I'm just going to tighten up
on<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.650> drag<00:01:23.420> still<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.479> bit<00:01:24.720> loose<00:01:25.130> there

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
on that drag still a bit loose there

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.800 
on that drag still a bit loose there
that's<00:01:26.369> that's<00:01:26.700> about<00:01:26.939> perfect<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.600> not

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
that's that's about perfect it's not

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.560 
that's that's about perfect it's not
totally<00:01:28.500> totally<00:01:28.920> tight<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.210> don't<00:01:30.360> want

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
totally totally tight and you don't want

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.240 
totally totally tight and you don't want
your<00:01:30.630> drag<00:01:30.960> all<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.409> way<00:01:31.500> totally<00:01:31.829> tight
