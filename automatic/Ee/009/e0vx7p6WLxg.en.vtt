00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.010 

so<00:00:01.890> I<00:00:01.920> spent<00:00:02.310> this<00:00:02.580> morning<00:00:02.820> getting<00:00:03.240> my<00:00:03.510> GE

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
so I spent this morning getting my GE

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.740 
so I spent this morning getting my GE
color<00:00:04.529> effects<00:00:04.970> holiday<00:00:05.970> lighting<00:00:06.270> strands

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
color effects holiday lighting strands

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.890 
color effects holiday lighting strands
to<00:00:07.140> be<00:00:08.010> controlled<00:00:08.460> through<00:00:08.580> my<00:00:08.970> macbook<00:00:09.630> pro

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
to be controlled through my macbook pro

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.539 
to be controlled through my macbook pro
and<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:11.160> way<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.340> did<00:00:11.700> this<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:13.040> I<00:00:14.040> cut<00:00:14.429> the

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
and the way I did this is I cut the

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.000 
and the way I did this is I cut the
string<00:00:14.820> apart<00:00:15.179> here<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.560> added<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.980> little

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
string apart here and I added a little

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.269 
string apart here and I added a little
custom<00:00:17.880> circuit<00:00:18.300> board<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.779> built<00:00:19.279> this

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
custom circuit board that I built this

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.230 
custom circuit board that I built this
board<00:00:20.609> receives<00:00:21.199> basically<00:00:22.340> the<00:00:23.340> G<00:00:23.609> color<00:00:24.000> FX

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
board receives basically the G color FX

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.810 
board receives basically the G color FX
protocol<00:00:24.840> but<00:00:25.080> receives<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.560> as<00:00:25.680> an<00:00:25.830> rs422

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
protocol but receives it as an rs422

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.509 
protocol but receives it as an rs422
level<00:00:27.150> signal<00:00:27.830> then<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:28.980> board<00:00:29.220> just<00:00:29.340> takes

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
level signal then this board just takes

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.640 
level signal then this board just takes
the<00:00:29.580> rs-422<00:00:30.449> single<00:00:30.810> converts<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.289> down<00:00:31.439> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the rs-422 single converts it down to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.690 
the rs-422 single converts it down to
3.3<00:00:32.309> volt<00:00:32.520> signal<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.090> feeds<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
3.3 volt signal and feeds it to the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.819 
3.3 volt signal and feeds it to the
first<00:00:35.700> bulb<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.329> string<00:00:36.719> even<00:00:37.680> though

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
first bulb and the string even though

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.520 
first bulb and the string even though
the<00:00:38.190> stock<00:00:38.460> controller<00:00:38.820> works<00:00:39.480> with<00:00:39.780> 5<00:00:40.110> volts

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the stock controller works with 5 volts
