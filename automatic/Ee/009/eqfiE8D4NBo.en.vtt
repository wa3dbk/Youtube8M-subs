00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
white area a little too thick whereas

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.410 
white area a little too thick whereas
the<00:02:44.210> original<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:44.810> nice<00:02:44.990> and<00:02:45.230> sleek<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:46.420> the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
the original is nice and sleek and the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.120 
the original is nice and sleek and the
retro<00:02:47.840> had<00:02:48.020> a<00:02:48.050> little<00:02:48.320> bit<00:02:48.470> more<00:02:48.500> padding<00:02:49.040> on

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
retro had a little bit more padding on

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.960 
retro had a little bit more padding on
the<00:02:49.270> ankle<00:02:50.270> area<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:51.740> another<00:02:52.160> thing<00:02:52.430> that

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
the ankle area the another thing that

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.880 
the ankle area the another thing that
was<00:02:53.120> interesting<00:02:53.270> is<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.870> original<00:02:54.380> had<00:02:54.650> like

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
was interesting is the original had like

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.420 
was interesting is the original had like
this<00:02:55.640> little<00:02:55.750> bulge<00:02:56.750> on<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.830> outside<00:02:58.220> of<00:02:58.340> the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
this little bulge on the outside of the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.120 
this little bulge on the outside of the
shoe<00:02:58.670> I<00:02:58.910> guess<00:02:59.240> for<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.540> better<00:02:59.890> like<00:03:00.890> if<00:03:01.040> you

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
shoe I guess for a better like if you

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.550 
shoe I guess for a better like if you
were<00:03:01.220> gonna<00:03:01.340> make<00:03:01.520> a<00:03:01.580> cut<00:03:02.210> a<00:03:02.390> quick<00:03:02.720> cut<00:03:02.990> and

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
were gonna make a cut a quick cut and

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.860 
were gonna make a cut a quick cut and
you<00:03:03.920> had<00:03:04.100> you<00:03:04.490> know<00:03:04.610> obviously<00:03:05.270> the<00:03:05.390> tennis

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
you had you know obviously the tennis

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.680 
you had you know obviously the tennis
was<00:03:06.350> Agassiz<00:03:07.130> shoe<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:08.030> if<00:03:08.120> he<00:03:08.240> was<00:03:08.360> gonna<00:03:08.450> make

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
was Agassiz shoe so if he was gonna make

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.810 
was Agassiz shoe so if he was gonna make
a<00:03:08.720> quick<00:03:09.320> cut<00:03:09.710> to<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:09.980> outside<00:03:10.400> or<00:03:10.610> something

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
a quick cut to the outside or something

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.540 
a quick cut to the outside or something
he'd<00:03:11.750> have<00:03:11.930> better<00:03:12.200> traction<00:03:12.530> better<00:03:13.100> control

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
he'd have better traction better control

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.210 
he'd have better traction better control
was<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.540> retro<00:03:14.990> didn't<00:03:15.230> had<00:03:15.410> that<00:03:15.440> but<00:03:15.950> it

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
was the retro didn't had that but it

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:24.240 
was the retro didn't had that but it
really<00:03:16.280> didn't<00:03:16.790> need<00:03:16.910> it<00:03:19.210> the<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:22.190> retro<00:03:22.940> is

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
really didn't need it the the retro is

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.240 
really didn't need it the the retro is
height<00:03:25.250> wise<00:03:25.520> I<00:03:25.550> think<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.120> retro<00:03:26.510> was<00:03:26.750> a

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
height wise I think the retro was a

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:36.040 
height wise I think the retro was a
slightly<00:03:28.250> higher<00:03:28.730> cut<00:03:32.140> and<00:03:34.060> well<00:03:35.060> now<00:03:35.690> looking

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
slightly higher cut and well now looking

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.670 
slightly higher cut and well now looking
at<00:03:36.200> it<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.860> retro<00:03:37.400> was<00:03:37.810> almost<00:03:38.810> six<00:03:39.110> inches<00:03:39.260> in

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
at it the retro was almost six inches in

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.650 
at it the retro was almost six inches in
height<00:03:40.060> from<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.150> bottom<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:43.510> there's<00:03:44.510> a

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
height from the bottom and there's a

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.990 
height from the bottom and there's a
pretty<00:03:44.900> much<00:03:45.110> similar<00:03:45.620> in<00:03:45.740> height<00:03:45.860> to<00:03:46.130> the

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
pretty much similar in height to the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.060 
pretty much similar in height to the
Nike<00:03:47.600> did<00:03:47.870> a<00:03:47.959> good<00:03:48.110> job<00:03:48.170> when<00:03:48.530> he's<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.890> only

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
Nike did a good job when he's the only

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.630 
Nike did a good job when he's the only
the<00:03:49.670> only<00:03:49.730> gripe<00:03:50.090> that<00:03:50.300> I<00:03:50.330> really<00:03:50.660> had<00:03:50.840> was<00:03:51.140> the

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
the only gripe that I really had was the

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.880 
the only gripe that I really had was the
the<00:03:52.640> toe<00:03:52.910> box<00:03:53.150> which<00:03:53.930> they<00:03:54.110> corrected<00:03:54.560> for<00:03:54.860> the

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
the toe box which they corrected for the

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.750 
the toe box which they corrected for the
clay<00:03:55.730> tar<00:03:56.060> colorway<00:03:56.510> so<00:03:57.100> that's<00:03:58.100> the<00:03:58.310> only

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
clay tar colorway so that's the only

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.660 
clay tar colorway so that's the only
issue<00:03:59.000> that<00:03:59.209> I<00:03:59.420> had<00:03:59.720> only<00:04:00.410> issue<00:04:00.800> the<00:04:01.160> colors

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
issue that I had only issue the colors

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.460 
issue that I had only issue the colors
were<00:04:01.910> pretty<00:04:02.209> much<00:04:02.420> dead<00:04:02.630> on<00:04:02.660> everything<00:04:03.290> else

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
were pretty much dead on everything else

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.250 
were pretty much dead on everything else
was<00:04:03.590> pretty<00:04:03.740> much<00:04:03.950> dead<00:04:04.220> on<00:04:04.720> all<00:04:05.720> around<00:04:06.110> it

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
was pretty much dead on all around it

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.710 
was pretty much dead on all around it

the<00:04:32.870> toe<00:04:33.710> box<00:04:33.919> is<00:04:34.130> too<00:04:34.460> bulky<00:04:34.820> it's<00:04:35.300> too<00:04:35.900> high

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
the toe box is too bulky it's too high

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.430 
the toe box is too bulky it's too high
so<00:04:37.280> when<00:04:37.729> you<00:04:37.850> go<00:04:38.030> to<00:04:38.060> walk<00:04:38.479> in<00:04:38.660> them<00:04:38.810> they<00:04:39.110> it

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
so when you go to walk in them they it

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.750 
so when you go to walk in them they it
folds<00:04:39.979> in<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:40.430> it<00:04:41.360> causes<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:43.220> shooter<00:04:43.550> look

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
folds in and it causes the shooter look

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.080 
folds in and it causes the shooter look
you<00:04:44.060> know<00:04:44.470> beat<00:04:45.470> up<00:04:45.650> quick<00:04:45.979> in<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:46.880> toe<00:04:47.060> area

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
you know beat up quick in the toe area

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.560 
you know beat up quick in the toe area
anyway<00:04:49.150> they're<00:04:50.150> not<00:04:50.449> that<00:04:50.660> comfortable<00:04:51.080> the

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
anyway they're not that comfortable the

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.680 
anyway they're not that comfortable the
hot<00:04:53.570> lava<00:04:53.750> cut<00:04:54.080> away<00:04:54.290> but<00:04:55.180> it's<00:04:56.180> it's<00:04:56.479> not

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
hot lava cut away but it's it's not

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.620 
hot lava cut away but it's it's not
unbearable<00:04:57.530> I<00:04:57.710> mean<00:04:58.130> they're<00:04:58.970> more

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
unbearable I mean they're more

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.120 
unbearable I mean they're more
comfortable<00:04:59.870> than<00:05:00.229> a<00:05:00.320> pair<00:05:00.500> of<00:05:00.530> Jordan<00:05:00.919> ones

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
comfortable than a pair of Jordan ones

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.640 
comfortable than a pair of Jordan ones
they<00:05:01.789> even<00:05:02.210> probably<00:05:02.750> more<00:05:02.960> comfortable<00:05:03.440> than

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
they even probably more comfortable than

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.860 
they even probably more comfortable than
the<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:05.840> new<00:05:06.110> Air<00:05:06.590> Max<00:05:06.860> 90<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.820> 2010<00:05:08.570> release
