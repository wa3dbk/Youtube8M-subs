00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
in the parks these are Blandings Turtles

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.899 
in the parks these are Blandings Turtles
they're<00:01:24.380> an<00:01:24.649> endangered<00:01:25.189> species<00:01:25.399> here<00:01:25.820> in

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
they're an endangered species here in

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.050 
they're an endangered species here in
Nova<00:01:26.119> Scotia<00:01:26.149> and<00:01:27.100> we<00:01:28.100> have<00:01:28.189> really<00:01:28.490> in-depth

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060

Nova Scotia and we have really in-depth
volunteer<00:01:29.570> program<00:01:30.049> so<00:01:30.350> this<00:01:30.500> year<00:01:30.649> we<00:01:30.770> just

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
volunteer program so this year we just

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.800 
volunteer program so this year we just
celebrated<00:01:31.399> over<00:01:31.490> 10,000<00:01:32.060> volunteer<00:01:32.450> hours

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
celebrated over 10,000 volunteer hours

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.020 
celebrated over 10,000 volunteer hours
for<00:01:33.740> people<00:01:33.770> helping<00:01:34.219> out<00:01:34.340> species<00:01:34.880> at<00:01:35.000> risk

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
for people helping out species at risk

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.700 
for people helping out species at risk
and<00:01:35.479> other<00:01:35.570> volunteer<00:01:36.140> projects<00:01:36.500> here<00:01:36.619> at

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
and other volunteer projects here at

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.230 
and other volunteer projects here at
Kachemak<00:01:37.039> is<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.219> can<00:01:37.310> astral<00:01:37.549> Park<00:01:37.729> and

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
Kachemak is you can astral Park and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.609 
Kachemak is you can astral Park and
where<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.539> hatchlings<00:01:38.990> are<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:39.170> sides<00:01:39.380> of<00:01:39.560> a

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
where the hatchlings are the sides of a

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.249 
where the hatchlings are the sides of a
$2<00:01:39.979> coin<00:01:40.250> being<00:01:40.759> able<00:01:40.880> to<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.689> pinpoint<00:01:41.899> them

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
$2 coin being able to to pinpoint them

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.499 
$2 coin being able to to pinpoint them
and<00:01:42.409> they<00:01:42.469> just<00:01:42.649> love<00:01:43.030> bogging<00:01:44.030> down<00:01:44.060> into

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
and they just love bogging down into

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.679 
and they just love bogging down into
this<00:01:44.630> these<00:01:45.409> thick<00:01:45.770> sphagnum<00:01:46.070> mats<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:46.820> using

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
this these thick sphagnum mats so using

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.690 
this these thick sphagnum mats so using
me<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.289> paddle<00:01:48.710> allows<00:01:49.219> us<00:01:49.430> to<00:01:49.579> really

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
me the paddle allows us to really

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.020 
me the paddle allows us to really
pinpoint<00:01:49.969> exactly<00:01:50.240> where<00:01:50.780> they<00:01:50.930> are<00:01:52.000> so<00:01:53.000> we

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
pinpoint exactly where they are so we

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.880 
pinpoint exactly where they are so we
actually<00:01:53.299> train<00:01:53.600> our<00:01:53.719> volunteers<00:01:53.840> to<00:01:54.380> be

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
actually train our volunteers to be

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.499 
actually train our volunteers to be
researchers<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:55.820> we<00:01:56.030> have<00:01:56.149> teams<00:01:56.359> of

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
researchers so we have teams of

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.510 
researchers so we have teams of
volunteers<00:01:56.539> that<00:01:56.990> will<00:01:57.200> go<00:01:57.350> out<00:01:57.530> with<00:01:58.159> radio

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
volunteers that will go out with radio

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.779 
volunteers that will go out with radio
tracking<00:01:58.939> equipment<00:01:59.149> and<00:02:00.049> they'll<00:02:00.200> monitor

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
tracking equipment and they'll monitor

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.580 
tracking equipment and they'll monitor
turtle<00:02:01.789> movement<00:02:02.210> they'll<00:02:02.390> monitor<00:02:02.590> nesting

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
turtle movement they'll monitor nesting

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.649 
turtle movement they'll monitor nesting
movements<00:02:03.979> in<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.159> spring<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.850> monitor<00:02:05.240> the

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
movements in the spring the monitor the

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.410 
movements in the spring the monitor the
nests<00:02:05.960> again<00:02:06.170> in<00:02:06.289> the<00:02:06.380> fall<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:06.950> track<00:02:07.609> the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
nests again in the fall and track the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.930 
nests again in the fall and track the

all of that data gets collected in a
