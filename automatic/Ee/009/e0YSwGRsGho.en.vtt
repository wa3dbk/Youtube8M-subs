paper<00:01:04.030> panel<00:01:04.600> what<00:01:05.019> I<00:01:05.050> find<00:01:05.440> is<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.820> creative

paper panel what I find is the creative

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.360 
paper panel what I find is the creative
palette<00:01:07.840> just<00:01:08.350> makes<00:01:08.620> such<00:01:08.860> a<00:01:08.890> big<00:01:09.010> difference

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
palette just makes such a big difference

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.039 
palette just makes such a big difference
when<00:01:09.850> I'm<00:01:09.970> painting<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:12.490> I<00:01:12.549> now<00:01:12.850> use<00:01:13.049> the

when I'm painting that I now use the

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:21.080

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
for many acrylic paints one of the most

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.840 
for many acrylic paints one of the most
difficult<00:01:25.009> techniques<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.610> floating

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
difficult techniques is the floating

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.139

it for doing my work that's another

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.440 
it for doing my work that's another
problem<00:02:31.200> area<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.980> many<00:02:32.459> painters<00:02:33.120> have

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
problem area that many painters have

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.039 
problem area that many painters have
what<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.170> do<00:02:34.290> is<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.680> simply<00:02:34.890> come<00:02:35.220> over<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:36.049> pull

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
what I do is I simply come over and pull

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.410 
what I do is I simply come over and pull
a<00:02:37.079> little<00:02:37.380> bit<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.709> water<00:02:37.950> off<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.730> palette

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
a little bit of water off the palette

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.920 
a little bit of water off the palette
the<00:02:40.200> puddle<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.650> paint<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:44.390> again<00:02:45.390> Pilate<00:02:45.660> and

the puddle of paint and again Pilate and

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.319 
the puddle of paint and again Pilate and
on<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.109> paper<00:02:46.350> towel<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:48.769> as<00:02:49.769> I<00:02:50.190> work<00:02:50.519> somehow

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
on the paper towel and as I work somehow

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.530 
on the paper towel and as I work somehow
if<00:02:51.690> this<00:02:52.680> grabs<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.549> palette<00:02:53.880> grabs<00:02:54.209> the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
if this grabs the palette grabs the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.199 
if this grabs the palette grabs the
paint<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.079> pushes<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.739> into<00:02:55.889> the<00:02:56.069> brush<00:02:56.400> so

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
paint and pushes it into the brush so

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.539 
paint and pushes it into the brush so
when<00:02:57.359> I<00:02:57.389> come<00:02:57.690> over<00:02:57.930> to<00:03:00.590> my<00:03:01.590> surface<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.340> get

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
when I come over to my surface I get

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:09.170 
when I come over to my surface I get
just<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.910> really<00:03:03.389> nice<00:03:03.950> even<00:03:04.950> line<00:03:08.180> another

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
just a really nice even line another

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.640 
just a really nice even line another
thing<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.569> I<00:03:09.600> really<00:03:10.079> love<00:03:10.200> about<00:03:10.260> the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
thing that I really love about the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.170 
thing that I really love about the
creative<00:03:10.920> palette<00:03:11.160> is<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.670> fact<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:11.940> it's

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
creative palette is the fact that it's

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.599 
creative palette is the fact that it's
transparent<00:03:12.840> many<00:03:13.530> times<00:03:13.889> were<00:03:14.160> mitt<00:03:14.430> when

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
transparent many times were mitt when

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.789 
transparent many times were mitt when
we're<00:03:14.730> mixing<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.329> value<00:03:15.630> scale<00:03:16.200> on<00:03:16.500> our

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
we're mixing a value scale on our

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.979 
we're mixing a value scale on our
palette<00:03:17.250> we<00:03:17.819> only<00:03:18.000> have<00:03:18.329> a<00:03:18.359> white<00:03:18.660> background

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
palette we only have a white background

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.500 
palette we only have a white background
but<00:03:19.530> because<00:03:19.859> it's<00:03:20.040> transparent<00:03:20.480> you<00:03:21.480> can

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
but because it's transparent you can

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.300 
but because it's transparent you can
simply<00:03:22.139> either<00:03:22.319> put<00:03:22.739> your<00:03:22.769> surface

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
simply either put your surface

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.629 
simply either put your surface
underneath<00:03:23.639> or<00:03:24.569> you<00:03:24.600> can<00:03:25.139> base<00:03:26.010> coats<00:03:26.370> and

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
underneath or you can base coats and

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.979 
underneath or you can base coats and
cardstock<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:28.350> can<00:03:28.530> see<00:03:28.769> that<00:03:29.180> how<00:03:30.180> your

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
cardstock and you can see that how your

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.630 
cardstock and you can see that how your
colors<00:03:31.439> are<00:03:31.709> going<00:03:32.159> into<00:03:32.430> a

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
colors are going into a

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.860 
colors are going into a
here<00:03:32.940> on<00:03:33.440> every<00:03:34.440> color<00:03:34.740> that<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.880> face<00:03:36.180> coded

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.050 

so<00:03:39.870> every<00:03:40.200> time<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.740> mix<00:03:41.010> your<00:03:41.220> colors<00:03:41.610> it's

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
so every time you mix your colors it's

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.000 
so every time you mix your colors it's
going<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.480> lay<00:03:42.630> down<00:03:42.660> perfectly<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.830> it's

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
going to lay down perfectly and it's

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.250 
going to lay down perfectly and it's
going<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.370> save<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.819> lot<00:03:45.120> of<00:03:45.180> time<00:03:45.569> with

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
going to save you a lot of time with

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.430 
going to save you a lot of time with
your<00:03:46.470> mixing<00:03:47.510> less<00:03:48.510> purpose<00:03:48.990> I'd<00:03:49.110> like<00:03:49.290> to

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440
