00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
road which I actually feel better about

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.250 
road which I actually feel better about
because<00:00:26.460> look<00:00:27.180> at<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.539> two<00:00:27.750> wins<00:00:28.019> have

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
because look at that the two wins have

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.779 
because look at that the two wins have
been<00:00:28.289> on<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.619> road<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.070> two<00:00:29.250> losses<00:00:29.460> that

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
been on the road and the two losses that

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.790 
been on the road and the two losses that
we<00:00:29.939> have<00:00:30.090> have<00:00:30.330> been<00:00:30.359> at<00:00:30.630> home<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.199> play<00:00:31.410> we

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
we have have been at home so we play we

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.260 
we have have been at home so we play we
play<00:00:31.830> better<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.489> road<00:00:32.520> that's<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.120> my

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
play better on the road that's just my

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.360 
play better on the road that's just my

the<00:03:33.550> last<00:03:33.760> season<00:03:34.120> where<00:03:34.300> he<00:03:34.330> struggled<00:03:34.600> to

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
the last season where he struggled to

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.720 
the last season where he struggled to
pick<00:03:35.110> up<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.350> cyst<00:03:35.620> right<00:03:36.100> here<00:03:36.250> he<00:03:36.370> picks<00:03:36.580> up

pick up a cyst right here he picks up
another<00:03:36.910> assist<00:03:37.570> I<00:03:37.780> think<00:03:38.140> that's<00:03:38.260> his<00:03:38.410> third

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
another assist I think that's his third

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.890 
another assist I think that's his third
of<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:39.010> season<00:03:39.040> maybe<00:03:39.610> third<00:03:40.330> or<00:03:40.480> second<00:03:40.840> I

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
of the season maybe third or second I

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.090 
of the season maybe third or second I
don't<00:03:41.050> even<00:03:41.110> know<00:03:41.290> maybe<00:03:41.470> it's<00:03:41.620> not<00:03:41.709> even<00:03:41.980> that

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
don't even know maybe it's not even that

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.590 
don't even know maybe it's not even that
many<00:03:42.250> assists<00:03:42.640> and<00:03:42.760> I'm<00:03:42.820> exaggerating<00:03:43.120> so

doesn't defend anymore he really his
stamina<00:06:28.460> is<00:06:28.699> not<00:06:28.969> the<00:06:29.120> greatest<00:06:29.360> soap<00:06:30.129> and<00:06:31.129> a

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
stamina is not the greatest soap and a

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.580 
stamina is not the greatest soap and a
nice<00:06:31.430> low<00:06:31.669> he's<00:06:31.879> very<00:06:32.090> slow<00:06:32.419> so<00:06:32.780> the<00:06:33.169> team<00:06:33.409> are

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
nice low he's very slow so the team are

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.290 
nice low he's very slow so the team are
honestly<00:06:34.039> performed<00:06:34.610> better<00:06:34.759> when<00:06:35.030> he<00:06:35.180> was

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
honestly performed better when he was

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.730 
honestly performed better when he was
sitting<00:06:35.569> on<00:06:35.629> the<00:06:35.750> bench<00:06:35.930> which<00:06:36.379> is<00:06:36.530> why<00:06:36.710> I

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
sitting on the bench which is why I

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.619 
sitting on the bench which is why I
guess<00:06:37.039> the<00:06:37.219> game<00:06:37.430> has<00:06:37.729> them<00:06:37.939> on<00:06:38.030> the<00:06:38.180> bench<00:06:38.360> so

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:38.629 
guess the game has them on the bench so

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:40.450 
guess the game has them on the bench so
if<00:06:39.259> you've<00:06:39.590> been<00:06:39.740> watching<00:06:39.949> which<00:06:40.370> you
