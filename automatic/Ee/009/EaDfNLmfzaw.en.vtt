 homemade tips 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.340
 today we will do in terms of management 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.460
 posted on youtube joke where 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.070
 formula the ingredients that will use us 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.410
 for our recipe is a can of milk 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:25.830
 condensed a cup of chocolate powder 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:29.279
 two boxes of sour cream 3 eggs 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.460
 around a tablespoon of butter or 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.460
 margarine 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.030
 we will also use the granulated 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.230
 want to be able to decorate our 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.410
 recipe in aluminum foil to cover the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.420
 our budget when it comes to the oven and 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.059
 its ingredients we will use to 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.070
 make our recipe today 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.520
 first we will turn the oven on 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.559
 average temperature 180 degrees to go 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.879
 heating up and then we put on the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.789
 our revenue 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.120
 We're going to hit the blender with the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:08.490
 two boxes of sour cream the milk 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.000
 condensed the entire games that 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.100
 butter or margarine 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.750
 We're going to hit it lightly after we 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.750
 we put the chocolate powder 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.830
 now we take the cup from the base of the 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.189
 blender 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.619
 put the chocolate powder and mix 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.990
 so manually 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.840
 we give this slight mixture that is 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.450
 how to beat chocolate powder 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.490
 it may not blend well now that 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.020
 we have this light mix 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:48.080
 we put it back in the blender 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.450
 and let's knock for five minutes 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.000
 now we've got a shape and we're 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.000
 with butter or margarine 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.830
 we took the paper towel and passed 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.050
 so that she is well anointed with people who 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.729
 if at the time you misinform it 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:12.600
 grabs 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:16.620
 now we dumped that our revenue 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.830
 will be made in the water bath until we 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.590
 Let's put hot water in a pan 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.150
 or shape larger than this one that is 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.709
 this mixture that we hit in the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.760
 blender 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:32.340
 have to have hot water are we 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.489
 Let's bake our recipe in the preheated oven. 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.819
 heated 180 degrees we'll put 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.720
 paper align by sealing the 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.720
 shiny 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.340
 We are finishing paper 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.390
 the shape that is advancing from the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.000
 bye 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.460
 now we are going to take the preheated oven 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.920
 heated for 90 minutes 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:01.750
 We are going to leave 45 minutes paper 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.420
 laminated 45 minutes on laminated paper 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.090
 45 minutes have passed since our 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.210
 recipe is in the oven and let's put 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.240
 now 45 more minutes without 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.860
 it has already begun to take on such 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.620
 inconsistent 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.540
 45 minutes have passed since the 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.340
 ours could be in the lining 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.350
 we know he is at the point with 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.500
 movies and lady cone 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.960
 consistent over and over time as well 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.970
 that I used to make my oven 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.430
 now we'll wait to cool the 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.680
 room temperature and then 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.340
 Let's cool the refrigerator in the 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.090
 The way our play was 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.650

 let a little longer but 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.490
 usually four hours is already good 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.930
 we will always pass the spatula 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.930
 make it easier to inform 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.900
 now we're going normal performance 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.349
