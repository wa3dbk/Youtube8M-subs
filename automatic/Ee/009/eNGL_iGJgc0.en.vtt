00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.810
 hello hello welcome on coco tv 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.359
 for a new video presentation 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.310
 today a new radiator and jeans 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.970
 tech always in top-flow format the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.289
 little praise 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.180
 so small simply because he 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.220
 measures 44 mm in thickness that can be 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.990
 note on the radiator box and 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.969
 fan included the fan it's 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.950
 a 90 mm model 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.180
 slim 15 mm thick that will turn 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.629
 so to watch on the box 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.670
 everything is noted on the side that will turn 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.379
 from 800 to 1400 rpm 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.730
 only so normally we should 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.890
 have silence for the farms 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.030
 performance we will of course expect 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.649
 do the test at the packaging level 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.700
 counter in the simple as always 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.140
 with the mark except that there we have 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.829
 still a little protection 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.170
 plastic 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:02.579
 the instructions for the hardware and finally the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.799
 front radiator here we are radiator 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.439
 with the intel fixation that is already in 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.200
 place in the box we have some md 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.439
 no problem with finishing 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.799
 we find annick age three heat pipes 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.509
 6 mm live touch with the small film 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.210
 protection of a cable sheathed time 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.250
 for the relatively cable fan 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.320
 long it goes so we can see 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.290
 we really do in the simple a little 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.140
 radiator at the base of the screw 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.840
 finally a pat share for fixation and 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.250
 finally the fan that kept 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.380
 directly by claws fixing 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.880
 will be done from below finally should 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.829
 to be relatively quick as his amd or 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.780
 intel 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.329
 we can see at the level of the heat pipes 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.799
 it comes directly to the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.420
 fixations so for compatibility 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.560
 with the different partners it does not 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.630
 should not be a problem then we 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.009
 will do a little editing fast 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.750
 we will leave here the protection of 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.070
 secret on this little map asus on it 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.110
 sees her going no problem for the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.689
 memory for vrm and finally if we 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.670
 goes on a motherboard after more 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.670
 classics we'll say in mini-itx with 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.700
 the pci express going going to turn in order to 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:18.590
 leave the pci express nearby so 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.610
 it's very simple we take it up 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.980
 in the holes then it takes just a 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.860
 little line and no problem we can 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.040
 put a card the base being off center 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.850
 we can turn the radiator if necessary 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.880
 to install it in the direction you want 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.290
 except in this one or it will come to type 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.239
 in our case on the map towards the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.330
 fan being still a little 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.220
 shifted forward in price 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.260
 we tap on about 25 euros so 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.489
 it's pretty cheap not to say 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.350
 very affordable 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.590
 competition is rather tough on this 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.470
 sector for this author but at this price 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.760
 it's rather the only one so let's hope it 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.160
 make it strong just like the palace 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.330
 big brother in 140 mm the tea is it very 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.080
 In the meantime, we will be waiting for you 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.080
 wish a good end of the day
