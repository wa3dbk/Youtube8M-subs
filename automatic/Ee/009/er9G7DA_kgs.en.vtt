00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:10.990
 hello friends I'm the reviewer today we're going 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.990
 to visit the bar here, audio is a 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.579
 quadruped with a very long neck like this 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.030
 to come with me and we will travel in the 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:18.030
 train 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.580
 net the quadruped 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:35.560
 it's more like everyone will come out I think the 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.560
 divisor sounds more like everything if someone 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.670
 I will invite the reviewer I can 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.670
 do this 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.660
 or it's fine but 30 that was not the wine 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.660
 train was timing 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.489
 so 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:04.460
 now if that means we have to 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.049

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.140
