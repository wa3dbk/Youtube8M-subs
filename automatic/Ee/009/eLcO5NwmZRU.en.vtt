hey<00:00:12.889> people<00:00:14.030> philippa<00:00:15.030> here<00:00:15.450> bringing<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.170> a

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
hey people philippa here bringing you a

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.019 
hey people philippa here bringing you a
sick<00:00:16.830> knife<00:00:17.369> only<00:00:17.580> swarm<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.410> domination<00:00:19.410> I

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
sick knife only swarm and domination I

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.759 
sick knife only swarm and domination I
think<00:00:21.029> it's<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.420> first<00:00:21.689> one<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.470> game

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
think it's the first one in this game

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.330 
think it's the first one in this game
mode<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.340> if<00:00:23.850> not<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.720> probably<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.710> fastest

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
mode and if not it probably the fastest

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.480 
mode and if not it probably the fastest
because<00:00:27.180> it's<00:00:27.449> only<00:00:27.930> two<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.740> half<00:00:28.949> minutes

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
because it's only two and a half minutes

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.310 
because it's only two and a half minutes
I<00:00:30.349> made<00:00:31.349> some<00:00:31.380> search<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.399> youtube<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.320> only

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
I made some search on youtube and only

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.190 
I made some search on youtube and only
found<00:00:34.590> another<00:00:34.950> life<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:35.730> worm<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
found another life on this worm and it

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.700 
found another life on this worm and it
was<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.649> Kill<00:00:37.980> Confirmed<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.930> shworv<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
was in Kill Confirmed the shworv is the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.360 
was in Kill Confirmed the shworv is the
is<00:00:41.129> killstreaks<00:00:41.930> history<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.379> game<00:00:43.620> with

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
is killstreaks history in the game with

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.150 
is killstreaks history in the game with
its<00:00:44.640> 19<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.660> red<00:00:45.989> points<00:00:46.680> needed<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.820> unlock

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
its 19 and red points needed to unlock

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.220 
its 19 and red points needed to unlock
because<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> score<00:00:50.760> streak<00:00:51.059> system<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:52.170> is

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
because of the score streak system it is

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.840 
because of the score streak system it is
way<00:00:52.920> easier<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.090> get<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:55.199> Kill<00:00:55.559> Confirmed

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
way easier to get in Kill Confirmed

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.410 
way easier to get in Kill Confirmed
where<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.149> get<00:00:57.949> 150<00:00:58.949> points<00:00:59.090> with<00:01:00.090> every

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
where you get 150 points with every

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.800 
where you get 150 points with every
killed<00:01:01.010> compared<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.840> 100<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.080> domination

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
killed compared to 100 in domination

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.469 
killed compared to 100 in domination
this<00:01:06.810> means<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.830> other<00:01:08.400> guy<00:01:08.760> got<00:01:09.150> only

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
this means that the other guy got only

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.670 
this means that the other guy got only
nine<00:01:10.049> kills<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:11.280> get<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> swarm<00:01:12.180> when<00:01:13.140> I

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
nine kills to get the swarm when I

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.170 
nine kills to get the swarm when I
needed<00:01:14.299> 17<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.740> am<00:01:16.740> pretty<00:01:17.189> happy<00:01:17.490> about<00:01:17.759> this

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
needed 17 I am pretty happy about this

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.080 
needed 17 I am pretty happy about this
gameplay<00:01:18.509> because<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.890> was<00:01:20.130> rushing<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
gameplay because I was rushing all the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.020 
gameplay because I was rushing all the
way<00:01:21.240> through<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.900> never<00:01:22.740> really<00:01:23.340> went<00:01:23.610> into

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
way through it I never really went into

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.140 
way through it I never really went into
a<00:01:24.060> corner<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.890> just<00:01:25.890> waiting<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.700> someone<00:01:26.970> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
a corner and just waiting for someone to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.060 
a corner and just waiting for someone to
come<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.670> anything<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.799> even<00:01:31.799> near

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
come and anything like that even near

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.440 
come and anything like that even near
the<00:01:32.250> end<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.850> was<00:01:33.090> rushing<00:01:34.130> I<00:01:35.130> know<00:01:35.579> most<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the end I was rushing I know most of the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.859 
the end I was rushing I know most of the
people<00:01:36.659> when<00:01:37.530> they<00:01:37.710> are<00:01:37.740> near<00:01:38.070> they<00:01:38.600> to<00:01:39.600> get

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
people when they are near they to get

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.730 
people when they are near they to get
someone<00:01:40.380> something<00:01:40.860> nice<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:42.320> camp<00:01:43.320> or

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
someone something nice they just camp or

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.389 
someone something nice they just camp or
wait<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.250> someone<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.970> come<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:46.100> that's<00:01:47.100> not

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
wait for someone to come but that's not

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.510 
wait for someone to come but that's not
what<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.700> did<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.420> game<00:01:48.659> play<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.829> think

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
what I did in this game play so I think

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.499 
what I did in this game play so I think
it<00:01:50.670> makes<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.390> really<00:01:51.780> entertaining<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.829> watch

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
it makes it really entertaining to watch

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.310 
it makes it really entertaining to watch
I<00:01:54.509> had<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.280> swarm<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.549> my<00:01:56.700> killstreaks<00:01:57.320> only

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
I had the swarm in my killstreaks only

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.080 
I had the swarm in my killstreaks only
because<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.740> thought<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.250> will<00:01:59.460> make<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> good

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
because I thought it will make a good

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.249 
because I thought it will make a good
video<00:02:00.590> but<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.619> never<00:02:02.369> we<00:02:02.790> really<00:02:03.540> went<00:02:03.869> for<00:02:04.049> it

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
video but I never we really went for it

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.600 
video but I never we really went for it
I<00:02:04.740> was<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.939> hoping<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.479> get<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.049> someday<00:02:07.610> and

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
I was just hoping to get it someday and

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.760 
I was just hoping to get it someday and
in<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.149> gameplay<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.690> was<00:02:09.989> actually<00:02:10.170> going

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770
