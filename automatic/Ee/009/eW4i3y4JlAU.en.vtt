00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
cool trans black color it's got what

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.390 
cool trans black color it's got what

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
sets it apart from other SNM frames out

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.560 
sets it apart from other SNM frames out
of<00:03:32.520> the<00:03:32.580> moment<00:03:32.880> it's<00:03:33.000> got<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.150> bit<00:03:33.270> of<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.420> lower

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
of the moment it's got a bit of a lower

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.320 
of the moment it's got a bit of a lower
bottom<00:03:33.750> bracket<00:03:34.200> at<00:03:34.350> 11.5<00:03:35.100> it's<00:03:36.000> also<00:03:36.120> got<00:03:36.240> a

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
bottom bracket at 11.5 it's also got a

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.570 
bottom bracket at 11.5 it's also got a
really<00:03:36.450> short<00:03:36.750> back<00:03:37.020> end<00:03:37.260> so<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:37.770> like<00:03:37.830> 13<00:03:38.310> 18

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
really short back end so it's like 13 18

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.120 
really short back end so it's like 13 18
so<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.900> going<00:03:40.020> to<00:03:40.080> pull<00:03:40.260> up<00:03:40.410> nice<00:03:40.740> and<00:03:40.770> quick

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
so it's going to pull up nice and quick

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.199 
so it's going to pull up nice and quick
but<00:03:41.160> it's<00:03:41.490> still<00:03:41.580> going<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.820> have<00:03:41.880> quite<00:03:42.090> a

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
but it's still going to have quite a
