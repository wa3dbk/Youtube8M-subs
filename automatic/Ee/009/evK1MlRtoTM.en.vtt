00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.600 
it when you agreed to call me what would
you<00:01:18.479> mean<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.200> think<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.100> main<00:01:20.250> aim<00:01:20.430> was<00:01:20.460> to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
you mean in I think the main aim was to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.030 
you mean in I think the main aim was to
get<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.090> get<00:01:21.240> minutes<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> pitch<00:01:21.799> and<00:01:22.799> I

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
get to get minutes on the pitch and I

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.440 
get to get minutes on the pitch and I
managed<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.460> do<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.820> especially<00:01:23.970> for<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
managed to do that especially for the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.330 
managed to do that especially for the
first<00:01:24.630> 10<00:01:24.900> games<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.500> think<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.740> started<00:01:26.070> every

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
first 10 games I think I started every

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.090 
first 10 games I think I started every
every<00:01:26.670> game<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.000> was<00:01:27.090> available<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:28.100> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
every game that was available for and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.620 
every game that was available for and
then<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.520> wanted<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:29.970> putting<00:01:30.150> good

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
then I wanted to be putting good

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.140 
then I wanted to be putting good
performances<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.560> felt<00:01:31.740> like<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.220> majority

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
performances and I felt like a majority

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.120 
performances and I felt like a majority
of<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> time<00:01:33.450> i've<00:01:33.600> done<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:33.990> i've<00:01:34.619> give

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
of the time i've done that and i've give

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.310 
of the time i've done that and i've give
it<00:01:35.220> my<00:01:35.340> all<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.729> yeah<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.869> been<00:01:36.930> good

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
it my all so yeah it's been good

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.510 
it my all so yeah it's been good
is<00:01:37.439> there<00:01:37.560> any<00:01:37.650> chance<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.950> you've<00:01:38.100> been<00:01:38.130> here

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.600 
is there any chance of you've been here
next<00:01:38.939> season<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.619> think<00:01:40.619> potentially<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.280> have

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
next season I think potentially I have

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.460 
next season I think potentially I have
to<00:01:41.729> go<00:01:41.820> back<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.150> United<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.720> I've<00:01:42.990> still<00:01:43.229> got

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
to go back to United and I've still got

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.100 
to go back to United and I've still got
a<00:01:43.500> few<00:01:43.560> years<00:01:43.920> left<00:01:44.280> there<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.640> my<00:01:44.700> contract<00:01:45.110> so

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
a few years left there on my contract so

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.380 
a few years left there on my contract so
I<00:01:46.140> need<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.439> go<00:01:47.280> back<00:01:47.430> there<00:01:47.610> reassess<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.270> and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
I need to go back there reassess it and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.080 
I need to go back there reassess it and
speak<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.750> them<00:01:49.009> and<00:01:50.009> see<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.579> I'll<00:01:50.790> be<00:01:50.880> getting

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
speak to them and see if I'll be getting

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.139 
speak to them and see if I'll be getting
an<00:01:51.180> opportunity<00:01:51.689> there<00:01:52.189> which<00:01:53.189> which<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.700> is

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
an opportunity there which which is is

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.270 
an opportunity there which which is is
my<00:01:54.420> aim<00:01:54.600> that's<00:01:55.049> what<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.590> wanted<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.100> when<00:01:56.250> I

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
my aim that's what I wanted to do when I

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.490 
my aim that's what I wanted to do when I
signed<00:01:56.520> my<00:01:56.579> contract<00:01:56.670> there<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.360> what<00:01:58.290> if

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
signed my contract there and what if

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.959 
signed my contract there and what if
that<00:01:58.740> doesn't<00:01:58.950> work<00:01:59.130> out<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.520> I'll<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.759> to

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
that doesn't work out then I'll have to

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.109 
that doesn't work out then I'll have to
reassess<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> situation<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.880> consider<00:02:02.880> all

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
reassess the situation and consider all

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.789 
reassess the situation and consider all
my<00:02:03.240> options<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.719> I'd<00:02:04.290> like<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.590> think<00:02:04.680> that

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
my options and I'd like to think that

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.280 
my options and I'd like to think that
this<00:02:04.890> would<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.100> one
