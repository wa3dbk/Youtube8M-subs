00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
are any special secrets to it I'm

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.260 
are any special secrets to it I'm
imagining<00:02:06.750> there<00:02:07.259> won't<00:02:07.530> be<00:02:07.789> it<00:02:08.789> fits<00:02:09.060> in

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
imagining there won't be it fits in

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.999 
imagining there won't be it fits in
there

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
there

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.250 
there
pretty<00:02:10.159> nicely<00:02:10.429> actually<00:02:10.810> snapped<00:02:11.810> right<00:02:11.959> in

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
pretty nicely actually snapped right in

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.970 
pretty nicely actually snapped right in
so<00:02:13.040> we've<00:02:13.340> got<00:02:13.519> it<00:02:13.610> closed<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.420> does<00:02:15.349> it<00:02:15.530> turn

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
so we've got it closed and does it turn

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.580 
so we've got it closed and does it turn
on<00:02:16.040> when<00:02:16.370> we<00:02:16.489> open<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:16.879> no<00:02:17.599> it<00:02:17.810> doesn't<00:02:18.200> because

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
on when we open it no it doesn't because

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.470 
on when we open it no it doesn't because
there's<00:02:18.739> no<00:02:18.829> magnet<00:02:19.310> or<00:02:19.549> anything<00:02:19.879> involved

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
there's no magnet or anything involved

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.569 
there's no magnet or anything involved
so<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:21.379> doesn't<00:02:21.709> do<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.040> automatic

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
so it doesn't do the automatic

actually folds back pretty nicely I will
say<00:02:54.079> that<00:02:54.349> just<00:02:55.069> by<00:02:55.250> grabbing<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.879> little<00:02:56.090> bit

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
say that just by grabbing a little bit

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.629 
say that just by grabbing a little bit
like<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.780> edge<00:02:57.590> here<00:02:57.950> doesn't<00:02:58.250> necessarily

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
like the edge here doesn't necessarily

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.240 
like the edge here doesn't necessarily
really<00:02:59.060> stick<00:02:59.510> all<00:02:59.690> that<00:02:59.900> well<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.590> so<00:03:01.220> I

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
really stick all that well to it so I

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.890 
really stick all that well to it so I
could<00:03:01.609> see<00:03:01.760> that<00:03:01.879> being<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:02.239> little<00:03:02.540> annoying

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
could see that being a little annoying

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.780 
could see that being a little annoying
if<00:03:03.440> you're<00:03:03.799> grabbing<00:03:04.129> it<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:04.549> can<00:03:04.700> almost

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
if you're grabbing it you can almost

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.940 
if you're grabbing it you can almost
feel<00:03:05.090> it<00:03:05.150> slip<00:03:05.599> off<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.840> device<00:03:06.260> now<00:03:06.680> i<00:03:06.709> don't

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
feel it slip off the device now i don't

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.289 
feel it slip off the device now i don't
think<00:03:07.099> the<00:03:07.190> device<00:03:07.430> is<00:03:07.579> going<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.790> like<00:03:07.940> slip

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
think the device is going to like slip

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.979 
think the device is going to like slip
out<00:03:08.480> by<00:03:08.720> any<00:03:08.900> means<00:03:09.760> but<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:11.090> edge<00:03:11.389> just<00:03:11.720> sort

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
out by any means but that edge just sort

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.930 
out by any means but that edge just sort
of<00:03:12.049> comes<00:03:12.319> off<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:12.799> that's<00:03:12.920> it's<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.790> bit
