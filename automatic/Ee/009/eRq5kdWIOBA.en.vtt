induction cooking what we're gonna love
this<00:00:04.930> okay<00:00:05.350> first<00:00:05.740> of<00:00:05.829> all<00:00:05.950> this<00:00:06.549> is<00:00:06.759> the<00:00:06.970> first

00:00:07.199 --> 00:00:07.209 
this okay first of all this is the first

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:09.030 
this okay first of all this is the first
time<00:00:07.450> really<00:00:07.749> we've<00:00:08.050> been<00:00:08.200> able<00:00:08.590> to<00:00:08.769> represent

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040 
time really we've been able to represent

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.250 
time really we've been able to represent
it<00:00:09.310> in<00:00:09.370> a<00:00:09.460> portable<00:00:09.820> format<00:00:10.360> you<00:00:10.900> know<00:00:11.020> over

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.260 
it in a portable format you know over

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.630 
it in a portable format you know over
the<00:00:11.350> years<00:00:11.530> in<00:00:11.770> taxes<00:00:12.130> getting<00:00:12.370> more<00:00:12.520> and<00:00:12.580> more

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:12.640 
the years in taxes getting more and more

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.670 
the years in taxes getting more and more
popular<00:00:13.060> but<00:00:13.210> they've<00:00:13.330> been<00:00:13.540> in<00:00:13.570> the<00:00:13.780> size<00:00:14.080> and

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
popular but they've been in the size and

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.849 
popular but they've been in the size and
maybe<00:00:14.860> this<00:00:15.160> big<00:00:15.640> cooktop<00:00:16.209> and<00:00:16.859> they're

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:17.859 
maybe this big cooktop and they're

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.399 
maybe this big cooktop and they're
ridiculous<00:00:18.249> in<00:00:18.490> price<00:00:18.730> this<00:00:19.179> however<00:00:19.449> is<00:00:20.019> very

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:20.409 
ridiculous in price this however is very

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:22.310 
ridiculous in price this however is very
reasonable<00:00:21.070> but<00:00:21.130> it's<00:00:21.249> also<00:00:21.369> very<00:00:21.669> portable

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
reasonable but it's also very portable

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.829 
reasonable but it's also very portable
okay<00:00:23.320> we've<00:00:23.679> got<00:00:23.890> this<00:00:24.779> electromagnet<00:00:25.779> in

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:25.839 
okay we've got this electromagnet in

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.509 
okay we've got this electromagnet in
here<00:00:26.050> which<00:00:26.199> is<00:00:26.289> going<00:00:26.380> to<00:00:26.439> cook<00:00:26.679> our<00:00:26.829> food<00:00:27.130> now

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
here which is going to cook our food now

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.880 
here which is going to cook our food now
only<00:00:27.880> cooks<00:00:28.210> when<00:00:28.630> a<00:00:28.659> metal<00:00:28.900> pan<00:00:29.589> which<00:00:29.859> is

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
only cooks when a metal pan which is

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.729 
only cooks when a metal pan which is
able<00:00:30.310> to<00:00:30.730> absorb<00:00:31.329> the<00:00:31.449> magnetic<00:00:31.929> fitment<00:00:32.259> mad

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
able to absorb the magnetic fitment mad

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.310 
able to absorb the magnetic fitment mad
magnetic<00:00:33.490> field<00:00:33.730> and<00:00:34.240> cook<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:34.630> water<00:00:34.840> or

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
magnetic field and cook the water or

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.530 
magnetic field and cook the water or
whatever<00:00:35.470> in<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:35.710> pan<00:00:35.890> so<00:00:36.040> basically<00:00:36.550> any<00:00:37.060> pan

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
whatever in the pan so basically any pan

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.420 
whatever in the pan so basically any pan
you<00:00:37.660> put<00:00:37.690> on<00:00:37.930> it<00:00:38.080> has<00:00:38.260> to<00:00:38.290> be<00:00:38.500> magnetic<00:00:38.950> okay

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
you put on it has to be magnetic okay

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.120 
you put on it has to be magnetic okay
but<00:00:39.850> it<00:00:39.940> works<00:00:40.180> fast<00:00:40.690> I<00:00:41.170> just<00:00:41.680> put<00:00:42.010> a<00:00:42.040> little

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
thank you very much okay this is an ice

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.450 
thank you very much okay this is an ice
cube<00:01:05.080> we<00:01:05.260> put<00:01:05.470> it<00:01:05.560> right<00:01:05.770> by<00:01:05.980> it<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.280> of<00:01:06.430> course

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
cube we put it right by it and of course

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.610 
cube we put it right by it and of course
because<00:01:07.240> they're<00:01:07.540> not<00:01:07.690> magnetic

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
because they're not magnetic

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.840 
because they're not magnetic
they<00:01:08.830> won't<00:01:09.040> melt<00:01:09.250> they're<00:01:09.400> just<00:01:09.550> gonna<00:01:09.640> sit

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
they won't melt they're just gonna sit

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.810 
they won't melt they're just gonna sit
there<00:01:10.000> and<00:01:10.210> that<00:01:10.960> gives<00:01:11.230> you<00:01:11.409> a<00:01:11.440> nice<00:01:11.650> safe<00:01:12.280> top

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
there and that gives you a nice safe top

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.200 
there and that gives you a nice safe top
to<00:01:13.030> use<00:01:13.210> no<00:01:15.330> really<00:01:16.330> is<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:16.630> crazy<00:01:17.850> its<00:01:18.850> energy

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
to use no really is it crazy its energy

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.570 
to use no really is it crazy its energy
efficient<00:01:19.600> so<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.930> only<00:01:20.080> thing<00:01:20.350> it's<00:01:21.130> using

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
efficient so the only thing it's using

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.770 
efficient so the only thing it's using
is<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.850> actual<00:01:22.120> space<00:01:22.360> which<00:01:22.540> is<00:01:22.630> being

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
is the actual space which is being

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.390 
is the actual space which is being
absorbed<00:01:23.050> by<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.290> pan<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.800> rest<00:01:23.979> of<00:01:24.100> its<00:01:24.250> just

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
absorbed by the pan the rest of its just

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.899 
absorbed by the pan the rest of its just
gonna<00:01:24.610> stay<00:01:24.790> cold<00:01:25.060> that<00:01:25.810> is<00:01:26.260> so<00:01:27.070> great<00:01:27.340> so<00:01:27.640> if

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
gonna stay cold that is so great so if

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.180 
gonna stay cold that is so great so if
you<00:01:28.300> were<00:01:28.450> to<00:01:28.659> have<00:01:28.870> a<00:01:28.930> gas<00:01:29.229> burner<00:01:29.560> on<00:01:29.920> it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
you were to have a gas burner on it

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.190 
you were to have a gas burner on it
would<00:01:30.310> be<00:01:30.430> having<00:01:30.700> maybe<00:01:30.970> yeah<00:01:31.360> we<00:01:31.720> imagine

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
would be having maybe yeah we imagine

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.719 
would be having maybe yeah we imagine
all<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.470> flames<00:01:32.710> coming<00:01:33.070> up<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.250> side<00:01:33.460> the

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
all the flames coming up the side the

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.039 
all the flames coming up the side the
wasting<00:01:34.150> heat<00:01:34.330> they're<00:01:34.479> hitting<00:01:34.750> up<00:01:34.870> your

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
wasting heat they're hitting up your

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.450

take<00:01:53.530> this<00:01:53.830> done<00:01:54.100> shuts<00:01:54.460> turn<00:01:54.760> off<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.890> it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
take this done shuts turn off and it

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.039 
take this done shuts turn off and it
back<00:01:57.220> on<00:01:57.369> yeah<00:01:57.580> it<00:01:57.729> turns<00:01:58.000> on<00:01:58.119> again<00:01:58.299> and<00:01:58.510> also

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
back on yeah it turns on again and also

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.390 
back on yeah it turns on again and also
you<00:01:59.110> know<00:01:59.290> because<00:01:59.530> these<00:01:59.830> are<00:01:59.979> so<00:02:00.100> portable

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
you know because these are so portable

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.609 
you know because these are so portable
these<00:02:00.880> are<00:02:01.060> fantastic<00:02:01.210> for<00:02:01.659> so<00:02:02.110> many

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
these are fantastic for so many

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.620 
these are fantastic for so many
applications<00:02:03.130> dorm<00:02:04.060> rooms<00:02:04.299> are<00:02:04.420> really

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
applications dorm rooms are really

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.940 
applications dorm rooms are really
popular<00:02:04.840> right<00:02:05.020> now<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.290> have<00:02:05.560> these<00:02:05.770> in

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
popular right now to have these in

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.230 
popular right now to have these in
because<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.280> can't<00:02:06.460> obviously<00:02:06.640> put<00:02:06.939> a<00:02:06.970> whole

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
because you can't obviously put a whole

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.089 
because you can't obviously put a whole
stove<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:08.019> can't<00:02:08.229> paint<00:02:08.409> a<00:02:08.470> whole<00:02:08.590> microwave

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
stove you can't paint a whole microwave

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.600 
stove you can't paint a whole microwave
these<00:02:09.640> are<00:02:09.880> fantastic<00:02:10.590> RVs

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
these are fantastic RVs

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.300 
these are fantastic RVs
cabins<00:02:13.610> boats<00:02:14.420> now<00:02:15.050> I<00:02:15.080> took<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.530> off<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:16.040> it

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
cabins boats now I took it off and it

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.190 
cabins boats now I took it off and it
turns<00:02:16.520> it<00:02:16.610> back<00:02:16.700> it'll<00:02:17.090> save<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.420> temperature

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
turns it back it'll save the temperature

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.890 
turns it back it'll save the temperature
for<00:02:18.770> a<00:02:18.800> few<00:02:19.040> seconds<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:19.640> then<00:02:20.000> we<00:02:20.600> bring<00:02:20.810> it

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
for a few seconds and then we bring it

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.980 
for a few seconds and then we bring it
down<00:02:21.080> here<00:02:21.610> it's<00:02:22.610> really<00:02:22.940> controllable<00:02:23.660> so

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
down here it's really controllable so

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.480 
down here it's really controllable so
you've<00:02:24.110> got<00:02:24.260> 10<00:02:24.590> degrees<00:02:24.920> of<00:02:25.069> heat<00:02:25.250> on<00:02:25.370> this

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
you've got 10 degrees of heat on this

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.870 
you've got 10 degrees of heat on this
thing

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
thing

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.430 
thing
so<00:02:26.060> obviously<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.450> highest<00:02:26.630> number<00:02:27.080> is<00:02:27.230> the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
so obviously the highest number is the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.350 
so obviously the highest number is the
highest<00:02:27.830> electromagnetic<00:02:28.790> field<00:02:29.000> we<00:02:29.090> can<00:02:29.180> put

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
highest electromagnetic field we can put

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.059 
highest electromagnetic field we can put
into<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.630> pan<00:02:29.810> which<00:02:30.350> means<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.620> good<00:02:30.830> rolling

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
into the pan which means a good rolling

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.710 
into the pan which means a good rolling
boil<00:02:31.400> we're<00:02:31.819> at<00:02:31.880> five<00:02:32.120> now<00:02:32.360> we'll<00:02:32.510> bring<00:02:32.600> it

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
boil we're at five now we'll bring it

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.210 
boil we're at five now we'll bring it
down<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:33.020> one<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.470> we<00:02:33.530> can<00:02:33.650> control<00:02:34.010> our

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
down to one and we can control our

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.699 
down to one and we can control our
simmer<00:02:34.520> really<00:02:35.330> easily<00:02:35.660> also<00:02:36.080> in<00:02:36.440> here<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:36.650> we

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
simmer really easily also in here so we

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:37.870 
simmer really easily also in here so we
have<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.860> temperature<00:02:37.220> control<00:02:37.310> if<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.760> don't

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
have a temperature control if you don't

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.240 
have a temperature control if you don't
want<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.060> use<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.300> numbers<00:02:38.569> you<00:02:38.660> can<00:02:38.810> go<00:02:38.930> from

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
want to use the numbers you can go from

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.800 
want to use the numbers you can go from
150<00:02:40.250> degrees<00:02:40.520> all<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.790> way<00:02:40.970> up<00:02:41.120> to<00:02:41.239> 450

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
150 degrees all the way up to 450

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.780 
150 degrees all the way up to 450
degrees<00:02:41.989> it's<00:02:42.920> 30<00:02:43.160> degree<00:02:43.340> increments<00:02:43.550> so

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
degrees it's 30 degree increments so

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.250 
degrees it's 30 degree increments so
it's<00:02:43.970> really<00:02:44.239> safe<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.630> you've<00:02:44.870> also<00:02:45.019> got<00:02:45.110> a

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
it's really safe and you've also got a

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.470 
it's really safe and you've also got a
timer<00:02:45.590> on<00:02:45.709> there<00:02:45.980> for<00:02:46.400> 150<00:02:47.030> minutes<00:02:47.180> as<00:02:47.360> well

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
timer on there for 150 minutes as well

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.300 
timer on there for 150 minutes as well
I'm<00:02:47.720> thinking<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.350> possibilities<00:02:49.130> how

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
I'm thinking of the possibilities how

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.770 
I'm thinking of the possibilities how
many<00:02:49.519> times<00:02:49.790> do<00:02:49.940> you<00:02:50.000> have<00:02:50.150> big<00:02:50.360> family

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
many times do you have big family

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.720 
many times do you have big family
dinners<00:02:51.530> that<00:02:51.560> you're<00:02:51.860> cooking<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:52.280> you<00:02:52.430> just

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
dinners that you're cooking and you just

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.970 
dinners that you're cooking and you just
need<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.120> one<00:02:53.180> extra<00:02:53.959> bar<00:02:54.110> extra<00:02:54.410> burner<00:02:54.650> and

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
need that one extra bar extra burner and

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.770 
need that one extra bar extra burner and
I<00:02:55.220> think<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:55.519> steal<00:02:55.670> these<00:02:55.880> crock<00:02:56.120> pots<00:02:56.420> lined

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
I think you steal these crock pots lined

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.410 
I think you steal these crock pots lined
up<00:02:57.050> and<00:02:57.380> you<00:02:57.709> can't<00:02:57.950> cook<00:02:58.250> really<00:02:58.550> many<00:02:59.330> things

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
up and you can't cook really many things

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.420 
up and you can't cook really many things
in<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.870> crock<00:03:00.080> pot<00:03:00.110> it's<00:03:00.410> stews<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:00.920> slow

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
in the crock pot it's stews and slow

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.430 
in the crock pot it's stews and slow
cooking<00:03:01.760> this<00:03:02.150> is<00:03:02.450> exactly<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.110> same<00:03:03.230> as<00:03:03.350> a

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
cooking this is exactly the same as a

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.650 
cooking this is exactly the same as a
stove<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:04.010> can<00:03:04.069> saute<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:04.910> can<00:03:05.030> pan<00:03:05.239> fry<00:03:05.269> you

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
stove you can saute you can pan fry you

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.570 
stove you can saute you can pan fry you
can<00:03:05.810> pay<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.019> grill<00:03:06.290> but<00:03:06.560> faster<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:07.310> more

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
can pay and grill but faster and more

that is what induction cooking is all

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.509 
that is what induction cooking is all
about<00:03:20.540> that<00:03:20.930> it's<00:03:21.170> only<00:03:21.500> heating<00:03:22.040> up<00:03:22.190> it's

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
about that it's only heating up it's

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.330 
about that it's only heating up it's
only<00:03:22.880> using<00:03:23.299> energy<00:03:23.900> where<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.320> pan<00:03:24.799> is<00:03:25.100> if

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
only using energy where the pan is if

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.009 
only using energy where the pan is if
there<00:03:25.670> were<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.820> bigger<00:03:26.030> pan<00:03:26.360> it<00:03:26.720> would<00:03:26.870> have

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
there were a bigger pan it would have

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.160 
there were a bigger pan it would have
more<00:03:27.290> space<00:03:27.590> or<00:03:27.769> take<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:28.250> up<00:03:28.370> it'll<00:03:28.730> take

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
more space or take it up it'll take

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.960 
more space or take it up it'll take
whatever<00:03:30.170> base<00:03:30.890> of<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.190> pan<00:03:31.370> touches<00:03:31.820> the

whatever base of the pan touches the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.400 
whatever base of the pan touches the
stove<00:03:32.180> that's<00:03:32.450> where<00:03:32.630> it's<00:03:32.750> gonna<00:03:32.810> cook<00:03:33.110> now

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
stove that's where it's gonna cook now

your gravy staying warm all the way
through<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.239> Thanksgiving<00:03:38.690> meal<00:03:39.049> because

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
through that Thanksgiving meal because

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.890 
through that Thanksgiving meal because
you've<00:03:39.560> got<00:03:39.739> this<00:03:39.950> on<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.640> buffet<00:03:41.030> this<00:03:41.660> is

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
you've got this on the buffet this is

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.930 
you've got this on the buffet this is
your<00:03:42.140> saucepan<00:03:42.380> see<00:03:42.920> that<00:03:43.190> saucepan<00:03:43.730> has

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
your saucepan see that saucepan has

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.870 
your saucepan see that saucepan has
magnetic<00:03:44.470> attraction<00:03:45.470> -<00:03:45.920> exactly<00:03:46.489> and<00:03:46.640> that

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
magnetic attraction - exactly and that

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.849 
magnetic attraction - exactly and that
will<00:03:47.120> turn<00:03:47.420> on<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.959> that's<00:03:48.170> how<00:03:48.290> induction

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
will turn on and that's how induction

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.190 
will turn on and that's how induction
works<00:03:49.070> it<00:03:49.310> works<00:03:49.549> through<00:03:50.019> magnetic<00:03:51.019> field

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
works it works through magnetic field

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.289 
works it works through magnetic field
yeah<00:03:51.410> so<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.160> magnetic<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:52.760> electromagnetic

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
yeah so the magnetic and electromagnetic

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.819 
yeah so the magnetic and electromagnetic
coil<00:03:53.900> in<00:03:54.019> here<00:03:54.200> is<00:03:54.290> going<00:03:54.410> to<00:03:54.470> create<00:03:54.709> the

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
coil in here is going to create the

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.710 
coil in here is going to create the
energy<00:03:55.070> in<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.250> pan<00:03:55.459> and<00:03:55.790> that's<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:56.450> only

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
energy in the pan and that's the only

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.550 
energy in the pan and that's the only
place<00:03:56.840> it's<00:03:57.019> going<00:03:57.140> to<00:03:57.200> create<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.470> energy

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
place it's going to create the energy

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.920 
place it's going to create the energy
which<00:03:57.890> creates<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.340> heat<00:03:58.630> excuse<00:03:59.630> me<00:03:59.750> this
