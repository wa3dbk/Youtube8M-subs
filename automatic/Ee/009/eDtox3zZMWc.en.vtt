00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 the new were still albert fermentation 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.160
 not yet won 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.259
 Peter trap becomes a problem already play 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.970
 scroll forward a long time 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.040
 for sprinting it speaks and livable 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.450
 goes a long sprint but 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.540
 pay attention to newbie account that 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.730
 we now lower is already exhausted but look up 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.590
 looks up and gives it to me and he 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.789
 there he goes and then he goes it 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.000
 red is closed but the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.990
 rotor never just harry this cannot and 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.480
 then it could be that 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.130
 Peter can't tell you this is this 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.190
 page 2 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.040
 this the now loading was on its way to profit 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.440
 gl over and driven into the hackers 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.820
 he is about a meter or two from that 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.930
 profit java 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.930
 we all have to look at it again 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.239
 that is the question of course that has 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.309
 not 100% deliberately done, he stibat 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.530
 is already there now 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.109
 but we, the new boot 33 seconds 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.109
 ice pray here in 33 seconds 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.619
 the sprint needed as soon as possible 48 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.780
 seconds is the backlog of nation 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.460
 the ranking on that albert you no 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.460
 to pick up politics 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.939
 so subject to type 2 the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.070
 new laren 3 peeters extended 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.720
 apologies from stiba 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.610
 and we were seemingly unacceptable 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.870
 do that again but he had 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.270
 no chance 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.400
 and was there besides yes but the problem is 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.780
 for the new laren 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.280
 so you can reconcile yourself with that 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.800
 it's just ice never 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.740
 he was therefore on the arrival time 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.580
 a line and so he gets up by one 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.470
 a nice one 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.470
 be told if they have computer on last weeks 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.650
 it is put in place by the computer 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.490
 two them 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.790
 repeat the commotion again 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.790
 do you ever say things a few times 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:06.619
 he comes to bart and alice pray what 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.520
 agree on f4 as long as he really gets there 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.759
 applause 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.350
 let 's go see it again he thinks 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.910
 I have strength enough to take it far 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.989
 but the new boot has got there 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.940
 good at stalls and weather 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.890
 marlin also the watering can 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.840
 as it is called hello kitty by blood that 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.850
 in that system goes with the now rare on it 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.980
 walk the new there is next to it 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.200
 comes over and then becomes dot 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.239
 in which hacking must be drummed 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.239
 be declassified yes point other line 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.100
 and yet and yet there is next door there 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.519
 is on the right and the model for that 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.709
 stybar 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:44.780
 carney no that's pretty greasy 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.360
 So, but now let them really do that bar 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.480
 classify who do you think wins 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.230
 kriterion no no peeters that's what i am 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.230
 just said before
