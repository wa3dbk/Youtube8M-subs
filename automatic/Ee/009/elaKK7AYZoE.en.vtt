and this also works for low-level guys
too<00:01:02.059> especially<00:01:02.800> this<00:01:03.800> is<00:01:03.949> mainly<00:01:04.159> aimed

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
too especially this is mainly aimed

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.190 
too especially this is mainly aimed
towards<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.360> lower<00:01:05.690> level<00:01:06.020> people

towards the lower level people

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.490 
towards the lower level people
adjustments<00:01:06.890> just<00:01:07.369> because<00:01:07.960> fall<00:01:08.960> in<00:01:09.110> our<00:01:09.350> low

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
adjustments just because fall in our low

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.550 
adjustments just because fall in our low
level<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.630> it's<00:01:11.630> easier<00:01:11.990> for<00:01:12.020> them<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.290> kill

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
level and it's easier for them to kill

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.070 
level and it's easier for them to kill
and<00:01:12.970> for<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.030> higher<00:01:14.210> level<00:01:14.600> people<00:01:14.840> they<00:01:15.020> do

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
and for the higher level people they do

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.170 
and for the higher level people they do
drop<00:01:15.500> legendary<00:01:16.009> engrams<00:01:16.190> it's<00:01:16.670> just<00:01:16.850> not<00:01:17.030> as

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
drop legendary engrams it's just not as

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.840
