okay welcome to part three of rügen
Lin's<00:00:05.359> with<00:00:06.359> this<00:00:06.509> position<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:07.259> we<00:00:07.680> see<00:00:07.890> on

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
Lin's with this position that we see on

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.200 
Lin's with this position that we see on
the<00:00:08.130> board<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.550> want<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.880> explain<00:00:09.150> something

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
the board I want to explain something

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.259 
the board I want to explain something
about<00:00:09.780> what's<00:00:10.349> called<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.889> long<00:00:11.639> side<00:00:11.940> on<00:00:12.179> the

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
about what's called the long side on the

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.570 
about what's called the long side on the
short<00:00:12.540> side<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:13.799> rock<00:00:14.009> endings

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
short side in rock endings

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.599 
short side in rock endings
we<00:00:15.030> saw<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.450> fields<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.839> position<00:00:16.320> in

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
we saw in the fields of position in

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.599 
we saw in the fields of position in
broken<00:00:17.609> mixed<00:00:17.789> number<00:00:18.000> two<00:00:18.199> that<00:00:19.220> in<00:00:20.220> a

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
broken mixed number two that in a

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.220 
broken mixed number two that in a
certain<00:00:20.789> position<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.600> was<00:00:21.720> important<00:00:22.199> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
certain position it was important to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.700 
certain position it was important to
give<00:00:22.470> such<00:00:22.740> checks<00:00:23.279> from<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.760> side<00:00:24.710> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
give such checks from this side the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.160 
give such checks from this side the
black<00:00:26.250> group<00:00:26.430> was<00:00:26.640> checking<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.449> white<00:00:27.930> king

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
black group was checking the white king

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.990 
black group was checking the white king
from<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.500> side<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.250> position<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.730> we

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
from the side in this position that we

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.959 
from the side in this position that we
see<00:00:30.179> here<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.840> same<00:00:31.109> idea<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.430> way<00:00:32.610> for

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
see here the same idea is the way for

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.810 
see here the same idea is the way for
black<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.719> achieve<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.260> draw<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.399> go<00:00:35.610> with

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
black to achieve a draw is to go with

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.610 
black to achieve a draw is to go with
this<00:00:35.940> rope<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.329> a-1<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.020> then<00:00:37.200> starts

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
this rope to a-1 and then starts

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.150 
this rope to a-1 and then starts
checking<00:00:37.920> from<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.790> king<00:00:39.329> from<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.600> side

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
checking from this king from the side

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.920 
checking from this king from the side
now<00:00:41.540> in<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.719> case<00:00:44.180> black<00:00:45.180> can<00:00:45.360> achieve<00:00:45.660> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
now in this case black can achieve a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.240 
now in this case black can achieve a
draw<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.879> the<00:00:47.879> reason<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.510> because<00:00:49.039> he<00:00:50.039> can

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
draw and the reason is because he can

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.080 
draw and the reason is because he can
give<00:00:50.510> these<00:00:51.510> checks<00:00:51.899> from<00:00:52.890> what<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.520> call<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
give these checks from what we call the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.410 
give these checks from what we call the
long<00:00:54.300> side<00:00:54.770> this<00:00:55.770> part<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> board<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
long side this part of the board the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.990 
long side this part of the board the
left<00:00:57.690> part<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.350> case<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.730> called

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
left part in this case is what we called

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.529 
left part in this case is what we called
the<00:01:00.090> long<00:01:00.120> side<00:01:01.070> because<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.399> white<00:01:02.969> king<00:01:03.300> is

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the long side because the white king is

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.640 
the long side because the white king is
an<00:01:03.750> e7<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.739> there<00:01:05.070> are<00:01:05.189> more<00:01:06.110> fields<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
an e7 so there are more fields on the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.920 
an e7 so there are more fields on the
left<00:01:07.680> side<00:01:08.070> than<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.909> right<00:01:09.090> side<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.600> this

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
left side than on the right side so this

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.820 
left side than on the right side so this
we<00:01:10.110> call<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.439> short<00:01:10.650> side<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.630> this<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:13.619> long

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
we call the short side and this the long

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.120 
we call the short side and this the long
side<00:01:14.270> now<00:01:15.270> let's<00:01:15.299> have<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.720> look<00:01:15.869> about<00:01:16.710> how

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
side now let's have a look about how

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.130 
side now let's have a look about how
this<00:01:18.439> position<00:01:19.439> could<00:01:19.710> develop<00:01:20.780> first<00:01:21.780> black

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
this position could develop first black

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.940 
this position could develop first black
Moses<00:01:22.590> group<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.130> a-1<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:24.350> what<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.560> whites

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
Moses group to a-1 and what one whites

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.370 
Moses group to a-1 and what one whites
wants<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.759> course<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:27.240> movie<00:01:27.840> Stroup<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
wants to do of course is movie Stroup to

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.060 
wants to do of course is movie Stroup to
d8<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:29.220> -<00:01:30.590> this<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.829> put<00:01:32.369> scheme<00:01:32.640> away<00:01:32.939> and

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
d8 then - this is put scheme away and

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.210 
d8 then - this is put scheme away and
advances<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.189> pawn<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> actually<00:01:37.740> he<00:01:37.829> needs<00:01:38.070> to

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
advances on pawn so actually he needs to

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.030 
advances on pawn so actually he needs to
move<00:01:38.400> these<00:01:38.670> two<00:01:38.729> pieces<00:01:39.119> away<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:40.350> make<00:01:40.530> space

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
move these two pieces away to make space

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.940 
move these two pieces away to make space
for<00:01:41.100> his<00:01:41.490> own<00:01:42.829> bone<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.040> advance<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.790> also

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
for his own bone to advance and also

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.499 
for his own bone to advance and also
because<00:01:46.950> black<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.369> threatening<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.270> check

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
because black is threatening a check

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.580 
because black is threatening a check
from<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.020> side<00:01:49.490> white<00:01:50.490> place<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.630> rook<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.350> d8

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
from the side white place the rook to d8

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.060 
from the side white place the rook to d8
in<00:01:53.009> order<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.460> put<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.880> between<00:01:54.259> if<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.860> check

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
in order to put it between if a check

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.950 
in order to put it between if a check
comes<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.670> that's<00:01:56.850> exactly<00:01:57.270> what<00:01:57.540> happens

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
comes and that's exactly what happens

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.490 
comes and that's exactly what happens
black<00:01:58.350> gives<00:01:58.770> check<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.930> white<00:02:00.930> puts<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
black gives check and white puts the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.999 
black gives check and white puts the
rock<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.799> between<00:02:02.130> 97<00:02:03.110> then<00:02:04.110> now<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.560> black

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
rock in between 97 then now the black

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.830 
rock in between 97 then now the black
rook<00:02:05.250> goes<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.240> eight

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.680 

there<00:02:09.410> is<00:02:09.530> not<00:02:09.920> much<00:02:10.480> to<00:02:11.800> try<00:02:12.800> for<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:13.690> white

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
there is not much to try for a white

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.470 
there is not much to try for a white
except<00:02:15.230> waiting<00:02:16.190> one<00:02:16.400> move<00:02:16.640> by<00:02:16.970> playing<00:02:17.269> the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
except waiting one move by playing the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.140 
except waiting one move by playing the
loop<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:17.840> b7<00:02:18.310> maybe<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.459> think<00:02:19.700> it's<00:02:19.940> possible

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
loop to b7 maybe you think it's possible

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.920 
loop to b7 maybe you think it's possible
to<00:02:20.480> play<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.870> king<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.230> d6<00:02:22.090> but<00:02:23.090> what<00:02:23.720> then

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
to play the king to d6 but what then

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.440 
to play the king to d6 but what then
happens<00:02:24.319> is<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.190> black<00:02:25.430> King<00:02:25.700> comes

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
happens is that the black King comes

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.190 
happens is that the black King comes
closer<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.989> f6<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:28.000> then<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.450> gets<00:02:29.780> really

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
closer to f6 and then it gets really

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.009 
closer to f6 and then it gets really
very<00:02:30.500> very<00:02:30.709> difficult<00:02:31.180> for<00:02:32.180> white<00:02:32.330> because

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
very very difficult for white because

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:40.630 
very very difficult for white because
after<00:02:34.900> for<00:02:35.900> example<00:02:35.930> e<00:02:37.000> 7<00:02:38.680> then<00:02:39.680> there<00:02:40.459> are

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
after for example e 7 then there are

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.059 
after for example e 7 then there are
different<00:02:41.120> ways<00:02:41.299> for<00:02:41.569> black<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.170> make<00:02:42.709> a<00:02:42.769> draw

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
different ways for black to make a draw

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.430 
different ways for black to make a draw
one<00:02:43.489> of<00:02:43.610> them<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:43.940> going<00:02:44.209> with<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.510> king<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:45.049> f7

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
one of them is going with the king to f7

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.729 
one of them is going with the king to f7
and<00:02:45.709> then<00:02:46.370> he<00:02:47.090> has<00:02:47.299> total<00:02:47.840> control<00:02:47.870> of<00:02:48.500> this

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
and then he has total control of this

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.729 
and then he has total control of this
square<00:02:49.519> here<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.120> there<00:02:50.480> is<00:02:50.620> practically<00:02:51.620> no

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
square here and there is practically no

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.520 
square here and there is practically no
way<00:02:52.250> for<00:02:52.310> white<00:02:52.849> to<00:02:53.299> get<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.720> square<00:02:54.079> even

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
way for white to get that square even

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.850 
way for white to get that square even
not<00:02:54.950> by<00:02:55.310> playing<00:02:55.670> this<00:02:56.209> rook<00:02:56.599> to<00:02:56.810> d8<00:02:56.989> but<00:02:57.590> then

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
not by playing this rook to d8 but then

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.300 
not by playing this rook to d8 but then
because<00:02:58.549> then<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.739> checks<00:03:00.739> from<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.950> side

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
because then the checks from the side

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.809 
because then the checks from the side
come<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.360> this<00:03:03.260> checks<00:03:03.620> there<00:03:04.010> is<00:03:04.099> no<00:03:04.579> way<00:03:04.790> to

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
come and this checks there is no way to

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.339 
come and this checks there is no way to
escape<00:03:05.500> for<00:03:06.500> for<00:03:06.829> white<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:08.480> we<00:03:08.900> go<00:03:09.079> back<00:03:09.110> to

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
escape for for white so we go back to

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:15.129 
escape for for white so we go back to
the<00:03:09.590> position<00:03:10.069> where<00:03:10.420> we<00:03:11.420> left<00:03:13.540> it's<00:03:14.540> open

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
the position where we left it's open

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.629 
the position where we left it's open
sorry<00:03:15.380> it's<00:03:15.650> right<00:03:16.370> here<00:03:17.769> white<00:03:18.769> can<00:03:18.980> play<00:03:19.010> is

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
sorry it's right here white can play is

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.770 
sorry it's right here white can play is
rook<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.209> d7<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:21.170> then<00:03:21.319> comes<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:22.250> into<00:03:22.940> g6

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
rook to d7 and then comes the into g6

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.330 
rook to d7 and then comes the into g6
and<00:03:24.109> if<00:03:24.709> white<00:03:25.639> moves<00:03:26.359> his<00:03:26.690> scheme<00:03:26.930> away<00:03:27.230> to

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
and if white moves his scheme away to

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.240 
and if white moves his scheme away to
give<00:03:28.340> space<00:03:28.700> for<00:03:28.760> spawn<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:30.560> continue<00:03:31.069> and

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
give space for spawn to continue and

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.259 
give space for spawn to continue and
promote<00:03:31.910> then<00:03:32.620> black<00:03:33.620> can<00:03:33.650> place<00:03:34.220> King<00:03:34.579> to<00:03:34.819> f6

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
promote then black can place King to f6

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.250 
promote then black can place King to f6
and<00:03:35.569> afteri<00:03:35.959> 7<00:03:36.470> king<00:03:37.370> of<00:03:37.519> 7<00:03:37.880> again<00:03:38.359> we<00:03:38.750> see<00:03:39.079> the

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
and afteri 7 king of 7 again we see the

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.770 
and afteri 7 king of 7 again we see the
same<00:03:39.290> kind<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:40.190> position<00:03:40.700> where<00:03:40.970> black<00:03:41.569> has

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
same kind of position where black has

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.250 
same kind of position where black has
total<00:03:42.260> control<00:03:42.290> of<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.160> field<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:44.660> square<00:03:44.989> e

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
total control of the field the square e

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.759 
total control of the field the square e
8<00:03:45.769> so<00:03:46.700> this<00:03:46.940> is<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.329> total<00:03:47.810> draw<00:03:49.660> it<00:03:50.660> could<00:03:51.019> go

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
8 so this is a total draw it could go

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.660 
8 so this is a total draw it could go
like<00:03:51.799> this<00:03:52.160> and<00:03:52.400> then<00:03:52.549> black<00:03:52.910> simply<00:03:53.480> wait

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
like this and then black simply wait

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.199 
like this and then black simply wait
move<00:03:55.670> in<00:03:55.790> this<00:03:55.910> rook<00:03:56.200> back<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:57.410> forward<00:03:57.799> and

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
move in this rook back and forward and

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:04.800 
move in this rook back and forward and
controlling<00:03:59.209> eh<00:04:00.370> okay<00:04:01.370> now<00:04:02.859> the<00:04:03.859> main<00:04:04.069> idea

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
controlling eh okay now the main idea

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.449 
controlling eh okay now the main idea
was<00:04:05.810> in<00:04:06.079> the<00:04:06.169> beginning<00:04:06.290> starting<00:04:07.069> position

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
was in the beginning starting position

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.940 
was in the beginning starting position
that<00:04:08.180> black<00:04:08.569> could<00:04:08.840> give<00:04:09.169> these<00:04:09.349> checks<00:04:09.739> on

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
that black could give these checks on

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.610 
that black could give these checks on
the<00:04:10.040> long<00:04:10.160> side<00:04:10.430> now<00:04:10.730> let's<00:04:11.510> see<00:04:11.780> what<00:04:12.470> would

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
the long side now let's see what would

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.229 
the long side now let's see what would
happen<00:04:12.859> if<00:04:14.260> it<00:04:15.260> this<00:04:15.620> would<00:04:15.860> not<00:04:16.070> be<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.489> long

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
happen if it this would not be the long

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.229 
happen if it this would not be the long
side<00:04:17.479> but<00:04:17.659> the<00:04:17.750> short<00:04:17.989> side<00:04:18.289> I'll<00:04:19.010> show<00:04:19.370> you

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
side but the short side I'll show you

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.300 
side but the short side I'll show you
I'll<00:04:20.299> have<00:04:20.539> to<00:04:20.690> set<00:04:20.900> up<00:04:21.049> a<00:04:21.139> new<00:04:21.289> position<00:04:21.440> so

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
I'll have to set up a new position so

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.279 
I'll have to set up a new position so
just<00:04:22.789> the<00:04:22.940> moment<00:04:23.300> you've<00:04:23.449> seen<00:04:23.690> our<00:04:23.840> strange

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
just the moment you've seen our strange

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.830 
just the moment you've seen our strange
things<00:04:24.620> happening<00:04:25.130> but<00:04:25.250> don't<00:04:25.520> worry<00:04:25.840> it's

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
things happening but don't worry it's

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.610 
things happening but don't worry it's
just<00:04:27.349> I<00:04:27.650> need<00:04:28.160> to<00:04:28.400> move<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.780> pieces<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.470> then

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
just I need to move the pieces and then

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.749 
just I need to move the pieces and then
put<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:31.069> new<00:04:31.370> position<00:04:32.560> like<00:04:33.560> this<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.220> then

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
put a new position like this and then

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:40.110 
put a new position like this and then
like<00:04:35.690> that<00:04:35.750> oh<00:04:37.750> okay

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
like that oh okay

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.790 
like that oh okay
done<00:04:41.120> here<00:04:41.840> we<00:04:41.990> have<00:04:42.169> the<00:04:42.289> new<00:04:42.410> position

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
done here we have the new position

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.939 
done here we have the new position
actually<00:04:43.190> I<00:04:43.460> moved<00:04:43.639> everything<00:04:44.410> one<00:04:45.410> space<00:04:45.770> to

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
actually I moved everything one space to

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.740 
actually I moved everything one space to
the<00:04:45.979> left<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:46.789> see<00:04:46.930> so<00:04:48.069> again<00:04:49.069> it's<00:04:49.599> black<00:04:50.599> to

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
the left you see so again it's black to

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.120 
the left you see so again it's black to
move<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.490> if<00:04:52.490> black<00:04:53.030> moves<00:04:53.060> to<00:04:53.949> tries<00:04:54.949> to

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
move and if black moves to tries to

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.649 
move and if black moves to tries to
achieve<00:04:55.220> after<00:04:55.520> all<00:04:55.729> the<00:04:55.970> same<00:04:56.180> way<00:04:56.389> by

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
achieve after all the same way by

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:59.589 
achieve after all the same way by
playing<00:04:56.960> is<00:04:57.199> rook<00:04:58.099> to<00:04:58.310> a-1<00:04:58.729> and<00:04:58.909> given<00:04:59.479> this

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
playing is rook to a-1 and given this

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.809 
playing is rook to a-1 and given this
checks<00:04:59.900> on<00:05:00.050> this<00:05:00.199> side<00:05:00.409> now<00:05:00.530> this<00:05:01.069> time<00:05:01.340> this

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:01.819 
checks on this side now this time this

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.200 
checks on this side now this time this
is<00:05:01.880> a<00:05:02.000> short<00:05:02.389> side<00:05:02.720> of<00:05:03.199> the<00:05:03.349> board<00:05:03.590> so<00:05:04.220> take<00:05:05.180> a

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
is a short side of the board so take a

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.559 
is a short side of the board so take a
look<00:05:05.389> at<00:05:05.539> what<00:05:05.690> happens<00:05:05.990> then<00:05:06.250> white<00:05:07.250> has<00:05:08.120> the

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 
look at what happens then white has the

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:11.969 
look at what happens then white has the
same<00:05:08.750> plan<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:09.650> now<00:05:10.580> after<00:05:10.880> a<00:05:11.060> check<00:05:11.419> just

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
same plan and now after a check just

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:17.200 
same plan and now after a check just
like<00:05:12.979> before<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:15.740> King<00:05:16.009> there's<00:05:16.940> no<00:05:17.060> need<00:05:17.180> to

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
like before the King there's no need to

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.700 
like before the King there's no need to
put<00:05:17.419> this<00:05:17.509> in<00:05:17.690> between<00:05:17.900> because<00:05:18.229> the<00:05:18.440> King<00:05:18.590> can

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
put this in between because the King can

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.020 
put this in between because the King can
go<00:05:18.830> to<00:05:18.889> c6<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:20.199> after<00:05:21.199> one<00:05:21.889> more<00:05:21.919> check<00:05:22.280> and<00:05:22.849> a

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
go to c6 and after one more check and a

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:29.499 
go to c6 and after one more check and a
six<00:05:24.550> King<00:05:25.550> goes<00:05:25.729> to<00:05:25.880> c7<00:05:26.270> and<00:05:27.310> then<00:05:28.330> after<00:05:29.330> one

six King goes to c7 and then after one

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:31.930 
six King goes to c7 and then after one
more<00:05:29.659> check<00:05:29.930> the<00:05:30.440> King<00:05:30.710> goes<00:05:30.919> to<00:05:31.070> b6<00:05:31.460> and<00:05:31.759> now

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
more check the King goes to b6 and now

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.450 
more check the King goes to b6 and now

the King is attacking the rook on a7 the
rook<00:05:37.699> can<00:05:37.969> go<00:05:38.509> to<00:05:39.500> d7<00:05:39.889> AB<00:05:40.460> then<00:05:40.820> the<00:05:41.120> right<00:05:41.360> King

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:41.659

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
attacks the bullpen and this is a total

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.600 
attacks the bullpen and this is a total
winning<00:05:44.870> position<00:05:45.320> for<00:05:45.710> white<00:05:45.919> because<00:05:46.400> when

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
winning position for white because when

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
winning position for white because when
the<00:05:46.729> roofs<00:05:46.940> goes<00:05:47.210> away<00:05:47.539> he<00:05:48.139> simply<00:05:49.419> have<00:05:50.419> to

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
the roofs goes away he simply have to

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.830 
the roofs goes away he simply have to
two<00:05:51.050> easy<00:05:51.349> ways<00:05:51.590> to<00:05:51.650> win<00:05:52.009> one<00:05:52.639> is<00:05:52.849> advancing

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
two easy ways to win one is advancing

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.950 
two easy ways to win one is advancing
the<00:05:54.080> poem<00:05:54.259> and<00:05:54.500> another<00:05:55.340> one<00:05:55.580> is<00:05:55.819> given<00:05:56.599> here<00:05:56.810> a

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
the poem and another one is given here a

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.129 
the poem and another one is given here a
check<00:05:57.199> this<00:05:57.830> is<00:05:57.979> also<00:05:58.219> totally<00:05:59.030> won<00:05:59.210> so<00:05:59.990> the

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
check this is also totally won so the

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.850 
check this is also totally won so the
difference<00:06:00.620> is<00:06:00.880> that<00:06:01.880> now<00:06:02.259> I'll<00:06:03.259> go<00:06:03.560> back<00:06:03.710> to

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
difference is that now I'll go back to

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.469 
difference is that now I'll go back to
the<00:06:04.009> starting<00:06:04.520> position<00:06:04.639> of<00:06:05.000> this<00:06:05.150> second

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
the starting position of this second

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:08.439 
the starting position of this second
example<00:06:05.569> that<00:06:06.139> the<00:06:06.770> difference<00:06:07.099> is<00:06:07.250> that<00:06:07.699> now

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
example that the difference is that now

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:12.189 
example that the difference is that now
this<00:06:08.780> checks<00:06:09.259> of<00:06:09.560> the<00:06:10.130> black<00:06:10.729> rook<00:06:11.030> come<00:06:11.990> from

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 
this checks of the black rook come from

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.950 
this checks of the black rook come from
the<00:06:12.319> short<00:06:12.620> side<00:06:12.979> there<00:06:13.580> are<00:06:13.699> only<00:06:13.909> two<00:06:14.360> free

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
the short side there are only two free

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.909 
the short side there are only two free
squares<00:06:15.349> here<00:06:15.940> so<00:06:16.940> the<00:06:17.300> white<00:06:17.509> king<00:06:17.840> can<00:06:18.289> go

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
squares here so the white king can go

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.760 
squares here so the white king can go
and<00:06:19.159> attack<00:06:19.460> the<00:06:20.210> black<00:06:20.630> rook<00:06:21.280> easily<00:06:22.280> and<00:06:22.490> so

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
and attack the black rook easily and so

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.469 
and attack the black rook easily and so
this<00:06:24.770> means<00:06:24.949> that<00:06:25.069> black<00:06:25.490> cannot<00:06:26.060> achieve<00:06:26.270> a

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
this means that black cannot achieve a

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:28.270 
this means that black cannot achieve a
draw<00:06:26.810> in<00:06:26.990> this<00:06:27.080> position

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
draw in this position

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.060 
draw in this position
that's<00:06:28.940> the<00:06:29.060> difference<00:06:29.480> between<00:06:29.810> the<00:06:30.560> short

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
that's the difference between the short

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.610 
that's the difference between the short
side<00:06:31.400> and<00:06:31.430> the<00:06:31.790> long<00:06:32.060> side<00:06:32.420> or<00:06:32.750> remember<00:06:33.290> if

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
side and the long side or remember if

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.460 
side and the long side or remember if
you<00:06:34.460> come<00:06:34.760> in<00:06:34.880> one<00:06:35.060> of<00:06:35.150> these<00:06:35.300> endings<00:06:36.020> and<00:06:36.350> you

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
you come in one of these endings and you

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.410 
you come in one of these endings and you
are<00:06:36.620> the<00:06:36.770> defending<00:06:37.280> part<00:06:37.550> so<00:06:37.790> you<00:06:37.820> are<00:06:38.120> upon

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.420 
are the defending part so you are upon

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.560 
are the defending part so you are upon
down<00:06:38.690> you<00:06:39.470> still<00:06:39.740> up<00:06:39.830> your<00:06:39.950> roof<00:06:40.160> try<00:06:41.030> to<00:06:41.090> give

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
down you still up your roof try to give

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.470 
down you still up your roof try to give
your<00:06:41.990> checks<00:06:42.320> from<00:06:42.650> the<00:06:42.830> side<00:06:43.100> from<00:06:44.030> the<00:06:44.210> long

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:44.480 
your checks from the side from the long

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.680 
your checks from the side from the long
side<00:06:44.780> of<00:06:44.810> the<00:06:45.140> board<00:06:45.380> to<00:06:46.220> the<00:06:46.340> white<00:06:46.520> king<00:06:46.790> then

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
side of the board to the white king then

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.060 
side of the board to the white king then
you<00:06:47.900> have<00:06:47.990> a<00:06:48.020> bigger<00:06:48.290> chance<00:06:48.590> of<00:06:49.060> magnetron
