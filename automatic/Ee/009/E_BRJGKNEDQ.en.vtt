 I feel in a situation of failure is 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.019
 the has a failure after a divorce a 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.450
 marriage that went wrong a 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.850
 separation with children 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.739
 very badly spent I wanted to change said 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.340
 I wanted everything started because 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.110
 I am a positive person at the base 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.180
 and then I said to myself common sense and then 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.899
 I'm going to move I'm going I'm going 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.399
 change of job I will change everything 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.020
 start from scratch except that in fact I 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.420
 can not get off the ground 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.980
 divide 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.390
 I started in entrepreneurship 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.059
 is mounted a furniture store of 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.840
 decoration and and then there I come from 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.330
 close 1 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.520
 for three months I do not know how I 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.760
 will bounce again except nth 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.549
 failure and the most hope in fact I 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.740
 do not know what I'm hearing already is that 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.939
 you speak to me of yet another failure 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.049
 are you doing 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.460
 the link between several events yes 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.100
 because it's like a waterfall 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.259
 do I have the impression that ben here is a 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.409
 name of one event driven the other and 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.000
 it can in times when I feel 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.040
 to have two fields what really that 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.750
 everything is against me I do not know how 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.790
 I could get up 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.080
 I drank cowardly hope in the process of 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:47.400
 give up so I got home 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.740
 at home I returned years to grenoble but 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.230
 I'm doing because for now I have 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.380
 no income I have trouble throwing myself 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.620
 in entrepreneurship throw no good 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.230
 already we will have to act in a way to ensure 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.400
 sustainability become today 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.340
 a find a job 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.690
 if you hit unemployment you can 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.800
 do it right now have a 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.200
 job search find a small 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.720
 work we will say ' you will allow 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.060
 killer vibrates and then de 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.710
 start from scratch except for the fact of 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.780
 to smooth out the situation a little 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.070
 something is happening and that's what 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.410
 that I hear in your mind in this 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.200
 moment is that coralie makes you the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.700
 link between several events then to 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.860
 review what's events 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.000
 cascades give me we'll take a 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.170
 example because finally it 'll help 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.480
 all our friends who are listening to this 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.820
 moment this link cascades like that then 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.560
 what are the events where you have 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.750
 the feeling of not being lucky 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.730
 to be in failure and that everything 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.340
 is linked and what are these events 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:49.770
 if they wanted list is already bad 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.690
 marriage is true that mom does it in 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.090
 speak his place and become aware of 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.530
 A lot of things 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.790
 I also remember it's true my husband 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.360
 tell me the often but naughty and 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.850
 will happen nothing a little down and 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.380
 I 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.600
 cries pam in fact he had returned in 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.740
 my brain and yes I'm going to fail in 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.840
 effect that his suitcases does not happen to 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.610
 to succeed what I do 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.020
 I was almost always telling myself 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.760
 also but even after my husband it's 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.470
 true what is it that I am in a 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.410
 bad term as they say in English 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.060
 you know that I find myself in the year 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.320
 it's that perpetual today I 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:34.490
 think it's my state of mind too 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:37.280
 probably something you 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.650
 musical is the bad marriage what 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.880
 we are trotting in the head 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.800
 the new marriage now that it 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.260
 goes back even before I said that 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.400
 is someone whose parents I 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.680
 did not ever be things pretty 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.380
 well at school and I had mails to 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.190
 his good grades had never been 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.350
 enough and in fact I was starting to 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.880
 to persuade of it happened said that 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.670
 I really was really someone from 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.220
 two draws and then it's true that is it 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.480
 that that's not what made me 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.250
 successful that I was in the facts that 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.790
 done in a little while everything can ask 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.570
 the presence is poor today 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.430
 you told me earlier that 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.860
 rally of your wedding or by 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.220
 the waters if I stay in this idea I 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.840
 have chosen you tennis and you me 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.330
 also said you what was the other 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.100
 failure a company that has caught c510 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.660
 yes it may be starting am 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.150
 this time it's the good I 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.030
 recommend bailly I'm moving I'm changing 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.410
 I'm leaving everything from scratch and is 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.240
 new and it's a new failure because 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.950
 that I wanted to go up my shop 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.630
 furniture and decoration but I have my 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.400
 store did not survive very long 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.880
 I had a lot of trouble getting organized 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.270
 manage the accounts I was overwhelmed the 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.800
 orders 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.800
 I could not actually I'm not 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.660
 arrived so left crate I believe that 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.110
 I still have not found that why I 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.730
 am really done in life I believe 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.110
 in fact I miss is that 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.090
 now I realize it by speaking to you 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.409
 without it going very well is this 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.110
 thank you 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:11.089
 realizing that it may have happened 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.819
 enough work on nature myself 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:15.649
 to know that what I really liked 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.849
 in life what were my talents 

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.739
 real talents 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.659
 maybe for your put plunges me at every 

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:22.959
 times in adventures that me 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:25.550
 do not agree and lead to failure 

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:26.929
 you coraline there was some 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.179
 something that is pretty strong in general 

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:30.349
 we find when we have when we 

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:32.330
 feels a sense of failure 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:34.069
 I would like some keys in a 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.569
 moment right after the break but 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:37.009
 I would like to finish with you coralie in 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:39.559
 general when we feel a feeling 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.849
 failure is because we are in 

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:42.919
 in united what I call a 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.929
 illusion of life after a while there 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.219
 sometimes has repetitions of 

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:47.419
 behavior that we have and who are 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:49.099
 completely unaware 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.779
 that will be the first thing that I 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.759
 commits you to work because 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:54.589
 times it's hard to see a return on 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.909
 we ourselves discuss like this and then 

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:57.079
 sometimes we are surprised at the reaction of 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:58.339
 but I did not tell you that too if you 

00:05:57.079 --> 00:06:00.889
 told me that but in time but it was 

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:03.229
 positive what I'm telling you in fact we did not 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:04.729
 no feedback on our communication 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.349
 so nothing about how we 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.029
 communicates with others we have very little 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.949
 back so I imagined in the 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:11.419
 business in the couple this is 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:12.949
 much more complex than it seems 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.949
 and when we do not know each other 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:18.919
 well enough we sometimes have a 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.329
 proportion deduce from two bad 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.759
 conclusions and then in addition obviously 

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:24.529
 there is education the beliefs that 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:25.459
 pass the parents what you were told 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:27.469
 you are a person 

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:28.939
 imagine good and your husband who in 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:30.050
 add a little layer that had 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:33.349
 look to be a little toxic of this 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.579
 side there many people are no longer 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:37.069
 to belittle others to make sure 

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:38.360
 pcc the very simple human technique 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:40.729
 it's the principle of jealousy too 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.959
 a roll of modeling to say wow 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:43.909
 it's great what you do I want to do 

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:46.189
 like you oh that's not good vade retro 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:48.229
 satana it's not hardly byword we have a 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:49.459
 kind of ease us there to cut 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:51.259
 short to choose what is more 

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:53.959
 simple to advance to protect our 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:55.909
 ego this leadership psychology put 

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:57.110
 apart from what happened to you and 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:59.800
 it's my feedback is what I can 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.879
 give you my feedback 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.800
 it might be a little rough 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:04.310
 but my beautiful you are in a kind 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.010
 island 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.750
 lyon still alive I have the feeling 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.100
 to be in failure you tell me but 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.050
 you are not in failure 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.970
 watch what happened you 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.470
 good marriage that messed up 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:19.900
 are you the only person 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:22.220
 who decides to separate on the planet 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.910
 are all the people separating 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.910
 are in failure 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.330
 that's what my parents had repeated 

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.220
 failed even look in your ivory tone 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.840
 same time agreement for marriage 

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.160
 tech or in all my poor girl is 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:38.330
 so it's true that these words there she 

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.830
 trots in my head but I'm not 

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.480
 ok I do not agree it's not 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.370
 because you separate from a person this
