kales<00:00:12.370> blade<00:00:12.639> from<00:00:13.030> God<00:00:13.299> of<00:00:13.330> War<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:14.740> may<00:00:15.099> have

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
kales blade from God of War it may have

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.250 
kales blade from God of War it may have
felt<00:00:15.459> faithfully<00:00:16.180> of<00:00:16.299> LEGO<00:00:16.510> bricks<00:00:16.600> as<00:00:17.140> you

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.260 
felt faithfully of LEGO bricks as you

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.859 
felt faithfully of LEGO bricks as you
can<00:00:17.439> see<00:00:17.650> and<00:00:18.119> yeah<00:00:19.119> I<00:00:19.390> think<00:00:19.510> it's<00:00:19.779> pretty

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
can see and yeah I think it's pretty

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.800 
can see and yeah I think it's pretty
cool<00:00:20.140> so<00:00:21.039> it's<00:00:21.730> got<00:00:21.880> quite<00:00:22.000> a<00:00:22.090> few<00:00:22.119> features

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
cool so it's got quite a few features

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.960 
cool so it's got quite a few features
like<00:00:23.320> it's<00:00:23.560> added<00:00:24.189> as<00:00:24.279> much<00:00:24.400> detail<00:00:24.789> as<00:00:24.820> I

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
like it's added as much detail as I

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.450 
like it's added as much detail as I
could<00:00:25.210> as<00:00:25.840> you<00:00:25.900> can<00:00:26.140> see<00:00:26.320> it's<00:00:26.590> got<00:00:26.859> slight<00:00:27.189> and

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
could as you can see it's got slight and

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.240 
could as you can see it's got slight and
dents<00:00:27.939> in<00:00:28.210> the<00:00:28.330> side<00:00:28.740> spaces<00:00:29.740> like<00:00:29.980> on<00:00:30.160> the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
dents in the side spaces like on the

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.619 
dents in the side spaces like on the
real<00:00:30.400> blade<00:00:30.730> and<00:00:31.529> it's<00:00:32.529> got<00:00:32.680> this<00:00:32.770> little

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629

thing over here the real one does have
that<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:37.809> spiky<00:00:38.620> bit<00:00:38.739> on<00:00:38.829> top<00:00:39.010> and<00:00:40.140> handle<00:00:41.140> I

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
that and spiky bit on top and handle I

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.319 
that and spiky bit on top and handle I
try<00:00:41.530> to<00:00:41.590> make<00:00:41.860> try<00:00:42.489> to<00:00:42.550> make<00:00:42.700> this<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:43.120> whole

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
try to make try to make this the whole

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.959 
try to make try to make this the whole
thing<00:00:43.660> as<00:00:44.050> close<00:00:44.649> to<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.219> blade<00:00:45.489> as<00:00:45.610> I<00:00:45.730> could

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
thing as close to the blade as I could

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:48.150 
thing as close to the blade as I could
so<00:00:46.239> as<00:00:46.899> you<00:00:47.079> can<00:00:47.170> see<00:00:47.289> I<00:00:47.320> tried<00:00:47.649> to<00:00:47.800> add<00:00:47.920> so<00:00:48.070> much

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
so as you can see I tried to add so much

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.560 
so as you can see I tried to add so much
detail<00:00:48.460> as<00:00:48.670> I<00:00:48.789> could<00:00:49.030> and<00:00:50.550> yeah<00:00:51.550> and<00:00:51.879> you've

detail as I could and yeah and you've

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.209 
detail as I could and yeah and you've
probably<00:00:52.690> seen<00:00:52.899> this<00:00:53.109> chain<00:00:53.559> hanging<00:00:53.890> around

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
probably seen this chain hanging around

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.400 
probably seen this chain hanging around
quite<00:00:54.430> a<00:00:54.460> lot<00:00:54.550> so<00:00:54.969> yeah<00:00:55.719> I<00:00:55.750> just<00:00:55.960> wanna<00:00:56.230> add

quite a lot so yeah I just wanna add

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.049 
quite a lot so yeah I just wanna add
like<00:00:56.649> a<00:00:56.680> little<00:00:56.980> change<00:00:57.160> with<00:00:57.280> decoration<00:00:57.820> and

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
like a little change with decoration and

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.060 
like a little change with decoration and
I<00:00:58.719> know<00:00:58.899> it's<00:00:59.019> pretty<00:00:59.260> small<00:00:59.590> compared<00:01:00.039> to

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
I know it's pretty small compared to

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.090 
I know it's pretty small compared to
actual<00:01:00.280> chain<00:01:00.699> just<00:01:01.329> quite<00:01:01.600> large<00:01:01.930> and<00:01:02.800> this

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
actual chain just quite large and this

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
actual chain just quite large and this
was<00:01:03.850> larger<00:01:04.120> than<00:01:04.240> this<00:01:04.300> anyway<00:01:04.660> and<00:01:06.090> well<00:01:07.090> I

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
was larger than this anyway and well I

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.640 
was larger than this anyway and well I
didn't<00:01:07.480> want<00:01:07.600> to<00:01:07.690> add<00:01:07.780> any<00:01:07.810> string<00:01:08.350> or<00:01:08.470> rope

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
didn't want to add any string or rope

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.020 
didn't want to add any string or rope
because<00:01:08.980> I<00:01:09.070> didn't<00:01:09.430> think<00:01:09.550> you<00:01:09.670> look<00:01:09.850> too

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
because I didn't think you look too

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.330 
because I didn't think you look too
great<00:01:10.300> I<00:01:10.690> said<00:01:11.290> I'd<00:01:11.440> like<00:01:11.590> some<00:01:11.830> sort<00:01:12.010> of<00:01:12.040> chain

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
great I said I'd like some sort of chain

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.820 
great I said I'd like some sort of chain
looking<00:01:12.640> thing<00:01:12.940> so<00:01:13.150> I<00:01:13.180> did<00:01:13.390> this<00:01:13.540> just<00:01:14.170> Lego<00:01:14.500> so

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
looking thing so I did this just Lego so

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.710 
looking thing so I did this just Lego so
it's<00:01:14.950> much<00:01:15.070> more<00:01:15.250> easy<00:01:15.400> spawn<00:01:15.790> made<00:01:16.510> it<00:01:16.600> quite

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
it's much more easy spawn made it quite

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.350 
bricks and grey bricks and then
eventually<00:01:50.950> just<00:01:51.220> great<00:01:51.610> make<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.030> but<00:01:52.150> came

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
eventually just great make it but came

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.720 
eventually just great make it but came
out<00:01:52.510> a<00:01:52.540> multicolored<00:01:53.050> like<00:01:53.200> this<00:01:53.380> so<00:01:54.280> I<00:01:54.370> had<00:01:54.580> to

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
out a multicolored like this so I had to

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.060 
out a multicolored like this so I had to
in<00:01:54.910> the<00:01:54.940> mix<00:01:55.300> up<00:01:55.480> a<00:01:55.600> bit<00:01:55.780> so<00:01:56.620> there's<00:01:56.920> been<00:01:57.040> a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
in the mix up a bit so there's been a

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.330 
in the mix up a bit so there's been a
bit<00:01:57.220> hectic<00:01:57.370> but<00:01:57.940> yeah<00:01:58.810> I<00:01:59.170> mean<00:01:59.890> if<00:02:00.010> it<00:02:00.160> looks

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
bit hectic but yeah I mean if it looks

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.070 
bit hectic but yeah I mean if it looks
like<00:02:00.460> an<00:02:00.610> actual<00:02:00.760> do<00:02:00.970> actual<00:02:01.390> colors<00:02:01.750> I<00:02:01.870> think
