00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.700
 Let's start by separating our eggs 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.550
 egg whites from sugar yolks and whip 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.119
 we will add flour starch and flour 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.090
 almonds 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.320
 we mix well and continue 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.930
 adding our melted butter 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.849
 we continue by mounting the egg whites we go 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.920
 to add it to the other compound 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.449
 delicate movements I recommend not 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.460
 we must dismantle ours too 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:38.390
 compound we are going to fill our own 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.510
 molds we bake at 180 degrees for 40 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.530
 minutes after 45 minutes of cooking we go 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.530
 to churn out our parishes 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:52.129
 perfectly golden and let's go 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.100
 cool down here and in the meantime let's go 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:01:06.590
 to chop the chocolate and melt it a 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:10.970
 bain-marie and we mix well 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:14.890
 until all is undissolved e 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.890
 we're going to frost our building 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.619
 our chocolate 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.899
 we are going to position our buildings 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:31.450
 on a grill with a container underneath 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:46.079
 the mask that will go to collect the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:46.079
 our chocolate 1 2 3 and 4 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:55.630
 gently sprinkle the parrozzo in 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.659
 chocolate surface to cover them 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.689
 do not completely leave no holes 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.569
 leave spaces I recommend a few shots 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.979
 to level our chocolate 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.979
 let's go and plant our buildings 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.840
 serving dish from the rocket 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.610
 we place in the middle a couple of 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.530
 decorative almonds evenly over if you want 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.090
 our building is ready and waiting for you 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.660
 for another unmistakable recipe
