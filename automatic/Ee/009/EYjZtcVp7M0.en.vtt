00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.530
 Well, this time we are with very little duty black ops 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.790
 and how to practice the way to get the trophy 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.759
 guide in the eleven mission that is called double uve mere 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.560
 the trophy begins the cup at the beginning of the mission 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.009
 there is a section where you have to 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.009
 guide certain people who did 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.659
 then objective 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:30.340
 and in this case what you have to do to get the trophy is 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.340
 keep all four people 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.960
 and well this is not very complicated nothing more them as soon as possible 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.380
 clarifications here 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.600
 to begin with obviously the first thing we are going to do is take them to the objective 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.960
 that mark us 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.690
 the game 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.080
 simply present crisis 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.980
 vanina towards her 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.540
 We wait for the clarification that needs to be made here 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.610
 important bases 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.450
 efe when they enter the house immediately they reach the point appear 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.030
 the indicator to enter the cimos house that delivers the house 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.920
 and well that's not going to look down and let's start playing one of the 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.370
 people that was in the house 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.790
 the problem here is why some people do not give these the trophy 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.120
 is that sometimes 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.720
 one of the three characters that this one with us dies 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.090
 i almost never realize it 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.360
 The first thing we are going to do is kill the second person who enters the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.360
 home times as per objective in 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.010
 in this point 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.560
 we notice 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.350
 recharge 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.420
 and while the October flash we have pointed not only carried all trick 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.689
 the disasters 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.750
 we kill each other 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.930
 and here is where it seems 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.190
 our partners die what I'm looking for is quickly at the door to check 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.159
 that indeed our three companions were there 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.350
 the problem here is that sometimes when 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.409
 step this section one of the 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.959
 not of the three companions dies 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.069
 and the other and immediately the pope showed this section when we go from 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.649
 new aerial view 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:16.709
 it revives 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.969
 who knows why but river we have no way of realizing 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:22.680
 who actually died 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.410
 that's what we're going to do this before on the airfield again change and 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.140
 towards the door that cost him a while ago to turn around and review what is actively 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.079
 in three other companions who were alive 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.579
 once we review that 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.790
 I regret to say that we continue with ambition to 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.279
 before continuing we must clarify that 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:43.669
 singh if any of your peers will not die what you have to do wife of the 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:46.649
 game and restart the mission the principle because 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:50.509
 who knows why in this trophy we give Ivan cuit and then 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.709
 we recharged in the last time we're in 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.709
 the trojan is given us high from the simplest 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:03:00.489
 percent the restore completely 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.019
 once we confirm this situation we continue to aim for both 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.669
 people who are 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:08.079
 To the left of 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.109
 from the point of with 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.810
 and we press x so that close that our companions arrive they eliminate them 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:19.509
 they will see a small thank you I'll take the mine 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:23.619
 the two people lacks turn black agents and we tell them that it continues in 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:24.839
 ascent 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:27.279
 the point that receives the mission 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:30.859
 we wait for it to arrive even when they go to the second point 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:36.719
 we are going to say that to the second point but they have begun to arrive one a 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:40.399
 enemy platoon what we're going to do quickly presents r3 

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:44.019
 and we're going to see how other colleagues who came back in black that 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.659
 means that they are already hidden 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.629
 we wait for the peloton to pass 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.169
 if everything went well obviously our colleagues boalo be detected and 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:58.509
 and the hair all go through the game so tell us that they are indeed 

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.529
 hidden inside the pole so that should not be any problem 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:05.899
 we continue towards the Indian point the only thing that is missing are the barracks 

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:09.429
 we are going to tell him to move towards the barracks 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:12.639
 and well we can lower mine to 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.639
 start playing with one of the people in the squad 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.289
 when we finish the barracks when he leaves 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.029
 is what the trophy we are going to move together grenades forward 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.889
 which is where some enemies are going to come 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.570
 we agreed roughness or four enemies that are already in the room 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.389
 and well after these sections where in theory the procedure of the shock 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.249
 when we put the pump on the wall 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:50.729
 Hilda detonates to start a small court of ten ignorant cut off deaths in 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.020
 where the professor himself 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.300
 we interviewed cases their colleagues are alive 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.460
 we have three more 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.189
 behave so other products 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:04.189
 we put the ma on the wall 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.530
 to take the process of unlocking in this case with the yatiri the pro was 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.839
 but not knowing what to expect in theory and then unlock 

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:17.669
 when the tenth cut begins it is where the games of the bosco gift of the trophy 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:18.800
 unlock 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.400
 - but they removed clarifications that from the beginning in which 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.860
 probably our partners die 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.460
 But well, since that's already happening, we're on the other side, there are rules that 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.229
 take them to 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.069
 to the last point is yours the look put on stand are dinner cut and 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.389
 here at this point where the trophy is unlocked 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.860
 you throw television very well the first house because it's where always a very 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.199
 followed by no mosul we do not in fact expect or distress the other two powers 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:50.620
 dismissal 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.270
 - this as for that trophy
