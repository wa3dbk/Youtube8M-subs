stars it's it's really cool so as I said

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.850 
stars it's it's really cool so as I said
before<00:04:43.070> our<00:04:43.490> 19th<00:04:43.940> my<00:04:44.780> favorite<00:04:45.140> bike<00:04:45.350> at<00:04:45.680> the

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
before our 19th my favorite bike at the

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.060 
before our 19th my favorite bike at the
moment<00:04:46.220> so<00:04:46.960> will<00:04:47.960> we<00:04:48.110> see<00:04:48.350> more<00:04:48.530> of<00:04:48.710> that<00:04:48.740> stuff

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
moment so will we see more of that stuff

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.940 
moment so will we see more of that stuff
will<00:04:49.550> you<00:04:49.669> have<00:04:49.850> kind<00:04:50.240> of<00:04:50.390> a<00:04:50.590> heritage<00:04:51.590> line

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
will you have kind of a heritage line

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.840 
will you have kind of a heritage line
maybe<00:04:52.790> in<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.180> future<00:04:53.360> I<00:04:54.010> I<00:04:55.010> think<00:04:55.550> it<00:04:55.700> would

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
maybe in the future I I think it would

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.300 
maybe in the future I I think it would
make<00:04:56.030> sense<00:04:56.060> yeah<00:04:56.720> and<00:04:57.320> this<00:04:57.560> is<00:04:57.740> also<00:04:57.950> why<00:04:58.160> we

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
make sense yeah and this is also why we

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.680 
make sense yeah and this is also why we
want<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.550> see<00:04:58.700> what<00:04:58.850> people<00:04:58.880> think<00:04:59.270> about<00:04:59.419> this

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
want to see what people think about this

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.440 
want to see what people think about this
bike<00:04:59.900> of<00:05:00.110> course<00:05:00.350> because<00:05:00.760> on<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:01.940> 90<00:05:02.330> you

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
bike of course because on the 90 you

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.480 
bike of course because on the 90 you
could<00:05:02.630> still<00:05:02.840> do<00:05:02.990> so<00:05:03.200> much<00:05:03.440> I<00:05:03.770> mean<00:05:04.010> here<00:05:04.310> this

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
could still do so much I mean here this

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.170 
could still do so much I mean here this
is<00:05:04.640> the<00:05:04.669> same<00:05:05.060> chassis<00:05:05.450> same<00:05:05.990> tank<00:05:06.350> it's

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
is the same chassis same tank it's

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.460 
is the same chassis same tank it's
basically<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.300> same<00:05:08.570> bike<00:05:08.840> we<00:05:09.050> just<00:05:09.229> jacked

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
basically the same bike we just jacked

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.830 
basically the same bike we just jacked
it<00:05:09.620> up<00:05:09.740> different<00:05:10.340> front<00:05:10.550> wheel<00:05:10.840> different

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
it up different front wheel different

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.480 
it up different front wheel different
rear<00:05:11.990> wheel<00:05:12.200> but<00:05:12.530> you<00:05:12.710> know<00:05:12.830> it's<00:05:13.010> it's<00:05:13.280> the

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
rear wheel but you know it's it's the

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.420 
rear wheel but you know it's it's the
same<00:05:13.729> chassis<00:05:14.030> you<00:05:14.360> you<00:05:15.290> can<00:05:15.500> do<00:05:15.620> so<00:05:15.860> much<00:05:16.070> just

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
same chassis you you can do so much just

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.800 
same chassis you you can do so much just
like<00:05:16.580> they<00:05:16.700> did<00:05:16.760> in<00:05:16.880> all<00:05:17.090> this<00:05:17.390> you<00:05:17.630> know<00:05:17.750> you

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
like they did in all this you know you

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.620 
like they did in all this you know you
had<00:05:17.960> a<00:05:17.990> basic<00:05:18.560> bike<00:05:18.770> you<00:05:19.040> can<00:05:19.220> you<00:05:19.940> can<00:05:20.150> tune<00:05:20.479> it

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
had a basic bike you can you can tune it

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.630 
had a basic bike you can you can tune it
a<00:05:20.720> little<00:05:20.900> bit<00:05:21.169> in<00:05:21.320> off-road<00:05:21.650> you<00:05:22.130> can<00:05:22.310> tune<00:05:22.490> it

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
a little bit in off-road you can tune it

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.130 
a little bit in off-road you can tune it
a<00:05:22.729> little<00:05:22.880> bit<00:05:23.090> in<00:05:23.240> this<00:05:23.360> direction<00:05:23.570> that

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
a little bit in this direction that

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.380 
a little bit in this direction that
direction<00:05:24.470> and<00:05:24.830> and<00:05:25.130> this<00:05:25.880> is<00:05:26.030> what<00:05:26.210> we're

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
direction and and this is what we're

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.530 
direction and and this is what we're
looking<00:05:26.660> at<00:05:26.810> and<00:05:27.880> now<00:05:28.880> we're<00:05:29.030> curious<00:05:29.270> what

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
looking at and now we're curious what

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.990 
looking at and now we're curious what
people<00:05:29.780> think<00:05:29.900> about<00:05:30.020> this<00:05:30.260> one<00:05:30.500> and<00:05:30.740> I<00:05:31.220> hope

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
people think about this one and I hope

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.630 
people think about this one and I hope
we<00:05:32.150> get<00:05:32.270> to<00:05:32.510> like<00:05:32.900> it<00:05:33.080> and<00:05:33.470> we<00:05:33.620> can<00:05:33.800> turn<00:05:34.280> around

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
we get to like it and we can turn around

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.290 
we get to like it and we can turn around
quick

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
quick

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.439 
quick
five<00:05:36.990> or<00:05:37.259> seven<00:05:37.949> years<00:05:37.979> ago<00:05:38.190> I<00:05:38.370> think<00:05:38.759> there

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
five or seven years ago I think there

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.550 
five or seven years ago I think there
was<00:05:39.629> no<00:05:39.840> are<00:05:40.020> 90<00:05:40.470> so<00:05:40.650> I<00:05:40.680> bought<00:05:41.039> an<00:05:41.280> r<00:05:41.490> 1200<00:05:41.909> see

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
was no are 90 so I bought an r 1200 see

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.149 
was no are 90 so I bought an r 1200 see
the<00:05:43.560> cars<00:05:43.889> are<00:05:44.389> and<00:05:45.389> it<00:05:45.539> looks<00:05:45.690> like<00:05:45.870> a<00:05:46.740> like<00:05:47.129> a

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
the cars are and it looks like a like a

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.800 
the cars are and it looks like a like a
military<00:05:47.490> bike<00:05:47.940> now<00:05:48.409> but<00:05:49.409> not<00:05:49.590> not<00:05:49.860> you<00:05:50.009> know<00:05:50.159> I

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
military bike now but not not you know I

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.890 
military bike now but not not you know I
underestimated<00:05:51.810> how<00:05:52.110> how<00:05:52.800> costly<00:05:53.340> it<00:05:53.460> is<00:05:53.900> so

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
underestimated how how costly it is so

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.110 
underestimated how how costly it is so
maybe<00:05:55.740> you<00:05:55.889> could<00:05:56.039> take<00:05:56.220> care<00:05:56.490> of<00:05:56.520> it<00:05:56.759> in<00:05:57.000> the

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
maybe you could take care of it in the

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.619 
maybe you could take care of it in the
future<00:05:58.370> keep<00:05:59.370> the<00:05:59.520> bike<00:05:59.669> simple<00:06:00.090> I<00:06:00.270> think

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:00.629 
future keep the bike simple I think

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:02.659 
future keep the bike simple I think
that's<00:06:00.780> it<00:06:00.990> that's<00:06:01.259> the<00:06:01.470> key<00:06:01.680> and<00:06:02.520> I<00:06:02.610> think

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
that's it that's the key and I think

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.270 
that's it that's the key and I think
that's<00:06:02.849> also<00:06:03.389> why<00:06:03.509> the<00:06:03.539> nineties<00:06:04.110> is<00:06:04.919> such<00:06:05.250> a

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
that's also why the nineties is such a

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.330 
that's also why the nineties is such a
good<00:06:05.550> bike<00:06:05.789> it's<00:06:06.090> just<00:06:06.360> a<00:06:06.479> simple<00:06:06.960> fewer<00:06:07.560> by

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
good bike it's just a simple fewer by
