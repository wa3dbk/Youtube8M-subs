00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.890
 good xatakeros let's make a 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.479
 small demonstration of one of the 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.390
 most expected characteristics of 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:11.240
 WhatsApp is neither more nor less than a 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.830
 web version of the application is 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.709
 functionality will come integrated into the 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.449
 version 211 498 right now is a 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:21.340
 beta test version and can be accessed 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.340
 to her through apk mirror 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.270
 brings with it a new section with 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.400
 we have downloaded the apk and what 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.220
 we installed on a mobile makes a mate 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.360
 7 and as you can see, here is the 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.400
 version is 4 98 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.650
 we have whatsapp web functionality 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.400
 we can access it through 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:46.550
 the options and encourages us in the form of a 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.940
 small tutorial on how to access 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.960
 service it is interesting to see that 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.640
 sends us the web to an url address that 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.580
 it's dot dot whatsapp dotcom 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.930
 then we are going to add this 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.330
 it's a small system that they have 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.030
 to synchronize let's say the service of 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.890
 whatsapp web with our mobile is not going to 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.740
 have data in a server on the internet 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.200
 but you directly from chrome to 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.729
 through the internet you will connect to 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.690
 your mobile is good then we go 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.690
 to scan the code 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.180
 and directly because they appear in our 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.910
 conversations and well let's check 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.430
 yes yes yes it really works in time 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.910
 real if not then well let's go to 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.910
 write here 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.180
 and it's written on the computer and well 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.799
 here directly in the conversation 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.610
 we can see that he is also going 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.610
 updating voucher 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.870
 directly the new message appears 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.400
 let's see what also when we 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.520
 write we will receive it both in the 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.060
 mobile like here 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.619
 You see directly the message is received 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.560
 that we have detected like this in the first 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.800
 moments of good use that really do not 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.330
 is an online service in the cloud 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.489
 not all of our messages are in 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.680
 internet stored but that is a 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.560
 point to point connection of our 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.510
 Chrome browser with our mobile 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.670
 as we know that good because it is so 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.730
 simple as right now we are 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.520
 we disconnected from the wifi and 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.620
 disconnect the data is worth then 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.410
 right now if I want to write a 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.960
 message 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.870
 he stays in pensive mode and really 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.950
 it does not work let's try to recharge the 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.660
 Web 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.170
 and he's going to tell us that the phone is not 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.170
 connected 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.859
 As you can see, the thing remains 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:55.659
 thinking is not that you can access 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.760
 from several from several browsers 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.250
 with different computers it's always worth 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.840
 from the chrome browser it's worth then 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.340
 well let's do a test that is in 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.709
 rather than through wifi let's do it 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.060
 through mobile data ok let's go to 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.310
 close our whatsapp application 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.980
 because it's important you can not pass 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.500
 in a direct way it is now that we open 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.180
 again 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.350
 and as you can see when opening whatsapp 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.210
 directly comes 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.110
 it's quite intuitive as you can see 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.630
 we can here add a photograph or 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.910
 take a photo from the computer in order 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.790
 for example a screenshot that 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.870
 we made the article from the other day 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.130
 Well, here it is given to send and as 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.020
 you see directly from the 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.210
 computer an image that is in the 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.250
 computer can be sent to whatsapp 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.840
 directly 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.940
 we have tried before to send a file 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.910
 let's try to send us a 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.050
 file an image you watch us tell the 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.430
 interface is the same as we have in 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.540
 android you can see the information of 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:58.890
 Contact that appears on the phone 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.890
 etcetera photography 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.650
 as you can see I just received a 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.299
 image 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.540
 and we have it here on the computer 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.540
 directly 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.099
 we click we see it big that 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:15.430
 we can copy the image in a tab 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.530
 new opens we can even download it 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.570
 from here once it opens 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.729
 the little arrow will appear to download 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.560
 global within here directly then 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.790

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.260

 most expected functionalities of

 whatsapp will reach the market 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.820
 shortly the version that is right now 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:36.949
 not the market since 476 and how can you 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.930
 see whatsapp since you already have several 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:46.280
 more trial versions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:48.790

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.790
 this functionality
