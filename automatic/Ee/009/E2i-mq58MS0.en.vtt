00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.870 
little bit good but honestly you'll
absolutely<00:01:37.439> love<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.220> finished<00:01:38.490> look<00:01:38.579> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
absolutely love the finished look and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.300 
absolutely love the finished look and
then<00:01:39.659> we're<00:01:39.810> going<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.990> highlight<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.710> area

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
then we're going to highlight this area

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.580 
then we're going to highlight this area
here<00:01:41.670> which<00:01:42.210> again<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.720> quite<00:01:43.020> shadowed

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
here which again can be quite shadowed

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.530 
here which again can be quite shadowed
is<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.189> deepest<00:01:44.700> areas<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> face

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
is one of the deepest areas on the face

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.740 
is one of the deepest areas on the face
so<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:46.049> really<00:01:46.259> create<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.829> shadow<00:01:47.220> and

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
so it can really create a shadow and

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.270 
so it can really create a shadow and
then<00:01:48.750> also<00:01:48.990> just<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.590> area<00:01:49.920> which<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
then also just this area which is the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.310 
then also just this area which is the
Cupid's<00:01:50.759> bow<00:01:50.970> that's<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.479> really<00:01:51.720> bring

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
Cupid's bow that's going to really bring

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.429 
Cupid's bow that's going to really bring
out<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.590> pelts<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.390> just<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.780> chin<00:01:55.020> so

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
out the pelts and just the chin so

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.899 
out the pelts and just the chin so
that's<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> highlighting<00:01:56.399> done<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.790> now

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
that's the highlighting done and now

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.399 
that's the highlighting done and now
we're<00:01:57.030> going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.180> go<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.540> contouring<00:01:58.140> and

I'm going to take a concealer that is

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.859 
I'm going to take a concealer that is
approximately<00:02:02.070> four<00:02:02.430> shades<00:02:03.000> darker<00:02:03.540> than

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
approximately four shades darker than

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.990 
approximately four shades darker than
lauren's<00:02:04.469> face<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.340> recommend<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.850> you

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
do use a creamy concealer because again

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.919 
do use a creamy concealer because again
it's<00:02:08.190> going<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.489> counteract<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.509> kind<00:02:09.840> of

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
it's going to counteract that kind of

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.990 
it's going to counteract that kind of
liquid<00:02:10.229> juhi<00:02:10.800> finish<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.370> we've<00:02:11.520> got<00:02:11.790> and

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
like a triangle really because this area

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.400 
like a triangle really because this area
here<00:03:30.880> is<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.420> highest<00:03:31.750> point<00:03:31.989> of<00:03:32.049> your<00:03:32.200> face
