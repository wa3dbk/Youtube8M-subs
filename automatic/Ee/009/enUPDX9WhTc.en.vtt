always want to make sure to use these
this<00:00:51.350> prevents<00:00:52.350> if<00:00:52.500> someone<00:00:52.769> had<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> door

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
this prevents if someone had the door

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.700 
this prevents if someone had the door
open<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:53.970> know<00:00:54.150> the<00:00:54.330> door<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.290> child

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
open and we know the door like a child

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.460 
open and we know the door like a child
or<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.129> dog<00:00:56.820> or<00:00:57.090> something<00:00:57.480> they<00:00:58.110> don't<00:00:58.290> get

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
or a dog or something they don't get

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.189 
or a dog or something they don't get
baked<00:00:58.830> in<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.040> oven<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.519> oven<00:01:00.150> could<00:01:00.900> pretty

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
baked in the oven the oven could pretty

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.619 
baked in the oven the oven could pretty
easily<00:01:01.470> tipped<00:01:01.949> forward<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.550> them<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:02.970> this

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
easily tipped forward on them so this

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.340 
easily tipped forward on them so this
bracket<00:01:04.259> gets<00:01:04.500> installed<00:01:04.979> back<00:01:05.339> here<00:01:05.759> and

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
bracket gets installed back here and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.859 
bracket gets installed back here and
that<00:01:07.350> way<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.100> oven<00:01:08.399> can't<00:01:08.670> tip<00:01:08.910> and<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.450> back

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
that way the oven can't tip and the back

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.040 
that way the oven can't tip and the back
leg<00:01:10.229> slips<00:01:10.770> right<00:01:10.920> into<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.550> spot<00:01:11.940> so<00:01:12.330> what

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
leg slips right into this spot so what

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.139 
leg slips right into this spot so what

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.920 
little too low which this actually looks
pretty<00:03:39.799> good<00:03:40.040> but<00:03:40.549> if<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.269> wanted<00:03:41.629> to<00:03:41.690> raise

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
pretty good but if you wanted to raise

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.589 
pretty good but if you wanted to raise
it<00:03:42.109> up<00:03:42.199> you<00:03:42.440> can<00:03:42.680> turn<00:03:43.069> the<00:03:43.310> feet<00:03:43.579> just<00:03:44.389> like<00:03:44.479> a

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
it up you can turn the feet just like a

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.920 
it up you can turn the feet just like a
refrigerator<00:03:45.019> you<00:03:45.979> can<00:03:46.159> pull<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.489> bottom<00:03:46.930> and

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
refrigerator you can pull the bottom and

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.170 
refrigerator you can pull the bottom and
out<00:03:48.139> and<00:03:48.379> that<00:03:48.709> gives<00:03:49.010> you<00:03:49.190> a<00:03:49.459> little<00:03:49.729> clearer

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
out and that gives you a little clearer

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.240 
out and that gives you a little clearer
view<00:03:50.629> to<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.959> feet<00:03:51.229> and<00:03:51.470> these<00:03:51.620> feet<00:03:51.949> just

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
view to the feet and these feet just

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.990 
view to the feet and these feet just
turn<00:03:52.659> so<00:03:53.859> I'm<00:03:54.859> gonna<00:03:54.979> go<00:03:55.159> ahead<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:55.400> raise<00:03:55.699> the

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
turn so I'm gonna go ahead and raise the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.640 
turn so I'm gonna go ahead and raise the
front<00:03:56.269> up<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:56.690> little<00:03:56.930> bit<00:03:57.079> so<00:03:57.409> that<00:03:57.440> this

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
front up a little bit so that this

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.979 
front up a little bit so that this
goes<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.069> back<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.549> little<00:03:59.849> bit<00:04:00.030> more<00:04:00.269> and

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
goes to the back a little bit more and

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.399 
goes to the back a little bit more and
it<00:04:01.170> also<00:04:01.319> has<00:04:01.650> a<00:04:01.680> rear<00:04:01.950> feet<00:04:02.450> but<00:04:03.450> it's<00:04:04.230> going

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
it also has a rear feet but it's going

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.280 
it also has a rear feet but it's going
to<00:04:04.560> lift<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.950> front<00:04:05.250> feet<00:04:05.489> up<00:04:05.780> just<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:07.019> little

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
to lift the front feet up just a little

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.839 
to lift the front feet up just a little
bit<00:04:07.470> just<00:04:07.860> to<00:04:08.069> make<00:04:08.099> this<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.459> little<00:04:08.930> tighter<00:04:09.930> a

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
bit just to make this a little tighter a

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:16.099 
bit just to make this a little tighter a
little<00:04:11.849> better<00:04:14.239> you<00:04:15.239> may<00:04:15.360> need<00:04:15.420> channel<00:04:15.900> locks

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
little better you may need channel locks

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.870 
little better you may need channel locks
especially<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:16.829> first<00:04:17.070> couple<00:04:17.220> turns<00:04:19.880> and

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
especially the first couple turns and

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.030 
especially the first couple turns and
once<00:04:21.090> once<00:04:21.389> it's<00:04:21.600> turned<00:04:21.930> free<00:04:22.350> then<00:04:22.620> then<00:04:22.919> it

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
once once it's turned free then then it

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.460 
once once it's turned free then then it
seems<00:04:23.250> to<00:04:23.400> rotate<00:04:23.820> a<00:04:23.910> little<00:04:24.150> easier<00:04:24.540> and<00:04:25.229> if

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
seems to rotate a little easier and if

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.080 
seems to rotate a little easier and if
you<00:04:25.560> want<00:04:25.740> to<00:04:25.800> make<00:04:25.919> it<00:04:26.070> easier<00:04:26.430> you<00:04:26.639> can<00:04:26.790> lift

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
you want to make it easier you can lift

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.800 
you want to make it easier you can lift
up<00:04:27.419> a<00:04:27.449> little<00:04:27.720> just<00:04:28.940> lift<00:04:29.940> up<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.330> little<00:04:30.540> bit

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:42.939 

just<00:04:39.740> look<00:04:40.740> a<00:04:40.770> little<00:04:41.070> bit<00:04:41.310> turn<00:04:41.850> it<00:04:42.060> like<00:04:42.210> so

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
just look a little bit turn it like so

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:47.090 
just look a little bit turn it like so
okay<00:04:44.810> and<00:04:45.810> then<00:04:45.990> we<00:04:46.110> want<00:04:46.289> it<00:04:46.380> to<00:04:46.500> be<00:04:46.620> balanced

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
okay and then we want it to be balanced

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.920 
okay and then we want it to be balanced
on<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.340> outside<00:04:48.680> it's<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.800> same<00:04:50.280> thing<00:04:50.930> and

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
on the outside it's the same thing and

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.950 
on the outside it's the same thing and
again<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.740> first<00:04:52.979> turns<00:04:53.660> usually<00:04:54.660> a<00:04:54.690> little

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
again the first turns usually a little

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.950 
again the first turns usually a little
tough<00:04:55.289> so<00:04:55.680> it's<00:04:55.710> a<00:04:55.889> good<00:04:56.039> idea<00:04:56.100> to<00:04:56.780> turn<00:04:57.780> that

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
tough so it's a good idea to turn that

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.430 
tough so it's a good idea to turn that
first<00:04:58.320> turn<00:04:59.419> channel<00:05:00.419> locks<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:00.870> then<00:05:01.260> it

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
first turn channel locks and then it

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.060 
first turn channel locks and then it
frees<00:05:02.160> up<00:05:02.419> quite<00:05:03.419> a<00:05:03.450> bit<00:05:03.720> so<00:05:04.110> here<00:05:04.470> we<00:05:04.590> go

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
frees up quite a bit so here we go

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.790 
frees up quite a bit so here we go
and<00:05:05.880> this<00:05:06.060> side<00:05:06.300> will<00:05:06.389> be<00:05:06.450> easier<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.260> lift<00:05:07.500> now

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
and this side will be easier to lift now

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.570 
and this side will be easier to lift now
that<00:05:08.010> the<00:05:08.789> other<00:05:08.910> side's<00:05:09.270> been<00:05:09.539> lifted<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:09.990> bit

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.230 

so<00:05:14.580> there<00:05:14.669> we<00:05:14.789> go

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
so there we go

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.300 
so there we go
one<00:05:15.599> nice<00:05:15.870> new<00:05:16.110> range<00:05:16.410> got<00:05:16.770> just<00:05:16.950> a<00:05:17.010> little<00:05:17.220> bit

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
one nice new range got just a little bit

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.339 
one nice new range got just a little bit
of<00:05:17.400> cleaning<00:05:17.700> up<00:05:17.789> I<00:05:18.120> got<00:05:18.570> most<00:05:18.810> of<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:19.080> tape

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
of cleaning up I got most of the tape

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:21.440 
of cleaning up I got most of the tape
material<00:05:20.010> packing<00:05:20.430> to<00:05:20.669> off<00:05:20.880> already

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
material packing to off already

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.190 
material packing to off already
I<00:05:21.599> don't<00:05:22.320> move<00:05:22.470> this<00:05:22.740> tape<00:05:23.010> make<00:05:23.910> sure<00:05:24.120> that<00:05:24.360> no

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
I don't move this tape make sure that no

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.589 
I don't move this tape make sure that no
one<00:05:25.380> wants<00:05:25.650> to<00:05:25.710> bake<00:05:26.010> with<00:05:26.220> that<00:05:26.479> you<00:05:27.479> know

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
one wants to bake with that you know

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.600 
one wants to bake with that you know
Dante<00:05:28.139> it<00:05:28.380> better<00:05:28.680> next<00:05:29.070> time<00:05:29.310> they<00:05:29.460> make

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
Dante it better next time they make

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.469 
Dante it better next time they make
cookies<00:05:29.930> they<00:05:30.930> won't<00:05:31.260> be<00:05:31.380> very<00:05:31.530> good<00:05:31.680> cookies

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
cookies they won't be very good cookies

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.790 
cookies they won't be very good cookies
so<00:05:33.479> now<00:05:33.840> we're<00:05:33.990> going<00:05:34.169> to<00:05:34.229> turn<00:05:34.349> our<00:05:34.410> breaker

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
so now we're going to turn our breaker

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.990 
so now we're going to turn our breaker
on<00:05:35.130> and<00:05:35.849> then<00:05:36.840> check<00:05:37.199> this<00:05:37.380> puppy<00:05:37.620> out

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
on and then check this puppy out

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.170 
on and then check this puppy out
breakers<00:05:39.000> reset<00:05:39.800> now<00:05:40.800> we<00:05:40.860> can<00:05:41.160> test<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.729> front

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
breakers reset now we can test the front

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.620 
breakers reset now we can test the front
