00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:46.890

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.840
 're the baton on the back will change a 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.399
 bit your balance point than 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.960
 We were already used to it so go 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.000

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:08.729
 Let's do three times out of 30 with 30 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:11.040
 seconds apart the next 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.510
 exercise and we will use the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.240

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.060
 difficult exercise then it starts well 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.790
 next to him and takes a big step 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.220
 back when it comes down, it pays a lot 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.130
 attention to maintain an angle of 90 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.900

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.850
 two times 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.590
 then use the support stick and in time 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.590
 to go down and give a little insurer there 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.390
 and 2 and only goes up 12 under this 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.740
 seguradinha down there makes all the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.500

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.530
 no more to that goes down there and 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.540
 back then the other tightens and comes back 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.030
 this exercise also works
