00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
to tell you how to get the sideways logs

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.200 
to tell you how to get the sideways logs
and<00:00:27.349> everything<00:00:27.680> like<00:00:27.830> that<00:00:27.890> but<00:00:28.130> I've<00:00:28.550> just

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
and everything like that but I've just

and everything like that but I've just
tried<00:00:29.480> to<00:00:29.690> do<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:30.020> glitch<00:00:30.619> and<00:00:31.190> the<00:00:31.430> for<00:00:31.730> some

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
tried to do the glitch and the for some

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.610 
tried to do the glitch and the for some
reason<00:00:32.180> it<00:00:32.300> just<00:00:32.330> weren't<00:00:32.720> working<00:00:32.870> i<00:00:33.379> tried

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
reason it just weren't working i tried

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.500 
reason it just weren't working i tried
to<00:00:33.739> do<00:00:33.860> north<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:34.400> south<00:00:34.489> everything<00:00:35.330> like

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
to do north and south everything like

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.330 
to do north and south everything like
that<00:00:35.540> is<00:00:35.870> i<00:00:36.199> don't<00:00:36.800> know<00:00:36.890> whether<00:00:36.980> it's<00:00:37.100> been

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
that is i don't know whether it's been

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.950 
that is i don't know whether it's been
patched<00:00:37.610> or<00:00:37.940> it<00:00:38.030> just<00:00:38.059> doesn't<00:00:38.239> want<00:00:38.629> to<00:00:38.750> work

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
patched or it just doesn't want to work

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.290 
patched or it just doesn't want to work
so<00:00:39.769> instead<00:00:40.309> i'm<00:00:40.610> going<00:00:40.699> to<00:00:40.850> show<00:00:41.000> you<00:00:41.030> how<00:00:41.150> to

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
so instead i'm going to show you how to

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.259 
so instead i'm going to show you how to
get<00:00:41.600> a<00:00:41.660> four<00:00:42.080> sided<00:00:42.320> like<00:00:42.650> a<00:00:42.680> six<00:00:43.340> sided<00:00:43.550> piston

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269 
get a four sided like a six sided piston

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.960 
get a four sided like a six sided piston
is<00:00:44.650> really<00:00:45.650> simple<00:00:45.920> and<00:00:46.159> easy<00:00:46.460> it's<00:00:46.729> probably

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
is really simple and easy it's probably

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.910 
is really simple and easy it's probably
going<00:00:47.120> to<00:00:47.180> be<00:00:47.239> literally<00:00:47.870> a<00:00:48.050> one-minute<00:00:48.620> video

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
going to be literally a one-minute video

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.070 
going to be literally a one-minute video
so<00:00:49.580> let's<00:00:49.610> get<00:00:50.000> started<00:00:50.150> shall<00:00:50.479> be<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:50.930> you<00:00:50.989> can

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
so let's get started shall be so you can

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.660 
so let's get started shall be so you can
get<00:00:51.170> any<00:00:51.350> block<00:00:51.620> but<00:00:51.920> i<00:00:51.979> prefer<00:00:52.190> to<00:00:52.250> use<00:00:52.400> know

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
get any block but i prefer to use know

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.310 
get any block but i prefer to use know
when<00:00:52.850> it<00:00:52.940> comes<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.299> doing<00:00:53.809> stuff<00:00:53.989> like<00:00:54.199> this

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
when it comes to doing stuff like this

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.899 
when it comes to doing stuff like this
so<00:00:55.309> i'll<00:00:55.370> get<00:00:55.549> snow<00:00:55.879> and<00:00:56.890> sticky<00:00:57.890> piston<00:00:58.309> and<00:00:58.489> a

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
so i'll get snow and sticky piston and a

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.840 
so i'll get snow and sticky piston and a
piston<00:00:59.449> and<00:00:59.720> a<00:01:00.530> pressure<00:01:00.890> plate<00:01:01.100> that's<00:01:01.640> all

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
piston and a pressure plate that's all

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.939 
piston and a pressure plate that's all
you<00:01:01.970> need<00:01:02.120> no<00:01:02.809> actual<00:01:03.170> redstone<00:01:03.559> dust<00:01:03.739> or

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
you need no actual redstone dust or

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
you're going to do just place three

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.820 
you're going to do just place three
blocks<00:01:08.750> three<00:01:08.990> highlights<00:01:09.320> for<00:01:09.440> one<00:01:09.500> two

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
blocks three highlights for one two

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.120 
blocks three highlights for one two
three<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:11.170> you<00:01:12.170> want<00:01:12.350> to<00:01:12.440> stand<00:01:12.680> on<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.950> top

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
three and you want to stand on the top

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.880 
three and you want to stand on the top
right<00:01:13.670> get<00:01:14.210> your<00:01:14.299> sticky<00:01:14.570> piston<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:15.710> place

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
right get your sticky piston and place

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.649 
right get your sticky piston and place
it<00:01:16.040> there<00:01:16.310> at<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:16.909> bottom<00:01:17.090> just<00:01:17.270> like<00:01:17.390> that

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659

then you want to play and get you see'em
you<00:01:20.780> normal<00:01:21.200> piston<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:21.859> place<00:01:22.039> it<00:01:22.189> on<00:01:22.280> top<00:01:22.450> no

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
you normal piston and place it on top no

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.910 
you normal piston and place it on top no
what<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:23.630> wanted<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:23.930> do<00:01:24.049> is<00:01:24.109> get<00:01:24.380> off<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.710> top

what you wanted to do is get off the top

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.349 
what you wanted to do is get off the top
of<00:01:24.950> it<00:01:25.219> and<00:01:25.399> put<00:01:25.700> your<00:01:25.789> brush<00:01:25.909> plate<00:01:26.180> on<00:01:26.270> the

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359 
of it and put your brush plate on the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:30.789 
of it and put your brush plate on the
top<00:01:26.649> and<00:01:27.649> now<00:01:28.520> you<00:01:29.000> wanna<00:01:29.149> this<00:01:29.810> is<00:01:29.990> like<00:01:30.170> some

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
pissed in your hand you want to fly just

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.330 
pissed in your hand you want to fly just
above<00:01:37.759> it<00:01:37.969> jump<00:01:38.689> down<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:39.229> put<00:01:39.679> it<00:01:39.799> on<00:01:39.920> top<00:01:39.950> as

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
above it jump down and put it on top as

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.359 
above it jump down and put it on top as
quick<00:01:40.520> as<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:40.729> can<00:01:40.759> just<00:01:41.749> like<00:01:41.869> that<00:01:42.020> and

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
quick as you can just like that and

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.039 
quick as you can just like that and
that's<00:01:43.369> how<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:43.880> just<00:01:44.570> get<00:01:44.719> that<00:01:44.840> piston

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
that's how you just get that piston

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.999 
that's how you just get that piston
early<00:01:45.619> so<00:01:45.829> I<00:01:46.630> will<00:01:47.630> attempt<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.439> do<00:01:48.619> it<00:01:48.740> again

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
early so I will attempt to do it again

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.840 
early so I will attempt to do it again
that<00:01:49.249> foresight<00:01:50.179> at<00:01:50.420> this<00:01:50.630> added<00:01:51.200> blog<00:01:51.530> glitch

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
that foresight at this added blog glitch

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.800 
that foresight at this added blog glitch
but<00:01:52.850> I<00:01:53.210> have<00:01:54.079> to<00:01:54.229> stride<00:01:54.560> it<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.060> yeah<00:01:56.060> it's

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
but I have to stride it and yeah it's

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.749 
but I have to stride it and yeah it's
just<00:01:57.170> not<00:01:57.350> worked<00:01:57.619> by<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.039> way<00:01:58.189> you<00:01:58.249> can't<00:01:58.579> get

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
just not worked by the way you can't get
