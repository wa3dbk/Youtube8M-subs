00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:17.449
 I go to all this new video where 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:19.680
 I will show this app the dj edg that 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:24.930
 in my opinion it is beautiful o 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:28.170
 downloaded for free and now we see the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:33.690
 let's analyze then well with this 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:41.250
 the more you choose the songs or you can 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:45.660
 also search via keys and with play goes 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.940
 go on you start with this one gets up yes 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.140
 lower the volume with this yes 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:01:04.979
 sync the other song and with that 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:07.710
 it increases by bpm loops are not are not 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:13.500
 integrated in this version but of 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:19.229
 sure in the complete one yes you can 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:24.259
 also find a kind of remix with the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.259
 frequencies that can be everything 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:41.220
 this this psycho download in the app 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:45.060
 store as a music category is no 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.830
 need in the full version are there 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.510
 all these effects which are quite a few 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:56.550
 but I don't want to buy them because 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:02:06.630
 this is quite a few in this one 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:11.000
 instead they can do various things 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:16.310
 indeed there are four different banks 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.080
 of a different type where it can be registered 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:27.360
 what it takes to personalize them 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:34.769
 with me you want to do I try here I do 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:39.510
 edith and you can see everyone with 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:44.640
 category we want to see recording 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:51.080
 and you can always personalize it 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:56.190
 and downloading is never even made like 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:59.519
 composition of the of this for 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.780
 dirty whizzing is done like a 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:06.840
 turntable and you can move this as well 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:11.720
 just like a turntable and that's fine 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.720
 sync too 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.980
 or the volume is raised 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:38.280
 these are the various main components 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:48.210
 the other low mids can be moved 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:51.160
 raise lower very complete from ad 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:57.450
 each effect can be customized 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.450
 as a volume and as a PC 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.370
 and this is this workbench 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:23.440
 very portable let's say because ipad in 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.440
 some others 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:34.750
 other apps can be found of the gods 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:39.180
 other tools like real ones 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:44.550
 own DJ benches or small ones 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:49.240
 glass where you can find these 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.460
 put it vertically and this is the bar 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.940
 with you to move the song 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:58.980
 on the other hand it is more practical or even like 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:06.520
 volumes that I practice most on the iPad 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:09.330
 and this would be the lap in the future 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.330
 I will do others
