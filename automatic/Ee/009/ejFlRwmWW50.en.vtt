00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
something like this it's small is you

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.020 
something like this it's small is you
bend<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.860> when<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.159> bend<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.700> create

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
bend it and when you bend it you create

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.580 
bend it and when you bend it you create
a<00:01:45.060> lot<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.329> stress<00:01:45.570> right<00:01:45.689> here<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.170> fibers

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
a lot of stress right here so the fibers

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.679 
a lot of stress right here so the fibers
and<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> tree<00:01:47.100> are<00:01:47.369> stressed<00:01:48.000> out<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.600> you

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
and the tree are stressed out so you

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.999 
and the tree are stressed out so you
take<00:01:48.869> your<00:01:49.020> knife<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.770> would<00:01:49.920> normally

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
take your knife and you would normally

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.289 
take your knife and you would normally
use<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.430> holy<00:01:50.640> nights<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.060> there's<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.990> microtek

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
use a holy nights but there's a microtek

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.030 
use a holy nights but there's a microtek
once<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.450> bend<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.869> sapling<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.560> other<00:01:55.890> words

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040
