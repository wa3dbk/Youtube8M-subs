I'll just go through what's actually

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.849 
I'll just go through what's actually
included<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> box<00:00:18.230> first<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.410> all<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:19.710> is

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
included in the box first of all this is

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.019 
included in the box first of all this is
the<00:00:19.920> item<00:00:20.220> itself<00:00:21.289> it's<00:00:22.400> quite<00:00:23.400> bulky<00:00:23.609> as<00:00:23.910> you

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
the item itself it's quite bulky as you

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.990 
the item itself it's quite bulky as you
can<00:00:24.180> see<00:00:24.859> but<00:00:25.859> that's<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.279> connector<00:00:26.849> there

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
can see but that's the connector there

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.339 
can see but that's the connector there
so<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.330> connector<00:00:29.510> hooks<00:00:30.510> up<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:31.019> here

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
so that connector hooks up to this here

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.280 
so that connector hooks up to this here
and<00:00:32.099> then<00:00:32.520> that's<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.540> part<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.780> plugs<00:00:33.989> into

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
and then that's the part that plugs into

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.000 
and then that's the part that plugs into
your<00:00:34.410> vehicle
