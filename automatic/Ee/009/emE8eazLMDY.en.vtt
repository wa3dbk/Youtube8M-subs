while<00:00:07.849> I've<00:00:08.849> been<00:00:08.910> off<00:00:09.540> camera<00:00:10.290> I've

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
while I've been off camera I've

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.270 
while I've been off camera I've
installed<00:00:11.730> their<00:00:12.150> mother<00:00:12.360> board<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:14.070> case

installed their mother board in the case
and<00:00:15.230> I<00:00:16.550> was<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.580> little<00:00:17.730> bit<00:00:17.850> concerned<00:00:18.260> whether

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
and I was a little bit concerned whether

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.779 
and I was a little bit concerned whether

or not the back plate behind the CPUs

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.349 
or not the back plate behind the CPUs

case<00:00:35.540> fortunately<00:00:36.950> two<00:00:37.950> things<00:00:38.219> I've<00:00:38.579> come

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
case fortunately two things I've come

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.490 
case fortunately two things I've come
across<00:00:39.120> two<00:00:39.510> positives<00:00:39.989> I've<00:00:40.200> come<00:00:40.410> across

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
across two positives I've come across

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.139 
across two positives I've come across
and<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:42.030> first<00:00:42.300> one<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:43.520> the<00:00:44.520> fact<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.850> this

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
and the first one is the fact that this

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.580 
and the first one is the fact that this
back<00:00:45.960> plate<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.010> large<00:00:47.280> as<00:00:47.870> you<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.289> see

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
back plate is so large as you can see

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.760 
back plate is so large as you can see
and<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.890> comes<00:00:50.100> off<00:00:50.250> two<00:00:50.850> catches<00:00:51.770> quite

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
and it comes off two catches quite

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.500 
and it comes off two catches quite
easily<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.460> made<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.789> plastic<00:00:54.120> rather<00:00:54.300> rot

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
easily it's made of plastic rather rot

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.040 
easily it's made of plastic rather rot
rather<00:00:55.050> Metra's<00:00:55.469> actually<00:00:55.800> plastic<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:57.050> you

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
rather Metra's actually plastic and you

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.439 
rather Metra's actually plastic and you
can<00:00:58.230> see<00:00:58.469> I'm<00:00:59.070> using<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.670> drill<00:00:59.910> processor

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449

can see I'm using a drill processor
motherboard<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.620> actually<00:01:01.770> see

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
motherboard and you can actually see

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.219 
motherboard and you can actually see
this<00:01:02.129> plenty<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.699> room<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:04.080> rear<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:06.229> the

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
have to attach is is this at the front

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.550 
have to attach is is this at the front
of<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.810> motherboard<00:03:46.810> this<00:03:47.079> will<00:03:47.260> allow<00:03:47.349> the

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
of the motherboard this will allow the

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.240 
of the motherboard this will allow the
water<00:03:47.979> cooling<00:03:48.459> pump<00:03:49.019> to<00:03:50.019> to<00:03:50.650> line<00:03:50.859> up<00:03:51.069> over

water cooling pump to to line up over
the<00:03:51.489> CPU<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.780> easily<00:03:53.470> so<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:54.040> I<00:03:54.430> put<00:03:54.669> this

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
the CPU and easily so and I put this

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.250 
the CPU and easily so and I put this
together<00:03:55.060> it'll<00:03:55.510> be<00:03:55.659> just<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:55.959> give<00:03:56.079> you<00:03:56.199> an

together it'll be just to give you an

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.610 
together it'll be just to give you an
idea<00:03:56.379> of<00:03:56.829> how<00:03:56.919> it<00:03:57.849> works<00:03:58.439> you've<00:03:59.439> got<00:03:59.590> a

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
idea of how it works you've got a

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.839 
idea of how it works you've got a

variety of screws and grommets all which

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.619 
variety of screws and grommets all which
you<00:04:04.810> attach<00:04:05.169> appropriately<00:04:06.129> and<00:04:06.479> for<00:04:07.479> your

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
you attach appropriately and for your

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.819 
you attach appropriately and for your
particular<00:04:07.900> cpu<00:04:08.739> and<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:10.750> that's<00:04:10.900> sorted<00:04:11.409> and

the seal to break always is on
everything<00:05:20.080> these<00:05:20.919> days<00:05:25.080> inside<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.199> box

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
everything these days inside the box

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.000 
everything these days inside the box
there<00:05:27.150> is<00:05:29.490> very<00:05:30.490> little<00:05:30.700> as<00:05:31.150> you<00:05:31.180> can<00:05:31.389> imagine

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
there is very little as you can imagine

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.529 
there is very little as you can imagine
just<00:05:33.010> a<00:05:33.099> bit<00:05:33.220> of<00:05:33.280> cardboard<00:05:33.820> protective

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
just a bit of cardboard protective

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.570 
just a bit of cardboard protective
packaging<00:05:35.520> holding<00:05:36.520> the<00:05:36.700> the<00:05:37.630> plastic<00:05:38.580> sleeve

which the processing wrapped in and also
an<00:05:47.440> installation<00:05:48.370> instructions<00:05:48.940> which<00:05:49.360> I

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
an installation instructions which I

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:57.540 
an installation instructions which I
actually<00:05:49.840> found<00:05:50.970> Viking<00:05:51.970> I<00:05:53.610> was<00:05:55.110> looking<00:05:56.550> for

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
actually found Viking I was looking for

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:04.860 
actually found Viking I was looking for
an<00:05:57.669> arrow<00:05:59.789> of<00:06:00.840> me<00:06:01.840> on<00:06:02.410> the<00:06:03.400> motherboard<00:06:03.870> I'm

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
an arrow of me on the motherboard I'm

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.939 
an arrow of me on the motherboard I'm
looking<00:06:04.990> for<00:06:05.289> an<00:06:05.349> arrow<00:06:05.940> which<00:06:06.940> would<00:06:07.330> line<00:06:07.900> up

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
looking for an arrow which would line up

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:13.560 
looking for an arrow which would line up
with<00:06:08.949> the<00:06:08.979> arrow<00:06:09.849> on<00:06:10.330> the<00:06:11.550> corner<00:06:12.550> of<00:06:12.669> this

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
with the arrow on the corner of this

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.950 
with the arrow on the corner of this
processor<00:06:14.500> so<00:06:15.310> I<00:06:15.340> got<00:06:15.699> the<00:06:15.960> orientation

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
processor so I got the orientation

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.420 
processor so I got the orientation
correct<00:06:18.090> unfortunately<00:06:20.039> there's<00:06:21.039> no<00:06:21.220> arrow

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
correct unfortunately there's no arrow

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.640 
correct unfortunately there's no arrow
at<00:06:21.639> all<00:06:21.849> on<00:06:22.060> the<00:06:22.150> motherboard<00:06:22.500> and<00:06:23.500> this

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
at all on the motherboard and this

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.950 
at all on the motherboard and this
flummox<00:06:24.130> me<00:06:24.370> because<00:06:24.789> you<00:06:25.300> can<00:06:25.449> imagine<00:06:25.660> with

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
flummox me because you can imagine with

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.230 
flummox me because you can imagine with
all<00:06:26.110> those<00:06:26.320> thousands<00:06:27.039> of<00:06:27.190> pins<00:06:27.400> you<00:06:27.760> can't

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
all those thousands of pins you can't

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.930 
all those thousands of pins you can't
afford<00:06:28.479> to<00:06:29.160> make<00:06:30.160> the<00:06:30.370> slightest<00:06:30.849> mistake

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
afford to make the slightest mistake

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
afford to make the slightest mistake
that<00:06:31.360> was<00:06:31.510> you're<00:06:31.690> going<00:06:31.810> to<00:06:31.900> bed

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
that was you're going to bed

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.270 
that was you're going to bed
but<00:06:34.960> it's<00:06:35.110> interesting<00:06:35.380> because<00:06:35.710> I<00:06:35.889> then

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
but it's interesting because I then

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.070 
but it's interesting because I then
realized<00:06:36.729> after<00:06:37.090> reading<00:06:37.419> the<00:06:37.540> instructions

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
realized after reading the instructions

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.400 
realized after reading the instructions
which<00:06:38.229> I<00:06:38.350> should<00:06:38.590> have<00:06:38.740> written<00:06:38.860> first<00:06:39.190> view

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
which I should have written first view

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.439 
which I should have written first view
but<00:06:41.410> i<00:06:41.470> think<00:06:41.650> it's<00:06:41.770> the<00:06:41.889> old<00:06:42.039> story<00:06:42.310> if<00:06:42.789> you

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:43.449 
but i think it's the old story if you

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:45.600 
but i think it's the old story if you
built<00:06:43.720> lots<00:06:44.020> and<00:06:44.229> lots<00:06:44.350> of<00:06:44.500> workstations<00:06:44.889> and

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
built lots and lots of workstations and

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.050 
built lots and lots of workstations and
home-based<00:06:46.419> pcs<00:06:46.990> and<00:06:47.710> you<00:06:48.580> feel<00:06:48.850> really

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
home-based pcs and you feel really

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.370 
home-based pcs and you feel really
between<00:06:49.389> to<00:06:49.600> be<00:06:49.690> confident<00:06:50.139> that<00:06:50.169> you<00:06:50.350> know

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
between to be confident that you know

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.659 
between to be confident that you know
what<00:06:50.650> you're<00:06:50.710> doing<00:06:50.919> events<00:06:51.130> suddenly<00:06:51.400> you

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:51.669 
what you're doing events suddenly you

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:53.340 
what you're doing events suddenly you
start<00:06:51.970> going<00:06:52.180> our<00:06:52.360> different<00:06:52.389> route<00:06:53.020> and<00:06:53.199> you

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 
start going our different route and you

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.700 
start going our different route and you
think<00:06:53.710> it's<00:06:54.330> simple<00:06:55.330> with<00:06:55.930> which<00:06:56.110> it<00:06:56.259> is<00:06:56.440> but

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
think it's simple with which it is but

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.560 
think it's simple with which it is but
it<00:06:57.280> doesn't<00:06:57.669> necessarily<00:06:57.729> need<00:06:58.060> to<00:06:58.240> say<00:06:58.389> it's

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.570 
it doesn't necessarily need to say it's

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.490 
it doesn't necessarily need to say it's
the<00:06:58.660> same<00:06:59.009> what<00:07:00.009> they've<00:07:00.639> done<00:07:01.000> with<00:07:01.500> these

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
the same what they've done with these

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.760 
the same what they've done with these
processes<00:07:03.190> is<00:07:03.370> they've<00:07:03.729> got<00:07:04.000> a<00:07:04.030> notch<00:07:04.479> a<00:07:05.050> bit

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770 
processes is they've got a notch a bit

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.520 
processes is they've got a notch a bit
like<00:07:05.949> when<00:07:06.910> you're<00:07:07.060> installing<00:07:07.530> memory

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530 
like when you're installing memory

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.710 
like when you're installing memory
they've<00:07:09.310> actually<00:07:09.550> put<00:07:09.820> a<00:07:09.850> notch<00:07:10.650> about

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 
they've actually put a notch about

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.170 
they've actually put a notch about
three-quarters<00:07:13.720> the<00:07:14.289> way<00:07:14.470> up<00:07:14.800> on<00:07:15.190> each<00:07:15.789> side

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180 
three-quarters the way up on each side

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.850 
three-quarters the way up on each side
and<00:07:18.240> basically<00:07:19.240> you<00:07:19.810> have<00:07:20.050> to<00:07:20.080> make<00:07:20.410> sure<00:07:20.440> that

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860 
and basically you have to make sure that

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.810 
and basically you have to make sure that
those<00:07:21.039> notches<00:07:21.580> which<00:07:22.030> are<00:07:22.210> cut<00:07:22.449> out<00:07:22.720> of<00:07:23.020> me

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:23.820 
those notches which are cut out of me

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.580 
those notches which are cut out of me
out<00:07:24.820> of<00:07:25.090> the<00:07:25.180> material<00:07:25.690> that<00:07:25.720> the<00:07:25.960> process<00:07:26.440> of

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.590 
out of the material that the process of

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:32.010 
out of the material that the process of
its<00:07:26.770> ways<00:07:28.229> that<00:07:29.229> lines<00:07:29.470> up<00:07:29.710> with<00:07:29.979> little<00:07:31.020> nips

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.020 
its ways that lines up with little nips

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:38.719 
its ways that lines up with little nips
which<00:07:32.440> is<00:07:32.590> sticking<00:07:32.919> out<00:07:33.070> on<00:07:33.430> the<00:07:33.599> actual<00:07:34.599> CPU

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:38.729 

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:43.170 

area<00:07:39.729> on<00:07:39.910> the<00:07:40.300> motherboard<00:07:40.570> so<00:07:42.060> that's<00:07:43.060> just

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:43.180 
area on the motherboard so that's just

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.230 
area on the motherboard so that's just
going<00:07:43.419> to<00:07:43.599> bear<00:07:43.780> in<00:07:43.930> mind<00:07:43.960> and<00:07:45.090> when<00:07:46.090> you're

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 
going to bear in mind and when you're

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.089 
going to bear in mind and when you're
lining<00:07:46.449> these<00:07:46.690> up<00:07:46.750> now<00:07:47.080> I'm<00:07:47.229> not<00:07:47.380> going<00:07:47.620> to<00:07:47.770> try

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:48.099 
lining these up now I'm not going to try

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:49.800 
lining these up now I'm not going to try
and<00:07:48.130> do<00:07:48.340> this<00:07:48.370> now<00:07:48.820> on<00:07:49.030> camera<00:07:49.479> because<00:07:49.599> I

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:49.810 
and do this now on camera because I

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.779 
and do this now on camera because I
don't<00:07:49.990> want<00:07:50.110> to<00:07:50.380> take<00:07:50.560> my<00:07:50.680> time<00:07:50.710> get<00:07:51.340> this<00:07:51.520> put

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:51.789 
don't want to take my time get this put

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:56.760 
don't want to take my time get this put
in<00:07:51.909> a<00:07:52.000> little<00:07:52.210> warning<00:07:53.729> and<00:07:54.729> it<00:07:55.770> it's

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:56.770 
in a little warning and it it's

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:57.870 
in a little warning and it it's
something<00:07:57.099> which<00:07:57.220> requires<00:07:57.580> a<00:07:57.699> certain

something which requires a certain
amount<00:07:58.000> of<00:07:58.180> precision<00:07:58.919> and<00:07:59.919> I<00:08:00.039> know<00:08:00.099> do<00:08:00.340> the

amount of precision and I know do the
same<00:08:00.729> with<00:08:00.940> this<00:08:01.090> one<00:08:01.150> now<00:08:01.590> so<00:08:02.590> the<00:08:03.400> next<00:08:03.550> time

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:03.760 
same with this one now so the next time

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.399 
same with this one now so the next time
you<00:08:03.970> see<00:08:05.820> see<00:08:06.820> them<00:08:07.000> the<00:08:07.539> Eternals<00:08:08.139> of<00:08:08.289> the

00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:08.409 
you see see them the Eternals of the

00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:10.800 
you see see them the Eternals of the
computer<00:08:08.949> will<00:08:09.280> be<00:08:09.460> two<00:08:09.789> processes<00:08:10.449> in<00:08:10.599> there

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:10.810 
computer will be two processes in there

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.710 
computer will be two processes in there
and<00:08:11.530> then<00:08:11.680> we'll<00:08:11.800> run<00:08:12.099> through<00:08:12.400> what<00:08:13.180> I'm

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:13.720 
and then we'll run through what I'm

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.930 
and then we'll run through what I'm
planning<00:08:13.930> to<00:08:14.139> do<00:08:14.289> regarding<00:08:14.800> the<00:08:15.010> water

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:15.940 
planning to do regarding the water

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.870 
planning to do regarding the water
cooling<00:08:16.360> so<00:08:17.169> I'll<00:08:18.010> get<00:08:18.190> back<00:08:18.340> to<00:08:18.400> you<00:08:18.610> again

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:18.880 
cooling so I'll get back to you again

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.210 
cooling so I'll get back to you again
shortly
