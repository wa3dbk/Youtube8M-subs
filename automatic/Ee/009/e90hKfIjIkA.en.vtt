00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
of difference the first thing people

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.290 
of difference the first thing people
notice<00:00:29.570> is<00:00:29.900> of<00:00:30.050> that<00:00:30.230> that<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:30.800> noise<00:00:31.010> floor

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
notice is of that that the noise floor

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.520 
notice is of that that the noise floor
reduces<00:00:32.300> quite<00:00:32.509> a<00:00:32.570> bit<00:00:32.750> when<00:00:32.960> they<00:00:33.019> go<00:00:33.199> from<00:00:33.350> a

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
reduces quite a bit when they go from a

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.920 
reduces quite a bit when they go from a
giant<00:00:34.010> USB<00:00:34.339> cable<00:00:34.670> to<00:00:34.699> higher<00:00:35.510> performance

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
giant USB cable to higher performance

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.180 
giant USB cable to higher performance
cable<00:00:36.260> so<00:00:36.379> you<00:00:36.409> get<00:00:36.620> a<00:00:36.650> better<00:00:36.830> sense<00:00:37.070> of

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
cable so you get a better sense of

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.759 
cable so you get a better sense of
dynamics<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:37.970> then<00:00:38.540> as<00:00:38.780> you<00:00:39.019> move<00:00:39.320> up<00:00:39.589> in

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
dynamics and then as you move up in

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.189 
dynamics and then as you move up in
anybody's<00:00:40.640> USB<00:00:41.030> cable<00:00:41.360> as<00:00:41.570> they<00:00:41.750> move<00:00:41.960> up<00:00:42.080> in

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
anybody's USB cable as they move up in

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.079 
anybody's USB cable as they move up in
craftsmanship<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:42.890> materials<00:00:43.089> you'll

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
notice more resolution better total

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.549 
notice more resolution better total
structure<00:00:46.610> better<00:00:47.299> total<00:00:47.690> balance<00:00:48.080> of<00:00:48.379> top

copper and the next to level up when you

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.100 
copper and the next to level up when you
go<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.740> cinnamon<00:01:40.190> you<00:01:40.760> get<00:01:41.000> one<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:41.900> a<00:01:41.930> quarter

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
go to cinnamon you get one and a quarter

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.020 
go to cinnamon you get one and a quarter
percent<00:01:42.590> silver<00:01:42.979> plating<00:01:43.400> over<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.880> long

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
percent silver plating over the long

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.210 
percent silver plating over the long
green<00:01:44.240> copper<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:45.020> then<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.560> next<00:01:45.590> level<00:01:46.100> up

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
green copper and then the next level up

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.880 
green copper and then the next level up
when<00:01:46.430> you<00:01:46.550> jump<00:01:46.820> up<00:01:47.030> into<00:01:47.330> carbon<00:01:48.080> you<00:01:48.710> get

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
when you jump up into carbon you get

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.880 
when you jump up into carbon you get
five<00:01:49.250> percent<00:01:50.170> silver<00:01:51.170> plating<00:01:51.530> over<00:01:51.650> the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
five percent silver plating over the

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.530 
five percent silver plating over the
copper<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.670> then<00:01:52.940> when<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:53.119> go<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.300> the<00:01:53.420> next

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
copper and then when you go to the next

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.630 
copper and then when you go to the next
level<00:01:53.930> which<00:01:54.229> is<00:01:54.259> coffee<00:01:54.920> which<00:01:55.220> I<00:01:55.340> have<00:01:55.490> right

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
level which is coffee which I have right

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.700 
level which is coffee which I have right
here<00:01:55.729> now

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
here now

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.859 
here now
we're<00:01:57.490> getting<00:01:57.670> into<00:01:57.820> ten<00:01:58.090> percent<00:01:58.510> silver

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
we're getting into ten percent silver

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.410 
we're getting into ten percent silver
plating<00:01:59.260> but<00:01:59.830> now<00:01:59.950> we're<00:02:00.159> also<00:02:00.310> adding<00:02:00.700> what's

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
plating but now we're also adding what's

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.130 
plating but now we're also adding what's
called<00:02:01.600> DPS<00:02:02.049> and<00:02:02.500> this<00:02:03.250> is<00:02:03.460> a<00:02:03.810> patented<00:02:04.810> system

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
called DPS and this is a patented system

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.040 
called DPS and this is a patented system
that<00:02:05.409> we<00:02:05.500> have<00:02:05.530> that<00:02:06.420> prevents<00:02:07.420> electrical

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
that we have that prevents electrical

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.199 
that we have that prevents electrical
interaction<00:02:08.649> or<00:02:08.890> reduces<00:02:09.610> rather<00:02:09.819> shouldn't

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
interaction or reduces rather shouldn't

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.910 
interaction or reduces rather shouldn't
say<00:02:10.300> prevents<00:02:10.810> but<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.380> reduces<00:02:11.500> the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
say prevents but it reduces the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.380 
say prevents but it reduces the
interaction<00:02:12.310> between<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.730> insulation<00:02:13.270> and

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
interaction between the insulation and

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.600 
interaction between the insulation and
the<00:02:13.450> conductor<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.440> less<00:02:14.620> energy<00:02:15.220> is<00:02:15.370> being

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
the conductor so less energy is being

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.240 
the conductor so less energy is being
absorbed<00:02:15.910> by<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.500> insulator<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.739> then

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
absorbed by the insulator and then

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.010 
absorbed by the insulator and then
released<00:02:18.610> later<00:02:18.850> on<00:02:19.090> again<00:02:19.390> back<00:02:19.600> onto<00:02:19.840> the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
released later on again back onto the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.070 
released later on again back onto the
conductor<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.180> we<00:02:22.420> go<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.600> our<00:02:22.690> pure

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
conductor so in this we go to our pure

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.470 
conductor so in this we go to our pure
100%<00:02:23.860> silver<00:02:24.220> which<00:02:24.520> is<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.790> diamond<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.360> it

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
100% silver which is the diamond and it

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.900 
100% silver which is the diamond and it
also<00:02:25.630> has<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.959> DBS<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:27.130> we<00:02:27.340> we<00:02:27.730> make

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
also has the DBS so we we make

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.090 
also has the DBS so we we make
incremental<00:02:28.270> substantive<00:02:29.010> improvements<00:02:30.010> as

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
incremental substantive improvements as

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.800 
incremental substantive improvements as
we<00:02:30.250> move<00:02:30.370> up<00:02:30.489> in<00:02:30.610> more<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:31.060> have<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.450> say<00:02:31.600> I<00:02:31.630> have

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
we move up in more I have to say I have

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.960 
we move up in more I have to say I have
your<00:02:31.930> diamond<00:02:32.320> cable<00:02:32.890> at<00:02:33.010> home<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.370> had<00:02:33.700> doubts

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
your diamond cable at home I had doubts

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.610 
your diamond cable at home I had doubts
on<00:02:34.840> whether<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.260> would<00:02:35.320> make<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.530> difference

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
on whether it would make a difference

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.650 
on whether it would make a difference
and<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.370> did<00:02:36.489> make<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.700> substantial<00:02:36.970> difference

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
and it did make a substantial difference

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.770 
and it did make a substantial difference
Laura<00:02:38.320> noise<00:02:38.560> floor<00:02:39.060> better<00:02:40.060> resolution<00:02:40.420> and

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
Laura noise floor better resolution and

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.449 
Laura noise floor better resolution and

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
the highest better resolution overall I

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.860 
the highest better resolution overall I
was<00:02:42.610> quite<00:02:42.670> surprised<00:02:43.090> it's<00:02:43.450> amazing

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
was quite surprised it's amazing

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.390 
was quite surprised it's amazing
everything<00:02:44.410> makes<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.800> difference<00:02:45.130> everything

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
everything makes a difference everything

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.949 
everything makes a difference everything
that<00:02:45.550> made<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.700> difference<00:02:45.760> 20<00:02:46.300> years<00:02:46.450> ago<00:02:46.690> it

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
that made a difference 20 years ago it

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.900 
that made a difference 20 years ago it
makes<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:47.830> difference<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.790> know<00:02:48.880> I

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
makes a difference that I you know I

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.250 
makes a difference that I you know I
first<00:02:49.120> started<00:02:49.360> in<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.630> industry<00:02:49.660> everybody

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
first started in the industry everybody

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.979 
first started in the industry everybody
would<00:02:50.440> say<00:02:50.620> there's<00:02:51.160> no<00:02:51.250> difference<00:02:51.580> between

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
would say there's no difference between

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.540 
would say there's no difference between
spdif<00:02:52.989> cables<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.590> then<00:02:53.739> after<00:02:54.459> a<00:02:54.489> while

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
spdif cables and then after a while

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.220 
spdif cables and then after a while
everybody<00:02:54.970> accepted<00:02:55.330> that<00:02:55.510> they<00:02:55.900> do<00:02:55.959> make<00:02:56.200> a

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
everybody accepted that they do make a

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.360 
everybody accepted that they do make a
difference<00:02:56.319> and<00:02:56.769> we're<00:02:56.950> starting<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.310> see

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
difference and we're starting to see

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.660 
difference and we're starting to see
that<00:02:57.550> transition<00:02:58.209> out<00:02:58.330> with

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
that transition out with

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.410 
that transition out with
things<00:02:59.120> like<00:02:59.300> USB<00:02:59.810> firewire<00:03:00.790> Ethernet<00:03:01.790> all<00:03:02.300> of

our computer and our hard drive all
these<00:03:06.560> things<00:03:06.770> are<00:03:06.830> making<00:03:07.069> a<00:03:07.160> difference

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
these things are making a difference

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.360 
these things are making a difference
so<00:03:08.020> for<00:03:08.620> those<00:03:08.709> people<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.040> are<00:03:09.190> really

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
so for those people that are really

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.979 
so for those people that are really
serious<00:03:09.550> about<00:03:09.670> computer<00:03:10.120> audio<00:03:10.270> there's

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
serious about computer audio there's

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.830 
serious about computer audio there's
their<00:03:11.530> never-ending<00:03:12.660> improvements<00:03:13.660> they<00:03:13.720> can

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
their never-ending improvements they can

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.089 
their never-ending improvements they can
make<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.020> the<00:03:14.110> system<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.590> part<00:03:14.890> of<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.040> is
