00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:15.760
 the main engine parts are the cylinder 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.590
 for clarity, we will cut it from above 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.030
 cylinder head will be installed 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.980
 cylinder it is already cut and have 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.210
 hole into which is inserted 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.550
 The spark plug also has channels for 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.059
 the intake of combustible mixture into the cylinders 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.020
 engine and burnt release 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.810
 exhaust gas 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.040
 these channels will close 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.040
 respectively, in the start me valve 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.950
 and exhaust valve 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:02.000
 the next very important detail is 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:04.680
 piston piston rings connecting rod 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.520
 which has a top head not 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.520
 split and lower split head 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.680
 the connecting rod is connected to the piston by 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.680
 piston pin 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.760
 crankshaft engine which has 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.700
 two bearing necks are also called 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.990
 indigenous to these necks 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.990
 crankshaft rotates 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.380
 and crank neck which will be 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.380
 connecting rod 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.660
 let the bottom cover of the connecting rod and with 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:58.400
 using bolts and nuts 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:02.350
 reliably fasten this connection all these 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.350
 we reduce parts in one unit 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.840
 extreme upper piston position 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:16.570
 called the top dead. 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.900
 extreme lower piston position 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.570
 called the bottom dead. 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.590
 distance between dead spots 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.720
 called piston stroke 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.810
 volume above the piston when it is in 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.150
 top dead center is called volume 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.880
 combustion chambers are the most important volume 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.930
 located between dead spots 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.620
 called the working volume the working volume 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.320
 cylinder 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.460
 very important indicator from which 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.380
 power will depend on the motor such 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.730
 way the larger working volume 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.880
 cylinder the more engine power 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.950
 we reviewed the overall device 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.450
 single cylinder engine 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.660
 However, in reality, the machines put 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.720
 multi cylinder engines two to 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.610
 eight cylinders 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.120
 working principle of such an engine we will 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.590
 consider on the next video lesson 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.120
 which is called the principle of operation 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:28.220
 engine and now again think about 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:32.019
 engine displacement and so the amount 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:37.280
 working volume of all engine cylinders 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:38.709
 called displacement or displacement 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.600
 engine 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.769
 engine capacity is measured in 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.380
 liters and for example cars 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.709
 depending on the size of the worker 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:55.900
 engine capacity 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.900
 may be very small class 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:06.130
 small middle class and 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.270
 cars with very powerful engines 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.270
 belong to a large class
