00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:13.070
 the nikon of 7,200 is a camera designed 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.869
 for demanding users it has 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.670
 technologies that allow you to achieve a 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.260
 high level of quality and performance 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.060
 let's look closely at some of those 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.010
 Features is the camera with the sensor 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.780
 from size to psc with the best performance 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.300
 of the market with an impressive 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.099
 score of 87 and 2a x are 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.500
 this sensor allows you to shoot in two 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.660
 formats the proper one of x and with a format 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.329
 13 x clipping that gives us a 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.370
 multiplication of 2 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.530
 the range of sensitivities begins in 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.039
 100 and only reaches up to 25 1600 iso 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.870
 being able to force up to 102 1400 all this 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.420
 keeping noise levels very 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.579
 low and with a high sharpness since not 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.500
 has the filter step under the screen 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.229
 of 3.2 inches has a 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.140
 resolution of one million 229 thousand points 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:59.229
 the monitor is anti-reflective and has 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.640
 of a white channel that I added to the rgb 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.439
 improves brightness and contrast so 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.830
 that we can work easily under 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.810
 any condition the 7,200 account 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.819
 with 51 focus points 15 of them in 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.250
 cross and can focus on conditions of 

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:15.409
 minus 13 v that is practically in the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.479
 darkness the continuous shot achieve 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.060
 bursts of up to 100 images in jpg 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.159
 or 27 in rock to six frames per 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.950
 second to seven if we shoot with the 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.110
 clipping mode in the video section 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.090
 the one of 7200 gets the height of its 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.789
 full-format sisters with 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.530
 Full hd recording of up to 50 or 60 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.650
 frames per second and with a menu 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.480
 dedicated for him 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.980
 It has advanced functions such as 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.230
 smooth automatic in manual mode very 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.450
 practical or with the zebra pattern that we 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.220
 help to expose correctly 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.370
 As usual it has an exit 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.440
 clean hdmi to connect the camera to 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.260
 external video recorders in addition 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.930
 allows simultaneous recording by hdmi 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.610
 and on the sd card 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.800
 wi-fi connectivity is being 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.740
 becoming commonplace of 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.180
 7.200 incorporates a wifi connection in addition 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.890
 from an nfc 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.360
 If our smartphone or 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.280
 our to the cable has this 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.899
 feature sharing the images is 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.030
 as simple as touching the phone with 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.770
 the camera
