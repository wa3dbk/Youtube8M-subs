if you're interested in finding any of
those<00:01:57.550> recipes<00:01:58.000> they'll<00:01:58.780> be<00:01:58.900> on<00:01:59.020> that<00:01:59.410> channel

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
those recipes they'll be on that channel

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.560 
those recipes they'll be on that channel
so<00:02:00.010> just<00:02:00.190> go<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.400> this<00:02:00.670> search<00:02:00.910> box<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:01.510> type

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
so just go to this search box and type

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.350 
so just go to this search box and type
in<00:02:01.990> low<00:02:02.170> carb<00:02:02.440> 360<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.310> my<00:02:03.729> other<00:02:03.910> channel

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
in low carb 360 and my other channel

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.710 
in low carb 360 and my other channel
will<00:02:04.509> come<00:02:04.690> up<00:02:04.899> okay<00:02:05.890> so<00:02:06.250> um<00:02:06.610> I<00:02:07.000> guess<00:02:07.420> that

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
will come up okay so um I guess that

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.660 
will come up okay so um I guess that
induction<00:02:08.140> wasn't<00:02:08.709> really<00:02:08.979> hard<00:02:09.220> for<00:02:09.369> me<00:02:09.429> I

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
induction wasn't really hard for me I

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.720 
induction wasn't really hard for me I
still<00:02:09.940> have<00:02:10.060> one<00:02:10.090> week<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.420> go<00:02:10.690> but<00:02:11.160> by<00:02:12.160> now<00:02:12.370> if

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
still have one week to go but by now if
