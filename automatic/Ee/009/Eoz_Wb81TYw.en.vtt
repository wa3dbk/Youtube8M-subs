some<00:01:04.170> sort<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.379> body<00:01:04.559> change<00:01:04.860> kind<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.280> like

all of his other forms you know

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.630 
all of his other forms you know
something<00:01:07.380> that's<00:01:07.590> really<00:01:07.830> like<00:01:08.130> maybe

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
something that's really like maybe

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.010 
something that's really like maybe
something<00:01:09.000> that's<00:01:09.119> really<00:01:09.270> awesome<00:01:09.479> looking

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.170 
and obviously I'd like super saiyan god
i<00:01:13.110> think<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> simple<00:01:14.400> approach<00:01:14.700> was

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
i think that the simple approach was

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.330 
i think that the simple approach was
good<00:01:15.479> for<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.170> form<00:01:16.470> only<00:01:16.650> because<00:01:17.040> every

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
good for that form only because every

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.710 
good for that form only because every
other<00:01:17.430> form<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.820> super<00:01:18.090> saiyan<00:01:18.240> before<00:01:18.570> that

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
other form of super saiyan before that

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.210 
other form of super saiyan before that
was<00:01:18.869> someone<00:01:19.140> over<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> top<00:01:19.680> or<00:01:19.860> at<00:01:19.950> least<00:01:20.070> it

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
was someone over the top or at least it

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.070 
was someone over the top or at least it
seemed<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.549> be<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:21.060> lightning<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.840> all<00:01:21.930> that

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
seemed to be like lightning and all that

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.230 
seemed to be like lightning and all that
stuff<00:01:22.170> only<00:01:22.680> one<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.950> really<00:01:23.100> wasn't<00:01:23.400> like

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
stuff only one that really wasn't like

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.670 
stuff only one that really wasn't like
that<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> first<00:01:24.990> worm<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.530> was<00:01:25.650> just

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
that was the first worm and I was just

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.890 
that was the first worm and I was just
like<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.610> first<00:01:26.640> form<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.150> was<00:01:27.270> plain<00:01:27.509> but

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
like the first form so it was plain but

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.420 
like the first form so it was plain but
like<00:01:28.080> for<00:01:28.380> them<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:28.890> lightning<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
like for them you have lightning and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.679 
like for them you have lightning and
then<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.579> have<00:01:29.670> long<00:01:29.850> hair<00:01:29.880> off<00:01:30.180> stuff<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
then you have long hair off stuff and

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.690 
then you have long hair off stuff and
you<00:01:30.960> know<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.920> made<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.310> somewhat

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.580 
you know that that made it somewhat
better<00:01:33.119> because<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.689> made<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.020> think<00:01:34.200> okay
