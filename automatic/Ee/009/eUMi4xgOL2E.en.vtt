atlas<00:01:44.159> whoever<00:01:45.159> they<00:01:45.310> are<00:01:45.460> but<00:01:45.609> whatever<00:01:46.090> this

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
atlas whoever they are but whatever this

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.169 
atlas whoever they are but whatever this
stuff<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:46.719> has<00:01:47.079> been<00:01:47.259> here<00:01:47.439> a<00:01:47.469> long<00:01:47.649> time<00:01:48.179> it's

it's not hard to do this one hand but um

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.660 
it's not hard to do this one hand but um
let's<00:02:33.290> try<00:02:33.410> actually<00:02:33.890> there's<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.250> lot<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.460> like

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
let's try actually there's a lot of like

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.210 
let's try actually there's a lot of like
said<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.970> sludge<00:02:35.240> tanks<00:02:35.600> around<00:02:35.780> here<00:02:36.050> but

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
said the sludge tanks around here but

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.930 
said the sludge tanks around here but
kind<00:02:37.220> of<00:02:37.310> in<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.820> area<00:02:38.570> where<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:39.700> whole<00:02:40.700> bunch<00:02:40.850> of

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
kind of in a area where a whole bunch of

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.540 
kind of in a area where a whole bunch of
hydro<00:02:41.330> lions<00:02:41.720> are<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.950> where<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.100> live<00:02:43.280> is<00:02:43.400> real

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
hydro lions are and where I live is real

hydro lions are and where I live is real
real<00:02:43.760> swampy<00:02:44.300> so<00:02:44.900> um<00:02:45.160> I'd<00:02:46.160> assume<00:02:46.430> this<00:02:46.580> is<00:02:46.640> all

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030
