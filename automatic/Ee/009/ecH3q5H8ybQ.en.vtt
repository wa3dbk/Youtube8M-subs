you'd want to hear one of the 50 that
sounds<00:01:58.840> like<00:01:58.959> New<00:01:59.140> Mexico<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.619> me<00:01:59.849> that's<00:02:00.849> your

sounds like New Mexico to me that's your

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.869 
sounds like New Mexico to me that's your
oven<00:02:01.270> temperature<00:02:02.069> you<00:02:03.069> want<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.369> be<00:02:03.520> sure

oven temperature you want to be sure

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:06.389 
oven temperature you want to be sure
that<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.479> screen<00:02:04.869> is<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.259> food-grade<00:02:05.950> safe

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
that the screen is a food-grade safe

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.300 
that the screen is a food-grade safe
plastic<00:02:07.030> or<00:02:07.390> stainless<00:02:08.259> steel<00:02:08.530> you<00:02:09.129> don't

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
plastic or stainless steel you don't

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.499 
plastic or stainless steel you don't
want<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.489> use<00:02:09.579> a<00:02:09.609> window<00:02:09.940> screen<00:02:10.000> because

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
want to use a window screen because

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.270 
want to use a window screen because
sometimes<00:02:10.959> those<00:02:11.140> are<00:02:11.290> galvanized<00:02:11.739> metal<00:02:11.980> and

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
sometimes those are galvanized metal and

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.069 
sometimes those are galvanized metal and
you<00:02:12.609> have<00:02:12.790> an<00:02:12.910> interaction<00:02:13.329> with<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.690> acids

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
you have an interaction with the acids

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:15.420 
you have an interaction with the acids
in<00:02:14.140> food<00:02:14.379> that<00:02:14.590> could<00:02:14.709> cause<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.099> type<00:02:15.280> of

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
in food that could cause the type of

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.460 
in food that could cause the type of
food<00:02:15.579> poisoning<00:02:15.790> what<00:02:16.599> you<00:02:16.720> would<00:02:16.870> do<00:02:17.049> is<00:02:17.260> put

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
food poisoning what you would do is put

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.979 
food poisoning what you would do is put
the<00:02:17.620> food<00:02:17.950> on<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.549> plastic<00:02:18.970> screening<00:02:19.390> set<00:02:19.870> it

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
the food on the plastic screening set it

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.630 
the food on the plastic screening set it
outdoors<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.650> want<00:02:20.799> it<00:02:20.890> in<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.069> hottest<00:02:21.280> Sun

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
outdoors you want it in the hottest Sun

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.640 
outdoors you want it in the hottest Sun
so<00:02:21.910> in<00:02:22.120> New<00:02:22.389> Mexico<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:22.900> would<00:02:22.989> be<00:02:23.079> out<00:02:23.260> by<00:02:23.470> 9:00

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
so in New Mexico it would be out by 9:00

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.400 
so in New Mexico it would be out by 9:00
and<00:02:23.950> then<00:02:24.370> in<00:02:24.609> by<00:02:24.849> 6:00<00:02:25.209> you<00:02:25.720> would<00:02:25.870> cover<00:02:26.139> it

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
and then in by 6:00 you would cover it

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.800 
and then in by 6:00 you would cover it
with<00:02:26.889> cheese<00:02:27.280> cloth<00:02:27.519> to<00:02:27.849> prevent<00:02:28.090> insects

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
with cheese cloth to prevent insects

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.020 
with cheese cloth to prevent insects
from<00:02:28.930> landing<00:02:29.650> on<00:02:29.829> it<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.160> then<00:02:30.489> after<00:02:30.910> the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
from landing on it and then after the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.420 
from landing on it and then after the
food<00:02:31.239> is<00:02:31.389> dry<00:02:31.660> then<00:02:32.349> you<00:02:32.500> want<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:32.889> freeze<00:02:33.190> it

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
food is dry then you want to freeze it

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.110 
food is dry then you want to freeze it
for<00:02:33.940> at<00:02:34.239> least<00:02:34.919> 72<00:02:35.919> hours<00:02:36.099> for<00:02:36.549> three<00:02:36.730> days<00:02:36.910> and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
for at least 72 hours for three days and

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.879 
for at least 72 hours for three days and
that<00:02:37.540> will<00:02:37.690> kill<00:02:37.840> all<00:02:38.019> the<00:02:38.139> insect<00:02:38.500> eggs<00:02:38.680> so

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
that will kill all the insect eggs so

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.589 
that will kill all the insect eggs so
they<00:02:38.919> don't<00:02:39.160> hit<00:02:39.280> challenge<00:02:39.669> you<00:02:40.209> can<00:02:40.359> I<00:02:40.389> see

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
they don't hit challenge you can I see

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.080 
they don't hit challenge you can I see
you've<00:02:40.780> got<00:02:40.810> apples<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:42.430> said<00:02:42.700> you<00:02:42.849> have<00:02:42.970> to

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
you've got apples you said you have to

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.159 
you've got apples you said you have to
use<00:02:43.120> something<00:02:43.389> to<00:02:43.540> keep<00:02:43.660> them<00:02:43.810> from<00:02:43.900> turning

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:44.169 
use something to keep them from turning

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.009 
use something to keep them from turning
brown<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.560> know<00:02:44.680> if<00:02:44.799> I<00:02:44.889> slice<00:02:45.130> an<00:02:45.310> apple<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:46.019> am

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
brown I know if I slice an apple and am

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.629 
brown I know if I slice an apple and am
slow<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.410> eat<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.919> begins<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.250> turn<00:02:48.400> brown

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
slow to eat it begins to turn brown

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.339 
slow to eat it begins to turn brown
pretty<00:02:48.940> quickly<00:02:49.150> right<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.870> that<00:02:49.989> happens

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
pretty quickly right and that happens

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.159 
pretty quickly right and that happens
when<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.620> oxidizes<00:02:51.419> apples<00:02:52.419> peaches<00:02:52.660> apricots

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169 
when it oxidizes apples peaches apricots

when it oxidizes apples peaches apricots
so<00:02:53.709> what<00:02:53.889> we're<00:02:54.010> going<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.160> do<00:02:54.400> is<00:02:54.609> make<00:02:55.480> a

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
so what we're going to do is make a

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.680 
so what we're going to do is make a
solution<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.500> cover<00:02:56.829> the<00:02:57.340> fruit<00:02:58.150> so<00:02:58.540> that

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
solution to cover the fruit so that

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.099 
solution to cover the fruit so that
doesn't<00:02:58.870> turn<00:02:59.410> dark<00:02:59.739> try<00:03:00.099> that<00:03:00.310> Apple<00:03:04.109> that's

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
doesn't turn dark try that Apple that's

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.500 
doesn't turn dark try that Apple that's
good

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
good

I've<00:03:34.129> taken<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:35.000> I<00:03:35.030> think<00:03:35.329> these<00:03:35.420> are<00:03:35.540> Alberta

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
I've taken the I think these are Alberta

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.920 
I've taken the I think these are Alberta
peaches<00:03:36.230> yeah<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.610> what<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.060> have<00:03:38.329> done<00:03:38.510> is

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
peaches yeah and what I have done is

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.289 
peaches yeah and what I have done is
slice<00:03:39.379> them<00:03:39.680> I<00:03:39.890> or<00:03:40.459> rather<00:03:40.610> peeled<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.120> filled

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
slice them I or rather peeled it filled

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.229 
slice them I or rather peeled it filled
in<00:03:41.420> first<00:03:41.629> I<00:03:41.780> put<00:03:41.959> them<00:03:42.109> into<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.409> solution<00:03:43.239> I'll

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
in first I put them into a solution I'll

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.960 
in first I put them into a solution I'll
get<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.480> towel<00:03:44.989> back<00:03:45.200> here<00:03:45.519> you<00:03:46.519> have<00:03:46.700> to<00:03:46.790> put

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
get the towel back here you have to put

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.429 
get the towel back here you have to put
them<00:03:47.090> into<00:03:47.209> a<00:03:47.329> solution<00:03:47.599> that<00:03:47.959> prevents<00:03:48.290> them

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
them into a solution that prevents them

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.349 
them into a solution that prevents them
turning<00:03:48.799> dark<00:03:49.069> one<00:03:49.670> of<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:49.879> products<00:03:50.269> you

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
turning dark one of the products you

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.440 
turning dark one of the products you
could<00:03:50.480> use<00:03:50.659> this<00:03:50.840> like<00:03:51.049> fruit<00:03:51.319> fresh<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:52.450> less

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
water put them in a plastic bag I was

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.500 
water put them in a plastic bag I was
wondering<00:04:09.889> about<00:04:09.920> that<00:04:10.099> and<00:04:10.909> then<00:04:11.180> just<00:04:11.359> take

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
wondering about that and then just take

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.080 
wondering about that and then just take
your<00:04:11.659> rolling<00:04:11.840> pin<00:04:14.319> smash<00:04:15.319> them<00:04:15.590> up<00:04:15.849> so<00:04:16.849> you've

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
your rolling pin smash them up so you've

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.240 
your rolling pin smash them up so you've
got<00:04:17.239> a<00:04:17.269> powder<00:04:19.930> I<00:04:20.930> thought<00:04:21.560> about<00:04:21.680> asking<00:04:21.889> you

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
got a powder I thought about asking you

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.550 
got a powder I thought about asking you
I<00:04:22.280> knew<00:04:22.639> you<00:04:22.759> would<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:23.960> then<00:04:24.139> we're<00:04:24.289> going<00:04:24.410> to

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
I knew you would and then we're going to

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.749 
I knew you would and then we're going to
be<00:04:24.620> I've<00:04:24.770> already<00:04:25.099> dissolved<00:04:25.550> in<00:04:25.669> the<00:04:25.729> water

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 
be I've already dissolved in the water

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.010 
be I've already dissolved in the water
and<00:04:26.030> you<00:04:26.120> can<00:04:26.270> see<00:04:26.300> these<00:04:26.509> pictures<00:04:26.660> have<00:04:26.960> been

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
and you can see these pictures have been

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.689 
and you can see these pictures have been
in<00:04:27.229> here<00:04:27.349> about<00:04:27.530> 30<00:04:27.740> minutes<00:04:28.099> and<00:04:28.340> they<00:04:28.550> have

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
in here about 30 minutes and they have

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.610 
in here about 30 minutes and they have
it<00:04:28.849> turned<00:04:29.060> dark<00:04:29.270> at<00:04:29.479> all<00:04:29.599> with<00:04:30.289> the<00:04:30.410> peaches

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
it turned dark at all with the peaches

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.279 
it turned dark at all with the peaches
what<00:04:31.400> we're<00:04:31.550> going<00:04:31.729> to<00:04:31.789> do<00:04:32.050> we're<00:04:33.050> going<00:04:33.080> to

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
what we're going to do we're going to

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.570 
what we're going to do we're going to
cut<00:04:33.560> it<00:04:33.680> in<00:04:33.800> half<00:04:34.210> twist<00:04:36.070> so<00:04:37.070> that<00:04:37.099> we<00:04:37.280> can<00:04:37.430> take

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
cut it in half twist so that we can take

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.300 
cut it in half twist so that we can take
out<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:37.880> seed<00:04:38.120> I<00:04:41.199> did<00:04:42.199> plums<00:04:42.500> two<00:04:42.830> weekends

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
out the seed I did plums two weekends

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.529 
out the seed I did plums two weekends
ago<00:04:43.430> and<00:04:43.669> this<00:04:43.729> is<00:04:43.789> how<00:04:43.909> I<00:04:44.060> did<00:04:44.270> all<00:04:44.389> those

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
ago and this is how I did all those

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.899 
ago and this is how I did all those
plums<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:47.570> then<00:04:47.840> we're<00:04:47.960> going<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.169> cut<00:04:48.409> them

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
plums and then we're going to cut them

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:52.120 
plums and then we're going to cut them
in<00:04:49.909> very<00:04:50.210> thin<00:04:50.300> slices<00:04:51.050> about<00:04:51.289> how<00:04:51.740> thick<00:04:51.949> is

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
in very thin slices about how thick is

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.490 
in very thin slices about how thick is
that<00:04:52.190> 1/4<00:04:53.180> inch<00:04:53.360> thick<00:04:53.449> and<00:04:54.139> that<00:04:54.289> will<00:04:54.380> give

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
that 1/4 inch thick and that will give

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.409 
that 1/4 inch thick and that will give
you<00:04:54.590> a<00:04:54.650> nice<00:04:54.800> slice<00:04:55.099> when<00:04:55.610> you're<00:04:55.729> dehydrating

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
you a nice slice when you're dehydrating

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.110 
you a nice slice when you're dehydrating
a<00:04:56.510> real<00:04:56.690> trick<00:04:57.020> is<00:04:57.229> that<00:04:57.530> all<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:58.190> size<00:04:58.370> slices

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
a real trick is that all the size slices

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.790 
a real trick is that all the size slices
of<00:04:59.389> anything<00:04:59.840> need<00:05:00.050> to<00:05:00.199> be<00:05:00.289> about<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:00.650> same

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
of anything need to be about the same

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.040 
of anything need to be about the same
size<00:05:01.099> so<00:05:01.460> they<00:05:02.000> all<00:05:02.120> dry<00:05:02.419> at<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.659> same<00:05:02.870> time

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
size so they all dry at the same time

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.290 
size so they all dry at the same time
and<00:05:03.199> you're<00:05:03.289> not<00:05:03.320> having<00:05:03.710> to<00:05:03.800> go<00:05:03.919> to<00:05:04.150> take<00:05:05.150> them

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
and you're not having to go to take them

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.010 
and you're not having to go to take them
off<00:05:05.449> the<00:05:05.659> screen<00:05:05.990> is<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:07.070> thinner<00:05:07.280> ones

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
off the screen is the thinner ones

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.260 
off the screen is the thinner ones
dehydrate<00:05:09.020> first<00:05:09.580> you<00:05:10.580> put<00:05:10.729> them<00:05:10.849> back<00:05:11.000> into

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
dehydrate first you put them back into

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.589 
dehydrate first you put them back into
them<00:05:11.860> we<00:05:12.860> want<00:05:13.039> to<00:05:13.130> eat<00:05:13.550> what<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.180> ascorbic

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
them we want to eat what the ascorbic

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.960 
them we want to eat what the ascorbic
acid<00:05:14.630> is<00:05:15.080> doing<00:05:15.380> is<00:05:15.500> just<00:05:15.710> coating<00:05:16.400> it<00:05:16.550> so<00:05:16.789> that

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
acid is doing is just coating it so that

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.640 
acid is doing is just coating it so that
it's<00:05:17.120> an<00:05:17.330> antioxidant<00:05:17.780> and<00:05:18.289> it's<00:05:18.409> not<00:05:18.530> going

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
it's an antioxidant and it's not going

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.649 
it's an antioxidant and it's not going
to<00:05:18.740> turn<00:05:18.889> brown<00:05:19.130> there's<00:05:20.060> no<00:05:20.180> problem<00:05:20.510> with

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
to turn brown there's no problem with

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.149 
to turn brown there's no problem with
the<00:05:20.780> Browning<00:05:21.169> and<00:05:21.229> food<00:05:21.409> safety<00:05:21.650> but<00:05:22.039> it's

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
the Browning and food safety but it's

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:23.980 
the Browning and food safety but it's
not<00:05:22.280> very<00:05:22.400> appetizing<00:05:22.840> certainly<00:05:23.840> not

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
not very appetizing certainly not

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.680 
not very appetizing certainly not
doesn't<00:05:24.440> look<00:05:24.590> very<00:05:24.620> good<00:05:24.860> okay<00:05:25.789> Curtis<00:05:26.120> let's

in that antioxidant now we've got a much
longer<00:05:45.060> process<00:05:45.210> of<00:05:45.840> drying<00:05:46.310> the<00:05:47.310> easy<00:05:47.520> one

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
you've got the apricots here the apples

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.400 
you've got the apricots here the apples
are<00:06:22.860> coming<00:06:23.160> in<00:06:23.280> shortly

are coming in shortly

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.840 
are coming in shortly
you've<00:06:25.410> got<00:06:25.560> cantaloupe<00:06:26.010> do<00:06:26.400> other<00:06:26.610> melons

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
you've got cantaloupe do other melons

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.100 
you've got cantaloupe do other melons
dehydrate<00:06:27.600> as<00:06:27.690> well

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
dehydrate as well

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.010 
dehydrate as well
I<00:06:28.169> tried<00:06:28.680> drying<00:06:29.039> watermelon<00:06:29.910> and<00:06:30.360> watermelon

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
I tried drying watermelon and watermelon

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.969 
I tried drying watermelon and watermelon
has<00:06:31.169> so<00:06:31.440> much<00:06:31.560> water<00:06:31.770> and<00:06:32.160> it<00:06:33.050> shrinks<00:06:34.050> up<00:06:34.380> to<00:06:34.949> a

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
has so much water and it shrinks up to a

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.580 
has so much water and it shrinks up to a
very<00:06:35.220> small<00:06:35.639> piece<00:06:36.000> and<00:06:36.300> it's<00:06:36.660> almost<00:06:36.990> sugar<00:06:37.289> I

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
very small piece and it's almost sugar I

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.250 
very small piece and it's almost sugar I
like<00:06:38.400> that<00:06:38.639> you<00:06:39.120> would<00:06:39.690> like<00:06:39.840> the<00:06:39.960> watermelon

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
like that you would like the watermelon

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.860 
like that you would like the watermelon
then<00:06:40.680> I've<00:06:41.340> done<00:06:41.400> honeydew<00:06:42.060> and<00:06:42.090> honeydew<00:06:42.510> has

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
then I've done honeydew and honeydew has

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.170 
then I've done honeydew and honeydew has
about<00:06:43.169> the<00:06:43.349> same<00:06:43.550> consistency<00:06:44.550> as<00:06:44.700> the

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
about the same consistency as the

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.890 
about the same consistency as the
cantaloupe

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
cantaloupe

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.659 
cantaloupe
so<00:06:46.080> the<00:06:46.229> honeydew<00:06:46.530> and<00:06:46.919> the<00:06:46.979> cantaloupe<00:06:47.430> are

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.669 
so the honeydew and the cantaloupe are

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:49.100 
so the honeydew and the cantaloupe are
probably<00:06:48.060> the<00:06:48.180> better<00:06:48.330> melons<00:06:48.750> for

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
probably the better melons for

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.990 
probably the better melons for
dehydration<00:06:49.800> but<00:06:50.460> what<00:06:50.550> do<00:06:50.639> you<00:06:50.700> do<00:06:50.849> with

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
dehydration but what do you do with

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000 
dehydration but what do you do with
these<00:06:51.270> things<00:06:51.330> once<00:06:51.930> you<00:06:52.139> finish<00:06:52.440> dehydrating

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 
these things once you finish dehydrating

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.170 
these things once you finish dehydrating
them<00:06:53.099> put<00:06:53.849> them<00:06:53.970> into<00:06:54.120> freezer<00:06:54.510> baggies<00:06:56.180> how

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
them put them into freezer baggies how

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.270 
them put them into freezer baggies how
do<00:06:57.240> you<00:06:57.330> have<00:06:57.479> to<00:06:57.570> freeze<00:06:57.780> him<00:06:57.990> after<00:06:58.229> this<00:06:58.380> you

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 
do you have to freeze him after this you

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.800 
do you have to freeze him after this you
said<00:06:59.460> depending<00:06:59.970> on<00:07:00.090> the<00:07:00.150> length<00:07:00.419> of<00:07:00.570> time

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
said depending on the length of time

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.120 
said depending on the length of time
that<00:07:00.840> you<00:07:01.169> want<00:07:01.380> to<00:07:01.500> store<00:07:01.740> them<00:07:01.919> if<00:07:02.039> you

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
that you want to store them if you

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.370 
that you want to store them if you
wanted<00:07:02.370> to<00:07:02.490> store<00:07:02.760> them<00:07:02.940> for<00:07:03.150> years<00:07:03.419> so<00:07:03.780> then<00:07:04.260> I

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.380 
wanted to store them for years so then I

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.719 
wanted to store them for years so then I
would<00:07:04.590> put<00:07:04.740> them<00:07:04.830> in<00:07:04.889> the<00:07:04.979> freezer<00:07:05.190> just<00:07:05.340> to

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:05.729 
would put them in the freezer just to

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:07.700 
would put them in the freezer just to
have<00:07:05.880> an<00:07:06.030> optimum<00:07:06.479> quality<00:07:06.900> product<00:07:07.620> you
