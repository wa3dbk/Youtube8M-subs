players didn't want to play canada at
some<00:00:32.759> time<00:00:32.969> well<00:00:33.660> that's<00:00:33.839> when<00:00:34.019> the<00:00:34.170> when<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
some time well that's when the when the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.009 
some time well that's when the when the
dollar<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> canadian<00:00:35.910> dollar<00:00:35.940> when<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
dollar and the canadian dollar when the

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.919 
dollar and the canadian dollar when the
exchange<00:00:37.949> rate<00:00:38.070> was<00:00:38.460> hurting<00:00:38.850> them<00:00:38.999> III<00:00:39.690> don't

00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:39.929 
exchange rate was hurting them III don't

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:41.329 
exchange rate was hurting them III don't
know<00:00:40.079> what<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.320> exchange<00:00:40.739> rate<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.070> with<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
know what the exchange rate is with the

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:43.939 
know what the exchange rate is with the
pound<00:00:41.609> right<00:00:41.969> now<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:42.899> my<00:00:43.050> guess<00:00:43.109> is<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
pound right now but my guess is that the

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:45.770 
pound right now but my guess is that the
NFL<00:00:44.370> would<00:00:44.519> find<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.909> way<00:00:44.999> to<00:00:45.059> compensate

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
NFL would find a way to compensate

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.750 
NFL would find a way to compensate
players<00:00:46.319> adequately<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.280> make<00:00:47.429> sure<00:00:47.550> that

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
players adequately to make sure that

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.520 
players adequately to make sure that
they<00:00:47.819> figure<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.179> out<00:00:48.359> yeah<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:49.319> not<00:00:49.499> that

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
they figure that out yeah it's not that

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.689 
they figure that out yeah it's not that
i<00:00:49.710> don't<00:00:49.949> think<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.370> sort<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.640> thing

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
i don't think it's the sort of thing

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.220 
i don't think it's the sort of thing
that's<00:00:50.969> an<00:00:51.059> insurmountable<00:00:51.359> hurdle<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.079> this

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
that's an insurmountable hurdle to this

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.910 
that's an insurmountable hurdle to this
whole<00:00:52.409> thing<00:00:52.649> okay<00:00:53.579> thanks<00:00:53.879> alright<00:00:54.569> 617<00:00:55.229> 7790

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
whole thing okay thanks alright 617 7790

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
whole thing okay thanks alright 617 7790
a<00:00:56.249> 50<00:00:56.609> you<00:00:56.729> were<00:00:56.789> saying<00:00:56.999> i<00:00:57.409> just<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:59.519> NFL

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
a 50 you were saying i just the NFL

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.819 
a 50 you were saying i just the NFL
desperately<00:01:00.629> wants<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.109> team<00:01:01.319> over<00:01:01.530> there<00:01:01.769> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
desperately wants a team over there and

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.399 
desperately wants a team over there and
i<00:01:02.579> think<00:01:02.909> that<00:01:03.149> cuz<00:01:03.899> Goodell<00:01:04.170> has<00:01:04.320> been

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
i think that cuz Goodell has been

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.840 
i think that cuz Goodell has been
talking<00:01:04.710> about<00:01:04.800> this<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.220> while<00:01:05.370> right<00:01:05.640> now

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
talking about this for a while right now

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.850 
talking about this for a while right now
and<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.630> think<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.020> do<00:01:07.320> they<00:01:07.409> want<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> team<00:01:07.770> in

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and I think that do they want a team in

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.429 
and I think that do they want a team in
Toronto<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.399> the<00:01:08.579> witch<00:01:09.149> yes<00:01:09.600> which<00:01:10.079> the<00:01:10.229> bills

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
Toronto to the witch yes which the bills

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.350 
Toronto to the witch yes which the bills
might<00:01:10.680> write<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.009> long<00:01:11.189> way<00:01:11.369> yeah<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.210> not

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
might write a long way yeah it's not

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.270 
might write a long way yeah it's not
exactly<00:01:12.689> going<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.930> be<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> long<00:01:13.200> commute<00:01:13.920> for

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
exactly going to be a long commute for

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.620 
exactly going to be a long commute for
the<00:01:14.340> bills<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.820> make<00:01:14.969> the<00:01:15.119> move<00:01:15.240> up<00:01:15.450> there

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
the bills to make the move up there

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.330 
the bills to make the move up there
they're<00:01:16.229> playing<00:01:16.409> what<00:01:16.680> two<00:01:16.890> games<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.310> year

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
they're playing what two games a year

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.069 
they're playing what two games a year
there<00:01:17.670> now<00:01:17.909> they<00:01:18.210> want<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> team<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.659> Mexico

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
there now they want a team in Mexico

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.230 
there now they want a team in Mexico
yeah<00:01:19.860> wouldn't<00:01:20.430> be<00:01:20.490> surprised<00:01:20.820> logistically

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
yeah wouldn't be surprised logistically

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.029 
yeah wouldn't be surprised logistically
would<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.869> not<00:01:21.960> make<00:01:22.110> more<00:01:22.500> sense<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.890> maybe

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
would it not make more sense and maybe

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.499 
would it not make more sense and maybe
this<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.310> too<00:01:23.340> much<00:01:23.490> expansion<00:01:24.000> too<00:01:24.270> quickly

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
this is too much expansion too quickly

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.910 
this is too much expansion too quickly
and<00:01:24.659> probably<00:01:25.020> won't<00:01:25.200> happen<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.649> for<00:01:25.890> that

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
and probably won't happen just for that

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.870 
and probably won't happen just for that
reason<00:01:26.039> have<00:01:26.850> two<00:01:27.030> teams<00:01:27.270> over<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:27.899> Europe

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
reason have two teams over in Europe

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.830 
reason have two teams over in Europe
they<00:01:29.880> play<00:01:30.119> each<00:01:30.149> other<00:01:30.420> they'd<00:01:30.570> be<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
they play each other they'd be in the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.630 
they play each other they'd be in the

the<00:01:36.359> bat<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.600> think<00:01:36.930> they<00:01:37.020> might<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.350> do<00:01:37.469> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
the bat I think they might have to do a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.740 
the bat I think they might have to do a
soft<00:01:37.829> sell<00:01:38.100> first<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.579> just<00:01:38.909> expect<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
soft sell first I just expect that the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.569 
soft sell first I just expect that the
NFL<00:01:40.289> keeps<00:01:40.530> going<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.859> London<00:01:41.189> every<00:01:41.399> year
