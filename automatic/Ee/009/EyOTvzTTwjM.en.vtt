00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.520
 hello guys here we are for a new one 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.560
 video review today unlike the 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.330
 previous videos will not anticipate you of 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.860
 what kind of application we will go to 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.529
 speak 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:30.530
 let's just start by opening the 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.330
 clicking on audio manager well yes 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.000
 he felt we would be led to think 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.660
 whether it is the classic application 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.430
 inherent in the audio manager so that there 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.400
 allows you to change the volume of the 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.790
 wake up music and so on 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.470
 however this is pure facade because 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.880
 holding down on the audio writing 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:55.370
 manager a keypad appears for 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:02.149
 type a password that I in this 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:04.850
 case I set to 123456 that's where it is 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:08.810
 will open real application ai 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.300
 tweet pro click on later 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.759
 in this case what allows us to do 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.039
 this application in essence of 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.720
 hide the files we have on 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:22.729
 phone photo video documents 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.459
 how is it possible to do this see allo 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.860
 immediately suppose we want to hide a 

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:29.860
 image click on images 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.960
 we obviously need to create a new one 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:40.110
 folder click on the folder ed 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.570
 add one of the files 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:49.170
 obviously in this case only file 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:51.510
 image click on it e 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.270
 we click below also on hides i 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.570
 files selected and possible 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.970
 select even more than one but in 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.340
 in this case, only the 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.140
 first image 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.490
 then click as said on hide 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.490
 the selected files 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.930
 we confirm the path 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.340
 and here our image was 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.800
 hidden to confirm that it works 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.780
 let us go to the directory where we are 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.660
 previously found the image 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.790
 copied for this archive test 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.880
 we run down we should have 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:37.200
 see it in the last file below and 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.180
 as you can see it does not appear we return to the 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.739
 home 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.580
 let's try now to make it reappear 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.580
 again 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.840
 open the folder in question 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:59.129
 we click on the image and as you can 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:03.299
 see and we will visualize and obviously it is 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:05.819
 You can also unlock it by clicking on 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.340
 shows in addition to these other options that 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.379
 allow us to delete it by sharing it 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.260
 and read the details and make others 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.900
 operations inherent in it have in 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.560
 this case is simply interesting 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.209
 unlock it then click on show 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.250
 we will be asked to confirm that it will be 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.689
 just re-click on show now 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.790
 we return to the bear hector the 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:34.969
 previously displayed where not 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.969
 some archive images appeared 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:41.819
 and here it is below in the logo punto jpg 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.280
 we can clearly open it as you have 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.880
 done so far 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.880
 here she is 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.610
 there is also another way by which 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.920
 being able to hide files on the 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.690
 our smartphone using 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.670
 the application 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:08.340
 then click here at the bottom left 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:10.530
 so much confirmation will come with encryption 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.270
 show all our folders and files 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.490
 present on your smartphone 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.209
 and we could go and choose 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:21.090
 directly can hide how 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.650
 you see the logo punto ge 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.510
 pgi 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.250
 we click on it we choose 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.530

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.750
 delete it 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:37.110
 in this case we click on in credit and 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.390
 we give confirmation already of which we can 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.510
 see how our file has disappeared 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:45.290
 by the director moving through 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.180
 swipe on our right 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:51.330

 rename it or delete it for confirmation 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.350
 that the file actually was 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.070
 hidden let us return to the 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:08.420
 directory and actually the 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.420
 encryption worked 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:19.960
 now we click on it and we decree 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.330
 we give confirmation and our file is of 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.710
 here we can see how it reappeared 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:28.389
 at the bottom of the list 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:31.800
 we go out to the wing for confirmation and here it is 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.800
 here place dot ge pgi 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.210
 analyzing this in more detail 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.860
 application we click on information 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.300
 General Settings 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.120
 here you can see some options 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.610
 present in relation to the program of 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.480
 whose most important is key duration 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.700
 long in the end what it means here 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.040
 you will set the duration of pressure on the 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.530
 written audio manager to make appear 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.750
 the keypad on which to type yours 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.770
 password and unlock the application 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.280
 real 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.920
 let's go back, of course there are 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.400
 also settings related to serity 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.400
 Facebook 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.240
 we could also apply the graphic theme 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.340
 different 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.340
 select for example a clear theme 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.610
 here graphically everything has changed 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.090
 we return to the real app e 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.090
 own 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:38.300
 what else can you do for example 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.300
 change pins 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.790
 and insert an email through which we can 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.990
 eventually recover the password 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:50.550
 accidentally forgotten or lost 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:54.060
 entered the advanced settings for

 let you see what is there and beyond 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.990
 to all this we could also remove the 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:01.770
 ads buying the pro version 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:07.340
 of the app to give feedback to 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:07.340
 developer and also share it 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.270
 concluding we could say that all this 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.580
 will be extremely useful to everyone 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.620
 those interested in keeping their own files 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.310
 documents and other far from eyes

 indiscreet 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:23.280
 especially when we share often 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:25.510
 our phone with family or friends 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.580
