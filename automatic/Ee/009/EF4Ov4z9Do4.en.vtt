00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
multi team game-mode and I believe we're

multi team game-mode and I believe we're
playing<00:00:27.470> hard<00:00:27.800> point<00:00:28.100> it's<00:00:28.760> a<00:00:28.880> fun<00:00:29.090> game<00:00:29.330> that

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
playing hard point it's a fun game that

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.540 
playing hard point it's a fun game that
I<00:00:29.600> have<00:00:29.870> and<00:00:30.050> I<00:00:30.080> think<00:00:30.260> I'd<00:00:30.320> go<00:00:30.410> like<00:00:30.530> 76<00:00:31.040> and<00:00:31.250> 7

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
I have and I think I'd go like 76 and 7

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.160 
I have and I think I'd go like 76 and 7
but<00:00:31.700> there<00:00:31.880> are<00:00:32.029> some<00:00:32.270> boosters<00:00:32.599> just<00:00:32.930> wanted

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
but there are some boosters just wanted

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.079 
but there are some boosters just wanted
to<00:00:33.290> note<00:00:33.500> that<00:00:33.530> but<00:00:34.399> I<00:00:34.429> think<00:00:34.579> I<00:00:34.789> ended<00:00:35.000> up

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:35.089 
to note that but I think I ended up

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:36.340 
to note that but I think I ended up
getting<00:00:35.359> killed<00:00:35.510> by<00:00:35.660> them<00:00:35.809> a<00:00:35.839> few<00:00:36.050> times<00:00:36.260> just

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
getting killed by them a few times just

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.630 
getting killed by them a few times just
because<00:00:36.679> I<00:00:36.739> was<00:00:36.829> trying<00:00:37.010> to<00:00:37.070> take<00:00:37.280> them<00:00:37.460> out

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
because I was trying to take them out

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.790 
because I was trying to take them out
and<00:00:37.879> try<00:00:38.480> to<00:00:38.539> end<00:00:38.750> their<00:00:38.929> little<00:00:39.199> their

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
source that presented some very

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.380 
source that presented some very
interesting<00:01:33.320> information<00:01:34.250> but<00:01:34.280> he<00:01:34.700> said<00:01:34.910> take

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
interesting information but he said take

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.390 
interesting information but he said take
it<00:01:35.420> as<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.630> grain<00:01:35.810> of<00:01:35.840> salt<00:01:36.500> because<00:01:36.680> it<00:01:37.070> I<00:01:37.220> guess

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
it as a grain of salt because it I guess

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.650 
it as a grain of salt because it I guess
gone<00:01:37.640> through<00:01:37.850> quite<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.090> few<00:01:38.270> people<00:01:38.450> already

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
gone through quite a few people already

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.540 
gone through quite a few people already
and<00:01:38.960> obviously<00:01:39.650> when<00:01:39.830> it<00:01:39.920> goes<00:01:40.040> through<00:01:40.220> what

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
and obviously when it goes through what

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.170 
and obviously when it goes through what
a<00:01:40.580> few<00:01:40.760> people

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
a few people

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.620 
a few people
there's<00:01:41.600> tends<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.320> be<00:01:42.440> some<00:01:43.090> inaccuracies<00:01:44.090> as

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
there's tends to be some inaccuracies as

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.290 
there's tends to be some inaccuracies as
to<00:01:44.960> what<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.230> original<00:01:45.550> information<00:01:46.550> was<00:01:46.820> so

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
to what the original information was so

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.370 
to what the original information was so
this<00:01:47.600> is<00:01:47.720> what<00:01:47.870> he<00:01:47.960> said

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
this is what he said

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.780 
this is what he said
apparently<00:01:48.980> vehicles<00:01:49.370> will<00:01:49.550> play<00:01:49.700> a<00:01:49.730> huge

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
apparently vehicles will play a huge

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.270 
apparently vehicles will play a huge
role<00:01:50.330> it's<00:01:50.870> been<00:01:51.080> compared<00:01:51.440> to<00:01:51.470> battlefield<00:01:52.010> 3

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
role it's been compared to battlefield 3

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.430 
role it's been compared to battlefield 3
system<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.570> source<00:01:53.780> claims<00:01:54.080> you'll<00:01:54.230> be

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
system and the source claims you'll be

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.890 
system and the source claims you'll be
able<00:01:54.650> to<00:01:54.740> use<00:01:54.920> tanks<00:01:55.370> choppers<00:01:56.210> parachutes

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
able to use tanks choppers parachutes

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.350 
able to use tanks choppers parachutes
and<00:01:57.020> jets<00:01:57.350> in<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.590> game<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.190> what<00:01:59.150> he<00:01:59.270> also

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
and jets in the game and what he also

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.580 
and jets in the game and what he also
said<00:01:59.660> that<00:01:59.690> it<00:01:59.870> could<00:02:00.020> be<00:02:00.140> possibly<00:02:00.470> just

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
said that it could be possibly just

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.380 
said that it could be possibly just
these<00:02:01.220> vehicles<00:02:01.460> could<00:02:01.790> just<00:02:01.970> be<00:02:02.060> used<00:02:02.270> for

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
these vehicles could just be used for

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.300 
these vehicles could just be used for
the<00:02:02.570> dynamic<00:02:03.260> intro<00:02:03.710> for<00:02:03.860> each<00:02:03.920> map<00:02:04.160> and

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
the dynamic intro for each map and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.100 
the dynamic intro for each map and
that's<00:02:04.430> actually<00:02:04.730> what<00:02:04.880> I<00:02:04.910> was<00:02:05.210> thinking<00:02:05.630> you

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
that's actually what I was thinking you

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.050 
that's actually what I was thinking you
know<00:02:06.140> maybe<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.710> dynamic<00:02:07.190> intro<00:02:07.490> is<00:02:07.670> how<00:02:07.910> it

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
know maybe the dynamic intro is how it

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.669 
know maybe the dynamic intro is how it
could<00:02:08.209> be<00:02:08.360> like<00:02:08.539> on<00:02:08.780> one<00:02:09.080> map<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:09.379> could<00:02:09.530> see

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
could be like on one map you could see

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.709 
could be like on one map you could see
like<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.890> tank<00:02:10.219> global<00:02:10.700> wall<00:02:10.879> and<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.510> team

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:11.719 
like a tank global wall and the team

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.020 
like a tank global wall and the team
enters<00:02:12.140> in<00:02:12.499> or<00:02:12.829> maybe<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.459> could<00:02:13.579> just<00:02:13.700> be<00:02:13.879> like

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
enters in or maybe it could just be like

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.710 
enters in or maybe it could just be like
a<00:02:14.090> team

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
a team

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.030 
a team
like<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.080> could<00:02:15.290> be<00:02:15.410> playing<00:02:15.650> on<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.890> other

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
like you could be playing on the other

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.890 
like you could be playing on the other
side<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.430> team<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:16.880> they're<00:02:17.450> just<00:02:17.630> like

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
side of the team and they're just like

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.270 
side of the team and they're just like
defending<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.560> they<00:02:18.650> just<00:02:18.860> start<00:02:19.100> running

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
defending and they just start running

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.310 
defending and they just start running
and<00:02:19.520> then<00:02:19.670> that's<00:02:20.060> how<00:02:20.210> it<00:02:20.240> starts<00:02:20.600> but<00:02:20.750> that's

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
and then that's how it starts but that's

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.770 
and then that's how it starts but that's
definitely<00:02:21.470> something<00:02:21.770> that<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.370> consider

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
definitely something that to consider

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.760 
definitely something that to consider
just<00:02:23.780> wanted<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.050> say<00:02:24.170> that<00:02:24.320> but<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.680> have

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
just wanted to say that but I have

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.960 
just wanted to say that but I have
alluded<00:02:24.950> with<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.220> theory<00:02:25.460> going<00:02:25.700> even<00:02:25.940> deeper

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
alluded with a theory going even deeper

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.330 
alluded with a theory going even deeper
into<00:02:26.450> this<00:02:26.600> of<00:02:27.020> how<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.260> killstreak<00:02:27.950> system

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
into this of how the killstreak system

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.430 
into this of how the killstreak system
may<00:02:28.550> work<00:02:28.760> with<00:02:28.940> these<00:02:29.090> vehicles<00:02:29.330> so<00:02:30.230> let<00:02:30.380> me

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
may work with these vehicles so let me

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.630 
may work with these vehicles so let me
guys<00:02:30.590> tell<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:30.890> about<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.130> theory<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.550> a

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
guys tell you about this theory and a

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.610 
guys tell you about this theory and a
lot<00:02:31.940> I'll<00:02:32.330> talk<00:02:32.570> about<00:02:32.600> a<00:02:32.840> little<00:02:32.990> bit<00:02:33.140> more<00:02:33.410> in

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
lot I'll talk about a little bit more in

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.290 
lot I'll talk about a little bit more in
depth<00:02:33.860> after<00:02:34.250> I<00:02:34.280> go<00:02:34.460> through<00:02:34.490> my<00:02:34.730> notes<00:02:34.910> here

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
depth after I go through my notes here

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.750 
depth after I go through my notes here
so<00:02:35.780> there<00:02:36.260> could<00:02:36.380> be<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.560> built-in<00:02:37.100> killstreak

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
so there could be a built-in killstreak

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.790 
so there could be a built-in killstreak
system<00:02:38.090> for<00:02:38.270> each<00:02:38.450> map<00:02:38.720> so<00:02:39.230> basically<00:02:39.530> there

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
system for each map so basically there

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.620 
system for each map so basically there
could<00:02:39.950> be<00:02:40.070> just<00:02:40.340> killstreaks<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:41.270> will<00:02:41.390> fit

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
could be just killstreaks that will fit

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.240 
could be just killstreaks that will fit
the<00:02:41.750> atmosphere<00:02:42.290> in<00:02:42.530> an<00:02:42.590> environment<00:02:43.070> of<00:02:43.190> the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
the atmosphere in an environment of the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.980 
the atmosphere in an environment of the
map<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:43.430> basically<00:02:43.970> if<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.240> have<00:02:44.420> like<00:02:44.600> a<00:02:44.630> sky

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
map so basically if you have like a sky

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.650 
map so basically if you have like a sky
map<00:02:45.230> like<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:46.010> free<00:02:46.400> fall<00:02:46.580> map<00:02:46.820> where<00:02:47.480> you're

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
map like the free fall map where you're

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.420 
map like the free fall map where you're
just<00:02:47.840> like<00:02:47.930> up<00:02:48.320> inside<00:02:48.740> a<00:02:48.770> building<00:02:49.070> there

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
just like up inside a building there

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.830 
just like up inside a building there
could<00:02:49.550> be<00:02:49.580> just<00:02:49.820> killstreaks<00:02:50.390> that<00:02:50.570> fit<00:02:50.810> that

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
could be just killstreaks that fit that

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.290 
could be just killstreaks that fit that
type<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.800> map<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.790> then<00:02:52.970> there<00:02:53.120> could<00:02:53.240> be

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
type of a map and then there could be

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.090 
type of a map and then there could be
just<00:02:53.780> certain<00:02:53.990> types<00:02:54.320> of<00:02:54.440> killstreaks<00:02:54.920> that

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
just certain types of killstreaks that

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.400 
just certain types of killstreaks that
work<00:02:55.310> for<00:02:55.580> like<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.120> map<00:02:56.330> that's<00:02:56.540> just<00:02:56.930> like

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
work for like a map that's just like

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.220 
work for like a map that's just like
wasteland<00:02:57.920> from<00:02:58.040> mw2<00:02:58.600> so<00:02:59.600> based<00:02:59.930> on<00:03:00.050> many

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
rumors and sources we could be seeing

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.090 
rumors and sources we could be seeing
choices<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:03.050> type<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.350> killstreaks<00:03:03.800> going

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
choices of type of killstreaks going

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.699 
choices of type of killstreaks going
back<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.370> mw3<00:03:04.790> system<00:03:05.300> was<00:03:05.420> sold<00:03:05.660> support<00:03:06.500> and

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
back to mw3 system was sold support and

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.980 
back to mw3 system was sold support and
specialist<00:03:07.360> possibly<00:03:08.360> more<00:03:08.570> than<00:03:08.630> three

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
specialist possibly more than three

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.690 
specialist possibly more than three
types<00:03:09.230> of<00:03:09.410> streaks<00:03:09.740> some<00:03:10.130> designed<00:03:10.459> for<00:03:10.580> all

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
types of streaks some designed for all

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.400 
types of streaks some designed for all
kinds<00:03:11.030> of<00:03:11.090> players<00:03:11.240> maybe<00:03:11.900> even<00:03:12.170> more<00:03:12.350> than

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
kinds of players maybe even more than

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.810 
kinds of players maybe even more than
three<00:03:12.800> maybe<00:03:12.950> we'll<00:03:13.160> see<00:03:13.370> something<00:03:13.610> like

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
three maybe we'll see something like

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.970 
three maybe we'll see something like
assault<00:03:14.209> support<00:03:14.690> specialist<00:03:15.230> rusher<00:03:15.650> sniper

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
assault support specialist rusher sniper

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.670 
assault support specialist rusher sniper
and<00:03:16.310> etc<00:03:17.270> I'm<00:03:17.360> not<00:03:17.510> gonna<00:03:17.690> go<00:03:18.020> too<00:03:18.080> into

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
and etc I'm not gonna go too into

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.040 
and etc I'm not gonna go too into
details<00:03:19.040> with<00:03:19.130> what<00:03:19.730> we<00:03:19.820> could<00:03:20.030> see<00:03:20.209> there<00:03:20.480> but

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
details with what we could see there but

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.479 
details with what we could see there but
this<00:03:21.410> is<00:03:21.530> an<00:03:21.650> example<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.100> have<00:03:22.250> for<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:22.459> guys

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
this is an example I have for you guys

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.490 
this is an example I have for you guys
so<00:03:22.850> for<00:03:23.090> example<00:03:23.450> if<00:03:23.570> you<00:03:23.660> plan<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:23.930> huge<00:03:24.260> map

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
so for example if you plan a huge map

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.830 
so for example if you plan a huge map
like<00:03:24.709> mw2<00:03:25.160> is<00:03:25.370> map<00:03:25.640> wasteland<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:26.209> could<00:03:26.480> have

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
like mw2 is map wasteland you could have

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.540 
like mw2 is map wasteland you could have
the<00:03:26.989> following<00:03:27.500> so<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.280> could<00:03:28.400> have<00:03:28.489> like

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
the following so you could have like

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.250 
the following so you could have like
choices<00:03:28.970> of<00:03:29.269> all<00:03:29.510> kinds<00:03:29.780> of<00:03:29.810> stuff<00:03:29.870> but<00:03:30.170> these

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
choices of all kinds of stuff but these

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.600 
choices of all kinds of stuff but these
are<00:03:30.410> just<00:03:30.500> two<00:03:30.709> that<00:03:30.860> I<00:03:30.920> was<00:03:31.100> thinking<00:03:31.280> of

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
are just two that I was thinking of

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.009 
are just two that I was thinking of
maybe<00:03:32.060> for<00:03:32.360> assault<00:03:32.630> you<00:03:32.720> could<00:03:32.870> have<00:03:32.959> a

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
maybe for assault you could have a

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.590 
maybe for assault you could have a
predator<00:03:33.500> missile<00:03:33.950> a<00:03:34.100> chopper<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:35.330> tank

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
predator missile a chopper and a tank

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.910 
predator missile a chopper and a tank
and<00:03:35.840> then<00:03:35.959> for<00:03:36.140> support<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.560> could<00:03:36.709> have<00:03:36.800> like

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
and then for support you could have like

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.970 
and then for support you could have like
UAV<00:03:37.400> vest<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:38.000> advanced<00:03:38.540> UAV<00:03:38.959> something<00:03:39.830> that

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
UAV vest and advanced UAV something that

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.160 
UAV vest and advanced UAV something that
fits<00:03:40.160> that<00:03:40.370> maybe<00:03:40.610> that<00:03:41.239> every<00:03:41.660> time<00:03:41.900> there

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
fits that maybe that every time there

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.810 
fits that maybe that every time there
could<00:03:42.290> be<00:03:42.350> like<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.590> certain<00:03:42.920> score<00:03:43.280> or<00:03:43.519> certain

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
could be like a certain score or certain

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.460 
could be like a certain score or certain
amount<00:03:44.030> of<00:03:44.060> kills<00:03:44.269> you<00:03:44.390> have<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.660> get<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:45.350> get

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
amount of kills you have to get to get

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.110 
amount of kills you have to get to get
the<00:03:45.620> hidden<00:03:46.010> kill<00:03:46.250> streak<00:03:46.519> and<00:03:46.850> maybe<00:03:47.000> the

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
the hidden kill streak and maybe the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.940 
the hidden kill streak and maybe the
hidden<00:03:47.360> kill<00:03:47.600> streaks<00:03:47.930> varies<00:03:48.500> like<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:48.830> could

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
hidden kill streaks varies like it could

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.949 
hidden kill streaks varies like it could
be<00:03:49.070> some<00:03:49.280> type<00:03:49.400> of<00:03:49.430> an<00:03:49.760> kill<00:03:50.360> streak<00:03:50.570> that<00:03:50.720> just

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
be some type of an kill streak that just

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.330 
be some type of an kill streak that just
is<00:03:51.170> for<00:03:51.200> support<00:03:51.769> players<00:03:52.070> and<00:03:52.310> just

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
is for support players and just

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.370 
is for support players and just
something<00:03:53.120> that<00:03:53.269> is<00:03:53.600> for<00:03:53.810> assault<00:03:54.080> players

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
something that is for assault players

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.600 
something that is for assault players
that<00:03:54.560> would<00:03:54.680> be<00:03:54.769> definitely<00:03:54.950> interesting<00:03:55.549> if

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
that would be definitely interesting if

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.680 
that would be definitely interesting if
they<00:03:55.730> could<00:03:55.940> do<00:03:56.120> something<00:03:56.150> like<00:03:56.630> that

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
they could do something like that

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.110 
they could do something like that
because<00:03:57.530> if<00:03:57.769> you<00:03:57.830> guys<00:03:57.950> do<00:03:58.220> realize<00:03:58.430> that<00:03:58.670> Call

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
because if you guys do realize that Call

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.030 
because if you guys do realize that Call
of<00:03:59.150> Duty<00:03:59.540> has<00:03:59.720> changed<00:04:00.440> their<00:04:00.590> kill<00:04:00.799> streaks

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
of Duty has changed their kill streaks

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.250 
of Duty has changed their kill streaks
every<00:04:01.269> every<00:04:02.269> time<00:04:02.450> every<00:04:02.780> game<00:04:02.989> has

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
every every time every game has

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.479 
every every time every game has
something<00:04:03.590> different<00:04:03.620> to<00:04:04.010> their<00:04:04.280> kill

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
something different to their kill

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.820 
something different to their kill
streaks<00:04:04.760> different<00:04:05.480> system<00:04:05.840> like<00:04:05.989> remember

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
streaks different system like remember

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.710 
streaks different system like remember
Call<00:04:07.100> of<00:04:07.130> Duty<00:04:07.370> 4<00:04:07.580> was<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:08.060> first<00:04:08.450> quality

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
Call of Duty 4 was the first quality

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.660 
Call of Duty 4 was the first quality
that<00:04:08.900> really<00:04:08.930> implemented<00:04:09.799> that<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:10.160> know<00:04:10.280> it

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
that really implemented that you know it

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.759 
that really implemented that you know it
had<00:04:10.850> the<00:04:11.000> three<00:04:11.299> five<00:04:11.510> six<00:04:11.840> seven<00:04:12.410> system

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
had the three five six seven system

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.110 
had the three five six seven system
maybe<00:04:12.890> they're<00:04:13.100> going<00:04:13.280> back<00:04:13.459> to<00:04:13.580> their<00:04:13.730> basics

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
maybe they're going back to their basics

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.850 
maybe they're going back to their basics
basically<00:04:14.480> that's<00:04:14.600> actually<00:04:14.930> what<00:04:15.049> I<00:04:15.080> said<00:04:15.350> so

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
basically that's actually what I said so

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.140 
basically that's actually what I said so
that<00:04:16.010> was<00:04:16.100> my<00:04:16.220> little<00:04:16.430> bit<00:04:16.609> of<00:04:16.700> a<00:04:16.760> theory<00:04:17.120> about

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
that was my little bit of a theory about

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.670 
that was my little bit of a theory about
that<00:04:17.419> guys<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:18.019> would<00:04:18.169> love<00:04:18.290> to<00:04:18.410> know<00:04:18.530> what<00:04:18.620> you

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.779 
guys think in the comments because I'm
sorry<00:04:20.810> because<00:04:21.169> I<00:04:21.229> was<00:04:21.590> a<00:04:21.620> lot<00:04:21.950> of<00:04:22.100> information

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
sorry because I was a lot of information

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.330 
sorry because I was a lot of information
that<00:04:22.880> I<00:04:23.120> just<00:04:23.180> threw<00:04:23.630> out<00:04:23.780> but<00:04:24.500> this<00:04:25.070> is<00:04:25.220> just

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
that I just threw out but this is just

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.890 
that I just threw out but this is just
something<00:04:25.490> that's<00:04:25.729> very<00:04:25.940> complex<00:04:26.479> I<00:04:26.599> think

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
something that's very complex I think

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.300 
something that's very complex I think
they<00:04:26.990> could<00:04:27.229> be<00:04:27.260> doing

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
they could be doing

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.159
