00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.130
 hello today i would like to 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.049
 talk about one 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:11.670
 amazing things on the beach photo video i 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:15.830
 ordered this thing that's steel 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.630
 the whole hole is drilled we are different 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:26.130
 diameters in some of them are chopped 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:29.099
 thread for different bolts and here you can 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.269
 attach both cameras and tripods and 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.910
 so on and so forth 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.000
 let's see why 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.300
 in fact, I was so imbued with 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.420
 this piece of iron the fact that here means 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.879
 it comes with a handle with a mount for 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:50.730
 cold shoe and in general all 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:53.690
 but steel itself is 4 millimeters thick 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.489
 because she's drilled 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:03.780
 practically so what is 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:08.040
 laces then it weighs very little let's 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.130
 let's see it means to bring it to work 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.130
 state 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:20.009
 even a child can 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.320
 what I tried it was cues 8 of 8 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:27.720
 he is working there is a wide film 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.650
 six by six millimeters frame 6 by 6 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.650
 centimeters frame 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:37.259
 can be scanned in principle 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:42.600
 here is an image from such a film 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:44.759
 let's say 120 megapixel is 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.680
 really real DSLR 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.189
 sometime twenty years ago i 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.240
 worked using the same camera and already 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:57.090
 by the habit of what's the matter so awkward and her 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.170
 just hold the shutter button 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:05.909
 and when you press this shutter button 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:09.509
 Generally the camera you shake to hold her 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:13.250
 uncomfortable and look slip 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:18.540
 plus this is heavy 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.970
 so it turned out that this thing and this 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.120
 the camera weighs in just a second 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.120
 two kilograms 200 grams 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.720
 this thing copes with its 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:38.000
 task 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:44.549
 that is, now it is really 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.680
 camera you need it reliably enough 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.500
 is being held and now pay attention 4 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.780
 millimeter steel easy grip 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.170
 wherein the holding chamber of any 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:00.930
 absolutely position that is even with 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:04.829
 With such cameras everything is okay. 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:09.620
 good for such cameras this thing 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:13.680
 absolutely indispensable let's see 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.859
 what it looks like on modern cameras 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.510
 and not so big as such 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:23.370
 grip can offer 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.790
 for example, a system like sony nex in 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.879
 face 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.419
 sony nex-7 with a long lens 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:35.609
 but firstly it's not pretty 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:37.560
 sustainable system despite the fact that 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:42.379
 beautiful stabilization inside here 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.849
 specifically this lens would like 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:48.060
 somehow 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:51.569
 keep it more catchy so in 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:56.030
 In this case, this system is also very 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:04:01.769
 even well suited well after 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:04.620
 the handle is attached sony nex-7 is no longer 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.900
 Looks like let's say unstable 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.140
 there is indeed some inertia 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.950
 balance is already 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:20.100
 quite comfortable design only 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:21.620
 that with such a lens to use the flash 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:27.810
 this is ridiculous 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:31.740
 trick that's what you can 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:35.550
 simultaneously shoot video two 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:42.949
 cameras or videos and photos that is the bottom 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.949
 the camera as I say sony nex-7 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:52.560
 makes 10 frames per second 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:55.950
 Plus, I can turn on the video on 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.750
 both cameras because let's say here in 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.530
 This case is not aligned to 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:04.340
 horizontals 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:07.350
 and plus to this, I can install 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.850
 sony microphone directed I have 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.080
 a gun 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:15.300
 but here is this microphone which is soft 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.740
 I like the head suspension more 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.479
 because he doesn't transmit work noise 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.210
 the camera turns on very serious 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:28.160
 system meaning you can shoot right away 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.160
 at two focal lengths 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:41.810
 sound is qualitatively removed and in general 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:46.479
 the whole system is quite compact with 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:54.080
 this and the whole system plus this 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:55.610
 mobile enough that is for 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:01.720
 some frames I can turn it 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.720
 the camera is okay there cut video 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.130
 if this is only a video then in general 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:11.780
 two hands already wield pretty 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:16.220
 convenient but you can even have one of 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:18.560
 hands remove here by the way here this hand 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.370
 clean up is not so convenient because sony 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.229
 nex-7 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:25.250
 it is not the world's toughest 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:34.960
 camera so pay attention 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:38.889
 But on such a simple thing normal 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:43.210
 it would seem just an ordinary handle 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:46.550
 which gives tremendous opportunities and 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:49.130
 fits in a small bag and even if 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:52.400
 for some reason you didn't have a bag 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:54.070
 it all fits in your pocket you can 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.490
 it's pretty funny to do 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:02.289
 put one camera here this one 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.289
 attach the camera here 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:11.780
 microphone somewhere here or vice versa 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:14.720
 two cameras so microphone down below or 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.470
 up above that is we have the richest 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.060
 opportunities 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:23.440
 when we have such a simple piece of iron 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:28.090
 piece of iron with a pen I never thought that 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:31.750
 such a simple scheme can give such 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.750
 amazing results 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:52.930
 we still wanted to consider heavy 

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:54.130
 stabilizers we will consider them next 

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:58.000
 releases 

00:07:54.130 --> 00:08:02.480
 Thank you for your attention and creative success 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.600
 until next time bye to 

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.600
 dating
