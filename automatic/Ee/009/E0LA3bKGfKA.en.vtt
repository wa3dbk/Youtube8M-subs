00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.839
 I am always amazed to study the 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.820
 principles that the Lord has taught us 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:04.439
 their concepts are simple and easy to 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:09.119
 manage and when we meet them 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.119
 we receive additional blessings 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.600
 the law of fasting is basic in the church 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.000
 Isaiah declared 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.220
 it's not the fasting that I chose 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.220
 let him break his bread with the hungry 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.030
 just like many other biblical practices 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.790
 this was restored by the Lord in 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.150
 our days through the prophet joseph 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.150
 smith 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.530
 The law of fasting has three purposes 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:46.130
 first provide help to the needy 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.590
 through the offerings of fasting 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.250
 equivalent to the value of the meals of 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.250
 that we abstain 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:00.970
 second the fast is a physical benefit 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.810
 and third increases both our humility 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.810
 as our spirituality 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.100
 if my son will find out that there is a 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.100
 would be very upset 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.800
 he says that with my years I should not fast 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.600
 that is not good for me 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.790
 but it's good for me 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.630
 It helps me feel close to the Lord 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.850
 when I make a small sacrifice for 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.820
 help someone else 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.520
 I have a lot and I need 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.980
 share it 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.130
 when I was baptized in the church 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.220
 I asked a friend how much my 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.760
 fasting offering 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.730
 and she told me that the prophet was asking 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:02.640
 we were generous I think we should 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:07.940
 sacrifice a little and that's what I 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.940
 although in reality it is not sacrifice 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.540
 one of the important reasons for fasting 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:20.020
 it is in contributing the money that 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.110
 we save by not eating and with that help 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.060
 the poor one of the most important 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.880
 warnings that the Lord has given to 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.690
 your children on earth is that we have the 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.410
 obligation and responsibility to help 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.410
 the needy 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.170
 It was King Benjamin who exhorted 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.890
 his people 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.910
 and now because of these things 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.270
 that I have spoken to you is to say in order 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.959
 retain the remission of your sins 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.980
 from day to day so that you walk without fault 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.069
 before God 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.580
 I would like that from your goods 16 to 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.970
 poor 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.970
 each according to what he has
