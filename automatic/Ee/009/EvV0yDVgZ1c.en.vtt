00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
right so sustainability definitely a

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.300 
right so sustainability definitely a
huge<00:02:21.930> piece<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:23.130> course<00:02:23.400> can't<00:02:23.849> go<00:02:24.200> 100%

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
huge piece to it of course can't go 100%

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.500 
huge piece to it of course can't go 100%
organic<00:02:26.310> but<00:02:26.700> we're<00:02:26.849> trying<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.239> be<00:02:27.360> as

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
organic but we're trying to be as

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.250 
organic but we're trying to be as
sustainable<00:02:27.750> as<00:02:28.230> possible<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.900> can<00:02:31.080> see

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
sustainable as possible and you can see

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.490 
sustainable as possible and you can see
that<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.709> soil<00:02:31.980> here<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.519> a<00:02:32.959> pretty<00:02:33.959> intense

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
that the soil here is a pretty intense

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.550 
that the soil here is a pretty intense
rock<00:02:35.069> so<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.519> have<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:36.000> rock<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:36.930> really

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
rock so you have this rock that really

connection<00:04:18.190> you<00:04:19.190> know<00:04:20.770> yeah<00:04:21.770> I<00:04:21.800> think<00:04:22.480> it<00:04:23.480> was

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
connection you know yeah I think it was

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.040 
connection you know yeah I think it was
spreaded<00:04:24.590> much<00:04:25.040> more<00:04:25.370> in<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.000> past<00:04:26.270> in<00:04:26.840> front

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
spreaded much more in the past in front

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.530 
spreaded much more in the past in front
there<00:04:27.170> in<00:04:27.320> Croatia<00:04:27.710> but<00:04:27.980> then<00:04:28.130> plots<00:04:28.640> replaced

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
there in Croatia but then plots replaced

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.750 
there in Croatia but then plots replaced
it<00:04:29.840> probably<00:04:30.590> because<00:04:30.890> of<00:04:30.920> the<00:04:31.190> resistant<00:04:31.700> to

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
it probably because of the resistant to

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.810 
it probably because of the resistant to
disease<00:04:32.120> right<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:32.960> later<00:04:33.200> rippling<00:04:34.130> right

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
disease right and later rippling right

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.000 
disease right and later rippling right
because<00:04:35.210> here's<00:04:35.480> very<00:04:35.720> warm<00:04:36.020> and<00:04:36.320> we<00:04:36.770> need<00:04:36.920> to

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
because here's very warm and we need to

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.410 
because here's very warm and we need to
pick<00:04:37.310> up<00:04:37.460> some<00:04:37.670> fun<00:04:37.820> deli<00:04:38.000> in<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.120> middle<00:04:38.330> of

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
pick up some fun deli in the middle of

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.720 
pick up some fun deli in the middle of
August<00:04:38.780> when<00:04:38.990> it's<00:04:39.110> very<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:40.040> before<00:04:40.460> when

wineries<00:04:41.270> didn't<00:04:41.510> have<00:04:41.660> such<00:04:41.960> a<00:04:41.990> good

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
wineries didn't have such a good

wineries didn't have such a good
conditions<00:04:42.710> of<00:04:42.920> cooling<00:04:43.460> and<00:04:43.610> controlling

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
conditions of cooling and controlling

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.240 
conditions of cooling and controlling
temperature<00:04:44.330> right<00:04:44.990> it<00:04:45.350> was<00:04:45.470> more<00:04:45.680> simple<00:04:45.860> to

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
temperature right it was more simple to

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.730 
temperature right it was more simple to
adjust<00:04:46.600> with<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:47.660> harvest<00:04:48.020> with<00:04:48.260> the<00:04:48.350> harvest

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
adjust with the harvest with the harvest

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.680 
adjust with the harvest with the harvest
and<00:04:48.950> take<00:04:49.340> it<00:04:49.460> up<00:04:49.550> a<00:04:49.640> variation<00:04:50.150> to<00:04:50.510> mean

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
and take it up a variation to mean

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.830 
and take it up a variation to mean
October<00:04:51.500> I<00:04:51.620> know<00:04:51.770> in<00:04:51.950> August<00:04:52.130> right<00:04:53.090> right
