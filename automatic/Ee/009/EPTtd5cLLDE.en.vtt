oh<00:00:00.380> so<00:00:01.399> what<00:00:02.399> we've<00:00:02.520> got<00:00:02.550> here<00:00:02.700> is<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.419> canon

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
oh so what we've got here is the canon

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.310 
oh so what we've got here is the canon
powershot<00:00:03.950> s95<00:00:07.970> it<00:00:08.970> like<00:00:09.150> camera<00:00:09.660> at<00:00:09.840> the

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
powershot s95 it like camera at the

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.770 
powershot s95 it like camera at the
moment<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.800> explain<00:00:11.219> why<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:12.000> we're<00:00:12.150> videoing

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
moment I explain why so we're videoing

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.580 
moment I explain why so we're videoing
this<00:00:12.870> on<00:00:13.080> SX<00:00:13.710> 200<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.429> which<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.880> got<00:00:15.500> but<00:00:16.500> this

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
this on SX 200 is which I got but this

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.990 
this on SX 200 is which I got but this
would<00:00:16.740> kind<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.920> fit<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.220> bill<00:00:17.400> better<00:00:17.580> cause

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
would kind of fit the bill better cause

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.359 
would kind of fit the bill better cause
up<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.510> very<00:00:18.840> small<00:00:19.170> very<00:00:19.439> compact<00:00:19.830> as<00:00:20.340> you

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
up it's very small very compact as you

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.660 
up it's very small very compact as you
can<00:00:20.550> see<00:00:21.320> kind<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.410> like<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.680> 200<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.340> when<00:00:23.609> you

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
can see kind of like the 200 is when you

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.599 
can see kind of like the 200 is when you
open<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:23.939> up<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.449> lens<00:00:24.630> comes<00:00:24.869> out<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.859> not<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
open it up the lens comes out it's not a

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.390 
open it up the lens comes out it's not a
-<00:00:27.090> zoom<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:28.920> still<00:00:29.130> three

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
- zoom so it's but it's still three

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.370 
- zoom so it's but it's still three
point<00:00:29.609> eight<00:00:29.730> times<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.480> quite<00:00:30.720> an<00:00:30.990> effective

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
point eight times so quite an effective

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.470 
point eight times so quite an effective
zoom<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.769> but<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> big<00:00:32.850> thing<00:00:32.880> about<00:00:33.300> this

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
zoom on it but the big thing about this

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.410 
zoom on it but the big thing about this
for<00:00:33.690> me<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.680> little<00:00:34.860> guy<00:00:35.130> here<00:00:35.460> so

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
for me is this little guy here so

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.720 
for me is this little guy here so
actually<00:00:36.540> we've<00:00:37.410> got<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.590> ring<00:00:37.829> controller<00:00:38.340> so

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
actually we've got a ring controller so

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.080 
actually we've got a ring controller so
like<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.690> 200<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.829> you've<00:00:41.219> got<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> dial<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.000> you

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
like the 200 is you've got a dial so you

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.910 
like the 200 is you've got a dial so you
can<00:00:42.210> set<00:00:42.360> manual<00:00:42.809> control<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.500> pretty<00:00:43.860> much

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
can set manual control of pretty much

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.709 
can set manual control of pretty much
everything<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.329> mean<00:00:45.480> pretty<00:00:45.629> much

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
everything and I mean pretty much

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.360 
everything and I mean pretty much
everything<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.320> got<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.590> visa<00:00:47.070> aperture

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
everything so you got a visa aperture

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.880 
everything so you got a visa aperture
priority<00:00:47.579> shutter<00:00:48.270> priority<00:00:48.930> all<00:00:49.500> those<00:00:49.649> good

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
priority shutter priority all those good

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.790 
priority shutter priority all those good
things<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:51.059> 200<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.320> reasonably

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
things on the 200 is it's reasonably

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.930 
things on the 200 is it's reasonably
straightforward<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.579> off<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> dial

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
straightforward you do that off the dial

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.450 
straightforward you do that off the dial
but<00:00:54.149> here<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.960> feels<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.800> little<00:00:55.920> bit<00:00:56.100> more<00:00:56.160> like

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
but here it feels a little bit more like

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.709 
but here it feels a little bit more like
this<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.879> line<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.329> you've<00:00:57.420> gotta<00:00:57.570> meet

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
this this line that you've gotta meet

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.660 
this this line that you've gotta meet
you<00:00:57.899> control<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.469> those<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.280> then<00:00:59.489> you've

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
you control of those and then you've

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.939 
you control of those and then you've
still<00:00:59.820> got<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.570> menu<00:01:00.930> job<00:01:01.260> dial<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.800> back

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
still got the menu job dial on the back

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.200 
still got the menu job dial on the back
so<00:01:02.250> you've<00:01:02.370> kind<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.670> got<00:01:02.820> an<00:01:02.910> extra

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
so you've kind of got an extra

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.910 
so you've kind of got an extra
controller<00:01:03.570> which<00:01:03.840> just<00:01:04.019> means<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.650> can<00:01:04.769> get

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
controller which just means you can get

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.340 
controller which just means you can get
to<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.129> settings<00:01:05.369> faster<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.750> manual<00:01:07.049> focus

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
to the settings faster the manual focus

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.140 
to the settings faster the manual focus
and<00:01:07.409> things<00:01:07.619> like<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.790> other<00:01:08.820> big

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
and things like that the other big

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.020 
and things like that the other big
feature<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.720> camera<00:01:09.960> for<00:01:10.200> me<00:01:11.030> was

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
feature of this camera for me was

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.250 
feature of this camera for me was
setting<00:01:12.270> some<00:01:12.390> temperature<00:01:12.689> priority<00:01:13.400> and

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
setting some temperature priority and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.760 
setting some temperature priority and
we<00:01:15.530> can<00:01:15.680> do<00:01:15.770> here<00:01:15.980> is<00:01:16.730> the<00:01:17.450> maximum<00:01:18.440> aperture

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
we can do here is the maximum aperture

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.030 
we can do here is the maximum aperture
size<00:01:19.100> which<00:01:19.490> is<00:01:19.670> that<00:01:19.850> F<00:01:20.060> 2.0<00:01:21.050> is<00:01:21.290> really

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
size which is that F 2.0 is really

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.620 
size which is that F 2.0 is really
really<00:01:22.190> important<00:01:22.640> there<00:01:22.790> that's<00:01:23.420> kind<00:01:23.600> of

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
really important there that's kind of

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.930 
really important there that's kind of
important<00:01:23.990> for<00:01:24.020> two<00:01:24.200> reasons<00:01:24.430> one<00:01:25.430> is<00:01:25.670> for

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
important for two reasons one is for

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.610 
important for two reasons one is for
later<00:01:26.120> line<00:01:26.330> start<00:01:26.780> imaging<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.320> get<00:01:27.440> a<00:01:27.470> lot

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
later line start imaging to get a lot

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.770 
later line start imaging to get a lot
more<00:01:27.800> light<00:01:28.070> in<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:29.270> sensors<00:01:29.600> pretty

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
more light in and the sensors pretty

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.390 
more light in and the sensors pretty
sensitive<00:01:30.140> as<00:01:30.290> well<00:01:30.470> so<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.860> lot<00:01:30.920> of<00:01:31.040> what<00:01:31.250> I<00:01:31.280> do

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
sensitive as well so a lot of what I do

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.170 
sensitive as well so a lot of what I do
which<00:01:31.850> is<00:01:32.290> talk<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:33.380> be<00:01:33.470> pretty<00:01:33.680> dark<00:01:33.920> places

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
which is talk to be pretty dark places

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.000 
which is talk to be pretty dark places
phenomenal<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.900> other<00:01:36.020> thing<00:01:36.320> is<00:01:36.470> that<00:01:36.500> with

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
phenomenal the other thing is that with

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.810 
phenomenal the other thing is that with
took<00:01:37.880> 1-0<00:01:38.270> lens<00:01:38.570> you<00:01:39.260> to<00:01:39.380> get<00:01:39.500> prey<00:01:39.820> shallow

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
took 1-0 lens you to get prey shallow

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.210 
took 1-0 lens you to get prey shallow
depth<00:01:41.210> field<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:41.900> that<00:01:41.930> traditional<00:01:42.650> kind<00:01:43.160> of

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
depth field so that traditional kind of

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.380 
depth field so that traditional kind of
blurry<00:01:43.430> looking<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:43.880> get<00:01:44.000> reduce<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.300> this

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
blurry looking you get reduce to this

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.140 
blurry looking you get reduce to this
are<00:01:44.630> you'll<00:01:45.380> get<00:01:45.590> with<00:01:45.740> this<00:01:45.890> when<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:46.880> zoom

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
are you'll get with this when you zoom

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.200 
are you'll get with this when you zoom
in<00:01:48.010> the<00:01:49.010> maximum<00:01:49.400> aperture<00:01:49.580> that<00:01:49.790> goes<00:01:49.970> down<00:01:50.180> a
