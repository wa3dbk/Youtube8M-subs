00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
gently of the flooring and it actually

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.170 
gently of the flooring and it actually
comes<00:02:49.290> off<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.650> was<00:02:49.739> very<00:02:49.859> surprised<00:02:50.250> but<00:02:50.969> I<00:02:51.030> did

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
comes off I was very surprised but I did

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.920 
comes off I was very surprised but I did
try<00:02:51.359> that<00:02:52.280> there's<00:02:53.280> been<00:02:53.579> also<00:02:53.819> no<00:02:54.150> smell<00:02:54.540> like

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
try that there's been also no smell like

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.780 
try that there's been also no smell like
say<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.290> first<00:02:55.560> week<00:02:55.890> after<00:02:56.099> we<00:02:56.370> put<00:02:56.549> it<00:02:56.670> in

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
say the first week after we put it in

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.110 
say the first week after we put it in
there<00:02:57.090> was<00:02:57.239> like<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.420> very<00:02:57.629> light<00:02:58.019> rubbery<00:02:58.500> snow

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
there was like a very light rubbery snow

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.000 
there was like a very light rubbery snow
that's<00:03:00.120> because<00:03:00.629> I<00:03:00.810> assumed<00:03:01.200> from<00:03:01.469> the<00:03:01.620> bottom

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
that's because I assumed from the bottom

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.879 
that's because I assumed from the bottom
of<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:03.000> planks<00:03:03.450> they're<00:03:03.750> sort<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.650> black

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
of the planks they're sort of a black

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.069 
of the planks they're sort of a black
rubbery<00:03:05.310> material<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:06.329> there<00:03:06.780> was<00:03:06.900> like<00:03:06.959> a

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
rubbery material so there was like a

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.740 
rubbery material so there was like a
slight<00:03:07.709> rubbery<00:03:08.250> smell<00:03:08.670> but<00:03:08.909> it<00:03:09.030> was<00:03:09.150> not<00:03:09.359> to

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
slight rubbery smell but it was not to

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.170 
slight rubbery smell but it was not to
me<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.139> was<00:03:10.260> not<00:03:10.409> chemical<00:03:10.859> and<00:03:11.069> it<00:03:11.909> didn't

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
me it was not chemical and it didn't

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.990 
me it was not chemical and it didn't
bother<00:03:12.900> me<00:03:13.109> and<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:13.769> that<00:03:13.950> smell<00:03:14.280> dissipated

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
bother me and that that smell dissipated

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.690 
bother me and that that smell dissipated
very<00:03:15.569> quickly<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:16.230> there's<00:03:16.560> no<00:03:17.010> smell<00:03:17.370> now

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
very quickly so there's no smell now

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.009 
very quickly so there's no smell now
that<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.090> can<00:03:18.530> see<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.919> I<00:03:20.419> guess<00:03:21.419> yeah<00:03:21.659> this<00:03:21.870> is

you because again that if you put the
whole<00:04:01.199> row<00:04:01.590> in<00:04:01.859> first<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.729> will<00:04:02.879> be<00:04:03.590> so<00:04:04.590> much

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
whole row in first you will be so much

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.469 
whole row in first you will be so much
happier<00:04:05.069> with<00:04:05.489> how<00:04:05.669> quickly<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.449> how

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479 
happier with how quickly and how

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.020 
happier with how quickly and how
efficiently<00:04:07.139> you<00:04:07.680> can<00:04:07.829> lay<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.159> down<00:04:08.189> whereas

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
efficiently you can lay it down whereas

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.210 
efficiently you can lay it down whereas
if<00:04:09.180> you<00:04:09.299> only<00:04:09.449> have<00:04:09.720> say<00:04:09.959> two<00:04:10.019> people<00:04:10.379> you<00:04:11.069> can

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
if you only have say two people you can

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.039 
if you only have say two people you can
only<00:04:11.370> hold<00:04:11.639> you<00:04:12.000> know<00:04:12.090> two<00:04:12.329> planks<00:04:12.599> together

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
only hold you know two planks together

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.170 
only hold you know two planks together
at<00:04:13.260> once<00:04:13.439> in<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:13.799> row<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.489> you're<00:04:15.000> always

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
at once in that row and you're always

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.729 
at once in that row and you're always
going<00:04:15.359> to<00:04:15.419> have<00:04:15.479> to<00:04:15.599> deal<00:04:15.870> with<00:04:15.900> putting<00:04:16.470> in

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
going to have to deal with putting in

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.009 
going to have to deal with putting in
two<00:04:17.070> edges<00:04:17.400> at<00:04:17.519> once<00:04:17.699> and<00:04:18.030> that<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.570> was<00:04:18.780> a

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
two edges at once and that that was a

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.670 
two edges at once and that that was a
headache<00:04:19.259> so<00:04:19.709> just<00:04:20.669> just<00:04:21.000> do<00:04:21.180> your<00:04:21.269> research

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
headache so just just do your research

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.529 
headache so just just do your research
go<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.979> store<00:04:23.310> wherever<00:04:23.669> store<00:04:24.120> carries

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
go to the store wherever store carries

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.810 
go to the store wherever store carries
the<00:04:24.750> flooring<00:04:25.110> you're<00:04:25.229> interested<00:04:25.650> in<00:04:25.800> for<00:04:26.580> me

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
the flooring you're interested in for me

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.520 
the flooring you're interested in for me
and<00:04:26.940> was<00:04:27.030> home<00:04:27.180> depot<00:04:27.570> I<00:04:27.810> definitely

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
and was home depot I definitely

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.159 
and was home depot I definitely
recommend<00:04:28.710> go<00:04:28.979> see<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.370> flooring<00:04:29.699> first<00:04:30.169> and

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
recommend go see the flooring first and

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.409 
recommend go see the flooring first and
then<00:04:31.680> sort<00:04:32.520> of<00:04:32.550> think<00:04:32.909> about<00:04:33.120> in<00:04:33.240> your<00:04:33.360> mind

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
then sort of think about in your mind

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.439 
then sort of think about in your mind
how<00:04:34.400> how<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.460> pieces<00:04:35.940> would<00:04:36.030> come<00:04:36.270> together

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
how how the pieces would come together

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.290 
how how the pieces would come together
so<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:37.020> can<00:04:37.199> sort<00:04:37.349> of<00:04:37.409> plan<00:04:37.680> out<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:39.000> way<00:04:39.120> that

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
so you can sort of plan out the way that

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.580 
so you can sort of plan out the way that
you<00:04:39.389> would<00:04:39.479> lay<00:04:39.659> it<00:04:39.750> down<00:04:39.810> I<00:04:39.960> think<00:04:40.139> all<00:04:40.530> of

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
you would lay it down I think all of

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.730 
you would lay it down I think all of
that<00:04:40.830> really<00:04:41.370> needs<00:04:41.610> experience<00:04:42.030> very

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
that really needs experience very

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:50.950 
that really needs experience very
actually<00:04:43.740> really<00:04:44.220> fun<00:04:44.460> for<00:04:44.880> us

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:05:01.060 

you

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070
