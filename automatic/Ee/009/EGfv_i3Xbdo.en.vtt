canada did not did not operate this a
little<00:00:43.620> bit<00:00:43.800> earlier<00:00:44.100> because<00:00:44.960> Bombardier<00:00:45.960> is

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
little bit earlier because Bombardier is

too many plans I don't believe this will

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.520

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
be going to my airport to my mono

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.380 
be going to my airport to my mono
airport<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.160> don't<00:03:20.670> know<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:20.790> might<00:03:21.030> put<00:03:21.300> it

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
airport I don't know I might put it

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.250 
airport I don't know I might put it
there<00:03:21.570> but<00:03:22.190> most<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.340> time<00:03:23.519> for<00:03:24.260> American

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
there but most of the time for American

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.820 
there but most of the time for American
routes<00:03:25.440> they<00:03:25.620> use<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.920> crj200<00:03:26.580> or<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.830> dash

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
routes they use the crj200 or the dash

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.360 
routes they use the crj200 or the dash
100<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.930> i<00:03:31.050> think<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.620> one<00:03:31.680> goes<00:03:32.040> like

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
100 and i think this one goes like

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.440 
100 and i think this one goes like
