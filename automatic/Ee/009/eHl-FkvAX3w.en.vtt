00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
sort of portion of it right but this

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.440 
sort of portion of it right but this
sort<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.550> eliminates<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.120> lot<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
sort of eliminates a lot of the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.860 
sort of eliminates a lot of the
technical<00:00:46.289> skill<00:00:46.620> needed<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.280> make<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.750> in<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
technical skill needed to make it in the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.150 
technical skill needed to make it in the
sense<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.379> know<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.800> sort<00:00:50.100> of

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
sense that you know you can sort of

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.130 
sense that you know you can sort of
train<00:00:50.670> almost<00:00:50.910> anybody<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.719> roll<00:00:51.899> something

are<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.290> key<00:01:40.470> points<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.579> where<00:01:41.970> do<00:01:42.090> we

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
are the key points and so where do we

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.069 
are the key points and so where do we
begin<00:01:42.360> if<00:01:42.810> we're<00:01:43.079> making

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
begin if we're making

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.200 
begin if we're making
at<00:01:44.259> samake<00:01:44.859> how<00:01:45.039> do<00:01:45.100> we<00:01:45.340> like<00:01:45.670> what<00:01:45.789> we<00:01:45.939> need

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
at samake how do we like what we need

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.270 
at samake how do we like what we need
what<00:01:46.539> we<00:01:46.689> get<00:01:46.810> started<00:01:47.200> with<00:01:47.380> okay<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:47.799> that<00:01:48.159> I

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
what we get started with okay so that I

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.730 
what we get started with okay so that I
mean<00:01:48.429> the<00:01:49.090> beginning<00:01:49.479> traditionally<00:01:50.350> is<00:01:50.469> this

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
mean the beginning traditionally is this

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.289 
mean the beginning traditionally is this
which<00:01:50.950> is<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.130> Hungary<00:01:51.609> which<00:01:51.909> is<00:01:52.060> where<00:01:52.210> the

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
which is the Hungary which is where the

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.690 
which is the Hungary which is where the
rice<00:01:52.450> gets<00:01:52.719> seasoned<00:01:53.079> so<00:01:53.799> the<00:01:54.100> rice<00:01:54.340> comes<00:01:54.520> out

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
rice gets seasoned so the rice comes out

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.130 
rice gets seasoned so the rice comes out
of<00:01:54.789> the<00:01:54.850> cooker<00:01:55.210> it<00:01:55.390> gets<00:01:55.539> put<00:01:55.719> in<00:01:55.810> here<00:01:56.049> it

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
of the cooker it gets put in here it

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.230 
of the cooker it gets put in here it
gets<00:01:56.229> sort<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:56.619> it<00:01:56.799> gets<00:01:56.950> fans<00:01:57.189> down<00:01:57.460> alright

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
gets sort of it gets fans down alright

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.849 
gets sort of it gets fans down alright
so<00:01:58.810> you<00:01:58.960> bring<00:01:59.109> the<00:01:59.229> temperature<00:01:59.649> down<00:01:59.679> to

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
so you bring the temperature down to

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.919 
so you bring the temperature down to
about<00:02:00.069> 130<00:02:00.789> degrees<00:02:00.880> or<00:02:01.360> so<00:02:01.539> because<00:02:01.750> if<00:02:01.840> you

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
about 130 degrees or so because if you

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:03.990 
about 130 degrees or so because if you
mix<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.289> when<00:02:02.380> it's<00:02:02.469> very<00:02:02.560> hot<00:02:02.649> it<00:02:03.429> starts

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
mix it when it's very hot it starts

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.910 
mix it when it's very hot it starts
becoming<00:02:04.329> very<00:02:04.569> glutinous<00:02:04.959> so<00:02:05.409> cooling<00:02:05.740> the

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
becoming very glutinous so cooling the

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.499 
becoming very glutinous so cooling the
rice<00:02:06.069> down<00:02:06.310> before<00:02:06.729> you<00:02:06.789> season<00:02:07.119> it<00:02:07.209> and<00:02:07.390> then

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
rice down before you season it and then

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:08.940 
rice down before you season it and then
using<00:02:07.719> a<00:02:07.929> mixture<00:02:08.170> of<00:02:08.229> sugar<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.799> vinegar

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
using a mixture of sugar and vinegar

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.250 
using a mixture of sugar and vinegar
evenly<00:02:09.459> mixing<00:02:10.330> these<00:02:10.450> things<00:02:10.720> into<00:02:10.989> it<00:02:11.110> it's

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
evenly mixing these things into it it's

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.930 
evenly mixing these things into it it's
very<00:02:11.410> very<00:02:11.500> key<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.250> want<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.459> get<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:12.640> flavor

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
very very key you want to get the flavor

very very key you want to get the flavor
profile<00:02:13.420> out<00:02:13.599> of<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:13.959> acidity<00:02:14.349> and<00:02:14.530> that

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
profile out of it that acidity and that

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.580 
profile out of it that acidity and that
salt<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.099> sugar<00:02:15.129> really<00:02:15.730> brings<00:02:16.660> out<00:02:16.870> the
