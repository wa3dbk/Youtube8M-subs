for<00:02:03.850> work<00:02:04.090> because<00:02:04.770> my<00:02:06.270> uniform<00:02:07.270> is<00:02:08.019> actually

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950

chocolate with orange feeds all over it

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.589 
chocolate with orange feeds all over it

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
so the lip are going to be orange as

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.559 
so the lip are going to be orange as
