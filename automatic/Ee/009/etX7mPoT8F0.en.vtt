about a hundred million down pipe and I
drew<00:00:24.449> some<00:00:24.689> holes<00:00:24.990> along<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.920> when<00:00:26.039> I

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
drew some holes along it so that when I

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.640

this little gadget so for our
ingredients<00:01:55.399> I'll<00:01:55.850> be<00:01:56.000> using<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:57.369> salt<00:01:58.369> as

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
ingredients I'll be using the salt as

ingredients I'll be using the salt as
you<00:01:58.850> know<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.300> chain<00:01:59.539> sawdust<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.410> bucket<00:02:01.160> up

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
you know the chain sawdust a bucket up

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.630 
you know the chain sawdust a bucket up
there<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.759> a<00:02:02.060> bucket<00:02:02.509> of<00:02:02.570> these<00:02:02.810> pouches<00:02:03.640> they

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
there and a bucket of these pouches they

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.999 
there and a bucket of these pouches they
are<00:02:04.759> pretty<00:02:05.119> dry<00:02:05.509> already<00:02:08.200> so<00:02:09.200> mix<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:09.800> into

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
are pretty dry already so mix it into

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.949 
are pretty dry already so mix it into
this<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:11.709> bucket<00:02:12.709> of<00:02:12.830> folders<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:14.570> bucket<00:02:14.870> of

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
this a bucket of folders and a bucket of

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:25.360 
this a bucket of folders and a bucket of
mouches<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:23.810> materials<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.650> bit<00:02:24.829> cold<00:02:25.130> but

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
mouches the materials a bit cold but

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.270 
mouches the materials a bit cold but
this<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:26.120> ok<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.780> here<00:02:26.989> people<00:02:27.290> will<00:02:27.560> still

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
this is ok and here people will still

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.819 
this is ok and here people will still
bind<00:02:28.549> them<00:02:28.730> together<00:02:32.110> so<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.230> idea<00:02:33.470> now<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.650> to

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
bind them together so the idea now is to

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.930 
bind them together so the idea now is to
really<00:02:34.730> mix<00:02:35.239> well<00:02:35.690> keep<00:02:36.260> mixing<00:02:36.560> until<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.610> is

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
really mix well keep mixing until it is

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.110 
really mix well keep mixing until it is
thoroughly<00:02:38.209> mixed<00:02:39.200> together<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:40.610> if<00:02:40.850> it<00:02:41.000> is<00:02:41.090> a

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
thoroughly mixed together and if it is a

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:49.150 
thoroughly mixed together and if it is a
bit<00:02:41.480> dry<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:41.989> no<00:02:42.350> water<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.959> want<00:02:48.110> to<00:02:48.230> be<00:02:48.440> in

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
bit dry and no water you want to be in

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.130 
bit dry and no water you want to be in
the<00:02:49.310> water<00:02:49.640> needs<00:02:49.970> to<00:02:50.030> be<00:02:50.120> dripping<00:02:50.690> down<00:02:50.870> when

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
the water needs to be dripping down when

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.410 
the water needs to be dripping down when
you<00:02:51.320> when<00:02:52.070> you<00:02:52.160> hold<00:02:52.400> me<00:02:52.760> here<00:02:52.910> contains

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
you when you hold me here contains

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.880 
you when you hold me here contains
together

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.560 

it<00:02:57.400> looks<00:02:57.670> like<00:02:57.820> it's<00:02:58.000> about<00:02:58.090> ready<00:03:00.570> maybe

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
it looks like it's about ready maybe

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.540 
it looks like it's about ready maybe
it's<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.960> bit<00:03:02.230> on<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.470> dry<00:03:02.650> side<00:03:03.040> but<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.310> think

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
it's a bit on the dry side but I think

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:16.050 
it's a bit on the dry side but I think
it'll<00:03:03.670> work<00:03:11.430> happy<00:03:12.430> with<00:03:12.550> it<00:03:13.980> okay<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.880> that's

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
it'll work happy with it okay so that's

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.140 
it'll work happy with it okay so that's
when<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:16.210> do<00:03:16.300> put<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.840> rock<00:03:17.050> in<00:03:17.080> and<00:03:17.560> in<00:03:17.710> the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
when I do put the rock in and in the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.450 
when I do put the rock in and in the
pumps<00:03:19.170> around<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.290> rock<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.800> put<00:03:21.100> a<00:03:21.130> plate

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
pumps around the rock and put a plate

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.900 
pumps around the rock and put a plate
over<00:03:22.770> and<00:03:23.770> if<00:03:23.920> that<00:03:24.070> is<00:03:24.220> falling<00:03:24.610> off<00:03:24.730> or

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
over and if that is falling off or

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.480 
over and if that is falling off or
crushingly<00:03:25.450> water<00:03:25.780> out<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:28.170> this<00:03:29.170> lever<00:03:29.440> is<00:03:29.830> a

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
crushingly water out so this lever is a

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.630 
crushingly water out so this lever is a
fairly<00:03:30.910> long<00:03:31.150> lever<00:03:31.450> so<00:03:31.870> not<00:03:32.650> much<00:03:32.830> strength<00:03:33.370> I

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
fairly long lever so not much strength I

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.230 
fairly long lever so not much strength I
needed<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.360> depress<00:03:35.050> it<00:03:35.080> down<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.760> longer<00:03:37.000> the

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
needed to depress it down the longer the

needed to depress it down the longer the
lever<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.570> lighter<00:03:37.990> work<00:03:38.440> so<00:03:39.430> I<00:03:39.460> attached

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
lever the lighter work so I attached

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.390 
lever the lighter work so I attached
this<00:03:40.120> lever<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.870> platform<00:03:41.860> that<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.100> made

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
this lever to the platform that I made

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.330 
this lever to the platform that I made
some<00:03:43.360> months<00:03:43.780> ago<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:45.610> this<00:03:45.820> is<00:03:45.970> just<00:03:46.210> a<00:03:47.340> steel

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
some months ago and this is just a steel

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.860 
some months ago and this is just a steel

tasting I put a piece of brick and a

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.060 
tasting I put a piece of brick and a
water<00:04:07.390> has<00:04:07.630> collected<00:04:07.959> will<00:04:08.350> be<00:04:08.380> you<00:04:08.920> know

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
water has collected will be you know

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:16.349 
water has collected will be you know
pour<00:04:09.880> back<00:04:10.090> into<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.480> bucket<00:04:14.640> so<00:04:15.640> these<00:04:16.150> are

pour back into the bucket so these are

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.490 
pour back into the bucket so these are
the<00:04:16.480> materials<00:04:18.570> it's<00:04:19.570> not<00:04:19.780> really<00:04:20.020> a<00:04:20.049> lot<00:04:20.290> in

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
the materials it's not really a lot in

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.360 
the materials it's not really a lot in
