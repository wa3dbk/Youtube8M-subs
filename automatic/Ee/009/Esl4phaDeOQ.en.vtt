00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.300
 the female beach volleyball in Hawaii around 1920 as a recreation 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.539
 but the success of the game was so great that it became a sport 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.230
 spread around the world 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.820
 salt if the link with the sport however is only in 1987 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.210
 the evolution was so great that beach volleyball came as a sport 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.809
 official of the olympics as early as 1996 in arkansas in the united states 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.600
 despite not being the cradle of the modality Brazil is the nation with 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.630
 more tradition in sport 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.340
 and great names of the sport have already appeared here in the country as Ricardo and Emanuel 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.550
 jaqueline fernandes among many other goal of the modality is the same as the 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.830
 volleyball court 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.390
 make the ball hit the ground of the opposing play area 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.200
 as in the block version the sets can give three passes before 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.950
 passing the ball to the opponent's side 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.200
 the ct is decided on 21 points with a minimum advantage of two points 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.770
 if there is a tie by 20 to 20 the match will continue in contention until some 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.080
 between two points of difference 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.650
 wins the match to the pair that conquer 2 6 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.720
 current impasses will be played in pride week 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.550
 or if you have to win the set that marks 15 points the biggest difference of the 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.860
 beach volleyball to court in practice is the number of players 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.160
 because there are only two athletes instead of six 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.820
 which forces the player's participation to marry every move 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.460
 a curiosity is that many volleyball athletes shifted the blocks to the beaches 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.990
 When I'm at the end of my career in Brazil, this was the case with 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.080
 giovani among others 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.330
 how it all works and explain how beach volleyball works
