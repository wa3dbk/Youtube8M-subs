lock up everything on the field and your
opponent<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:52.860> lob<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.280> up<00:01:53.399> because

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
opponent to just lob it up because

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.460 
opponent to just lob it up because
they're<00:01:54.270> panicking<00:01:54.780> or<00:01:54.899> lob<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.259> up<00:01:55.320> because

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
they're panicking or lob it up because

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.190 
they're panicking or lob it up because
they<00:01:55.710> have<00:01:55.829> nowhere<00:01:56.100> else<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.430> go<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.200> just

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
they have nowhere else to go and just

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.440 
they have nowhere else to go and just
come<00:01:58.439> down<00:01:58.469> with<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> huge<00:01:59.450> reception

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
come down with the huge reception

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.330 
come down with the huge reception
because<00:02:00.780> your<00:02:01.049> defender<00:02:01.469> just<00:02:01.649> doesn't<00:02:02.070> react

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
because your defender just doesn't react

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.550 
because your defender just doesn't react
or<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:02.640> they<00:02:02.820> do<00:02:02.880> react<00:02:03.329> all<00:02:03.750> they<00:02:03.960> do<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.140> play

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
or if they do react all they do is play

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.770 
or if they do react all they do is play
the<00:02:04.860> wide<00:02:05.369> receiver<00:02:05.759> instead<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.329> playing<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
the wide receiver instead of playing the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.900 
the wide receiver instead of playing the
ball<00:02:07.079> this<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.160> something<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.610> absolutely

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
ball this is something that absolutely

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.999 
ball this is something that absolutely
must<00:02:09.810> be<00:02:09.989> fixed<00:02:10.349> with<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.530> Mexican

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
must be fixed with the Mexican

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.679 
must be fixed with the Mexican
aim<00:02:11.099> I've<00:02:11.489> also<00:02:11.819> seen<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.330> become<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.629> problem

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:12.689 
aim I've also seen it become a problem

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.979 
aim I've also seen it become a problem
for<00:02:13.140> other<00:02:13.409> routes<00:02:14.400> as<00:02:14.640> well<00:02:14.670> but<00:02:15.599> for<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
for other routes as well but for the

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.050 
for other routes as well but for the
most<00:02:16.170> part<00:02:16.319> it's<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.799> streak<00:02:17.340> on<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.610> outside

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
most part it's the streak on the outside

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.360 
most part it's the streak on the outside
that<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.629> biggest<00:02:18.930> issue<00:02:19.319> but<00:02:20.220> I've

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
that is the biggest issue but I've

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.460 
that is the biggest issue but I've
definitely<00:02:20.610> seen<00:02:20.909> guys<00:02:21.360> just<00:02:21.689> not<00:02:21.900> react<00:02:22.260> on

more pressure and we end up getting the
interception<00:02:59.909> big<00:03:00.209> time<00:03:00.510> pick<00:03:00.930> right<00:03:01.200> there

bit<00:05:06.030> i<00:05:06.060> mean<00:05:06.150> you<00:05:06.780> use<00:05:06.930> a<00:05:06.960> better<00:05:07.229> team<00:05:07.560> it's

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
bit i mean you use a better team it's

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.020 
bit i mean you use a better team it's
more<00:05:07.919> likely<00:05:08.190> that<00:05:08.370> you're<00:05:08.639> going<00:05:08.669> to<00:05:08.789> get<00:05:08.910> the

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
more likely that you're going to get the

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.240 
more likely that you're going to get the
good<00:05:09.210> breaks<00:05:09.449> but<00:05:10.080> it's<00:05:10.260> not<00:05:10.440> necessarily<00:05:11.070> the

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
good breaks but it's not necessarily the

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.510 
good breaks but it's not necessarily the
case<00:05:11.610> so<00:05:12.260> all<00:05:13.260> you<00:05:13.320> can<00:05:13.680> do<00:05:13.830> is<00:05:14.039> hope<00:05:14.220> for<00:05:14.460> the

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
case so all you can do is hope for the

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.400 
case so all you can do is hope for the
best<00:05:14.760> and<00:05:15.060> then<00:05:15.300> just<00:05:15.539> continue<00:05:15.660> to<00:05:16.050> play<00:05:16.289> your

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
best and then just continue to play your

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.900 
best and then just continue to play your
game<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:16.680> understand<00:05:17.340> that's<00:05:17.520> part<00:05:17.729> of<00:05:17.820> the

game and understand that's part of the

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.600 
game and understand that's part of the
game<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.389> do<00:05:18.660> what<00:05:18.690> you<00:05:18.960> can<00:05:19.229> to<00:05:19.500> get<00:05:19.860> them<00:05:20.070> w's

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
game and do what you can to get them w's

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
on a two-point conversion so we're

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.060 
on a two-point conversion so we're
sending<00:05:48.360> heaters<00:05:48.660> left<00:05:48.960> and<00:05:49.169> right<00:05:49.380> and<00:05:49.620> we

sending heaters left and right and we

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.650 
sending heaters left and right and we
end<00:05:50.220> up<00:05:50.370> getting<00:05:50.639> the<00:05:50.669> ball<00:05:50.910> back<00:05:50.970> right<00:05:51.449> here

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
end up getting the ball back right here

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.180 
end up getting the ball back right here
and<00:05:51.810> at<00:05:51.900> this<00:05:52.020> point<00:05:52.260> all<00:05:52.440> we<00:05:52.470> need<00:05:52.650> to<00:05:52.680> do<00:05:52.949> is

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
and at this point all we need to do is

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.879 
and at this point all we need to do is
kill<00:05:53.729> the<00:05:54.000> class<00:05:54.630> that's<00:05:55.260> one<00:05:55.590> thing<00:05:55.620> about

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
kill the class that's one thing about

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:57.589 
kill the class that's one thing about
much<00:05:56.310> that<00:05:56.490> you<00:05:56.639> have<00:05:56.760> to<00:05:56.909> be<00:05:57.000> careful<00:05:57.180> of<00:05:57.479> is

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
much that you have to be careful of is

00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:59.450 
much that you have to be careful of is
turning<00:05:57.930> the<00:05:57.990> ball<00:05:58.139> over<00:05:58.199> or<00:05:58.860> getting<00:05:59.190> stopped

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
turning the ball over or getting stopped

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.640 
turning the ball over or getting stopped
because<00:05:59.580> if<00:05:59.909> you<00:06:00.030> do<00:06:00.270> the<00:06:00.870> chances<00:06:01.289> are<00:06:01.320> coming

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
because if you do the chances are coming

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.990 
because if you do the chances are coming
back<00:06:01.770> or<00:06:01.949> a<00:06:01.979> lot<00:06:02.190> less<00:06:02.400> just<00:06:02.639> because<00:06:02.909> the

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
back or a lot less just because the

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.820 
back or a lot less just because the
games<00:06:03.180> are<00:06:03.360> a<00:06:03.389> lot<00:06:03.539> shorter<00:06:03.780> so<00:06:04.260> take<00:06:04.530> care<00:06:04.560> of

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
games are a lot shorter so take care of

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.370 
games are a lot shorter so take care of
that<00:06:04.919> ball<00:06:05.190> it<00:06:05.460> really<00:06:06.330> value<00:06:06.690> every<00:06:07.050> single

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
that ball it really value every single

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.589 
that ball it really value every single
possession<00:06:07.880> again<00:06:08.880> we'll<00:06:09.030> go<00:06:09.150> to<00:06:09.210> a<00:06:09.270> teeny
