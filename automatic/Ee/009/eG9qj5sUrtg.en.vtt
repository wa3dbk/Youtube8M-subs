00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.970
 league for micro party baby what's going on my 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.619
 team has aps c is back yesterday 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.630
 I went up in the first league 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.160
 together with child in olympic stadium and 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.590
 we have the game against the world 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.149
 team from sandhausen looked at this 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.149
 team has actually tried ours 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.399
 team with a five-chain to offer something 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.809
 also worked well up to the 85 minute 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.820
 we just are not anymore 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.440
 but then redeemed us by 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.130
 michelle lasogga and has us with his 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.780
 10 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.239
 brought back to the first league 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.890
 and I have to say that at last 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.930
 for me as a hertha fan, there are also in 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.100
 This season something to celebrate for me 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.190
 actually had me before the season 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.399
 namely a self imposed self 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.809
 stadium ban imposed and have only 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.760
 the half of all the mirrors looked because 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.409
 I just shit all this 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.210
 It just does not happen last season 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.500
 wanted to admit and what preetz and 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.240
 Gegenbauer also from this club 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.380
 I've made them up 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.690
 Do not forgive today 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.170
 I only say player transfers 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.400
 not hit at all then 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.950
 Coach change in the middle of the season 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.869
 just say spark or rehhagel 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.340
 that should probably be enough as an example 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.979
 financially is the club 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.350
 lousy there and I hope I hope 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.409
 indebted that preetz from his mistakes 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.000
 has learned and hertha bsc really 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.740
 steers into the right direction and there 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.119
 get back where we ever been 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.250
 I'll win my already won in the 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.900
 Champions league and this club has 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.820
 but with this city and background 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.840
 There's so much potential there as well 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.790
 jump out more 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.220
 and this lot I give him one now 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.200
 last last chance if he has it this time 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.090
 again verkackt then I raced completely 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.619
 Except I did not forget this 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.900
 whole shit after the düsseldorf game 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.369
 and also there you can before you 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.590
 remember the Dusseldorf plays so where 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.509
 we are fans ran onto the playing field 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.720
 then yes deservedly descended 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.189
 are 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.590
 but then what because everything around it 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.790
 happens happens I is not got it 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.590
 I did not forgive him and 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.269
 That's why it was right there 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.499
 boycott to impose and say as 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.150
 hertha fan no 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.860
 you have to now your shit 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.270
 pay for it yourself here 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.280
 and then the fans come back like that 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.290
 like I have been doing for 15 years 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.850
 then you can come back to us 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.800
 but do not count before and the 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.300
 Conditions are also very high this time 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.370
 well we have a coach with luhukay 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.410
 the team in any case again 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.150
 we have steered into the right direction 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.210
 have a stable defense we have one 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.800
 team what works and the first league 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.810
 is not overly strong now 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.300
 you could not get the 15 place at least 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.810
 create so this time it has to be easy 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.670
 fold 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.350
 the seasonal goal can not be just that 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.120
 So I'm not one too 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.170
 Of these he will always be the hertha fans 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.180
 gladly implies that they will be back 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.830
 are freaking out and thinking we create 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.989
 the European Cup the next song no 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.230
 no, this time we stay very far 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.790
 the ground and do not say that is down 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.530
 the goal and if something happens 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.540
 if we are somehow a negative series 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.580
 then also preetz must not freak out 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.360
 Let luca celebrate again, let him 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.190
 to calm down 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.780
 I think a lot of them because heart 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.760
 after all, with gladbach and augsburg too 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.130
 already managed to ascend and with 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.630
 Augsburg this group troupe has that 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.190
 really managed to stay in there too 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.900
 at gladbach or I think fired 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.410
 It does not matter anyway 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.670
 Trainer 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.070
 you just have to hold it now 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.260
 and as far as the player potential is concerned 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.209
 Of course, we are very far 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.430
 below have hardly any creativity 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.840
 Only ronny and maybe a 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.580
 Two good strikers and that was it then 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.769
 we are also very good on the outdoor tracks 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.580
 sparse and we can ourselves 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.410
 Of course, none at all 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.820
 players do so we have no money 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.959
 and we will probably join us 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.799
 this whole average player 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.230
 have to content 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.000
 but even with the team I have to say 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.280
 you can do it easily and also 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.350
 total then consolidate 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.510
 in the next years what also the 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.890
 financially and in the medium term 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.900
 of course, only be the goal that 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.390
 to establish itself in the first league 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.850
 if you did it and me 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.130
 synonymous find no matter if you hertha fans or 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.750
 an opponent of the berlin club simply has 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.850
 a club deserves the first league 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.190
 plays in europe because it is synonymous 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.200
 so yes two clubs are in the 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.870
 respective capitals always top with 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.760
 and play for championships 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.650
 but only in germany it is not 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.880
 possible no that just can not be 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.250
 that 's why I am glad that we are now the 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.799
 get second chance after say 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.840
 Dieter Hoeneß era around us 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.610
 a good point in the first 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.590
 to work in the league 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.509
 but since we just talked about europe 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.759
 have I run now just skill 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:32.379
 I'm talking about another topic 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.419
 pending namely tomorrow and beyond 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:36.639
 namely the two champions league 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.370
 games by bavaria munich and dortmund 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.930
 against two spanish teams namely out 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.150
 barcelona and real madrid 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.190
 since I'm already like fritter fat 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.860
 I really need you, too 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.330
 of course, I am local there 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.520
 i am a fan of bavaria i am even fan 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.020
 schalke-fan international and that as 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.150
 Hard for you have to introduce yourself 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.620
 no fun aside these two games 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.620
 are of course awesome 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.539
 that's what a football fan is 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.000
 wants to see where the heart is rising 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:06.099
 and if I have a quick look at the game of 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.719
 bavaria against barcelona may go there 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.780
 I think it's such a game in memory 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:12.909
 from 2009 I think that was there 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.379
 but bavaria neatly made fresh 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:15.310
 from barcelona in the return match with 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:17.379
 4 12 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.090
 and then I thought so there you look 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:20.440
 you yet again the lineup at 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.690
 and I have my eyes so laid 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.039
 a little bit defensive and there 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.789
 is my jaw at one 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.590
 fell down 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:28.779
 because in the defense have the following 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.430
 player played on the right ley in the 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:33.190
 internal defense van buyten and breno 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.860
 and on the right otto and then her solo 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.360
 i know these players me yes me 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.440
 I could not remember that 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.270
 have a player than at bayern 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.759
 has played and there is a lot to me 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.669
 it became clear why bavaria prayed there 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:48.099
 but was so right and I guess 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:50.650
 the cadres of the current which is ten times 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:51.849
 stronger than then and therefore have 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.349
 you definitely have a good chance 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:53.949
 also against this world team 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.830
 Barcelona 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.750
 i mean this investors are also one 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.949
 bit in the years come messi is 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.240
 just a bit dependent on that 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:04.210
 If you are the circles of iniesta 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.789
 and xavi disturbed in any case 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.190
 a chance to turn off messi and 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:11.020
 I'll say 45 percent 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.000
 Probably at least I would 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.400
 Bayern believe they will continue there 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.199
 come and also just with the whole 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.529
 records the bavaria has set up yes 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:22.419
 they have a confidence of 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:24.190
 The finest of these are the eggs 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:25.779
 must already be medicine ball size 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.819
 and that's why I trust in it and on 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:30.310
 any case I am very curious 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:32.840
 if they can do it but we still have 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.820
 a second game namely dortmund went 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.160
 third on wednesday that's not 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.919
 less interesting and I have to go 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.630
 say yes dortmund has already made it 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:43.699
 dortmund has already done real madrid 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:47.180
 They have two to beat at home 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:48.680
 one won and even 1 2 away 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.830
 2 squeezed out if I'm not 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.600
 fake and I say so 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.160
 why should not they do it again 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.360
 I can do that because of the semi-final 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.970
 two such a different story 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.560
 but dortmund is in top occupation 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:04.669
 in my opinion the best striker 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.889
 the world right now but yes I am 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:08.810
 actually good things that you can do against 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:10.490
 Real Madrid can win in any case 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.500
 because watching the defense of more real 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.530
 Madrid is always good for a goal 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.760
 and the offensive is of course killer 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.520
 measures itself so there you have to be hellish 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.620
 I'm glad that also 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.150
 hummels is back because santana has 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:27.110
 I'm not exactly messing with fame 

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:29.690
 in the quarterfinals and what should I do 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:32.240
 I think that everything is possible, I am glad 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.130
 In any case, that's it, I hope 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.580
 you have my desert eagle mount 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.780
 have impressed here, yes, yes 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.820
 and now have a go with yours 

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.050
 shit now a fun 

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.639
 Of course you can keep your ideas 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.080
 Let's see you next time 

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:48.160
 again when once again the 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.160
 group is
