slides that half step slide go straight

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.750 
slides that half step slide go straight
into<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.430> f-sharp<00:02:58.670> chord

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.360 

there's<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.300> route<00:03:06.489> and<00:03:08.019> then<00:03:09.019> there's

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
there's the route and then there's

five<00:03:17.030> then<00:03:17.690> we<00:03:17.720> slide<00:03:18.140> from<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.620> sharp<00:03:18.950> which<00:03:19.159> is

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
five then we slide from a sharp which is

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.070 
five then we slide from a sharp which is
the<00:03:19.459> third<00:03:19.730> of<00:03:19.849> the<00:03:19.970> f<00:03:20.150> sharp<00:03:20.360> chord<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:21.049> the

the third of the f sharp chord to the
root<00:03:21.379> of<00:03:21.560> B<00:03:21.739> minor<00:03:22.069> and<00:03:26.410> play<00:03:27.410> a<00:03:27.440> C<00:03:27.799> sharp<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:28.430> D

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
root of B minor and play a C sharp to D

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:38.540 
root of B minor and play a C sharp to D
hammer<00:03:28.819> on

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.930 

at<00:03:39.420> this<00:03:39.540> point<00:03:39.750> we<00:03:39.990> reached<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.380> e<00:03:40.410> chord<00:03:40.920> e<00:03:41.220> 7

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
at this point we reached the e chord e 7

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.380 
at this point we reached the e chord e 7
the<00:03:42.060> 5<00:03:42.300> chord<00:03:44.960> as<00:03:45.960> the<00:03:46.230> road<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:47.030> we<00:03:48.030> end<00:03:48.180> on

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
the 5 chord as the road and we end on

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.500 
the 5 chord as the road and we end on
the<00:03:48.540> root<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.020> a<00:03:49.050> chord
