side<00:04:09.420> what<00:04:10.349> will<00:04:10.470> happen<00:04:10.860> is<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.010> down<00:04:11.370> in

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
side what will happen is that down in

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.210 
side what will happen is that down in
here<00:04:11.819> which<00:04:12.599> we<00:04:12.840> have<00:04:13.170> a<00:04:13.440> hut<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:13.920> bedding

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
here which we have a hut and the bedding

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.770 
here which we have a hut and the bedding
it<00:04:14.340> will<00:04:14.430> actually<00:04:14.550> create<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:15.000> bubble<00:04:15.269> of<00:04:15.510> warm

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
it will actually create a bubble of warm

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.199 
it will actually create a bubble of warm
air<00:04:16.019> from<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.070> heat<00:04:17.280> rising<00:04:17.790> up<00:04:17.910> in<00:04:18.120> the

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
air from the heat rising up in the

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.640 
air from the heat rising up in the
bottom<00:04:18.479> where<00:04:18.600> your<00:04:18.720> heat<00:04:18.900> pads<00:04:19.169> gonna<00:04:19.410> be

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
bottom where your heat pads gonna be

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.830 
bottom where your heat pads gonna be
here<00:04:19.889> and<00:04:20.729> hitting<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.150> top<00:04:21.329> with<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.630> Hobbit

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
here and hitting the top with the Hobbit

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.689 
here and hitting the top with the Hobbit
Hut<00:04:22.079> so<00:04:22.290> you'll<00:04:22.410> find<00:04:22.650> that<00:04:22.860> when<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.280> get<00:04:23.520> if

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
Hut so you'll find that when you get if

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:24.920 
Hut so you'll find that when you get if
you<00:04:23.820> were<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.000> get<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.180> digital<00:04:24.449> thermometer

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
you were to get a digital thermometer

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.420 
you were to get a digital thermometer
with<00:04:25.260> a<00:04:25.290> probe<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.770> you<00:04:25.860> put<00:04:26.040> it<00:04:26.130> in<00:04:26.250> here

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
with a probe and you put it in here

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.730 
with a probe and you put it in here
temperatures<00:04:27.000> in<00:04:27.120> here<00:04:27.419> would<00:04:28.110> easily<00:04:28.380> be

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
temperatures in here would easily be

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.260 
temperatures in here would easily be
five<00:04:28.949> times<00:04:29.250> degrees<00:04:29.490> warmer<00:04:30.150> the

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
five times degrees warmer the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.450 
five times degrees warmer the
temperatures<00:04:30.750> up<00:04:30.960> here<00:04:31.290> if<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:31.919> don't<00:04:32.190> have<00:04:32.310> a

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
temperatures up here if you don't have a

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.080 
temperatures up here if you don't have a
light<00:04:32.760> lucky<00:04:33.660> you<00:04:33.870> you're<00:04:34.530> gonna<00:04:34.710> have<00:04:35.090> your

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
mini deep dome and a light bulb and

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.040 
mini deep dome and a light bulb and
here's<00:04:38.729> our<00:04:38.910> nice<00:04:41.360> and<00:04:42.360> then<00:04:42.540> you<00:04:42.690> can<00:04:42.900> just

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.050 

thermometer<00:04:51.389> and<00:04:51.539> again<00:04:51.840> I<00:04:52.020> was<00:04:52.259> like<00:04:53.060> but

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
thermometer and again I was like but

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.939 
thermometer and again I was like but
without<00:04:54.449> way<00:04:54.629> I<00:04:54.659> noticed<00:04:54.930> about<00:04:55.199> snakes

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
without way I noticed about snakes

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.879 
without way I noticed about snakes
getting<00:04:59.750> and<00:05:00.750> put<00:05:00.990> one<00:05:01.110> on<00:05:01.199> the<00:05:01.289> cold<00:05:01.530> side<00:05:01.710> so

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
getting and put one on the cold side so

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.559 
getting and put one on the cold side so
you<00:05:01.979> can<00:05:02.099> see<00:05:02.310> just<00:05:02.370> how<00:05:02.490> cold<00:05:02.789> it<00:05:03.000> gets<00:05:03.030> and

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
you can see just how cold it gets and

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:04.760 
you can see just how cold it gets and
then<00:05:03.659> you<00:05:03.750> can<00:05:03.900> even<00:05:04.020> people<00:05:04.289> in<00:05:04.379> the<00:05:04.530> middle

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
then you can even people in the middle

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.659 
then you can even people in the middle
and<00:05:04.919> see<00:05:05.039> what<00:05:05.159> the<00:05:05.250> ambient<00:05:05.669> temperature<00:05:06.090> is

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
and see what the ambient temperature is

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.129 
and see what the ambient temperature is
then<00:05:08.669> the<00:05:08.759> last<00:05:08.939> thing<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.539> biggest<00:05:09.719> mistake

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
then the last thing the biggest mistake

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:11.689 
then the last thing the biggest mistake
I<00:05:10.229> see<00:05:10.409> people<00:05:10.439> making<00:05:10.889> is<00:05:11.069> that<00:05:11.219> they<00:05:11.400> put<00:05:11.550> the

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
I see people making is that they put the

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.820 
I see people making is that they put the
thermometer<00:05:11.969> up<00:05:12.360> here<00:05:12.810> you<00:05:13.500> don't<00:05:13.650> want<00:05:13.770> to

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
thermometer up here you don't want to

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.929 
thermometer up here you don't want to
know<00:05:13.919> the<00:05:14.039> temperature<00:05:14.219> is<00:05:14.520> at<00:05:14.639> the<00:05:14.699> top<00:05:14.909> of

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:14.939 
know the temperature is at the top of

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:16.129 
know the temperature is at the top of
the<00:05:15.120> cage<00:05:15.300> that's<00:05:15.479> not<00:05:15.659> where<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:15.900> snakes

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
the cage that's not where the snakes
