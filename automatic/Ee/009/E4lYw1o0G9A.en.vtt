though<00:04:46.880> so<00:04:47.750> whatever<00:04:47.930> reasons<00:04:48.410> they<00:04:48.530> may<00:04:48.650> have

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
though so whatever reasons they may have

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.690 
though so whatever reasons they may have
nonetheless<00:04:49.520> still<00:04:50.210> really<00:04:50.570> good

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
nonetheless still really good
