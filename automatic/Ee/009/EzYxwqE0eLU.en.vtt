 video will start at 32 10 hello was I 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.600
 the other day watching an anime called 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.820
 death not when a chapter dies a 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.949
 very dear character for my thing that is not 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.050
 I liked nothing after a lot 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.240
 regret and remember the dead of 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.920
 the creators of the anime I came up with the 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.079
 idea of ​​making a video loquendo 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.930
 criticizing briefly the most deaths 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.850
 annoying in animes before you start 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.860
 with the critical notice that this video 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.930
 may contain spoilers since 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.989
 I will mention deaths of famous animes and 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.149
 not so famous well I 'll go saying one for 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.820
 one the most annoying deaths for me and 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.680
 then I will comment a little about them in 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.510
 the number 10 we have the death of 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.090
 character called to sum of the anime 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.010
 Naruto shippuden this death bothered me 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.500
 a bit since apart from that death 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.539
 of assumption was somewhat unjustified the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.460
 final scene is very sad and I would have 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.210
 liked that the character lived more 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.060
 for 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.040
 give more knowledge to their apprentices 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.900
 in number 9 we have the death of 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.210
 character called death also from 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.220
 Naruto shippuden the death of this 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.770
 character has a good part and another 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.200
 bad part the good part is that thank you 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.420
 at his death the character called k almost 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.729
 that was his partner could change 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.590
 attitude and become a better ninja besides 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.509
 who got the sharing and the death and 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.270
 he became caracas and the ninja copión 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.860
 the bad part for me is that he died nothing 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.170
 more to awaken their sharing and of 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.270
 become a good ninja and also died 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.000
 just when he started getting along 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.950
 with k almost at number 8 we have the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.530
 death of the character called light or 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.170
 anime death note this character is the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.420
 protagonist of the anime however in my 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.940
 opinion was an evil and cruel character 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.649
 that I deserved a little death what I 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.570
 annoying of his death is that he could 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.520
 have been a good person and could 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.130
 He has given a twist to the story 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.100
 anime anyway dies at the end of 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.110
 anime in the number 7 we have death 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.489
 of the character called joe of the anime 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.500
 black Rock Shooter 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.660
 this character dies at the end of the anime 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.260
 but it still bothered me since his death 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.439
 it's a little 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.629
 and I liked the character quite well, 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:21.060
 anime know if this is well known but 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.010
 I liked it a lot and I recommend them in 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.079
 the number 6 we have the death of 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.689
 character called os juniors of the anime 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.879
 one piece this character though only 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.840
 it came out in 1 or 2 chapters and it did not have great 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.370
 relevance 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.319
 his death was very moving and 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.989
 surely he drew more than a tear 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.019
 some the next three deaths are 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.909
 all of the anime one piece at number 5 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.829
 we have the death of the pirate called 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.440
 white beard or Japanese and follow it 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.480
 this death was one of the saddest and 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.549
 touching of all the anime since the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.530
 character was very dear to all and what 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.200
 worst of all was that his death was not in 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.150
 a clean and fair battle in the number 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.209
 4 is the death of the character called 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.400
 except the death of this character was a 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.530
 both chilling and cruel because what 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.239
 they killed being just a child and a 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.920
 shot of a cannon 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.139
 I would have liked that character 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.060
 continue living to the point that 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.579
 become a great pirate and in the future 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.620
 you will meet the protagonist in the 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.680
 number 3 we have the death of the character 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.130
 called and I made this death surely 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.440
 is 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.450
 of all one piece since that was the 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.060
 brother of the protagonist and dies in his 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.670
 many arms will have been missed 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.680
 the tears with this tragic death with 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.720
 this ended the deaths of the anime one 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.600
 piece and continue with others of others 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.640
 animes in number 2 we have death 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.280
 of the character called Naruto's Hitachi 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.680
 shippuden as incredible as this 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.780
 character dies twice the first 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.450
 dies at the hands of his brother sas that but 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.070
 he says goodbye to him tenderly later 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.260
 it tells how hitachi was a good 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.600
 person and he just wanted the good of his 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.730
 brother this makes those who seek 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.230
 revenge and after much searching 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.350
 meet with his brother hitachi 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.730
 revived and start working together 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.830
 then it is explained that hitachi was 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.660
 revived with a jutsu and finally dies 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.450
 saying goodbye to his brother in a 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.100
 last scene of the most emotional 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.680
 honestly this death took me 1 or 2 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.260
 tears and finally we get to the number 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.290
 1 to the most annoying death in my opinion 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.170
 the character in question is called the ies 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.360
 of the anime dead not doubt this death 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.700
 It never had to have happened since he 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.980
 was a defender of justice was he 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.840
 intelligent and important of the good and 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.390
 besides, it was funny sometimes 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.760
 also dies murdered by the bad guy 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.310
 anime finally all these characters 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.350
 mentioned already died and I do not think that 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.290
 relive them again in their respective 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.020
 animes with this finished my little criticism 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.270
 about the deaths in the animes I hope 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.430
 who have enjoyed it, comment and 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.430
 subscribe goodbye bayly
