00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.670
 enterprise uses 

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.549
 deep-well water from a 77 deep well 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:06.799
 meters well this class is small 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:08.980
 subject to changes in the composition of the mobile and 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.740
 characterized by high stability 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.889
 Zyryanskaya gifts 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.629
 that's what it is from two artesian wells 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:16.910
 located on the territory 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.269
 enterprises is well 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.220
 he is drilled but actually the question is 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.500
 what exactly did each well 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.910
 is this water quality 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.339
 initially 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.480
 and here is the first question about the second 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.310
 how is it cleaned 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.720
 and how it is served to consumers which 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.650
 pipe which can be made 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.570
 how often do activities for 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.830
 The processing of these pipes is carried out as 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.540
 care for these wells like 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.380
 monitor water quality and here's 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.510
 it is important 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.370
 enterprise laboratory 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.390
 equipped with the latest instruments 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.239
 but no water control at all 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.059
 production stages given the physic style 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.040
 chemical indicators with selection 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.040
 samples seven hundred to a thousand samples per day 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.989
 passes in career 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.420
 occupying manner 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.290
 so 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.480
 before you get directly 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.000
 second fashion passes several degrees 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.050
 cleaning 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.100
 it means she passes the next stage 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.930
 cleaning knows that the water rise on 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.110
 surface passes through mechanical 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.060
 Minsk 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.590
 even know what the 100 division 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.979
 water treatment decreases with stress 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.260
 organizationally calcium and magnesium 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.170
 even means she goes to fifa 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.640
 fine filter carbon filters 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.150
 with a pore size of 10 microns 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.870
 and passes ultraviolet 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.850
 Pechenenko Caballeros radiation 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.780
 decontamination manufacturers 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.230
 bottled water is not used for 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.540
 disinfecting its products its chlorine 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.320
 drugs 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.050
 it is strictly prohibited by law 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.310
 easily detectable by taste and smell 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.650
 even ugliness 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.100
 just her transparency 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.549
 understands his 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.549
 look what nafig in the kettle u man then 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.429
 there is of course scary yellow bloom 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.270
 on the cross here are these pieces of course nothing 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.640
 no good about it got a quality mark 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.289
 lab water enters 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.049
 directly to the bottling plant 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.909
 it is here that small things happen 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:09.520
 miracle 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.290
 in just a few minutes here 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.340
 so little 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.849
 it looks like the floor of a bakara turns into 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.379
 finished product arriving 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.669
 store shelves 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:19.259
 single bed bugs in special 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:21.309
 molding machine 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:24.309
 in front of the bottle 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:31.919
 rectangular bottle is a style 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:33.349
 company peculiar 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.890
 company business card 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.810
 the form is patented 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.840
 or five-liter bottles pressed out 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.359
 Company name 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.279
 getting a corporate logo tara 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:43.639
 sent for bottling 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.669
 naturally first flushing 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:48.429
 and the bottle is filled with clean drinking water 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:50.790
 this process does not stop 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.390
 online on each bottle 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.390
 spill date and time supplied 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.229
 a few more manipulations and now 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.770
 the buzz 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.770
 and commodity markets 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.969
 at the turn of 2007 2008, enterprises survived 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:11.059
 new stage of reorganization 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:12.939
 a large finished warehouse was commissioned 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:13.960
 products 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.479
 connect two buildings transport galleries 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:18.039
 they put the conveyor on 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:20.249
 which purchases with water automatically 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:21.829
 moved to the warehouse 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.139
 thanks technical but 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.099
 removal has the opportunity to store 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:26.919
 water supply for three days 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.099
 The main consumers of water are Moscow and 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.359
 Moscow region but the company has 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:32.929
 regional offices 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:34.209
 distribution geography 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.499
 production has already reached Sakhalin 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:38.449
 district authorities met and 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.129
 provided enterprises 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.169
 additionally plot of land on 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:43.619
 which were built new 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:45.189
 enclosures and warehouse 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.690
 the holding is continuously growing and developing 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.200
 so at the end of 2007 production started 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.629
 child repel fairy forest 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.299
 it's a big responsibility so 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.319
 like baby water 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.079
 very high demands 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:58.969
 of course untrained 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.099
 consumer question is a 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.419
 why actually buy water 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.779
 her in the koran is enough but if 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.179
 consider that 80 percent 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:09.459
 human diseases directly or indirectly 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.239
 related to the quality of water consumed 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.229
 but before the full glass floors 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.439
 faces of moisture would be nice to think 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:18.729
 how useful is the product that you are 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.989
 consume
