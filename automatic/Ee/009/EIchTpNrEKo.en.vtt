this is not rifle from belleville the

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.530 
this is not rifle from belleville the
tree<00:00:31.750> where<00:00:32.529> it<00:00:32.680> is<00:00:32.829> the<00:00:33.340> high<00:00:33.790> damage<00:00:34.120> sniper

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.250 
tree where it is the high damage sniper
rifle<00:00:34.930> and<00:00:36.239> when<00:00:37.239> you<00:00:37.360> look<00:00:37.390> at<00:00:37.750> who<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:38.020> steps

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
rifle and when you look at who the steps

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.090 
rifle and when you look at who the steps
you<00:00:38.530> will<00:00:39.250> see<00:00:39.550> that<00:00:39.760> this<00:00:40.059> sniper<00:00:40.300> rifle<00:00:40.750> is

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
you will see that this sniper rifle is

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.270 
you will see that this sniper rifle is
very<00:00:42.100> similar<00:00:42.399> to<00:00:42.610> the<00:00:42.880> m95<00:00:43.649> all<00:00:44.649> damage

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
very similar to the m95 all damage

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.490 
very similar to the m95 all damage
bullet<00:00:45.790> drop<00:00:46.000> and<00:00:46.420> bullet<00:00:46.870> velocity<00:00:46.960> and

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
bullet drop and bullet velocity and

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.740 
bullet drop and bullet velocity and
total<00:00:47.890> range<00:00:48.160> is<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:48.820> same<00:00:49.030> on<00:00:49.300> these<00:00:49.570> two

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
total range is the same on these two

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.729 
total range is the same on these two
small<00:00:49.989> profits<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:52.570> probably<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.530> biggest

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
small profits the probably the biggest

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.290 
small profits the probably the biggest
differences<00:00:54.309> between<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:56.140> m95<00:00:56.649> and<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.250> m<00:00:57.460> 98

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
differences between the m95 and the m 98

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.830 
differences between the m95 and the m 98
Bravo<00:00:58.750> is<00:00:59.050> that<00:00:59.770> the<00:01:00.100> m<00:01:00.190> 98<00:01:00.430> Bravo<00:01:01.210> is<00:01:01.539> firing

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
Bravo is that the m 98 Bravo is firing

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.660 
Bravo is that the m 98 Bravo is firing
some<00:01:02.500> faster<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:04.360> rate<00:01:04.479> of<00:01:04.540> fire<00:01:04.809> of<00:01:04.839> the<00:01:05.110> m95

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
some faster the rate of fire of the m95

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.890 
some faster the rate of fire of the m95
is<00:01:06.670> a<00:01:06.729> 21<00:01:07.690> rounds<00:01:07.990> per<00:01:08.650> minute<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.510> m<00:01:10.600> 98

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
is a 21 rounds per minute and the m 98

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.899 
is a 21 rounds per minute and the m 98
got<00:01:11.880> 24<00:01:12.880> rounds<00:01:13.270> per<00:01:13.420> minute<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.700> is<00:01:15.790> not

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
got 24 rounds per minute and this is not

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.090 
got 24 rounds per minute and this is not
much<00:01:16.210> faster<00:01:16.659> but<00:01:16.810> it's<00:01:17.320> a<00:01:17.409> little<00:01:17.590> bit<00:01:17.710> faster

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.630 

the<00:01:21.100> l<00:01:21.250> 96<00:01:22.030> is<00:01:22.479> firing<00:01:23.070> 47<00:01:24.070> rounds<00:01:24.400> per<00:01:24.549> minute

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
the l 96 is firing 47 rounds per minute

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.969 
the l 96 is firing 47 rounds per minute
so<00:01:24.970> you<00:01:25.869> probably<00:01:26.170> see<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.530> differences

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
so you probably see the differences

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.330 
so you probably see the differences
there<00:01:27.689> at<00:01:28.689> the<00:01:28.869> side<00:01:29.200> magazine<00:01:29.680> size<00:01:29.890> it<00:01:30.280> is

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
there at the side magazine size it is

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.870 
there at the side magazine size it is
also<00:01:30.610> better<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.840> m95<00:01:32.290> got<00:01:33.100> four<00:01:33.369> rounds<00:01:33.729> in

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
also better the m95 got four rounds in

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.100 
also better the m95 got four rounds in
each<00:01:34.030> each<00:01:34.330> mag<00:01:34.600> what<00:01:35.590> did<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:35.979> m<00:01:36.100> 98<00:01:36.610> 98<00:01:37.450> got

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
each each mag what did the m 98 98 got

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.149 
each each mag what did the m 98 98 got
six<00:01:38.619> per<00:01:39.130> mag<00:01:39.369> which<00:01:40.360> is<00:01:40.630> most<00:01:41.530> of<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:41.830> slow

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
six per mag which is most of the slow

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.679 
six per mag which is most of the slow
firing<00:01:42.700> smart<00:01:42.970> rifles<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:45.790> also<00:01:45.939> got<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.479> same

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
firing smart rifles it also got the same

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.859 
firing smart rifles it also got the same
reloading<00:01:47.140> time<00:01:47.170> as<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:48.040> m95<00:01:48.549> it<00:01:49.540> all<00:01:49.720> so

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
reloading time as the m95 it all so

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.990 
reloading time as the m95 it all so
surreal<00:01:50.079> loading<00:01:50.590> some<00:01:50.829> faster<00:01:51.340> than<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.579> m95

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
surreal loading some faster than the m95

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.539 
surreal loading some faster than the m95
but<00:01:52.780> there<00:01:52.930> is<00:01:53.020> no<00:01:53.170> no<00:01:53.799> much<00:01:54.009> difference<00:01:54.040> is

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
but there is no no much difference is

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.359 
but there is no no much difference is
between<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:55.030> reloading<00:01:55.240> time<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.920> also<00:01:57.100> got

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
between the reloading time it also got

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.210 
between the reloading time it also got
less<00:01:57.549> recoil<00:01:57.729> but<00:01:58.390> you<00:01:58.659> know<00:01:58.829> recoil<00:01:59.829> doesn't

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
less recoil but you know recoil doesn't

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.399 
less recoil but you know recoil doesn't
really<00:02:00.369> matter<00:02:00.700> for<00:02:00.850> both<00:02:01.329> action<00:02:01.810> sniper

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
can equip it with a the ballistic or the

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.330 
can equip it with a the ballistic or the
desert<00:03:47.610> then<00:03:48.610> but<00:03:49.540> this<00:03:49.630> is<00:03:49.810> all<00:03:50.049> tall<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:50.590> think
