not my natural language so yeah and no
one<00:04:02.810> is<00:04:02.930> perfect<00:04:04.209> so<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:06.410> game<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:07.040> think<00:04:07.730> you

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
one is perfect so the game I think you

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.559 
one is perfect so the game I think you
can<00:04:08.180> check<00:04:08.840> it's<00:04:09.109> realistic<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.910> maps<00:04:11.150> are

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
can check it's realistic the maps are

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.020 
can check it's realistic the maps are
only<00:04:12.440> two<00:04:12.859> because<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.190> line<00:04:13.430> in<00:04:13.609> the<00:04:13.700> game<00:04:13.849> as

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
only two because the line in the game as

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.719 
only two because the line in the game as
i<00:04:14.180> said<00:04:14.480> was<00:04:15.139> launched<00:04:15.560> today<00:04:15.709> so<00:04:16.180> but<00:04:17.829> i<00:04:18.829> think
