00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
got a little challenge I think with our

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.980 
got a little challenge I think with our
pressure<00:01:59.640> relief<00:02:00.000> valve<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.450> don't<00:02:00.630> think<00:02:00.810> it's

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
pressure relief valve I don't think it's

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.840 
pressure relief valve I don't think it's
functioning<00:02:01.500> quite<00:02:01.620> correct<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.580> know<00:02:02.700> we've

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
functioning quite correct you know we've

functioning quite correct you know we've
got<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.030> all<00:02:03.180> together<00:02:03.360> it's<00:02:03.750> working<00:02:04.170> still<00:02:04.800> a

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
got it all together it's working still a

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.230 
got it all together it's working still a
little<00:02:04.979> bit<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.220> work<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.550> think<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.850> do<00:02:05.970> on<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
little bit of work I think to do on the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.790 
little bit of work I think to do on the
booms<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.720> on<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> hinge<00:02:07.200> points<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
booms and on the hinge points and the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.760 
booms and on the hinge points and the
breakaways<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.910> outside<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.649> you<00:02:10.649> know

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
breakaways but outside of that you know

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.340 
breakaways but outside of that you know
for<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> few<00:02:11.250> hundred<00:02:11.400> bucks<00:02:11.640> we've<00:02:11.940> got<00:02:12.060> a

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
as our plumbing goes anyway so got the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
part that's always a question is how

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.870

much money should you put into something
versus<00:02:24.600> buying<00:02:24.989> something<00:02:25.350> new<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:25.950> guess

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
versus buying something new and I guess

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.550 
versus buying something new and I guess
you<00:02:26.550> know<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:27.150> right<00:02:27.360> parts<00:02:27.750> are<00:02:27.900> new<00:02:28.080> it

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
you know the right parts are new it

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.710 
you know the right parts are new it
works<00:02:28.739> out<00:02:28.920> all<00:02:29.040> right<00:02:29.190> yeah<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:29.580> guess<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.360> can

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
works out all right yeah I guess you can

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.420 
works out all right yeah I guess you can
price<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:30.959> out<00:02:31.260> again<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.709> think<00:02:31.830> we<00:02:32.190> probably

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
price it out again I think we probably

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.620 
price it out again I think we probably
got<00:02:32.640> about<00:02:32.670> four<00:02:33.060> or<00:02:33.150> five<00:02:33.300> hundred<00:02:33.330> dollars

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
got about four or five hundred dollars

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.199 
got about four or five hundred dollars
in<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.260> that's<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.760> know<00:02:35.850> we<00:02:36.000> bought<00:02:36.180> a

in this that's the you know we bought a

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.180 
in this that's the you know we bought a
pump<00:02:36.540> we<00:02:37.080> bought<00:02:37.290> all<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.739> plumbing

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
pump we bought all the plumbing

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.340 
pump we bought all the plumbing
accessories<00:02:38.880> so<00:02:39.330> sissy<00:02:39.660> everything<00:02:40.230> that

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
accessories so sissy everything that

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.150 
accessories so sissy everything that
holds<00:02:40.590> water

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
holds water

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.630 
holds water
besides<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.940> tank<00:02:42.209> is<00:02:42.480> new<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:44.010> it's<00:02:44.430> a

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
besides the tank is new and and it's a

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.759 
besides the tank is new and and it's a
real<00:02:44.970> high<00:02:45.120> quality<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:46.019> it<00:02:46.170> will<00:02:46.260> last<00:02:46.410> for<00:02:46.739> a

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
real high quality so it will last for a

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.680 
real high quality so it will last for a
long<00:02:46.800> time<00:02:47.220> right<00:02:47.519> all<00:02:47.910> right<00:02:48.239> well<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.540> guess

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
long time right all right well I guess

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.270 
long time right all right well I guess
let's<00:02:49.140> go<00:02:49.350> check<00:02:49.530> out<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.680> pressure<00:02:49.980> belt

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
let's go check out that pressure belt

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:58.750 
let's go check out that pressure belt
all<00:02:50.640> right<00:02:50.820> okay<00:02:51.360> thank<00:02:51.870> you

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.679 

well<00:02:59.760> it's<00:02:59.879> that<00:02:59.939> time<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.150> year<00:03:00.269> we<00:03:00.450> starting

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
well it's that time of year we starting

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.179 
well it's that time of year we starting
to<00:03:00.750> see<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> lot<00:03:01.079> of<00:03:01.110> weeds<00:03:01.409> out<00:03:01.590> in<00:03:01.709> our<00:03:01.799> fields

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
to see a lot of weeds out in our fields

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.970 
to see a lot of weeds out in our fields
Joe<00:03:02.540> let's<00:03:03.540> just<00:03:03.810> say<00:03:03.959> we<00:03:04.140> have<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.620> sprayer

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
Joe let's just say we have a sprayer

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.410 
Joe let's just say we have a sprayer
we've<00:03:05.220> built<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.579> sprayer<00:03:05.790> we<00:03:05.970> bought<00:03:06.209> one

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
we've built a sprayer we bought one

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.259 
we've built a sprayer we bought one
recently<00:03:07.220> go<00:03:08.220> back<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:08.640> beginning<00:03:08.790> and

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
recently go back to the beginning and

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.660 
recently go back to the beginning and
what<00:03:09.780> do<00:03:09.870> we<00:03:09.989> need<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.349> know<00:03:10.530> about<00:03:10.829> operating

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
what do we need to know about operating

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.520 
what do we need to know about operating
this<00:03:11.819> thing<00:03:12.090> out<00:03:12.450> in<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.629> field<00:03:12.810> well<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.170> think

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
this thing out in the field well I think

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.289 
this thing out in the field well I think
the<00:03:13.860> very<00:03:14.099> most<00:03:14.489> important<00:03:14.939> thing<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.269> need

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
the very most important thing you need

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.390 
the very most important thing you need
to<00:03:15.540> do<00:03:15.659> is<00:03:15.840> calibrate<00:03:16.290> your<00:03:16.379> sprayer<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.340> you

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
to do is calibrate your sprayer so you

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.369 
to do is calibrate your sprayer so you
need<00:03:17.549> to<00:03:17.640> know<00:03:17.700> how<00:03:17.939> much<00:03:18.290> product<00:03:19.290> you're

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
need to know how much product you're

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.589 
need to know how much product you're
going<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.560> be<00:03:19.620> putting<00:03:19.829> out<00:03:19.950> per<00:03:20.250> nozzle

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
going to be putting out per nozzle

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.030 
going to be putting out per nozzle
across<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.720> entire<00:03:21.959> boom<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:22.739> that<00:03:22.890> way

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
across the entire boom so that way

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.770 
across the entire boom so that way
you're<00:03:23.220> not<00:03:23.250> applying<00:03:23.849> too<00:03:24.090> little<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.599> not

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
you're not applying too little and not

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.229 
you're not applying too little and not
getting<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.079> activity<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.620> want<00:03:25.769> and

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
getting the activity you want and

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.160 
getting the activity you want and
basically<00:03:27.239> wasting<00:03:27.659> your<00:03:27.780> time<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:27.959> money

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
basically wasting your time and money

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.649 
basically wasting your time and money
there<00:03:28.439> or<00:03:28.950> applying<00:03:29.220> too<00:03:29.430> much<00:03:29.640> and<00:03:30.180> again

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
there or applying too much and again

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.440 
there or applying too much and again
wasting<00:03:31.349> product<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:32.549> probably<00:03:33.150> causing

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
wasting product and probably causing

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.300 
wasting product and probably causing
injury<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.930> whatever<00:03:34.079> crop<00:03:34.409> or<00:03:34.739> pasture

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
injury to whatever crop or pasture

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.220 
injury to whatever crop or pasture
wherever<00:03:35.700> you're<00:03:36.150> trying<00:03:36.389> to<00:03:36.629> control<00:03:37.049> weeds

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
wherever you're trying to control weeds

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.750 
wherever you're trying to control weeds
it<00:03:37.440> okay<00:03:37.859> how<00:03:38.280> are<00:03:38.310> we<00:03:38.430> going<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.639> go<00:03:38.730> about

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
it okay how are we going to go about

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.210 
it okay how are we going to go about
doing<00:03:38.940> this<00:03:39.359> well<00:03:39.690> kind<00:03:40.409> of<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.530> old<00:03:40.680> standby

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
doing this well kind of the old standby

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.679 
doing this well kind of the old standby
the<00:03:41.250> old<00:03:41.489> traditional<00:03:41.879> way<00:03:42.030> for<00:03:42.269> calibrating

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:42.689 
the old traditional way for calibrating

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.949 
the old traditional way for calibrating
a<00:03:42.720> sprayer<00:03:43.079> is<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:44.040> calculate<00:03:44.909> the<00:03:45.510> gallons

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
a sprayer is to calculate the gallons

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.440 
a sprayer is to calculate the gallons
per<00:03:46.170> minute<00:03:46.530> per<00:03:46.980> nozzle<00:03:47.220> there's<00:03:47.909> a<00:03:47.970> formula

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
per minute per nozzle there's a formula

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.559 
per minute per nozzle there's a formula
you<00:03:48.659> use<00:03:48.689> where<00:03:49.079> you<00:03:49.109> take<00:03:49.439> your<00:03:50.569> desired

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
you use where you take your desired

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.379 
you use where you take your desired
gallons<00:03:51.989> per<00:03:52.170> acre<00:03:52.200> total<00:03:53.189> output<00:03:53.389> multiply

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
gallons per acre total output multiply

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.259 
gallons per acre total output multiply
that<00:03:54.510> by<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.720> width<00:03:55.049> of<00:03:55.260> each<00:03:55.829> nozzle<00:03:56.269> usually

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
that by the width of each nozzle usually

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.599 
that by the width of each nozzle usually
it's<00:03:57.389> 19<00:03:57.959> or<00:03:58.139> 20<00:03:58.409> inches<00:03:58.680> okay<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.220> multiply

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
it's 19 or 20 inches okay and multiply

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.520 
it's 19 or 20 inches okay and multiply
that<00:03:59.760> by<00:03:59.819> your<00:04:00.090> speed<00:04:00.510> in<00:04:00.689> miles<00:04:01.109> per<00:04:01.260> hour

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
that by your speed in miles per hour

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.439 
that by your speed in miles per hour
okay<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.519> then<00:04:02.639> you<00:04:02.760> divide<00:04:03.060> all<00:04:03.090> that<00:04:03.389> by

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
okay and then you divide all that by

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.379 
okay and then you divide all that by
this<00:04:03.629> constant<00:04:04.280> 59:40<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.489> that'll<00:04:06.120> give<00:04:06.269> you

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
this constant 59:40 and that'll give you

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.289 
this constant 59:40 and that'll give you
a<00:04:06.449> decimal<00:04:07.069> usually<00:04:08.069> point<00:04:08.459> one<00:04:08.699> point<00:04:09.150> two

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
a decimal usually point one point two

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.699 
a decimal usually point one point two
point<00:04:09.480> three<00:04:09.690> right<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.199> that's<00:04:10.349> your<00:04:10.500> your

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
point three right and that's your your

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.220 
point three right and that's your your
gallons<00:04:11.190> per<00:04:11.430> minute<00:04:11.730> per<00:04:12.030> nozzle<00:04:12.239> okay<00:04:13.049> so

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
gallons per minute per nozzle okay so

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.689 
gallons per minute per nozzle okay so
then<00:04:13.379> the<00:04:13.470> next<00:04:13.709> step<00:04:13.859> is<00:04:14.010> go<00:04:14.250> out<00:04:14.370> there<00:04:14.430> and

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
then the next step is go out there and

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.279 
then the next step is go out there and
turn<00:04:14.970> on<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.299> turn<00:04:15.659> on<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.870> sprayer<00:04:16.139> and

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
turn on the turn on the sprayer and

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.610 
turn on the turn on the sprayer and
collect<00:04:16.949> from<00:04:17.820> each<00:04:18.000> nozzle<00:04:18.329> tip<00:04:18.720> for<00:04:19.139> a<00:04:19.169> set

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
collect from each nozzle tip for a set

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.890 
collect from each nozzle tip for a set
amount<00:04:19.739> of<00:04:19.889> time<00:04:19.979> and<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:20.970> can<00:04:21.090> kind<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:21.750> back

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
amount of time and you can kind of back

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.300 
amount of time and you can kind of back
calculate<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:22.620> figure<00:04:22.800> out<00:04:22.830> how<00:04:23.039> much<00:04:23.190> you

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
calculate and figure out how much you

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.310 
calculate and figure out how much you
need<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.580> collect<00:04:23.909> there<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.599> equal<00:04:25.169> that

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
need to collect there to equal that

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.469 
need to collect there to equal that
gallons<00:04:25.919> per<00:04:26.159> minute<00:04:26.340> per<00:04:26.639> nozzle<00:04:26.789> okay

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
gallons per minute per nozzle okay

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.480 
gallons per minute per nozzle okay
another<00:04:27.870> way<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.080> do<00:04:28.260> it<00:04:28.349> is<00:04:28.500> use<00:04:28.710> this<00:04:28.889> a

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
another way to do it is use this a

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.210 
another way to do it is use this a
little<00:04:29.970> spot<00:04:30.240> on<00:04:30.270> sprayer<00:04:30.960> calibrator<00:04:31.560> and

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
little spot on sprayer calibrator and

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.890 
little spot on sprayer calibrator and
basically<00:04:32.699> you<00:04:33.030> just<00:04:33.060> hold<00:04:33.389> this<00:04:33.539> underneath

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
basically you just hold this underneath

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.439 
basically you just hold this underneath
the<00:04:34.289> the<00:04:34.740> nozzle<00:04:35.099> tip<00:04:35.280> it'll<00:04:35.699> fill<00:04:35.970> with<00:04:36.150> water

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
the the nozzle tip it'll fill with water

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.149 
the the nozzle tip it'll fill with water
and<00:04:36.690> there's<00:04:37.349> a<00:04:37.380> little<00:04:37.530> electrodes<00:04:37.949> in<00:04:38.039> there

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.159 
and there's a little electrodes in there

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.640 
and there's a little electrodes in there
that<00:04:38.520> sense<00:04:38.849> as<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.720> water<00:04:39.930> is<00:04:40.020> filling<00:04:40.380> and

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
that sense as the water is filling and

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.750 
that sense as the water is filling and
then<00:04:40.740> it'll<00:04:40.889> tell<00:04:41.099> you<00:04:41.159> right<00:04:41.310> on<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.490> screen

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
then it'll tell you right on the screen

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.000 
then it'll tell you right on the screen
here<00:04:41.909> your<00:04:42.270> gallons<00:04:42.599> per<00:04:42.810> minute<00:04:42.960> well<00:04:43.740> this

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
here your gallons per minute well this

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.250 
here your gallons per minute well this
is<00:04:44.159> a<00:04:44.400> little<00:04:44.940> simpler<00:04:45.240> way<00:04:45.419> yeah<00:04:45.840> kind<00:04:46.110> of<00:04:46.139> an

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
is a little simpler way yeah kind of an

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.409 
is a little simpler way yeah kind of an
expensive<00:04:46.710> tool<00:04:46.860> but<00:04:47.159> but<00:04:47.669> does<00:04:48.060> make<00:04:48.300> it<00:04:48.389> a

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
expensive tool but but does make it a

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:49.430 
expensive tool but but does make it a
little<00:04:48.479> bit<00:04:48.659> easier<00:04:48.900> than<00:04:48.960> doing<00:04:49.229> all<00:04:49.320> the

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
little bit easier than doing all the

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.640 
little bit easier than doing all the
calculations<00:04:50.039> and<00:04:50.490> really<00:04:50.729> fast<00:04:50.940> yes<00:04:51.620> okay<00:04:52.620> so

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
calculations and really fast yes okay so

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.420 
calculations and really fast yes okay so
we've<00:04:53.130> got<00:04:53.510> our<00:04:54.510> sprayer<00:04:55.380> calibrated<00:04:56.130> we<00:04:56.250> know

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
we've got our sprayer calibrated we know

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.879 
we've got our sprayer calibrated we know
it's<00:04:56.729> putting<00:04:57.060> out<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.330> right<00:04:57.479> amount<00:04:57.889> when

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
it's putting out the right amount when

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.770 
it's putting out the right amount when
we<00:04:59.039> start<00:04:59.250> mixing<00:04:59.430> things<00:04:59.789> inside<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.330> tank

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
we start mixing things inside the tank

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.200 
we start mixing things inside the tank
there's<00:05:01.560> a<00:05:01.639> process<00:05:02.639> in<00:05:02.789> a<00:05:02.820> way<00:05:02.880> that<00:05:02.970> that

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
there's a process in a way that that

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.760 
there's a process in a way that that
needs<00:05:03.389> to<00:05:03.479> be<00:05:03.570> done<00:05:03.720> yep<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:04.349> need<00:05:04.470> to<00:05:04.620> put

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
needs to be done yep you need to put

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.070 
needs to be done yep you need to put
things<00:05:04.979> in<00:05:05.190> in<00:05:05.370> the<00:05:05.430> right<00:05:05.580> order

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
things in in the right order

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.740 
things in in the right order
there's<00:05:07.080> an<00:05:07.260> old<00:05:07.380> acronym<00:05:07.800> whales<00:05:08.810> wal<00:05:09.810> ES<00:05:10.169> or

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
Dale's the first one wrd it would be

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.640 
Dale's the first one wrd it would be
your<00:05:14.110> wedding

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
your wedding

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.220 
your wedding
or<00:05:15.130> your<00:05:15.280> dry<00:05:15.550> flowable<00:05:15.880> put<00:05:16.750> those<00:05:16.900> into<00:05:17.140> the

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
or your dry flowable put those into the

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.700 
or your dry flowable put those into the
tank<00:05:17.530> first<00:05:17.830> then<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.670> a<00:05:18.700> is<00:05:19.120> for<00:05:19.150> agitation

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
tank first then the a is for agitation

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.230 
tank first then the a is for agitation
so<00:05:20.710> get<00:05:20.860> those<00:05:21.040> mixed<00:05:21.280> up<00:05:21.520> sometimes<00:05:21.820> you<00:05:22.090> can

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
so get those mixed up sometimes you can

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.360 
so get those mixed up sometimes you can
put<00:05:22.450> those<00:05:22.570> into<00:05:22.780> a<00:05:22.840> slurry<00:05:23.230> or<00:05:24.010> you'll<00:05:24.220> put

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
put those into a slurry or you'll put

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.860 
put those into a slurry or you'll put
those<00:05:24.520> in<00:05:24.700> a<00:05:24.940> little<00:05:25.090> bit<00:05:25.240> of<00:05:25.390> water

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
those in a little bit of water

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.780 
those in a little bit of water
get<00:05:26.500> those<00:05:26.650> dissolved<00:05:27.130> mixed<00:05:27.430> in<00:05:27.520> and<00:05:27.670> then

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
get those dissolved mixed in and then

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.150 
get those dissolved mixed in and then
add<00:05:28.000> that<00:05:28.210> mixture<00:05:28.630> to<00:05:28.990> the<00:05:29.020> tank<00:05:29.350> okay<00:05:29.920> L<00:05:30.100> is

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
add that mixture to the tank okay L is

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.400 
add that mixture to the tank okay L is
for<00:05:30.430> liquids<00:05:31.030> that'd<00:05:31.630> be<00:05:31.750> your<00:05:31.840> next<00:05:32.170> thing<00:05:32.290> to

the<00:05:50.740> last<00:05:50.919> one<00:05:51.130> is<00:05:51.280> for<00:05:51.520> surfactants<00:05:52.390> so<00:05:52.960> your

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
the last one is for surfactants so your

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.260 
the last one is for surfactants so your
non<00:05:53.350> ionic<00:05:53.620> surfactants<00:05:54.520> your<00:05:54.669> methylated

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
non ionic surfactants your methylated

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.720 
non ionic surfactants your methylated
seed<00:05:55.510> oils<00:05:55.840> any<00:05:56.380> additive<00:05:57.010> that<00:05:57.280> you'll<00:05:57.520> put

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
seed oils any additive that you'll put

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.550 
seed oils any additive that you'll put
in<00:05:57.850> there<00:05:58.090> to<00:05:58.780> make<00:05:58.870> the<00:05:58.990> herbicide<00:05:59.380> work

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
in there to make the herbicide work

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.560 
in there to make the herbicide work
better<00:05:59.890> okay<00:06:00.430> and<00:06:00.730> you're<00:06:00.940> not<00:06:00.970> necessarily

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
better okay and you're not necessarily

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.330 
better okay and you're not necessarily
going<00:06:01.690> to<00:06:01.780> use<00:06:01.990> all<00:06:02.230> of<00:06:02.410> those<00:06:02.560> every<00:06:03.040> time<00:06:03.070> you

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
going to use all of those every time you

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.740 
going to use all of those every time you
go<00:06:03.430> out<00:06:03.520> and<00:06:03.669> spray<00:06:03.850> them<00:06:04.060> no<00:06:04.270> sometimes

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
go out and spray them no sometimes

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.470 
go out and spray them no sometimes
you'll<00:06:04.930> just<00:06:04.960> use<00:06:05.430> maybe<00:06:06.430> one<00:06:06.669> herbicide<00:06:07.150> and

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
you'll just use maybe one herbicide and

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.880 
you'll just use maybe one herbicide and
a<00:06:07.600> surfactant<00:06:07.900> you<00:06:08.320> know<00:06:08.440> if<00:06:08.590> you're<00:06:08.710> using

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
a surfactant you know if you're using

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.250 
a surfactant you know if you're using
glyphosate<00:06:09.760> or<00:06:09.790> roundup<00:06:09.970> a<00:06:10.480> lot<00:06:10.840> of<00:06:10.900> times<00:06:11.080> all

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
glyphosate or roundup a lot of times all

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.200 
glyphosate or roundup a lot of times all
you're<00:06:11.440> going<00:06:11.590> to<00:06:11.680> use<00:06:11.980> would<00:06:12.550> be<00:06:12.580> ammonium

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
you're going to use would be ammonium

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.060 
you're going to use would be ammonium
sulfate<00:06:13.690> and<00:06:13.870> you'd<00:06:14.260> always<00:06:14.410> add<00:06:14.650> that<00:06:14.680> to<00:06:14.979> the

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
sulfate and you'd always add that to the

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.940 
sulfate and you'd always add that to the
tank<00:06:15.280> first<00:06:15.640> to<00:06:16.240> condition<00:06:16.690> the<00:06:16.780> water<00:06:17.050> and

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
tank first to condition the water and

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.340 
tank first to condition the water and
then<00:06:18.130> your<00:06:18.490> glyphosate<00:06:19.000> product<00:06:19.810> or<00:06:19.960> whatever

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
then your glyphosate product or whatever

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.510 
then your glyphosate product or whatever
other<00:06:20.470> herbicide<00:06:20.890> you're<00:06:20.979> going<00:06:21.100> to<00:06:21.160> use<00:06:21.310> and

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
other herbicide you're going to use and

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.030 
other herbicide you're going to use and
then<00:06:21.970> surfactant<00:06:22.900> there<00:06:23.050> at<00:06:23.140> the<00:06:23.260> end<00:06:23.410> okay<00:06:23.979> so

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
then surfactant there at the end okay so

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.880 
then surfactant there at the end okay so
it's<00:06:24.610> just<00:06:24.880> a<00:06:25.330> step<00:06:25.930> by<00:06:26.080> step<00:06:26.110> process<00:06:26.500> or

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
it's just a step by step process or

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:27.719 
it's just a step by step process or
whenever<00:06:27.100> you're<00:06:27.190> going<00:06:27.310> to<00:06:27.370> be<00:06:27.430> putting

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
those yeah and when you start adding in

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.530 
those yeah and when you start adding in
liquid<00:06:30.340> fertilizer<00:06:30.880> in<00:06:31.150> twenty<00:06:31.450> eight

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
percent or something you need to be very

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.310 
percent or something you need to be very
careful<00:06:33.520> that<00:06:33.729> the<00:06:34.000> herbicide<00:06:34.479> is<00:06:34.750> compatible

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
with that fertilizer mixture you can't

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.420 
with that fertilizer mixture you can't
run<00:06:37.240> into<00:06:37.390> problems<00:06:37.720> where<00:06:37.870> you'll<00:06:38.070> gel<00:06:39.070> up<00:06:39.250> in

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
run into problems where you'll gel up in

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.159 
run into problems where you'll gel up in
the<00:06:39.490> tank<00:06:39.760> and<00:06:39.940> won't<00:06:40.090> get<00:06:40.300> any<00:06:40.690> spray<00:06:41.020> out

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:41.169 
the tank and won't get any spray out

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:43.020 
the tank and won't get any spray out
won't<00:06:41.410> get<00:06:41.560> anything<00:06:41.800> out<00:06:42.070> of<00:06:42.130> it<00:06:42.280> I<00:06:42.550> guess<00:06:42.940> the

won't get anything out of it I guess the

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.210 
won't get anything out of it I guess the
last<00:06:43.180> thing<00:06:43.300> is<00:06:43.570> putting<00:06:44.110> it<00:06:44.290> down<00:06:44.470> and<00:06:44.800> when

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
last thing is putting it down and when

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.100 
last thing is putting it down and when
you<00:06:45.340> take<00:06:45.729> it<00:06:45.820> out<00:06:45.940> there<00:06:46.180> speed

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
you take it out there speed

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.900 
you take it out there speed
recommendations<00:06:47.860> how<00:06:48.010> fast<00:06:48.250> you<00:06:48.400> go<00:06:48.520> how<00:06:48.729> slow

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:48.910 
recommendations how fast you go how slow

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.730 
recommendations how fast you go how slow
you<00:06:48.970> go<00:06:49.180> well<00:06:49.510> it<00:06:49.840> all<00:06:50.110> depends<00:06:50.410> on<00:06:50.530> how<00:06:50.650> much

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
you go well it all depends on how much

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.740 
you go well it all depends on how much
you<00:06:50.860> want<00:06:51.010> to<00:06:51.070> put<00:06:51.190> out<00:06:51.419> obviously<00:06:52.419> that<00:06:52.630> the

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
you want to put out obviously that the

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.960 
you want to put out obviously that the
faster<00:06:53.260> you<00:06:53.410> go<00:06:53.560> out<00:06:53.770> or<00:06:54.460> the<00:06:54.610> faster<00:06:54.880> you

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
faster you go out or the faster you

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.610 
faster you go out or the faster you
travel<00:06:55.330> the<00:06:55.419> more<00:06:55.600> you<00:06:55.780> need<00:06:55.900> to<00:06:55.960> put<00:06:56.200> out<00:06:56.380> at<00:06:56.560> a

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 
travel the more you need to put out at a

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.100 
travel the more you need to put out at a

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110 
time you know depending on your sprayer

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.719 
time you know depending on your sprayer
size<00:06:59.410> and<00:06:59.740> how<00:06:59.830> much<00:07:00.010> ground<00:07:00.280> you<00:07:00.490> need<00:07:00.610> to

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:00.729 
size and how much ground you need to

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:02.090 
size and how much ground you need to
cover<00:07:00.910> that<00:07:01.030> will<00:07:01.240> determine<00:07:01.540> a<00:07:01.690> lot<00:07:01.840> of<00:07:01.930> that

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
cover that will determine a lot of that

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.260 
cover that will determine a lot of that
really<00:07:03.100> the<00:07:03.340> output<00:07:03.790> is<00:07:03.880> probably<00:07:04.120> the<00:07:04.210> most

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270 
really the output is probably the most

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.480 
really the output is probably the most
important<00:07:04.780> thing<00:07:04.810> or<00:07:05.140> gallons<00:07:05.440> per<00:07:05.650> acre<00:07:05.680> okay

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
important thing or gallons per acre okay

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.210 
important thing or gallons per acre okay
and<00:07:06.820> that<00:07:06.970> has<00:07:07.090> a<00:07:07.120> lot<00:07:07.270> to<00:07:07.300> do<00:07:07.450> with<00:07:07.540> coverage

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
and that has a lot to do with coverage

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.800 
and that has a lot to do with coverage
if<00:07:09.220> you're<00:07:09.520> trying<00:07:09.790> to<00:07:10.030> get<00:07:10.120> very<00:07:10.660> good

coverage especially with things like

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.090 
coverage especially with things like

per<00:07:15.250> acre<00:07:15.310> it's<00:07:15.580> gonna<00:07:15.729> be<00:07:15.820> bad

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830 
per acre it's gonna be bad

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.590 
per acre it's gonna be bad
sometimes<00:07:17.700> you<00:07:17.790> get<00:07:17.940> away<00:07:18.030> with<00:07:18.210> very<00:07:18.390> low

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600
