00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
take that out so especially when you

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.990 
take that out so especially when you
have<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.470> swarm<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.040> dogs<00:03:05.250> all<00:03:05.550> at<00:03:05.790> once

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
it works out very well and on a map like

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.800 
it works out very well and on a map like
raid<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.310> can<00:03:08.459> play<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.670> very<00:03:08.790> well<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.360> the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
raid you can play it very well and the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.350 
raid you can play it very well and the
swarm<00:03:10.110> is<00:03:10.290> just<00:03:10.470> going<00:03:10.620> complete<00:03:11.069> ham<00:03:11.340> but<00:03:11.970> the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
swarm is just going complete ham but the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.850 
swarm is just going complete ham but the
disadvantage<00:03:12.600> is<00:03:12.989> for<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.319> lodestone<00:03:13.739> the

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
disadvantage is for the lodestone the

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.530 
disadvantage is for the lodestone the
maps<00:03:14.040> warm<00:03:14.340> if<00:03:14.489> you're<00:03:14.640> getting<00:03:14.760> them<00:03:15.000> in<00:03:15.180> the

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
maps warm if you're getting them in the

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.660 
maps warm if you're getting them in the
tree<00:03:15.750> spawns<00:03:16.050> it's<00:03:16.440> not<00:03:16.800> really<00:03:17.069> too<00:03:17.220> good<00:03:17.430> but

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
tree spawns it's not really too good but

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.520 
tree spawns it's not really too good but
you're<00:03:17.940> still<00:03:18.570> able<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.840> pick<00:03:18.989> up<00:03:19.110> really

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
you're still able to pick up really

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.440
