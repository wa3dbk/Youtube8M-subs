00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.000
 the space of the city of sciences in paris 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.319
 instead of popular science 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.890
 just updated the crossroads 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.349
 digital 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.210
 this space now in version 2.0 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.830
 welcomes the general public for the purpose of 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.680
 make him discover test manufacture 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.570
 different scientific facilities 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.810
 so the digital crossroads is a 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.869
 space 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.270
 dedicated to 15-25 years old mainly 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.009
 is led to propose two major projects 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.910
 a project called living lab is 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.730
 a project called the fab lab 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.430
 fab lab project is a space 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.360
 collaborative sharing where the idea is 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.160
 to be able to make everything we have 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.140
 want to make the second project 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.120
 living lab is more of an approach that 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.309
 is the one to put the most upstream 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.800
 possible devices for creating them 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.920
 end users we try to do 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.809
 think about people with profiles 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.409
 different different expertise 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.629
 different ages on all types of 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.339
 Service project implementation 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.989
 then there are two themes that you 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:02.500
 are mainly of interest to 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.019
 robotic and that of video game and after 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.540
 actually we try through this 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.420
 means of communication to push a 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.640
 little participants the users to 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.960
 be interested in programming 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.600
 was interested in a little more things 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.280
 pushed a little more complex across 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.470
 these projects pretty enough projects 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.680
 playful and why not give them 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.359
 want in their future studies or in 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.460
 their professional project to launch 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.079
 in these areas among the many 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.030
 creative workshops present on the 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.859
 place we find a dedicated space 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.079
 in the manufacture of joystick using 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:36.100
 pieces of polystyrene 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.009
 so it's for a game called 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.579
 slam of dark age who has a game based on 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.340
 a mechanics of track and field ur to 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.899
 as the game progresses 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.170
 the avatar to change color and so 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.389
 the players will have to look for the 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.700
 joystick that will move them forward 

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:56.360
 and so there the objective of the workshop is 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.340
 to build 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.430
 in fact the whole party at once 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.230
 aesthetics of joysticks so that's the 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.330
 guys are made of polystyrene for 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.729
 can be destroyed it's a game 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.950
 pretty punk in the mind we found 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.970
 that once we explain to people 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.070
 that they can afford everything 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.040
 to break there he lets go well back 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.420
 even more they have gaming experience 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.830
 and if you are not very manual do not 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.750
 do not worry there will also be some 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.580
 activities for you a little further 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.440
 we have indeed met elysÃ©es 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.970
 crash studio creator a platform 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.410
 cooperative video game creation 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.750
 for the general public 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.459
 he leads here and a game jam 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.590
 workshop on video game design 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.030
 in fact I present a little bit how 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.250
 are we going to be able to create a game 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.110
 video from scratch starting from 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.760
 zero so in kraft and at there is a 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.530
 set of tools that will allow to 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.590
 create 3d models of the characters from 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.850
 cube- based objects it makes sure a 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.160
 map editor that will allow to 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.180
 create environments and in fact one 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.060
 will be able to meet everyone in all 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.620
 together on a server 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.400
 everyone is going to go on something 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.739
 something someone who embodies a 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.819
 klein character who creates 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.620
 the environment and then we will be able 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.390
 scripted and so give life to all this and 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.550
 then share those games with the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.290
 community and do not be shy not 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.040
 need a bac + 9 to participate in 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.349
 this workshop 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.670
 we have 8 year old kids who who who 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.170
 who do what they do their own 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.630
 little game of course they are not going 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.580
 necessarily as far as people anymore 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.910
 aged but here's there really is all 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.160
 ages 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.959
 and I really simplified I 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.670
 removed all the complex options and I 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.310
 I really focused on having 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.640
 something nice of accessible from 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.350
 more 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.060
 accessibility does not necessarily mean 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.590
 mediocrity since many games of 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.840
 quality are created such as this 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.519
 friendly kraft fighter messi 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.810
 definitely the envy of creating does not flow 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.340
 in your veins you can always 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.310
 take a tour of the place to discover 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.660
 different experimental facilities 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.840
 so then behind me there is the game 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.640
 gigantomachy which is a game with 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.220
 joysticks 3 meters long and 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.780
 which is a game of versus fighting so 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.920
 a giant against another giant it can 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.790
 to be like games like street 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.680
 fighter 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.680
 the difference it lies in the fact 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.420
 that the six buttons here are on 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.650
 very large controllers 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.840
 that is, they are three meters 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.850
 the challenge is if we play 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.440
 one against one we will have to find ourselves at 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.600
 run on the controller to get to 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.310
 direct his founder control his 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.959
 germ or so we can play with 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.630
 other people and divide up a little 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.310
 the power on these controllers try 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.510
 to sync and if you find that 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.220
 too classic to play with a controller 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.750
 three meters long rendezvous 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.120
 directly to the fruit workshop and 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.250
 vegetables presents you so a little 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.480
 workshop on so-called maquis 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.630
 maquis who are therefore controllers 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.050
 multimedia controller we can see them 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.780
 here is a controller who will us 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.080
 allow after assigned him is 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.850
 well a custom device 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.020
 as long as the device allows 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.110
 drive the current we can use 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.460
 the device created to control in 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.230
 the occurrence a little musical game 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.730
 if you find it strange to play with 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.350
 an apple was waiting to hear this 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.350
 concerto for cycles but clemency 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.450
 all the programming and on the website of 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.510
 cac resumes digital with all our 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:07.230
 activities to propose on some 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.930
 ask for an inscription some not 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.010
 come in completely free way what 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.870
 which is important is that all of this is 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:17.370
 completely free and freely accessible 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.480
 that you have science and refuse or 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.800
 no we can only advise you 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.370
 to go for a ride at the crossroads 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.020
 digital 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.580
 maybe you will discover a 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.290
 true passion for science 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.290
 It is free and open to all 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.410
 -
