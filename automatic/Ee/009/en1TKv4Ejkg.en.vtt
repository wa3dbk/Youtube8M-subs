Sakai<00:01:15.270> was<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.900> manufacturer<00:01:16.710> for<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
Sakai was the manufacturer for the

Sakai was the manufacturer for the
original<00:01:18.360> hit<00:01:18.509> big<00:01:18.720> series<00:01:19.670> drums<00:01:21.080> so<00:01:22.080> it's

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
original hit big series drums so it's

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.340 
original hit big series drums so it's
not<00:01:23.790> ironic<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.750> Pak<00:01:24.930> D<00:01:25.140> kit

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
not ironic that we have the Pak D kit

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.440 
not ironic that we have the Pak D kit
which<00:01:25.500> has<00:01:25.530> very<00:01:25.920> similar<00:01:26.159> sizes<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.939> what<00:01:27.240> was

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
which has very similar sizes to what was

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.749 
which has very similar sizes to what was
the<00:01:27.659> big<00:01:28.049> junior<00:01:28.409> kit<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.490> if<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.670> were

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the big junior kit so if you were

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.160 
the big junior kit so if you were
familiar<00:01:29.939> with<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.360> set<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.990> not

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
familiar with that set this is not

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.649 
familiar with that set this is not
unlike<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.560> at<00:01:31.950> all<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:33.030> fact<00:01:33.180> there's<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.540> bit

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
unlike that at all in fact there's a bit

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.940 
unlike that at all in fact there's a bit
of<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.840> difference<00:01:34.200> here<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.530> think<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
of a difference here and I think the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.710 
of a difference here and I think the
suspension<00:01:35.670> mount<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> 10<00:01:36.270> really<00:01:36.509> lends

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
suspension mount on the 10 really lends

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.100 
suspension mount on the 10 really lends
to<00:01:37.700> what<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.729> consider<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.150> much<00:01:39.420> more<00:01:39.570> robust

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
to what I consider a much more robust

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.539 
to what I consider a much more robust
sound<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:41.549> sell<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> lot<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.329> compact<00:01:42.780> jets

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
sound we sell a lot of the compact jets

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.730 
sound we sell a lot of the compact jets
cheaper<00:01:44.549> sets<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> 3.99<00:01:45.420> 499<00:01:46.229> kits<00:01:46.470> which<00:01:46.619> are

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
cheaper sets the 3.99 499 kits which are

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.230 
cheaper sets the 3.99 499 kits which are
great<00:01:47.369> value<00:01:47.820> they<00:01:48.299> sound<00:01:48.600> good<00:01:49.759> they're<00:01:50.759> so

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
great value they sound good they're so

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.920 
great value they sound good they're so
cheap<00:01:51.619> but<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.770> issue<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.430> think<00:01:53.540> for<00:01:54.540> me<00:01:54.659> as<00:01:54.899> a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
cheap but the issue I think for me as a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.380 
cheap but the issue I think for me as a
drummer<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.759> know<00:01:56.850> because<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
drummer is that you know because the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.350 
drummer is that you know because the
wood<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.930> an<00:01:58.829> excuse<00:01:59.369> inexpensive<00:02:00.240> it's

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
wood is so an excuse inexpensive it's

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.569 
wood is so an excuse inexpensive it's
it's<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> porous<00:02:01.140> wood<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.680> don't<00:02:02.219> get<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> lot<00:02:02.460> of

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
it's a porous wood I don't get a lot of

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.960 
it's a porous wood I don't get a lot of
snap<00:02:02.790> back

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
snap back

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.190 
snap back
when<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.090> put<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.080> stick<00:02:05.230> on<00:02:05.290> it<00:02:05.440> and<00:02:06.720> these<00:02:07.720> I

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
when I put the stick on it and these I

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.160 
when I put the stick on it and these I
do<00:02:08.440> get<00:02:08.800> that<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.190> then<00:02:09.340> also<00:02:09.810> there's<00:02:10.810> just<00:02:11.050> a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
do get that and then also there's just a
