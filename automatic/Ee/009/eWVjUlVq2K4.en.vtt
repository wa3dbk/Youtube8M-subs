00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
is is I was planning on just running

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.940 
is is I was planning on just running
this<00:02:24.760> line<00:02:25.000> straight<00:02:25.570> into<00:02:25.900> this<00:02:26.020> outlet<00:02:26.500> that

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
this line straight into this outlet that

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.430 
this line straight into this outlet that
runs<00:02:27.220> into<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.580> tank<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:28.690> reason<00:02:29.050> I<00:02:29.140> didn't

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
runs into the tank the reason I didn't

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.560 
runs into the tank the reason I didn't
do<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.740> is<00:02:29.920> this<00:02:30.220> canister<00:02:30.970> filters<00:02:31.300> just

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
do that is this canister filters just

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.240 
do that is this canister filters just
not<00:02:31.720> strong<00:02:32.050> enough<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.350> be<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.590> main<00:02:32.890> pump

for the tank or flow so I left the main

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.940 
for the tank or flow so I left the main
pump<00:02:36.370> in<00:02:36.580> there<00:02:36.990> my<00:02:37.990> one<00:02:38.230> complaint<00:02:38.470> with<00:02:38.860> the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
pump in there my one complaint with the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.380 
pump in there my one complaint with the
main<00:02:39.100> pump<00:02:39.400> though<00:02:39.580> is<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.850> too<00:02:39.940> noisy

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
main pump though is it too noisy

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.930 
main pump though is it too noisy
it<00:02:40.870> makes<00:02:41.080> this<00:02:41.260> clicking<00:02:41.560> noise<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.700> fix

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
it makes this clicking noise and to fix

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.780 
it makes this clicking noise and to fix
that<00:02:43.210> though<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.630> have<00:02:43.780> figured<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.140> out

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
that though I have figured it out

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.360 
that though I have figured it out
this<00:02:45.960> restrictor<00:02:46.960> that<00:02:47.170> directs<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.070> flow

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
this restrictor that directs the flow

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.640 
this restrictor that directs the flow
pop<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.270> off<00:02:49.390> it's<00:02:49.630> real<00:02:49.840> easy<00:02:49.870> take<00:02:50.470> your

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
pop it off it's real easy take your

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.340 
pop it off it's real easy take your
Dremel<00:02:50.860> ur<00:02:51.010> Dremel<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.820> out<00:02:51.970> inside<00:02:52.390> it's<00:02:53.050> just

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
Dremel ur Dremel it out inside it's just

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.650 
Dremel ur Dremel it out inside it's just
too<00:02:53.530> restricting<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:55.180> holds<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.540> water

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
too restricting and it holds the water

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.540 
too restricting and it holds the water
back<00:02:55.900> if<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.230> can<00:02:56.380> listen<00:02:59.400> hear<00:03:00.400> that

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
back if you can listen hear that

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.150 
back if you can listen hear that
clicking<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:02.080> does<00:03:02.320> that<00:03:02.500> all<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.680> time<00:03:02.830> if

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
clicking it does that all the time if

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.400 
clicking it does that all the time if
you<00:03:03.280> don't<00:03:03.460> do<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.090> highly<00:03:04.720> suggest<00:03:05.170> you

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
you don't do it so I highly suggest you

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.920 
you don't do it so I highly suggest you
you<00:03:06.280> fix<00:03:06.520> it<00:03:06.730> but<00:03:06.850> that<00:03:06.970> is<00:03:07.090> also<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.420> fix<00:03:07.750> if

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
you fix it but that is also the fix if

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.810 
you fix it but that is also the fix if
you<00:03:08.020> already<00:03:08.140> have<00:03:08.380> one<00:03:08.560> on<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:10.360> deal

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
you already have one on the deal

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.470 
you already have one on the deal
evaporation<00:03:12.820> is<00:03:12.970> probably<00:03:13.240> your<00:03:13.360> biggest

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
evaporation is probably your biggest

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.930 
evaporation is probably your biggest
problem<00:03:13.960> with<00:03:14.050> this<00:03:14.230> tank<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:15.370> evaporates

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
problem with this tank it evaporates

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.180 
problem with this tank it evaporates
really<00:03:16.450> quick<00:03:16.690> so<00:03:17.500> if<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.680> even<00:03:17.830> want<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.040> go

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
home for the weekend you need to have

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.530 
home for the weekend you need to have
some<00:03:20.560> sort<00:03:20.710> of<00:03:20.800> auto<00:03:20.980> top<00:03:21.280> off<00:03:21.490> or<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.820> friend<00:03:22.210> or

something my auto top off at these float
switches<00:03:25.990> I've<00:03:26.470> got<00:03:26.680> two<00:03:26.860> of<00:03:26.890> them<00:03:27.330> when

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
switches I've got two of them when

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.980 
switches I've got two of them when
they're<00:03:28.480> both<00:03:28.690> down<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:30.190> pump<00:03:30.790> is<00:03:30.940> on<00:03:31.150> when

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
they're both down the pump is on when

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.640 
they're both down the pump is on when
either<00:03:32.260> one<00:03:32.410> is<00:03:32.710> up<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.460> pump<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:33.850> off<00:03:34.060> and

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
either one is up the pump is off and

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.890 
either one is up the pump is off and
that<00:03:35.650> one<00:03:35.920> is<00:03:36.070> set<00:03:36.340> lower<00:03:36.700> in<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.420> water<00:03:37.630> than

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
that one is set lower in the water than

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.780 
that one is set lower in the water than
this<00:03:38.050> one<00:03:38.290> so<00:03:38.500> if<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:38.770> one<00:03:38.920> got<00:03:39.070> stuck<00:03:39.490> down

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
this one so if that one got stuck down

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.940 
this one so if that one got stuck down
for<00:03:40.090> some<00:03:40.270> reason<00:03:40.300> this<00:03:41.050> one<00:03:41.110> would<00:03:41.500> save<00:03:41.740> it

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
for some reason this one would save it

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.570 
for some reason this one would save it
it<00:03:42.610> was<00:03:42.730> my<00:03:42.880> backup<00:03:43.630> strategy<00:03:44.230> there<00:03:44.410> it<00:03:45.310> runs

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
it was my backup strategy there it runs

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.640 
it was my backup strategy there it runs
down<00:03:46.210> the<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.810> know<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.050> electrical<00:03:47.470> lines

I bought the plastic heated it up with a
lighter<00:04:05.020> and<00:04:05.200> bent<00:04:05.650> it<00:04:05.830> and<00:04:06.070> then<00:04:06.190> dipped<00:04:06.400> it

from<00:04:08.500> continuously<00:04:09.220> melting<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:10.660> was<00:04:10.780> pretty

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
from continuously melting it was pretty

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.460 
from continuously melting it was pretty
easy<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:11.560> took<00:04:11.770> me<00:04:11.920> about<00:04:12.040> an<00:04:12.190> hour<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.459> I<00:04:13.470> run

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
the lights on timers everything like

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.229 
the lights on timers everything like
that<00:04:16.830> the<00:04:17.830> heater<00:04:18.070> this<00:04:18.520> is<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:18.820> line<00:04:19.000> for<00:04:19.180> the

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
that the heater this is the line for the

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
heater the heater actually goes

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.430 
heater the heater actually goes
underneath<00:04:20.859> this<00:04:21.640> chamber<00:04:22.150> this<00:04:22.990> chamber<00:04:23.050> is

underneath this chamber this chamber is
not<00:04:23.560> very<00:04:23.770> deep<00:04:24.010> so<00:04:24.250> you

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
not very deep so you

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.129 
not very deep so you
go<00:04:24.789> with<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.210> heater<00:04:25.389> when<00:04:25.629> none<00:04:25.780> of<00:04:25.810> this<00:04:25.990> is

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
go with the heater when none of this is

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.350 
go with the heater when none of this is
in<00:04:26.259> here<00:04:26.439> you<00:04:26.500> can<00:04:26.650> go<00:04:26.770> down<00:04:27.099> and<00:04:27.460> then<00:04:27.669> oh<00:04:27.849> you

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:30.969 
know down and under and it'll lay across

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.059 
know down and under and it'll lay across
the<00:04:31.180> bottom<00:04:31.509> so<00:04:32.110> I<00:04:32.169> have<00:04:32.289> a<00:04:32.349> big<00:04:32.560> 10<00:04:32.860> watt

the bottom so I have a big 10 watt

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:34.559 
the bottom so I have a big 10 watt
heater<00:04:33.370> laying<00:04:33.729> across<00:04:33.969> the<00:04:34.210> bottom<00:04:34.449> down

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:34.569 
heater laying across the bottom down

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:36.420 
heater laying across the bottom down
there<00:04:34.629> it<00:04:34.840> works<00:04:34.990> great<00:04:35.349> save<00:04:35.680> me<00:04:35.860> room<00:04:36.069> up<00:04:36.219> top

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
there it works great save me room up top

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.330 
there it works great save me room up top
and<00:04:36.789> if<00:04:37.449> the<00:04:37.599> water<00:04:37.810> level<00:04:37.900> gets<00:04:38.289> low<00:04:38.530> keeps

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
and if the water level gets low keeps

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.059 
and if the water level gets low keeps
the<00:04:39.460> heater<00:04:39.639> from<00:04:39.879> burning<00:04:40.210> up<00:04:40.330> so<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:41.800> very

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:42.069 
the heater from burning up so the very

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.610 
the heater from burning up so the very
last<00:04:42.159> thing<00:04:42.550> that'll<00:04:43.060> you<00:04:44.020> know<00:04:44.050> come<00:04:44.379> out<00:04:44.500> of

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
last thing that'll you know come out of

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.830 
last thing that'll you know come out of
the<00:04:44.680> water<00:04:44.830> would<00:04:45.039> be<00:04:45.069> the<00:04:45.159> heater<00:04:45.430> I<00:04:45.840> find

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
the water would be the heater I find

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.719 
the water would be the heater I find
that<00:04:46.960> with<00:04:47.110> this<00:04:47.229> float<00:04:47.530> switch<00:04:47.860> system<00:04:48.430> with

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
that with this float switch system with

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.390 
that with this float switch system with
the<00:04:48.939> aqua<00:04:49.240> lifter<00:04:49.569> pump<00:04:49.810> I<00:04:50.080> can<00:04:50.620> get<00:04:50.740> about<00:04:50.949> 10

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
the aqua lifter pump I can get about 10

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.749 
the aqua lifter pump I can get about 10
days<00:04:51.699> before<00:04:52.629> the<00:04:52.870> tank<00:04:53.370> empties<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.580> that's

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
days before the tank empties and that's

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.969 
days before the tank empties and that's
what<00:04:54.909> the<00:04:55.000> gallon<00:04:55.449> this<00:04:56.259> line<00:04:56.500> runs<00:04:56.770> to<00:04:56.949> a

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
what the gallon this line runs to a

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.369 
what the gallon this line runs to a
gallon<00:04:57.430> tank<00:04:57.699> so<00:04:58.060> you<00:04:58.419> could<00:04:58.599> just<00:04:58.810> up<00:04:58.990> that<00:04:59.199> to

00:04:59.369 --> 00:04:59.379 
gallon tank so you could just up that to

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:00.749 
gallon tank so you could just up that to
a<00:04:59.409> two<00:04:59.620> gallon<00:04:59.949> tank<00:05:00.159> and<00:05:00.370> you<00:05:00.430> could<00:05:00.550> probably

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
a two gallon tank and you could probably

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.059 
a two gallon tank and you could probably
get<00:05:01.000> twenty<00:05:01.330> days<00:05:01.509> now<00:05:01.990> you<00:05:02.289> have<00:05:02.919> other

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
get twenty days now you have other

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:06.119 
get twenty days now you have other
problems<00:05:03.340> after<00:05:03.819> twenty<00:05:04.120> days<00:05:04.270> but<00:05:04.680> so<00:05:05.680> about

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:06.129 
problems after twenty days but so about

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:07.920 
problems after twenty days but so about
ten<00:05:06.400> days<00:05:06.550> I<00:05:06.610> did<00:05:07.000> it<00:05:07.090> once<00:05:07.300> for<00:05:07.569> spring<00:05:07.779> break

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
ten days I did it once for spring break

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.450 
ten days I did it once for spring break
and<00:05:08.199> it<00:05:08.289> worked<00:05:08.439> out<00:05:08.560> pretty<00:05:08.740> good<00:05:11.250> going<00:05:12.250> back

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
and it worked out pretty good going back

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.119 
and it worked out pretty good going back
this<00:05:12.669> way<00:05:12.849> so<00:05:12.879> it's<00:05:13.120> upright<00:05:13.479> for<00:05:13.659> you<00:05:13.719> guys

aqueon<00:05:26.009> evolve<00:05:27.009> for<00:05:27.599> my<00:05:28.599> only<00:05:28.930> complaints

aqueon evolve for my only complaints

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.050 
aqueon evolve for my only complaints
would<00:05:29.500> be<00:05:29.650> is<00:05:29.770> that<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:30.250> acrylic<00:05:30.550> is<00:05:30.819> pretty

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
would be is that the acrylic is pretty

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.689 
would be is that the acrylic is pretty
easy<00:05:31.240> to<00:05:31.360> scratch<00:05:31.949> but<00:05:32.949> other<00:05:33.159> than<00:05:33.310> that<00:05:33.370> the

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
easy to scratch but other than that the

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.519 
easy to scratch but other than that the
tanks<00:05:33.940> been<00:05:34.060> pretty<00:05:34.300> solid<00:05:37.080> and<00:05:38.080> I<00:05:38.349> guess

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:38.529 
tanks been pretty solid and I guess

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.409 
tanks been pretty solid and I guess
