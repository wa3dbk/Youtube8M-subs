00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.340
 let's prepare pickled chicken for 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.160
 we have here a chicken cut up without 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.590
 skin because I used to take the chicken 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.890
 the skin because that 's where it has all the 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.500
 fat and cholesterol then here 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:28.200
 we have the chicken chopped some leaves 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:31.630
 laurel carrot onion garlic salt 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.259
 balls of black pepper vinegar and 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.570
 oil 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.120
 we have peeled the carrot and we have 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.149
 cut into slices and onion 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.660
 so in half moon now in a pot 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:46.409
 hot oil with a little let 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.409
 to sautÃ© what 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.140
 next we have talked about the 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.739
 chicken arms and we're going to put them in 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.739
 the casserole 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.439
 we put the arms 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.010
 Martin Laurel 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.270
 they are the generals of the black triumph 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.810
 for all 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.440
 a glass of green wine and my mother 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.640
 We are a 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.080
 observe this proportion because now 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.080
 let's buy three oil 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.150
 as before, then one 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.730
 two 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.260
 we have put all three of oil and now 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.590
 I'm going to put some water as a medium 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.590
 cup 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.820
 It has to be well covered in oil 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.820
 and of liquid 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.480
 once it has been well covered 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.930
 of liquid and well preached everything I 've 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.740
 Pour some salt to the oil in the broth 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.450
 and now I put a plate on it 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.840
 that there is water 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.540
 this is an ancient custom and then 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.150
 because I keep it when the 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.430
 dish water or I put more we are going to 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.770
 have knowing about 45 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.690
 minutes but we'll check if it's 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.540
 soft if it's already cooked if not 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.640
 we would leave more 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.799
 the fire that is not very strong once 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.500
 Let it start to boil , we will lower it to 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:49.709
 let it go smoothly we have had almost 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.760
 one hour cooking the chicken gently 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.819
 we have the headless finished now 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.760
 we can just let it cool 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:03.120
 and how it is covered by oil and 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:07.079
 vinegar and water then well then 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.909
 It can preserve us a lot of time and 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.980
 I do not tell you if you put it in the fridge 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:13.799
 once it's cold it's still preserved 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.569
 better then what time to eat can you 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.329
 temper it a bit if you like a 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.599
 Pochitico hot but if you do not eat 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.599
 cold
