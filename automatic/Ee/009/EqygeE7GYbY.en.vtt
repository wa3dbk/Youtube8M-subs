00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
another story it's really not too too

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.600 
another story it's really not too too
bad<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:45.450> handlebars<00:00:46.110> are<00:00:46.739> really<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> only

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
bad the handlebars are really the only

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.250 
bad the handlebars are really the only
things<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.539> put<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:49.700> by

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
things that you have to put on by

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.069 
things that you have to put on by
suggest<00:00:52.260> using<00:00:52.500> glue<00:00:53.370> when<00:00:54.239> you're<00:00:54.420> doing<00:00:54.899> it

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
suggest using glue when you're doing it

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.240 
suggest using glue when you're doing it
so<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.980> you're<00:00:56.190> not<00:00:56.219> knocking<00:00:56.699> them<00:00:57.090> off

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
so that you're not knocking them off

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.080 
so that you're not knocking them off
because<00:00:59.250> they're<00:00:59.520> not<00:00:59.730> really<00:01:00.690> at<00:01:00.960> stable<00:01:02.090> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
because they're not really at stable the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.119 
because they're not really at stable the
connections<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.019> know<00:01:04.470> could<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.100> a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
connections you know could have it a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.010 
connections you know could have it a
little<00:01:05.309> bit<00:01:05.580> better<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.479> little<00:01:06.750> crazy

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
little bit better but a little crazy

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.950 
little bit better but a little crazy
glue<00:01:07.320> goes<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.680> long<00:01:07.979> way<00:01:10.040> for<00:01:11.040> size<00:01:11.460> scale<00:01:12.000> let

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
glue goes a long way for size scale let

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.170 
glue goes a long way for size scale let
me<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.290> show<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:14.180> this<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.840> hot<00:01:16.590> wheels

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
me just show you this is the hot wheels

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.770 
me just show you this is the hot wheels
elite<00:01:18.290> version<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.460> can<00:01:20.700> see<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.299> size

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
got movable gas brake wires for the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:51.319 
got movable gas brake wires for the
lighting<00:01:44.479> as<00:01:45.680> you<00:01:46.680> know<00:01:46.829> lines<00:01:49.610> down<00:01:50.610> here<00:01:51.090> for

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
lighting as you know lines down here for

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.030 
lighting as you know lines down here for
the<00:01:51.420> brakes<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.530> motors<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.369> wheels

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
the brakes for the motors and the wheels

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.569 
the brakes for the motors and the wheels
this<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> really<00:01:56.670> detailed<00:01:56.909> figure<00:01:58.579> it's

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
this is a really detailed figure it's

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.770 
this is a really detailed figure it's
got<00:01:59.729> two<00:02:00.030> bright<00:02:00.390> leds<00:02:01.020> for<00:02:01.939> lights<00:02:02.939> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
got two bright leds for lights the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.779 
got two bright leds for lights the
batteries<00:02:04.770> go<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:07.039> right<00:02:08.039> under<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.489> seat

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789

and make it look like he's blowing
through<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.190> wind<00:02:49.320> but<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.530> clips<00:02:51.540> don't

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
through the wind but the clips don't

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.090 
through the wind but the clips don't
really<00:02:53.200> attached<00:02:54.150> quite<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.390> well<00:02:55.830> so<00:02:56.830> I've

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
really attached quite that well so I've

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.100 
really attached quite that well so I've
been<00:02:57.220> forced<00:02:57.820> to<00:02:58.200> use<00:02:59.200> some<00:02:59.530> glue<00:03:00.630> which<00:03:01.630> is

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
been forced to use some glue which is

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.479 
been forced to use some glue which is
setting<00:03:02.620> up<00:03:02.830> right<00:03:03.160> now<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.900> later<00:03:05.709> on<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:06.400> will

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489
