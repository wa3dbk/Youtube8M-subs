00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:52.250 

break<00:03:44.140> it<00:03:44.290> away<00:03:44.610> discard<00:03:45.610> that

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.970 

now<00:03:53.260> we<00:03:53.320> just<00:03:53.410> need<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:54.300> reinsert<00:03:55.770> tubing<00:03:56.770> into

now we just need to reinsert tubing into

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.340 
now we just need to reinsert tubing into
the<00:03:57.070> new<00:03:57.190> valve<00:03:57.460> we<00:03:58.420> little<00:03:58.720> resistance<00:03:59.230> of

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
the new valve we little resistance of

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.500 
the new valve we little resistance of
the<00:03:59.440> o-ring<00:03:59.800> in<00:03:59.950> there<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:01.060> then<00:04:01.270> it<00:04:01.420> will

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
the o-ring in there and then it will

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.640 
the o-ring in there and then it will
eventually<00:04:01.600> bottom<00:04:02.230> out<00:04:03.870> little<00:04:04.870> tug<00:04:05.110> make

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
eventually bottom out little tug make

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:32.960 
eventually bottom out little tug make
