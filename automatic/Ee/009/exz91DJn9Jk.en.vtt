cooking<00:02:25.170> time<00:02:25.320> is<00:02:25.440> going<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.650> be<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.739> demo

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
cooking time is going to be a demo

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.080 
cooking time is going to be a demo
because<00:02:28.140> again<00:02:28.500> remember<00:02:28.650> use<00:02:29.100> hot<00:02:29.310> water<00:02:29.580> if

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
because again remember use hot water if

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.760 
because again remember use hot water if
cold<00:02:30.450> water<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.930> could<00:02:31.230> definitely<00:02:31.350> probably

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
cold water I could definitely probably

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.900 
cold water I could definitely probably
change<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:32.820> this<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.150> hot<00:02:33.330> when<00:02:33.780> injected

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
change so this is hot when injected

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.490 
change so this is hot when injected
absolutely<00:02:35.910> now<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.840> bet<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.140> can't<00:02:37.320> use<00:02:37.470> that

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
absolutely now I bet you can't use that

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.949 
absolutely now I bet you can't use that
guess<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.040> next<00:02:38.160> thing<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.459> use<00:02:38.670> now<00:02:39.570> one<00:02:39.780> thing

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
guess the next thing I use now one thing

I'm gonna have a crust across there I
won't<00:04:26.270> be<00:04:26.390> able<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.630> see<00:04:26.720> which<00:04:26.870> way<00:04:27.020> to<00:04:27.080> cut<00:04:27.290> it

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
won't be able to see which way to cut it

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:38.360 
won't be able to see which way to cut it
but<00:04:27.740> we're<00:04:27.890> also<00:04:28.010> going<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.310> work<00:04:28.460> on<00:04:28.610> that

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.640 

so<00:04:38.970> you<00:04:39.030> don't<00:04:39.300> cook<00:04:39.660> it<00:04:39.810> with<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.139> fat<00:04:40.350> side

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
so you don't cook it with the fat side

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.710 
so you don't cook it with the fat side
up<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:40.889> keep<00:04:41.220> it<00:04:41.370> based<00:04:41.610> it's<00:04:42.150> not<00:04:42.330> gonna<00:04:42.449> base

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
up to keep it based it's not gonna base

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.050 
up to keep it based it's not gonna base
with<00:04:42.960> that<00:04:43.280> fat<00:04:44.280> and<00:04:44.550> whether<00:04:44.820> it<00:04:44.940> be<00:04:45.030> a

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
with that fat and whether it be a

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.760 
with that fat and whether it be a
brisket<00:04:45.480> or<00:04:45.780> whether<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.050> be<00:04:46.169> a<00:04:46.199> but<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:46.650> will

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
brisket or whether it be a but it will

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.700 
brisket or whether it be a but it will
not<00:04:46.949> based<00:04:47.389> and<00:04:48.389> the<00:04:48.479> reason<00:04:48.840> is<00:04:48.990> this<00:04:49.530> is

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
not based and the reason is this is

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.990 
not based and the reason is this is
straight<00:04:49.949> from<00:04:50.190> a<00:04:50.810> meat<00:04:52.220> PhD<00:04:53.220> from<00:04:53.669> state<00:04:53.880> of

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
straight from a meat PhD from state of

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.629 
straight from a meat PhD from state of
Kansas<00:04:54.389> he<00:04:54.930> says<00:04:55.199> you<00:04:55.650> can<00:04:55.800> lay<00:04:55.949> as<00:04:56.070> much<00:04:56.280> fat

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
Kansas he says you can lay as much fat

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.070 
Kansas he says you can lay as much fat
on<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:57.000> top<00:04:57.030> of<00:04:57.419> meat<00:04:57.690> that<00:04:58.169> you<00:04:58.320> want<00:04:58.669> but<00:04:59.669> the

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
on the top of meat that you want but the

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.570 
on the top of meat that you want but the
meat<00:05:01.080> will<00:05:01.380> never<00:05:01.620> absorb<00:05:02.070> it<00:05:02.190> because<00:05:02.460> the

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
meat will never absorb it because the

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.310 
meat will never absorb it because the
fat<00:05:02.760> molecules<00:05:03.300> looking<00:05:03.570> thick<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:03.990> go<00:05:04.110> down

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
fat molecules looking thick to go down

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.420 
fat molecules looking thick to go down
into<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.740> meat<00:05:05.360> he<00:05:06.360> says<00:05:06.889> and<00:05:07.889> I<00:05:08.070> said<00:05:08.280> well

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
into the meat he says and I said well

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.530 
into the meat he says and I said well
what<00:05:08.580> about<00:05:08.610> all<00:05:08.880> these<00:05:08.940> people<00:05:09.030> say<00:05:09.360> you<00:05:09.419> need
