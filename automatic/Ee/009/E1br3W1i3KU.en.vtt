00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
exactly off-putting but it is a little

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.170

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.820 
action which i think is really great for
the<00:04:22.270> series<00:04:22.660> I<00:04:22.750> never<00:04:23.080> imagined<00:04:23.620> we<00:04:23.710> were

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
the series I never imagined we were

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.310 
the series I never imagined we were
gonna<00:04:23.919> start<00:04:24.190> seeing<00:04:24.460> all<00:04:24.610> of<00:04:24.760> these<00:04:24.880> like<00:04:25.030> big

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
little bit more later because I was

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.790 
little bit more later because I was
expecting<00:04:36.480> him<00:04:36.540> to<00:04:36.600> be<00:04:36.780> just<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.170> complete
