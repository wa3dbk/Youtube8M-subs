00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
apply silicone rubber to the piece this

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.469 
apply silicone rubber to the piece this
is<00:00:42.479> a<00:00:43.069> 11<00:00:44.069> $12<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.819> pound

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
piece it will pick up a fingerprint

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.029 
piece it will pick up a fingerprint
that's<00:00:49.889> there<00:00:50.159> on<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.460> place<00:00:54.379> after<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.710> apply

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
that's there on the place after we apply

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.879 
that's there on the place after we apply
the<00:00:56.100> rubber<00:00:56.519> all<00:00:57.239> over<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> clay<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.589> add

00:00:58.879 --> 00:00:58.889 
the rubber all over the clay and we add

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:01.160 
the rubber all over the clay and we add
these<00:00:59.159> parting<00:01:00.030> lines<00:01:00.269> so<00:01:00.719> that's<00:01:00.899> where

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
these parting lines so that's where

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.520 
these parting lines so that's where
we'll<00:01:01.319> actually<00:01:01.559> cut<00:01:02.069> the<00:01:02.219> rubber<00:01:02.719> apart<00:01:03.719> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
we'll actually cut the rubber apart to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.690 
we'll actually cut the rubber apart to
expose<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.159> clay<00:01:05.369> then<00:01:05.670> peel<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.060> off<00:01:07.460> we<00:01:08.460> have

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
expose the clay then peel it off we have

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.090 
expose the clay then peel it off we have
to<00:01:08.969> apply<00:01:09.329> what's<00:01:09.750> called<00:01:10.079> a<00:01:10.409> mother<00:01:10.799> hole

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
to apply what's called a mother hole

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.580 
to apply what's called a mother hole
because<00:01:12.090> rubber<00:01:12.360> won't<00:01:12.689> keep<00:01:12.899> its<00:01:13.110> shape<00:01:13.170> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
because rubber won't keep its shape and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.060 
because rubber won't keep its shape and
it<00:01:13.680> won't<00:01:13.860> have<00:01:14.130> anything<00:01:14.579> inside<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.210> anymore

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
it won't have anything inside it anymore

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.490 
it won't have anything inside it anymore
to<00:01:17.070> help<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.430> keep<00:01:17.609> its<00:01:17.820> shape<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:19.229> use

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
to help it keep its shape and we use

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
to help it keep its shape and we use
plaster<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:21.060> hemp<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.890> for<00:01:22.890> strength<00:01:23.250> and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
plaster with hemp in it for strength and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.599 
plaster with hemp in it for strength and
rigidity<00:01:24.079> to<00:01:25.079> make<00:01:25.320> our<00:01:25.530> mother<00:01:25.740> mold<00:01:26.009> right

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:26.609 
rigidity to make our mother mold right

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:28.880 
rigidity to make our mother mold right
now<00:01:26.759> we're<00:01:26.969> just<00:01:27.119> removing<00:01:27.539> the<00:01:27.780> plaster<00:01:28.680> off

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
now we're just removing the plaster off

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.160 
now we're just removing the plaster off
of<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:30.079> piece<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:32.149> just<00:01:33.149> use<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.359> crowbar<00:01:33.719> and

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
of the piece and just use a crowbar and

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.109 
of the piece and just use a crowbar and
a<00:01:34.259> hammer<00:01:34.469> and<00:01:35.509> strategically<00:01:36.509> pry<00:01:36.899> them<00:01:37.109> off

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
a hammer and strategically pry them off

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.069 
a hammer and strategically pry them off
the<00:01:39.119> plaster<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.869> pretty<00:01:40.320> cured<00:01:40.590> now<00:01:40.829> after

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
the plaster is pretty cured now after

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.359 
the plaster is pretty cured now after
this<00:01:43.079> number<00:01:43.439> 24<00:01:44.159> hours<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:44.880> pretty<00:01:45.630> hard

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
this number 24 hours so it's pretty hard

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.800 
this number 24 hours so it's pretty hard
that<00:01:47.369> one<00:01:47.460> actually<00:01:47.640> sticks<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.479> itself

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
that one actually sticks to itself

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.340 
that one actually sticks to itself
really<00:01:49.170> well<00:01:50.570> similar<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.600> your<00:01:51.810> bathroom

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
really well similar to your bathroom

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.069 
really well similar to your bathroom
caulking<00:01:52.920> silicone<00:01:53.700> there's<00:01:54.179> the<00:01:54.359> inside<00:01:54.840> of

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
caulking silicone there's the inside of

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:55.690 
caulking silicone there's the inside of
it

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
it

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.020 
it
two<00:01:56.060> forms<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:56.810> these<00:01:57.469> little<00:01:57.770> buttons<00:01:58.030> will

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
two forms and these little buttons will

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.010 
two forms and these little buttons will
sink<00:01:59.420> back<00:01:59.719> into<00:01:59.750> these<00:02:00.170> holes<00:02:00.469> actually<00:02:01.130> use

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
sink back into these holes actually use

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.410 
sink back into these holes actually use
what's<00:02:03.020> called<00:02:03.289> a<00:02:03.409> groove<00:02:03.649> knife<00:02:03.950> so<00:02:04.909> I've<00:02:05.149> got

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
what's called a groove knife so I've got

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.550 
what's called a groove knife so I've got
an<00:02:05.600> actual<00:02:06.020> bend<00:02:06.409> in<00:02:06.679> it<00:02:06.829> and<00:02:07.130> leaves<00:02:07.399> a<00:02:07.579> group

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
an actual bend in it and leaves a group

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.500 
an actual bend in it and leaves a group
that<00:02:09.560> allows<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.280> rubber<00:02:10.519> to<00:02:10.789> fit<00:02:11.000> back<00:02:11.209> up

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
that allows the rubber to fit back up

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.809 
that allows the rubber to fit back up
with<00:02:11.810> itself<00:02:12.290> perfectly<00:02:12.890> giving<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.459> a<00:02:13.550> key

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
with itself perfectly giving it a key

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.449 
with itself perfectly giving it a key
you<00:02:14.660> can<00:02:14.870> also<00:02:15.050> give<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.470> an<00:02:15.680> additional<00:02:16.010> key

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
you can also give it an additional key
