00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
an interface that is used with the

input of your iPad iPhone or I touch it

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.779 
input of your iPad iPhone or I touch it
requires<00:00:24.689> two<00:00:25.019> triple<00:00:25.410> A<00:00:25.500> batteries<00:00:25.789> this

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
requires two triple A batteries this

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.849 
requires two triple A batteries this
provides<00:00:27.269> power<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.990> separate<00:00:28.500> headphone

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
provides power to the separate headphone

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.400 
provides power to the separate headphone
output<00:00:29.279> by<00:00:29.519> doing<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.390> avoids<00:00:30.810> what<00:00:31.259> we

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
output by doing this it avoids what we

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.279 
output by doing this it avoids what we
call<00:00:31.619> crossfade<00:00:32.189> our<00:00:33.059> crossfade<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.809> when<00:00:34.050> you

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:34.289 
call crossfade our crossfade is when you

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.029 
call crossfade our crossfade is when you
have<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.129> low<00:00:36.000> input<00:00:36.270> signal<00:00:36.780> going<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.590> at

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
have a low input signal going in and at

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:39.680 
have a low input signal going in and at
the<00:00:38.070> same<00:00:38.280> time<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.610> high<00:00:38.820> current<00:00:39.120> coming<00:00:39.480> out

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the same time a high current coming out

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.350 
the same time a high current coming out
now<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.559> arm<00:00:40.860> kit<00:00:41.100> prevents<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.760> crossfade

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
now the arm kit prevents this crossfade

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.209 
now the arm kit prevents this crossfade
and<00:00:42.629> leaves<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.899> with<00:00:43.020> nice<00:00:43.230> clean<00:00:43.649> toning

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and leaves you with nice clean toning

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.180 
and leaves you with nice clean toning
signal<00:00:45.199> now<00:00:46.199> as<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.949> works

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
signal now as you can see it works

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.279 
signal now as you can see it works
absolutely<00:00:47.430> fine<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:48.090> Peterson<00:00:48.629> tuner<00:00:49.140> and

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
absolutely fine with Peterson tuner and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.860 
absolutely fine with Peterson tuner and
also<00:00:49.949> it<00:00:50.070> works<00:00:50.280> great<00:00:50.609> with<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.090> TC<00:00:51.539> poly

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
also it works great with the TC poly

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.170 
also it works great with the TC poly
tune<00:00:52.170> as<00:00:52.320> well

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180

kit app now ok as you can see I'm using

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.759 
kit app now ok as you can see I'm using
a<00:01:02.550> real<00:01:02.760> basic<00:01:03.149> setup<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.170> noise<00:01:04.379> gate<00:01:04.470> in

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
a real basic setup just a noise gate in

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.580 
a real basic setup just a noise gate in
another<00:01:05.009> effects<00:01:05.400> pedal<00:01:05.759> I've<00:01:06.659> got<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.020> rigged

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
another effects pedal I've got it rigged

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.410 
another effects pedal I've got it rigged
into<00:01:07.920> my<00:01:08.040> Pro<00:01:08.250> Tools<00:01:08.430> unit<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.180> see

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.230 
into my Pro Tools unit so you can see
just<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.020> clarity<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.549> actual<00:01:11.880> app

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
just the clarity of the actual app

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.530 
just the clarity of the actual app
itself<00:01:13.460> you<00:01:14.460> get<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.700> choice<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> actual
