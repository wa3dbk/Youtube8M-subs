as<00:05:13.920> a<00:05:13.980> first<00:05:14.520> hairstyle<00:05:14.760> but<00:05:15.180> it's<00:05:15.330> a<00:05:15.360> little

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
as a first hairstyle but it's a little

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.880 
as a first hairstyle but it's a little
bit<00:05:15.630> different<00:05:15.990> because<00:05:16.080> you<00:05:16.320> have<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:16.650> wait

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890
