go<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.109> 16<00:00:31.710> gigs<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.719> ram<00:00:33.719> but<00:00:34.219> I<00:00:35.219> realized<00:00:35.850> I

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
go to 16 gigs of ram but I realized I

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.170 
go to 16 gigs of ram but I realized I
had<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> wrong<00:00:36.809> one<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:38.160> held<00:00:38.670> onto<00:00:38.879> these

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.170 
so let's start with the first one this
is<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:20.190> patriot<00:02:21.190> 8<00:02:21.820> gigabyte<00:02:23.010> each<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.520> it's<00:02:24.700> PC

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
is a patriot 8 gigabyte each and it's PC

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:33.510 
is a patriot 8 gigabyte each and it's PC
3<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:26.110> it's<00:02:28.860> 130<00:02:30.540> 1333<00:02:31.540> megahertz<00:02:32.310> which<00:02:33.310> is

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
3 and it's 130 1333 megahertz which is

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.970 
3 and it's 130 1333 megahertz which is
not<00:02:33.700> exactly<00:02:34.180> what<00:02:34.530> we're<00:02:35.530> supposed<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.830> be

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
not exactly what we're supposed to be

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.060 
not exactly what we're supposed to be
using<00:02:36.400> but<00:02:36.990> we'll<00:02:37.990> go<00:02:38.140> ahead<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.380> use<00:02:38.710> it

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
using but we'll go ahead and use it

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.270 
using but we'll go ahead and use it
anyway<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.560> lines<00:02:41.770> up

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
anyway so it lines up

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.810 
anyway so it lines up
you<00:02:42.640> know<00:02:42.760> matches<00:02:43.210> perfectly<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:45.340> what<00:02:45.700> we're

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
you know matches perfectly so what we're

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.390 
you know matches perfectly so what we're
gonna<00:02:45.880> do<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:46.360> line<00:02:46.570> it<00:02:46.720> up<00:02:46.810> with<00:02:46.990> a<00:02:47.020> little<00:02:47.400> tab

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
gonna do is line it up with a little tab

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.580 
gonna do is line it up with a little tab
right<00:02:48.640> there<00:02:48.810> make<00:02:49.810> sure<00:02:50.020> it's<00:02:50.200> all<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.560> way

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
right there make sure it's all the way

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.580 
right there make sure it's all the way
in<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.070> then<00:02:51.970> gently<00:02:52.390> just<00:02:52.780> push<00:02:53.230> down<00:02:53.440> until

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
in and then gently just push down until

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.500 
in and then gently just push down until
it<00:02:53.800> clicks

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
it clicks

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.310 
it clicks
that's<00:02:55.510> one<00:02:56.550> let's<00:02:57.550> do<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.880> other<00:02:57.910> one<00:02:58.320> this

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
that's one let's do the other one this

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.190 
that's one let's do the other one this
video<00:02:59.680> is<00:02:59.770> mainly<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.310> show<00:03:00.580> you<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:01.020> it<00:03:02.020> does

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
video is mainly to show you that it does

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.200 
video is mainly to show you that it does
work<00:03:03.090> when<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.180> have<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.390> boon<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.690> running<00:03:06.210> so

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
work when you have a boon to running so

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.710 
work when you have a boon to running so
we'll<00:03:07.390> pop<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:07.780> one<00:03:07.990> out<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:09.360> then<00:03:10.360> this<00:03:10.510> one

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
we'll pop that one out and then this one

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.870 
we'll pop that one out and then this one
goes<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:11.050> opposite<00:03:11.470> way<00:03:11.790> into<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.820> slot<00:03:13.320> here

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
goes the opposite way into a slot here

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.400 
goes the opposite way into a slot here
and<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:17.200> just<00:03:17.410> place<00:03:17.710> it<00:03:17.740> in<00:03:18.960> make<00:03:19.960> sure<00:03:19.990> that

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
and you just place it in make sure that

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.450 
and you just place it in make sure that
it's<00:03:20.590> lined<00:03:21.130> up<00:03:21.370> correctly<00:03:22.920> before<00:03:23.920> pushing

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
it's lined up correctly before pushing

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:51.540 
it's lined up correctly before pushing
on<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.110> make<00:03:26.110> sure<00:03:26.140> it's<00:03:26.470> in

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.030 

every<00:03:52.550> no<00:03:52.970> it's<00:03:53.120> it<00:03:53.620> couldn't<00:03:54.620> see<00:03:54.770> in<00:03:54.860> that

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
every no it's it couldn't see in that

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.030 
every no it's it couldn't see in that
angle<00:03:55.330> so<00:03:56.330> both<00:03:56.510> of<00:03:56.540> them<00:03:56.720> are<00:03:56.900> in<00:03:57.020> now<00:03:57.200> that's

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
angle so both of them are in now that's

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.540 
angle so both of them are in now that's
fine

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
fine

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.770 
fine
now<00:03:59.330> we<00:03:59.390> throw<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.780> cover<00:03:59.960> back<00:04:00.200> on<00:04:01.450> now<00:04:02.450> in

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
now we throw the cover back on now in

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.890 
now we throw the cover back on now in
the<00:04:02.900> future<00:04:03.260> I'm<00:04:03.560> gonna<00:04:03.740> replace<00:04:04.220> this<00:04:04.520> with<00:04:04.790> a

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
the future I'm gonna replace this with a

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.360 
the future I'm gonna replace this with a
hard<00:04:05.900> drive<00:04:06.140> you<00:04:06.470> just<00:04:06.890> got<00:04:07.010> to<00:04:07.070> make<00:04:07.130> sure<00:04:07.190> you

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
description to the one that fits

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.880 
description to the one that fits
perfectly<00:04:11.510> in<00:04:11.720> there<00:04:11.870> all<00:04:12.080> you<00:04:12.140> have<00:04:12.230> to<00:04:12.290> do<00:04:12.770> is

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
perfectly in there all you have to do is

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.040 
perfectly in there all you have to do is
take<00:04:13.070> off<00:04:13.310> this<00:04:13.910> little<00:04:14.240> clip<00:04:14.450> here<00:04:14.480> there's

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
take off this little clip here there's

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.360 
take off this little clip here there's
two<00:04:15.200> little<00:04:15.350> black<00:04:15.740> things<00:04:15.980> that<00:04:16.130> slide

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
two little black things that slide

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.580 
two little black things that slide
forward<00:04:16.700> and<00:04:16.850> you<00:04:17.690> basically<00:04:17.930> pull<00:04:18.380> it<00:04:18.500> out

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
forward and you basically pull it out

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.190 
forward and you basically pull it out
it's<00:04:18.800> just<00:04:18.860> sitting<00:04:19.250> there<00:04:19.750> then<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:20.900> put<00:04:21.110> it

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
it's just sitting there then you put it

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.010 
it's just sitting there then you put it
on<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:22.370> bracket<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.420> put<00:04:23.810> this

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
on the bracket and you put this

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.930 
on the bracket and you put this
connection<00:04:24.680> on<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:25.160> you<00:04:25.310> throw<00:04:25.520> it<00:04:25.610> back<00:04:25.730> in

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
connection on and you throw it back in

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.150 
connection on and you throw it back in
and<00:04:26.210> it<00:04:26.330> works<00:04:26.510> beautifully<00:04:26.660> and<00:04:27.140> that<00:04:28.040> will

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
and it works beautifully and that will

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.890 
and it works beautifully and that will
speed<00:04:28.430> up<00:04:28.520> your<00:04:28.640> computer<00:04:28.700> more<00:04:29.450> than<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.720> RAM

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
speed up your computer more than the RAM

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.740 
speed up your computer more than the RAM
would<00:04:30.340> so<00:04:31.340> now<00:04:31.850> we<00:04:31.910> could<00:04:32.090> just<00:04:32.240> put<00:04:32.450> the<00:04:32.540> cover

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
would so now we could just put the cover

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.180 
would so now we could just put the cover
right<00:04:33.260> back<00:04:33.470> on<00:04:33.680> like<00:04:33.920> this<00:04:34.100> and<00:04:35.890> push<00:04:36.890> forward

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
right back on like this and push forward

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.550 
right back on like this and push forward
and<00:04:37.610> it's<00:04:37.850> on<00:04:38.000> you<00:04:38.870> know<00:04:38.960> we'll<00:04:39.140> replace<00:04:39.470> the

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
and it's on you know we'll replace the

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.160 
and it's on you know we'll replace the
battery<00:04:42.790> now<00:04:43.790> that<00:04:43.970> took<00:04:44.120> seconds<00:04:44.600> usually

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
battery now that took seconds usually

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.440 
battery now that took seconds usually
computers<00:04:45.680> you<00:04:45.770> gotta<00:04:45.920> take<00:04:46.580> off<00:04:46.760> feet<00:04:47.180> and

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
computers you gotta take off feet and

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.440 
computers you gotta take off feet and
take<00:04:47.990> off<00:04:48.170> eight<00:04:48.620> screws<00:04:49.180> though<00:04:50.180> with<00:04:50.300> this

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
take off eight screws though with this

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.010 
take off eight screws though with this
you<00:04:50.630> didn't<00:04:50.840> have<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.140> do<00:04:51.290> so<00:04:52.000> now<00:04:53.000> let's<00:04:53.360> take

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
you didn't have to do so now let's take

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:11.460 
you didn't have to do so now let's take
a<00:04:54.080> look<00:04:55.720> you'll<00:04:56.720> boot<00:04:57.020> up<00:04:58.390> I'll<00:04:59.390> show<00:04:59.420> you

so<00:05:12.470> I'll<00:05:12.590> just<00:05:12.920> skip<00:05:13.520> this<00:05:13.730> with<00:05:14.000> control<00:05:14.780> D

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.499 

and<00:05:19.160> you're<00:05:19.430> gonna<00:05:19.580> see<00:05:19.910> that<00:05:20.180> it's<00:05:20.360> working

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 
and you're gonna see that it's working

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:27.959 
and you're gonna see that it's working
just<00:05:21.139> fine

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:27.969 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:42.070 

take<00:05:28.629> a<00:05:28.659> second<00:05:29.199> turn<00:05:29.439> on

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.530 

there<00:05:42.919> it<00:05:43.039> is

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
there it is

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.820 
there it is
working<00:05:46.510> now<00:05:47.510> of<00:05:47.660> course<00:05:47.840> if<00:05:48.080> you<00:05:48.200> change<00:05:48.500> the

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
working now of course if you change the

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.430 
working now of course if you change the
hard<00:05:49.730> drive<00:05:50.000> with<00:05:50.330> an<00:05:50.480> SSD<00:05:50.780> then<00:05:51.170> you'll<00:05:51.320> have

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
hard drive with an SSD then you'll have

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.010 
hard drive with an SSD then you'll have
to<00:05:51.560> put<00:05:51.770> Chrome<00:05:52.280> back<00:05:52.520> on<00:05:52.810> using<00:05:53.810> your

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
to put Chrome back on using your

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.400 
to put Chrome back on using your
recovery<00:05:54.530> and<00:05:54.970> then<00:05:56.020> you<00:05:57.020> would<00:05:57.140> have<00:05:57.260> to

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
recovery and then you would have to

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.880 
recovery and then you would have to
reinstall<00:05:57.950> a<00:05:58.250> bun<00:05:58.850> -<00:05:59.030> so<00:05:59.710> what<00:06:00.710> are<00:06:00.770> you<00:06:00.830> gonna

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:00.890 
reinstall a bun - so what are you gonna

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.050 
reinstall a bun - so what are you gonna
do<00:06:01.330> not<00:06:02.330> ready<00:06:02.510> to<00:06:03.160> increase<00:06:04.160> that<00:06:04.490> but<00:06:04.700> I<00:06:04.790> I

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
do not ready to increase that but I I

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.180 
do not ready to increase that but I I
will<00:06:05.780> and<00:06:06.140> it'll<00:06:06.410> actually<00:06:06.620> let<00:06:06.950> it<00:06:06.980> run

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
will and it'll actually let it run

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.320 
will and it'll actually let it run

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
a program on here that actually will

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.070 
a program on here that actually will
just<00:06:15.710> go<00:06:15.950> to<00:06:16.010> the<00:06:16.100> stock<00:06:16.340> one<00:06:16.780> that<00:06:17.780> actually
