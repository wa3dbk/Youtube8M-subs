hey this is chip with T NBC and we're
gonna<00:00:10.980> talk<00:00:11.160> about<00:00:11.429> one<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.750> more

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
gonna talk about one of the more

gonna talk about one of the more
frequently<00:00:13.380> asked<00:00:13.530> questions<00:00:14.009> with<00:00:14.250> PBS<00:00:14.700> for

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
frequently asked questions with PBS for

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.210 
frequently asked questions with PBS for
teens<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:16.199> how<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.560> have<00:00:17.190> a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
teens and that is how to have a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.060 
teens and that is how to have a
magnified<00:00:17.970> night<00:00:18.300> vision<00:00:18.630> view<00:00:18.930> on<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.350> weapon

magnified night vision view on a weapon
mount<00:00:20.250> system<00:00:20.930> there's<00:00:21.930> really<00:00:22.199> two<00:00:22.590> ways

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
mount system there's really two ways

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.279 
mount system there's really two ways
that<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.640> people<00:00:23.850> talk<00:00:24.570> about<00:00:24.600> doing<00:00:25.109> and

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
that that people talk about doing and

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.900 
that that people talk about doing and
one's<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.769> little<00:00:25.890> bit<00:00:26.220> more<00:00:26.250> effective<00:00:26.760> than

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
one's a little bit more effective than

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.060 
one's a little bit more effective than
the<00:00:27.029> other<00:00:27.060> we<00:00:27.810> don't<00:00:27.930> completely<00:00:28.590> recommend

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
the other we don't completely recommend

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.919 
the other we don't completely recommend
either<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.939> them<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.300> honest<00:00:30.689> with<00:00:30.840> you

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
either of them to be honest with you

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.810 
either of them to be honest with you
because<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.470> you're<00:00:32.040> kind<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.309> asking<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
because it's you're kind of asking the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.130 
because it's you're kind of asking the
system<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.450> something<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.930> wasn't

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
system to do something that it wasn't

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.680 
system to do something that it wasn't
really<00:00:34.440> meant<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.950> do<00:00:35.149> so<00:00:36.149> let's<00:00:36.300> talk<00:00:36.510> about

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
really meant to do so let's talk about

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.690 
really meant to do so let's talk about
the<00:00:37.380> first<00:00:37.649> one<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.850> not<00:00:39.750> as<00:00:40.079> effective

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
the first one that is not as effective

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.139 
the first one that is not as effective
as<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.760> know<00:00:42.120> most<00:00:42.750> red<00:00:43.170> dot<00:00:43.379> sights<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:44.190> or

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
as you know most red dot sights have or

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.930 
as you know most red dot sights have or
most<00:00:45.420> red<00:00:45.660> dot<00:00:45.809> sight<00:00:46.050> manufacturers<00:00:46.940> have

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
most red dot sight manufacturers have

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.569 
most red dot sight manufacturers have
three<00:00:48.870> power<00:00:49.140> magnifiers<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:50.399> be

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
three power magnifiers that can be

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.459 
three power magnifiers that can be
quick-detach<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.719> off<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.350> use

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
quick-detach on and off so you can use

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.069 
quick-detach on and off so you can use
it<00:00:52.620> when<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.829> need<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.250> guys<00:00:54.180> talked<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.809> lot

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
it when you need and guys talked a lot

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.010 
it when you need and guys talked a lot
about<00:00:55.289> having<00:00:55.890> their<00:00:56.250> their<00:00:56.969> aim<00:00:57.539> point<00:00:57.899> of

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
about having their their aim point of

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.189 
about having their their aim point of
their<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.350> otech<00:00:58.710> with<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.699> 3x<00:01:00.270> magnifier<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
their a otech with a 3x magnifier and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.369 
their a otech with a 3x magnifier and
then<00:01:01.559> putting<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.890> pvs-14<00:01:02.250> behind<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.379> now

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
then putting a pvs-14 behind it now

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.109 
then putting a pvs-14 behind it now
you're<00:01:04.710> aligning<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.189> lot<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.460> glass<00:01:05.640> here<00:01:06.000> and

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
you're aligning a lot of glass here and

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.480 
you're aligning a lot of glass here and
technically<00:01:07.110> yes<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.040> gonna<00:01:08.189> work

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
technically yes this is gonna work

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.609 
technically yes this is gonna work
you're<00:01:09.180> gonna<00:01:09.299> see<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> lot<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:09.960> light<00:01:10.350> loss

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
you're gonna see a lot of light loss

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.649 
you're gonna see a lot of light loss
though<00:01:10.860> because<00:01:11.100> every<00:01:11.640> time<00:01:11.880> light<00:01:12.210> travels

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
though because every time light travels

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.219 
though because every time light travels
through<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.900> lens<00:01:13.200> whether<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.010> house<00:01:15.229> we

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
through a lens whether it's a house we

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.050 
through a lens whether it's a house we
know<00:01:16.439> whether<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.250> glasses<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:17.939> your

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
know whether it's the glasses on your

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.359 
know whether it's the glasses on your
face<00:01:18.299> or<00:01:18.630> whether<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.470> not<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.830> con<00:01:19.979> your<00:01:20.130> gun

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
face or whether it's not to con your gun

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.640 
face or whether it's not to con your gun
it's<00:01:21.119> gonna<00:01:21.330> be<00:01:21.570> diminished<00:01:22.020> somewhat<00:01:22.409> and

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
it's gonna be diminished somewhat and

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.890 
it's gonna be diminished somewhat and
that<00:01:22.920> light<00:01:23.220> degradation<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:24.360> gonna<00:01:24.689> happen

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
that light degradation is gonna happen

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.789 
that light degradation is gonna happen
all<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.890> way<00:01:26.060> from<00:01:27.060> up<00:01:27.390> here<00:01:27.750> through<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
all the way from up here through the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.620 
all the way from up here through the
second<00:01:29.130> optic<00:01:29.460> before<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.000> even<00:01:30.119> hits<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
second optic before it even hits the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.630 
second optic before it even hits the
pvs-14<00:01:30.990> objective<00:01:31.829> lens<00:01:32.009> which<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
pvs-14 objective lens which is the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.520 
pvs-14 objective lens which is the
light-gathering<00:01:32.850> lens<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:34.049> you're<00:01:34.229> already

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
light-gathering lens so you're already

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.740 
light-gathering lens so you're already
behind<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.100> power<00:01:35.310> curve<00:01:35.460> before<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.540> even

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
behind the power curve before you even

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.319 
behind the power curve before you even
start<00:01:37.740> using<00:01:38.009> your<00:01:38.250> night<00:01:38.430> vision<00:01:38.460> you're

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
start using your night vision you're

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.130 
start using your night vision you're
suffering<00:01:39.869> from<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.259> lot<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.950> light<00:01:41.100> loss<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
suffering from a lot of light loss and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.109 
suffering from a lot of light loss and
the<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.350> second<00:01:43.710> reason<00:01:43.890> why<00:01:44.040> we're<00:01:44.850> not

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
the the second reason why we're not

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.300 
the the second reason why we're not
really<00:01:45.600> big<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.229> system<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:47.220> obvious

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
really big on this system is for obvious

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.569 
really big on this system is for obvious
reasons<00:01:47.960> that's<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.170> lot<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.530> freakin<00:01:50.070> glass<00:01:50.310> up

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
reasons that's a lot of freakin glass up

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.649 
reasons that's a lot of freakin glass up
there<00:01:50.720> it's<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:52.110> little<00:01:52.799> obnoxious<00:01:53.549> even<00:01:54.420> you

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
there it's a little obnoxious even you

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.179 
there it's a little obnoxious even you
you<00:01:54.840> might<00:01:55.020> say<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.500> then<00:01:55.680> when<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:55.979> go<00:01:56.130> to

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
you might say and then when you go to

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.670 
you might say and then when you go to
take<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> pvs-14<00:01:56.909> off<00:01:57.509> now<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.259> still<00:01:58.649> have

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
take the pvs-14 off now you still have

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.060 
take the pvs-14 off now you still have
your<00:01:59.040> optics<00:01:59.460> moved<00:01:59.850> way<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.619> way<00:02:01.619> way<00:02:01.890> up

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
your optics moved way the way way up

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.370 
your optics moved way the way way up
here<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:02.939> not<00:02:03.719> conducive<00:02:03.990> to

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
here it's just it's not conducive to

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
setup is a little bit more conducive

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.740

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
lens of the goggle so you're not going

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.470 
lens of the goggle so you're not going
to<00:02:44.900> suffer<00:02:45.260> technically<00:02:46.190> as<00:02:46.430> much<00:02:46.910> light<00:02:47.209> loss

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
to suffer technically as much light loss

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.229 
to suffer technically as much light loss
as<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.810> might<00:02:48.200> on<00:02:48.530> this<00:02:49.130> other<00:02:49.370> system<00:02:49.670> but

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
as you might on this other system but

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.949 
as you might on this other system but
you<00:02:51.080> can<00:02:51.110> still<00:02:51.799> see<00:02:52.010> this<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.489> very<00:02:53.180> big

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
you can still see this is a very big

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.960 
you can still see this is a very big
optic<00:02:54.500> that<00:02:54.709> you're<00:02:54.830> putting<00:02:55.130> behind<00:02:55.340> your

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
optic that you're putting behind your

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.750 
optic that you're putting behind your
red<00:02:56.180> dot<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.599> that's<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.799> big<00:02:58.250> key<00:02:58.489> right<00:02:58.730> there

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
red dot and that's a big key right there

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.819 
red dot and that's a big key right there
is<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.299> PBS<00:03:00.200> four<00:03:00.440> teens<00:03:00.680> are<00:03:00.799> not

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
is that PBS four teens are not

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.580 
is that PBS four teens are not
collimated<00:03:01.790> optics<00:03:02.209> so<00:03:02.390> they<00:03:02.540> cannot<00:03:02.930> go<00:03:03.290> in

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
collimated optics so they cannot go in

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.759 
collimated optics so they cannot go in
front<00:03:04.130> of<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.549> red<00:03:05.000> dot<00:03:05.150> sight<00:03:05.480> when<00:03:05.930> mounted<00:03:06.680> on

front of a red dot sight when mounted on
the<00:03:06.890> weapon<00:03:07.250> they<00:03:07.910> always<00:03:08.569> have<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.900> go<00:03:09.019> behind

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
the weapon they always have to go behind

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.530 
the weapon they always have to go behind
it<00:03:09.709> doesn't<00:03:10.700> matter<00:03:10.850> whether<00:03:11.269> they're

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
it doesn't matter whether they're

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.170 
it doesn't matter whether they're
perfectly<00:03:12.109> aligned<00:03:12.530> parallel<00:03:13.519> or<00:03:14.030> anything

perfectly aligned parallel or anything
like<00:03:14.359> that<00:03:14.420> as<00:03:14.750> long<00:03:14.780> as<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:15.140> get<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.560> optic

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
like that as long as you get the optic

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.280 
like that as long as you get the optic
behind<00:03:16.250> both<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:17.000> red<00:03:17.180> dot<00:03:17.329> sight<00:03:17.600> you<00:03:18.109> can

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
behind both the red dot sight you can

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.110 
behind both the red dot sight you can
technically<00:03:18.799> see<00:03:19.100> through<00:03:19.340> it<00:03:19.489> and<00:03:19.670> be

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
technically see through it and be

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.069 
technically see through it and be
alright<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.780> get<00:03:21.410> your<00:03:21.650> hits<00:03:21.889> but<00:03:23.079> this

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
alright and get your hits but this

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.220 
alright and get your hits but this
system<00:03:24.980> itself<00:03:25.459> it's<00:03:26.000> just<00:03:26.299> it's<00:03:26.569> huge

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
system itself it's just it's huge

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.550 
system itself it's just it's huge
so<00:03:28.209> what's<00:03:29.209> more<00:03:31.180> during<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.239> day<00:03:32.500> now<00:03:33.500> you

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
so what's more during the day now you

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.400 
so what's more during the day now you
have<00:03:33.799> a<00:03:33.829> setup<00:03:34.069> like<00:03:34.280> this<00:03:34.519> your<00:03:35.389> weapon<00:03:35.900> has

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
have a setup like this your weapon has

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.680 
have a setup like this your weapon has
your<00:03:36.680> optic<00:03:37.040> way<00:03:37.519> up<00:03:37.790> here<00:03:37.970> on<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.150> hand<00:03:38.359> cards

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
your optic way up here on the hand cards

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.879 
your optic way up here on the hand cards
and<00:03:38.900> if<00:03:39.019> you<00:03:39.139> don't<00:03:39.290> have<00:03:39.440> railed<00:03:39.769> handguard

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
and if you don't have railed handguard

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.670 
and if you don't have railed handguard
which<00:03:40.870> there's<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.959> lot<00:03:42.109> of<00:03:42.230> guys<00:03:42.319> that<00:03:42.530> don't

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
which there's a lot of guys that don't

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.420 
which there's a lot of guys that don't
this<00:03:43.579> is<00:03:43.760> not<00:03:44.299> gonna<00:03:44.480> work<00:03:44.690> out<00:03:44.900> for<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.319> so<00:03:45.950> in
