00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 t people hope you're fine 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.970
 it's Saturday noon and today I 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.390
 am currently preparing my meal 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.010
 midday 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.469
 I was a little scared I will make myself a 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.429
 little millet even clean style I will you 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.450
 show a little what I'm going 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.580
 do it so I 'm preparing 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:21.630
 so pasta carbonara made me 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.850
 the battles at carbo diet version or 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.990
 dropped it 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:32.730
 so we take the hot wind chicken 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:38.520
 up with olive oil is a tech we 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:42.809
 Background of the hop stove there is taken a 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:51.110
 paper with a mass a little war except 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:52.230
 you have that you are a little here 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.239
 trash can 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.820
 now we put the chicken breast 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.969
 in which brand did I take master cock 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.190
 why master cock those who speak 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.960
 english understand we have nothing to do 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.729
 but simply because because 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.130
 it was styles shine there in the east 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.200
 boxes of 1200 grams 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.720
 so it's easier for me and tight 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.640
 and shouted you're using so that's for sure 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.759
 it's not for taste so I'm doing 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.900
 kind of put my 150 g of meat that 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.520
 it can be 200 g 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.090
 we begin a virtuous while waiting 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.210
 go put 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.930
 we will prepare the complete pasta 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.490
 would not have complete 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.299
 I got bored 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.110
 I took wholemeal spaghetti so there 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.340
 we will put 150 g of dough we will not 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.810
 to be too greedy on the legs no 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.590
 more hop 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.600
 so that's all we can be 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.549
 simply instead of making fatals 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.020
 in carbo has two ways to be there instead 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.909
 to put money you will put 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.340
 at all the chickens and instead of putting 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.720
 white paws you have if 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.080
 possible the master is pasta 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.080
 complete 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.239
 it can be great and for the cream 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.230
 fresh 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.190
 then I go back to fresh cream while 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.950
 simply by the white cheese 0 % all 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.019
 just so with that in fact you 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.360
 must put the cottage cheese learned that 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.560
 like a white game in the pan just to 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.060
 the housewife chicken with him 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.519
 now we will wait for any star and 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.590
 girls that she is after then so where 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.230
 is that about blondes anymore 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.580
 start to be not bad at all hop on 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.580
 will put the white chrome 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.010
 we will lower the temperature just before 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:57.340
 this we will have added another way there we 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:03:09.400
 pass a little bit we moved saint-die 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:13.170
 so here we mix everything here 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.170
 cream we will add a little more 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:25.000
 and here lp cables have the legs we are 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.840

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.010
 were taking another small meal then not 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.420
 to complete with the chicken so in this 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.130
 menu we put 100 g of cottage cheese 0% 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.650
 150 g of doubled chicken breasts 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:46.720
 stride and 150 g of complete spaghetti 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:49.900
 so in total we to 63 g of protein 109 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.970
 grams of fat and carbohydrate and 5.3 g 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.769

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.120

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.389

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.340
 I admit that here the diet begins to 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.769

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.160
