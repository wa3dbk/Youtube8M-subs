it's right on the goal line there now

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.219 
it's right on the goal line there now
the<00:01:32.100> head<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.700> all<00:01:33.000> right<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.689> over<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.889 
tall here I almost think the white head
of<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> stick<00:01:42.030> might<00:01:42.329> have<00:01:42.450> helped<00:01:42.659> him<00:01:42.750> out
