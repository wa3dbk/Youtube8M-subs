00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.889
 and present very interesting 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.650
 double knitting tool 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:14.110
 decker double hooks for lifting 5 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.730
 see when you constantly need 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.910
 lift loops naturally if not 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.070
 consoles gum 2 by 2 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.000
 but you have to lift these loops 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:29.970
 such a thing two times save time here 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.970
 me 2 loops purl remain 2 loops 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.150
 I immediately descend these hem for caps 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.950
 gum anything 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.820
 immediately two loops bloom full 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.390
 loop stitch 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.390
 double 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.110
 as usual we leave one loop at the bottom 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:07.310
 put a loop on the needle i start 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:12.650
 lift everything is done just like 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.640
 if it was a single hook on 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:21.320
 children 2 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:25.930
 and they do it at the same time and now 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.440
 leaves sold twice less but the rise 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.440
 from no newcomer 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.329
 such hooks can theoretically be 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.030
 triple quarters just probably it 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.689
 not very comfortable double quite 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.369
 copes with its task because 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.570
 control three hooks will be already 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.689
 harder a little 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.759
 and two is the most-thing to receive 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.819
 on the bitch, an even petelin column is raised 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.960
 it turns out how much time I have it 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:04.470
 raise how much time did you raise 22 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.509
 then I put these bars on 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:15.360
 I picked up the needle 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:19.110
 loops look how cool absolutely 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.959
 even beautiful land wonderful 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.760
 elastic 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.890
 it is more elastic because you see 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.750
 here these loops do not touch here 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.510
 it turns out too untouched because 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.579
 that when I lift one hook off 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.380
 I get a little inconsistency loops 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:39.540
 equal between them is a strip and 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.220
 it doesn't look so neat it 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.500
 double hook copes tasks 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.510
 much more efficient than single can 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.690
 watch this hook and order it 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.000
 on our website, see how it is 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.269
 makes life easier for boredom 3 goes your 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.170
 work two needles cost two following 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.170
 dissolve 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.690
 and in general if you are interested in spare parts for 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.200
 knitting machines it's like a 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.640
 him 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.560
 from 1 to 11 contact us at 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.160
 we are engaged in us 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.160
 spare parts for car spare parts and 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.160
 accessories 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.690
 but such a hook I'm sure that none of 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:37.360
 you have never seen it completely 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:41.810
 new product that we offer you 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:46.790
 look and if interested to order 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.440
 because I really liked not 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.320
 such a chicken will not refuse and I will 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.220
 use or joyfully a little bit 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.290
 to adapt 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.290
 see how fast it works 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.819
 I raised 2 stitch posts all 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.299
 hartge for caps can be literally done 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.299
 for there up to 10 minutes 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.760
 see how to do keeps the shape of the gum 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.320
 bound by this hook she really doesn't 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.100
 stretch and it is absolutely 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:39.360
 equally on the left side and on the right behind 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.310
 account of what we shot and wore two 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.280
 there are no loops at the same time 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.500
 no distance and loop 1 perfect 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.070
 gum size symmetry right 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.070
 if you do it better 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.070
 it turns out
