00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
program I'm going to link an article in

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.340 
program I'm going to link an article in
the<00:00:56.760> description<00:00:56.850> box<00:00:57.329> where<00:00:57.510> he<00:00:57.690> outlines<00:00:58.109> it

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the description box where he outlines it

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.590 
the description box where he outlines it
but<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> basics<00:00:59.250> are<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.550> real<00:00:59.730> focus<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.420> on

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
but the basics are the real focus is on

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.599 
but the basics are the real focus is on
the<00:01:00.719> assistance<00:01:01.260> work<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> Wendler

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
the assistance work so for the Wendler

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.520 
the assistance work so for the Wendler
sets<00:01:02.879> you're<00:01:03.180> not<00:01:03.390> supposed<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.960> go<00:01:04.140> over<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
sets you're not supposed to go over the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.440 
sets you're not supposed to go over the
exceeded<00:01:04.949> amount<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.339> reps<00:01:05.580> for<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.000> plus<00:01:06.210> set

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
exceeded amount of reps for the plus set

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.420 
exceeded amount of reps for the plus set
hence<00:01:06.960> why<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.290> stopped<00:01:07.619> at<00:01:07.799> 5<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.369> case

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
hence why I stopped at 5 in this case

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.640 
hence why I stopped at 5 in this case
the<00:01:09.210> focus<00:01:09.570> being<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.020> assistance<00:01:10.470> work

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
the focus being on the assistance work

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.740 
the focus being on the assistance work
is<00:01:10.860> then<00:01:11.070> followed<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:11.520> by<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.909> opposite<00:01:12.540> lift

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
is then followed up by the opposite lift

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.230 
is then followed up by the opposite lift
so<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.350> case<00:01:13.650> overhead<00:01:14.549> press<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.030> bench

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
so in this case overhead press and bench

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.240 
so in this case overhead press and bench
our<00:01:15.450> flip-flop<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.770> squats<00:01:17.070> and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
our flip-flop and then it's squats and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.280 
our flip-flop and then it's squats and
deadlifts<00:01:17.580> our<00:01:17.759> flip-flop<00:01:18.180> as<00:01:18.390> well<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.049> for

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
deadlifts our flip-flop as well so for

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.140 
deadlifts our flip-flop as well so for
today<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.560> start<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:20.009> overhead<00:01:20.369> press<00:01:20.640> then

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
today you start with overhead press then

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.850 
today you start with overhead press then
you<00:01:21.270> go<00:01:21.390> into<00:01:21.509> five<00:01:21.869> sets<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.350> 10<00:01:22.590> for

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
you go into five sets of 10 for

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.850 
you go into five sets of 10 for
benchpress<00:01:23.220> using<00:01:23.970> 50%<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:25.080> your<00:01:25.229> projected<00:01:25.650> 1

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
benchpress using 50% of your projected 1

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.399 
benchpress using 50% of your projected 1
rep<00:01:26.070> max<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.580> here<00:01:26.759> I'm<00:01:26.850> doing<00:01:27.000> 5<00:01:27.689> sets<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.140> 10

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
rep max so here I'm doing 5 sets of 10

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.580 
rep max so here I'm doing 5 sets of 10
of<00:01:28.619> 195<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:30.090> second<00:01:30.540> month<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.049> program

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
of 195 the second month of this program

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.710 
of 195 the second month of this program
instead<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.100> doing<00:01:32.340> 50%<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.270> bump<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.600> up<00:01:33.659> to

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
instead of doing 50% you bump it up to

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.580 
instead of doing 50% you bump it up to
60%<00:01:34.290> third<00:01:35.250> month<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.759> use<00:01:35.869> 70%<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.380> each

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
60% third month you use 70% so each

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.020 
60% third month you use 70% so each
month<00:01:37.890> you're<00:01:38.070> upping<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.520> percentages

suggestion assistance work you could
suggest<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.829> then<00:01:44.040> follow<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.430> up

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
suggest this and then follow this up

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.210 
suggest this and then follow this up
with<00:01:44.790> 5<00:01:45.060> sets<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.509> 10<00:01:45.810> 4<00:01:46.049> chins<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:47.130> he

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
with 5 sets of 10 4 chins and then he

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.590 
with 5 sets of 10 4 chins and then he
gives<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.460> some<00:01:47.610> options<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:48.090> what<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.420> want

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
gives you some options on what you want

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.450 
gives you some options on what you want
to<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.140> you'll<00:01:49.259> see<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.500> as<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.040> program

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
to do but you'll see that as the program

00:01:50.460 --> 00:03:06.850 
to do but you'll see that as the program
continues

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.500 

so<00:03:07.860> as<00:03:07.980> mentioned<00:03:08.220> now<00:03:08.519> five<00:03:08.760> sets<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.180> ten<00:03:09.390> on

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
so as mentioned now five sets of ten on

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.330 
so as mentioned now five sets of ten on
chins<00:03:09.870> I'm<00:03:10.110> exciting<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.650> just<00:03:10.830> use<00:03:10.950> my<00:03:10.980> body

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
chins I'm exciting to just use my body

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.559 
chins I'm exciting to just use my body
weight<00:03:11.580> here<00:03:11.819> because<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.150> want<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.390> kind<00:03:12.480> of

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
weight here because I want to kind of

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.059 
weight here because I want to kind of
get<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.750> feel<00:03:12.959> for<00:03:12.989> how<00:03:13.230> this<00:03:13.409> is<00:03:13.530> going<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.890> go

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
get a feel for how this is going to go

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.649 
get a feel for how this is going to go
the<00:03:14.670> first<00:03:14.879> couple<00:03:15.150> sets<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.510> were

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
the first couple sets of this were

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.390 
the first couple sets of this were
pretty<00:03:15.930> easy<00:03:16.110> as<00:03:16.440> they<00:03:16.620> were<00:03:16.680> with<00:03:16.920> bench<00:03:17.159> but

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
pretty easy as they were with bench but

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.619 
pretty easy as they were with bench but
when<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:17.549> starts<00:03:17.790> getting<00:03:18.030> two<00:03:18.090> sets<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.390> four

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
when you starts getting two sets of four

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.270 
when you starts getting two sets of four
and<00:03:18.780> five<00:03:18.989> they<00:03:19.319> do<00:03:19.379> become<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:19.829> lot<00:03:20.069> tougher

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
and five they do become a lot tougher

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.309 
and five they do become a lot tougher
going<00:03:20.970> forward<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.450> will<00:03:21.510> probably<00:03:21.900> add<00:03:22.019> some

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
going forward I will probably add some

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.440 
going forward I will probably add some
resistance<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:23.010> this<00:03:23.220> he<00:03:23.640> also<00:03:23.819> suggests<00:03:24.329> in

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
resistance to this he also suggests in

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.490 
resistance to this he also suggests in
the<00:03:24.540> article<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:24.989> you<00:03:25.110> use<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.260> different

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
the article that you use a different

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.350 
the article that you use a different
hand<00:03:25.829> position<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.280> grip<00:03:26.519> for<00:03:26.730> each<00:03:26.879> set<00:03:27.180> and

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
hand position and grip for each set and

00:03:27.360 --> 00:04:57.080 
hand position and grip for each set and
that's<00:03:27.510> exactly<00:03:27.810> what<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:28.200> do

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.060 

curls<00:04:59.930> squat<00:05:00.930> rack

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
curls squat rack

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.850 
curls squat rack
and<00:05:02.550> describe<00:05:04.280> another<00:05:05.280> please<00:05:05.640> go<00:05:05.790> back

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
and describe another please go back

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.580 
and describe another please go back
do<00:05:08.520> this

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.300 

figured<00:05:12.590> I'd<00:05:12.650> go<00:05:12.770> ahead<00:05:12.890> and<00:05:13.040> show<00:05:13.130> you<00:05:13.190> that

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
figured I'd go ahead and show you that

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.770 
figured I'd go ahead and show you that
no<00:05:13.460> one's<00:05:13.640> using<00:05:13.760> the<00:05:13.910> squat<00:05:14.150> rack<00:05:14.180> so<00:05:14.570> no<00:05:14.660> one

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
no one's using the squat rack so no one

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.630 
no one's using the squat rack so no one
can<00:05:14.900> yell<00:05:15.050> at<00:05:15.140> me<00:05:15.230> for<00:05:15.410> curling<00:05:15.710> here<00:05:15.980> so<00:05:16.460> this

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
can yell at me for curling here so this

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.590 
can yell at me for curling here so this
is<00:05:16.820> kind<00:05:17.000> of<00:05:17.090> where<00:05:17.210> it<00:05:17.300> gets<00:05:17.450> more

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
is kind of where it gets more

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.730 
is kind of where it gets more
interesting<00:05:17.780> edge<00:05:18.110> he<00:05:18.320> gives<00:05:18.500> you<00:05:18.590> some

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
interesting edge he gives you some

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.350 
interesting edge he gives you some
options<00:05:18.860> these<00:05:19.280> aren't<00:05:19.550> necessary<00:05:20.090> lifts

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
options these aren't necessary lifts

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.910 
options these aren't necessary lifts
spread<00:05:20.630> aside<00:05:20.840> to<00:05:20.960> add<00:05:21.080> them<00:05:21.260> in<00:05:21.410> because<00:05:21.770> what

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
spread aside to add them in because what

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.290 
spread aside to add them in because what
I'm<00:05:22.010> trying<00:05:22.220> to<00:05:22.310> do<00:05:22.400> is<00:05:22.520> up<00:05:22.700> the<00:05:22.850> volume<00:05:23.180> a<00:05:23.270> bit

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
I'm trying to do is up the volume a bit

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.270 
I'm trying to do is up the volume a bit
one<00:05:24.110> of<00:05:24.200> the<00:05:24.260> things<00:05:24.470> that<00:05:24.650> I<00:05:24.680> really<00:05:24.920> like<00:05:25.100> is

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
one of the things that I really like is

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.040 
one of the things that I really like is
training<00:05:25.670> everything<00:05:25.910> twice<00:05:26.330> per<00:05:26.570> week<00:05:26.750> this

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
training everything twice per week this

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.020 
training everything twice per week this
program<00:05:27.560> now<00:05:27.770> allows<00:05:28.010> me<00:05:28.220> to<00:05:28.310> do<00:05:28.460> it<00:05:28.610> based<00:05:28.850> off

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
program now allows me to do it based off

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.820 
program now allows me to do it based off
the<00:05:29.180> way<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.420> assistants<00:05:29.870> work<00:05:30.050> is<00:05:30.230> laid<00:05:30.440> out

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
the way the assistants work is laid out

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.200 
the way the assistants work is laid out
it<00:05:31.100> also<00:05:31.250> lets<00:05:31.490> me<00:05:31.670> do<00:05:31.790> a<00:05:31.820> little<00:05:31.970> bit<00:05:32.180> more

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
it also lets me do a little bit more

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.480 
it also lets me do a little bit more
volume<00:05:32.660> each<00:05:32.960> day<00:05:33.200> so<00:05:33.260> I'm<00:05:33.590> doing<00:05:33.830> around<00:05:34.040> 20

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
volume each day so I'm doing around 20

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.610 
volume each day so I'm doing around 20
sets<00:05:34.700> on<00:05:34.940> this<00:05:35.270> day<00:05:35.480> which<00:05:36.020> is<00:05:36.140> very<00:05:36.350> similar

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
sets on this day which is very similar

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.560 
sets on this day which is very similar
to<00:05:36.740> the<00:05:36.980> upper<00:05:37.310> lower<00:05:37.520> split<00:05:37.940> that<00:05:38.060> I<00:05:38.120> follow<00:05:38.480> a

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
to the upper lower split that I follow a

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.970 
to the upper lower split that I follow a
couple<00:05:38.930> months<00:05:39.140> back<00:05:39.290> that<00:05:39.530> I<00:05:39.590> saw<00:05:39.770> a<00:05:39.800> great

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
couple months back that I saw a great

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.070 
couple months back that I saw a great
progress<00:05:40.280> on<00:05:40.640> I<00:05:40.880> find<00:05:41.330> that<00:05:41.540> as<00:05:41.660> far<00:05:41.840> as<00:05:41.870> volume

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
progress on I find that as far as volume

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.350 
progress on I find that as far as volume
goes<00:05:42.410> this<00:05:42.620> is<00:05:42.770> kind<00:05:42.980> of<00:05:43.040> my<00:05:43.190> sweet<00:05:43.490> spot<00:05:43.610> about

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
goes this is kind of my sweet spot about

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.120 
goes this is kind of my sweet spot about
20<00:05:44.720> sets<00:05:44.900> hitting<00:05:45.260> everything<00:05:45.470> twice<00:05:45.860> per

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
20 sets hitting everything twice per

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.190 
20 sets hitting everything twice per
week<00:05:46.160> so<00:05:46.970> for<00:05:47.240> that<00:05:47.390> curls<00:05:47.750> I<00:05:47.870> actually<00:05:47.960> did

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
week so for that curls I actually did

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.660 
week so for that curls I actually did
three<00:05:48.440> sets<00:05:48.650> of<00:05:48.740> ten<00:05:48.980> only<00:05:49.220> film<00:05:49.430> the<00:05:49.520> first

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
three sets of ten only film the first
