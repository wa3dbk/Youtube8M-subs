00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
computing of the environment so that we

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.430 
computing of the environment so that we

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
can understand what's going on out in

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.079 
can understand what's going on out in
the<00:00:56.769> natural<00:00:57.129> world<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.550> immediately

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
the natural world and immediately

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.990 
the natural world and immediately
respond<00:00:58.660> to<00:00:59.170> things<00:00:59.440> when<00:00:59.859> they<00:00:59.980> go<00:01:00.129> wrong<00:01:00.399> so

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
respond to things when they go wrong so

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.369 
respond to things when they go wrong so
we're<00:01:01.120> doing<00:01:01.239> that<00:01:01.510> in<00:01:01.690> in<00:01:01.960> two<00:01:02.170> particular

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
we're doing that in in two particular

in<00:01:54.399> about<00:01:54.880> five<00:01:55.119> minutes<00:01:55.509> we<00:01:55.960> plug<00:01:56.289> together

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
in about five minutes we plug together

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.980 
in about five minutes we plug together
the<00:01:56.829> little<00:01:57.070> modules<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:57.729> devices<00:01:58.420> we<00:01:58.780> wrote

behind here they they range so far that
we<00:02:40.580> don't<00:02:40.670> actually<00:02:41.269> know<00:02:41.480> where<00:02:42.260> they're

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
we don't actually know where they're

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.380 
we don't actually know where they're
going<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.769> be<00:02:42.860> going<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.640> within<00:02:43.849> a<00:02:44.060> nearest

going to be going to to within a nearest

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.880 
going to be going to to within a nearest
kilometre<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.989> go<00:02:45.019> and<00:02:45.230> get<00:02:45.349> their<00:02:45.560> their

kilometre to go and get their their
their<00:02:46.130> data<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.700> so<00:02:47.180> we're<00:02:47.420> starting<00:02:47.569> to<00:02:47.840> put

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
their data and so we're starting to put

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.289 
their data and so we're starting to put

unmanned aerial vehicles can fly around

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.080 
unmanned aerial vehicles can fly around
and<00:03:12.560> listen<00:03:12.980> for<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.250> presence<00:03:13.700> of<00:03:13.880> these

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
and listen for the presence of these

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.150 
and listen for the presence of these
devices<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.810> when<00:03:14.930> they<00:03:15.019> hear<00:03:15.319> them<00:03:15.500> they<00:03:15.980> can

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
devices and when they hear them they can

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.250 
devices and when they hear them they can
fly<00:03:16.489> over<00:03:16.519> there<00:03:17.120> they<00:03:17.510> can<00:03:17.690> switch<00:03:18.019> their

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
fly over there they can switch their

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.979 
fly over there they can switch their
autopilot<00:03:18.709> mode<00:03:18.950> to<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.970> device<00:03:20.239> itself<00:03:20.480> and

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
autopilot mode to the device itself and

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.740 
autopilot mode to the device itself and
suddenly<00:03:21.650> you<00:03:21.829> have<00:03:22.040> actually<00:03:22.760> an<00:03:22.880> elephant

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
suddenly you have actually an elephant

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.479 
suddenly you have actually an elephant
driven<00:03:24.079> drone<00:03:24.380> right<00:03:24.769> as<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.100> elephant's

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
driven drone right as the elephant's

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.580 
driven drone right as the elephant's
wandering<00:03:25.940> around<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.480> drones<00:03:26.959> following<00:03:27.470> it

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
wandering around the drones following it

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.190 
wandering around the drones following it
and<00:03:27.620> taking<00:03:28.190> high-definition<00:03:29.090> video<00:03:29.750> imagery

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
and taking high-definition video imagery

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.699 
and taking high-definition video imagery
and<00:03:30.470> so<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:32.450> issue<00:03:32.630> about<00:03:32.989> that<00:03:33.260> high<00:03:33.500> def

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
and so the the issue about that high def

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.879 
and so the the issue about that high def
and<00:03:33.889> video<00:03:34.100> imagery<00:03:34.549> is<00:03:35.410> pretty<00:03:36.410> important

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
and video imagery is pretty important

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.650 
and video imagery is pretty important
because<00:03:37.069> no<00:03:37.519> matter<00:03:37.670> how<00:03:37.880> cheap<00:03:38.239> we<00:03:38.450> make

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
because no matter how cheap we make

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.849 
because no matter how cheap we make
these<00:03:38.810> we're<00:03:39.049> not<00:03:39.170> going<00:03:39.290> to<00:03:39.350> get<00:03:39.500> them<00:03:39.590> on<00:03:39.680> all

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
these we're not going to get them on all

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.400 
these we're not going to get them on all
the<00:03:40.010> elephants<00:03:40.459> out<00:03:41.239> there<00:03:41.569> and<00:03:41.780> so<00:03:42.139> really

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
the elephants out there and so really

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.930 
the elephants out there and so really
what<00:03:42.739> what<00:03:43.010> this<00:03:43.280> does<00:03:43.519> is<00:03:43.700> it<00:03:43.819> takes

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
what what this does is it takes

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.030 
what what this does is it takes
long-term<00:03:44.329> from<00:03:45.200> a<00:03:45.290> temporal<00:03:45.829> perspective

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
long-term from a temporal perspective

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.910 
long-term from a temporal perspective
data<00:03:46.730> on<00:03:46.940> where<00:03:47.389> an<00:03:47.540> elephant<00:03:47.930> is<00:03:48.079> and<00:03:48.350> then<00:03:48.739> in

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
data on where an elephant is and then in

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.949 
data on where an elephant is and then in
the<00:03:49.190> short<00:03:49.459> term<00:03:49.670> we<00:03:49.940> can<00:03:50.269> have<00:03:50.359> drones<00:03:50.630> flying

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
the short term we can have drones flying

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.050 
the short term we can have drones flying
around<00:03:51.230> taking<00:03:51.769> video<00:03:52.130> imagery<00:03:52.549> to<00:03:52.790> figure

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
around taking video imagery to figure

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.000 
around taking video imagery to figure
out<00:03:53.209> what<00:03:53.600> all<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:54.019> elephants<00:03:54.410> around<00:03:54.769> that

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
out what all the elephants around that

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.830 
out what all the elephants around that
other<00:03:55.160> one<00:03:55.400> are<00:03:55.670> doing<00:03:55.970> as<00:03:56.090> well<00:03:56.299> but<00:03:56.750> of

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
other one are doing as well but of

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.940 
other one are doing as well but of
course<00:03:56.870> that<00:03:57.139> means<00:03:57.380> that<00:03:57.620> we<00:03:57.739> have<00:03:57.769> to

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
course that means that we have to

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.370 
course that means that we have to
extract<00:03:58.609> the<00:03:58.910> information<00:03:59.060> the<00:04:00.019> tract

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
extract the information the tract

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.259 
extract the information the tract
information<00:04:01.130> from<00:04:01.430> those<00:04:01.579> other<00:04:01.819> elephants

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
information from those other elephants

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.699 
information from those other elephants
that<00:04:02.359> aren't<00:04:02.569> wearing<00:04:02.720> our<00:04:02.900> devices<00:04:03.170> from

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
that aren't wearing our devices from

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.440 
that aren't wearing our devices from
video<00:04:04.069> imagery<00:04:04.519> that's<00:04:04.730> collected<00:04:05.180> from<00:04:05.299> the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
video imagery that's collected from the

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.879 
video imagery that's collected from the
drone<00:04:05.630> so<00:04:06.019> i'm<00:04:06.079> going<00:04:06.200> to<00:04:06.260> show<00:04:06.410> you<00:04:06.440> just<00:04:06.590> a

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
drone so i'm going to show you just a

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.309 
drone so i'm going to show you just a
bit<00:04:07.099> of<00:04:07.340> early<00:04:07.880> version<00:04:08.510> software<00:04:08.720> that<00:04:09.170> we've

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
bit of early version software that we've

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.670 
bit of early version software that we've
used<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.920> to<00:04:10.730> do<00:04:10.910> just<00:04:11.209> that<00:04:11.299> I<00:04:11.930> couldn't<00:04:12.500> put

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
used to to do just that I couldn't put

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.740 
used to to do just that I couldn't put
elephants<00:04:13.190> in<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.340> box<00:04:13.549> and<00:04:13.760> I<00:04:14.030> was<00:04:14.209> interested

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
elephants in a box and I was interested

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.210 
elephants in a box and I was interested
in<00:04:14.959> doing<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:15.530> bit<00:04:15.680> more<00:04:15.829> of<00:04:15.889> a<00:04:16.010> laboratory

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
in doing a bit more of a laboratory

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.520 
in doing a bit more of a laboratory
style<00:04:16.820> experiment<00:04:17.389> so<00:04:17.720> instead<00:04:17.989> I<00:04:18.049> put<00:04:18.289> some

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
style experiment so instead I put some

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.199 
style experiment so instead I put some
some<00:04:19.070> bees<00:04:19.250> in<00:04:19.430> a<00:04:19.489> box<00:04:19.669> and<00:04:19.820> they're<00:04:19.940> flying

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
some bees in a box and they're flying

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.480 
some bees in a box and they're flying
around<00:04:20.570> and<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:21.470> choosing<00:04:21.979> between<00:04:22.070> white

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
around and and choosing between white

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.339 
around and and choosing between white
and<00:04:22.520> purple<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.270> white<00:04:23.360> flowers<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.229> they

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
and purple and white flowers that they

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.830 
and purple and white flowers that they
want<00:04:24.530> to<00:04:24.740> feed<00:04:25.729> from<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.270> I<00:04:26.450> just<00:04:26.659> want<00:04:26.810> to

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
want to feed from and I just want to

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.409 
want to feed from and I just want to
show<00:04:26.990> you<00:04:27.080> really<00:04:27.470> quickly<00:04:27.950> how<00:04:28.099> easily<00:04:28.640> the

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
show you really quickly how easily the

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:30.679 
show you really quickly how easily the
software<00:04:29.900> allows<00:04:30.169> you

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:30.689 
software allows you

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:33.559 
software allows you
extract<00:04:31.199> tracks<00:04:31.679> from<00:04:32.099> from<00:04:32.549> images<00:04:32.939> and<00:04:33.149> so

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 
extract tracks from from images and so

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.949 
extract tracks from from images and so
you<00:04:33.659> can<00:04:33.809> see<00:04:33.959> this<00:04:34.110> be<00:04:34.409> flying<00:04:34.889> around<00:04:35.219> here

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:35.959 
you can see this be flying around here

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:38.659 
you can see this be flying around here
it's<00:04:36.959> really<00:04:37.289> hard<00:04:37.499> to<00:04:37.679> actually<00:04:38.309> even

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
it's really hard to actually even

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.309 
it's really hard to actually even
determine<00:04:38.909> that<00:04:39.149> it<00:04:39.269> is<00:04:39.389> a<00:04:39.419> B<00:04:39.659> it's<00:04:39.869> going<00:04:40.139> so

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:40.319 
determine that it is a B it's going so

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:42.949 
determine that it is a B it's going so
fast<00:04:40.559> but<00:04:41.309> you<00:04:41.489> can<00:04:41.639> see<00:04:41.849> that<00:04:42.059> if<00:04:42.149> I<00:04:42.269> say<00:04:42.569> okay

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:42.959 
fast but you can see that if I say okay

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:45.289 
fast but you can see that if I say okay
I'm<00:04:43.739> going<00:04:43.949> to<00:04:44.009> call<00:04:44.249> this<00:04:44.459> the<00:04:44.669> first<00:04:44.909> frame

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:45.299 
I'm going to call this the first frame

00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:47.449 
I'm going to call this the first frame
and<00:04:45.839> I'm<00:04:45.929> going<00:04:46.110> to<00:04:46.169> click<00:04:46.409> on<00:04:46.589> this<00:04:46.769> be<00:04:47.039> here

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:47.459 
and I'm going to click on this be here

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:49.039 
and I'm going to click on this be here
which<00:04:47.759> is<00:04:47.909> really<00:04:48.119> just<00:04:48.209> a<00:04:48.449> blur<00:04:48.719> in<00:04:48.929> the

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:49.049 
which is really just a blur in the

00:04:49.049 --> 00:04:50.359 
which is really just a blur in the
imagery<00:04:49.409> you<00:04:49.679> can<00:04:49.799> see<00:04:49.919> the<00:04:50.039> software

00:04:50.359 --> 00:04:50.369 
imagery you can see the software

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:53.629 
imagery you can see the software
immediately<00:04:50.999> makes<00:04:51.209> a<00:04:51.329> mistake<00:04:51.889> but<00:04:52.889> if<00:04:53.489> I

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
immediately makes a mistake but if I

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.179 
immediately makes a mistake but if I
then<00:04:53.849> go<00:04:54.029> to<00:04:54.089> the<00:04:54.239> end<00:04:54.479> and<00:04:54.719> i<00:04:55.169> click<00:04:55.409> on<00:04:55.589> on<00:04:55.860> the

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:56.189 
then go to the end and i click on on the

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:58.939 
then go to the end and i click on on the
B<00:04:56.309> again<00:04:57.229> you<00:04:58.229> can<00:04:58.379> see<00:04:58.499> the<00:04:58.619> software

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
B again you can see the software

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.159 
B again you can see the software
immediately<00:04:59.399> makes<00:04:59.579> another<00:04:59.879> mistake<00:05:00.299> but

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
immediately makes another mistake but

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.839 
immediately makes another mistake but
the<00:05:01.319> really<00:05:01.799> nice<00:05:02.009> thing<00:05:02.309> and<00:05:02.489> this<00:05:02.610> this

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
the really nice thing and this this

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.119 
the really nice thing and this this
really<00:05:03.149> exemplifies<00:05:03.749> what<00:05:03.779> in<00:05:04.409> in<00:05:04.649> in<00:05:04.979> the

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:05.129 
really exemplifies what in in in the

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:06.919 
really exemplifies what in in in the
computer<00:05:05.459> science<00:05:05.610> world<00:05:06.119> we<00:05:06.300> call<00:05:06.449> human<00:05:06.719> in

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:06.929 
computer science world we call human in

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:09.769 
computer science world we call human in
the<00:05:07.019> loop<00:05:07.610> interfaces<00:05:08.610> you<00:05:09.300> can<00:05:09.419> see<00:05:09.569> if<00:05:09.659> I

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:09.779 
the loop interfaces you can see if I

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:11.899 
the loop interfaces you can see if I
scroll<00:05:10.169> this<00:05:10.409> back<00:05:10.709> here<00:05:11.039> and<00:05:11.249> I<00:05:11.459> just<00:05:11.489> give

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
scroll this back here and I just give

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:13.609 
scroll this back here and I just give
the<00:05:12.149> software<00:05:12.659> a<00:05:12.689> little<00:05:12.779> bit<00:05:13.439> more

00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:13.619 
the software a little bit more
