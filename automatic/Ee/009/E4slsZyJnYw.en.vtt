 your smartphone will turn on everything 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:53.629

 orange free bouygues facts 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.099
 in short, you wait for the smartphone 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.930
 start it will take a little bit more 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:16.930
 time as usual 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.930
 here 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:26.690

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.050
