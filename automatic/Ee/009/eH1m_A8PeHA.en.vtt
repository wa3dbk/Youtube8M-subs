the screen way to the left hand side we

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.120 
the screen way to the left hand side we
think<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.640> see<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> flashing<00:00:30.570> light<00:00:31.130> just

side and is we think you can see a
flashing<00:01:36.390> light<00:01:36.950> just<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.070> little<00:01:38.310> bit<00:01:38.550> to<00:01:38.760> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
flashing light just a little bit to the

left of the center of the screen very

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.740 
left of the center of the screen very
faint<00:01:46.550> and<00:01:47.550> we<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:47.850> see<00:01:48.060> something<00:01:48.360> flashing

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
faint and we do see something flashing

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.780 
faint and we do see something flashing
visually<00:01:49.710> but<00:01:49.890> we're<00:01:50.040> not<00:01:50.160> sure<00:01:50.190> that<00:01:50.760> that

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
visually but we're not sure that that

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.120 
visually but we're not sure that that
might<00:01:51.120> be

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.249 

this<00:01:58.729> is<00:01:58.939> Mission<00:01:59.240> Control<00:01:59.270> Houston<00:01:59.810> once

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
this is Mission Control Houston once

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.260 
this is Mission Control Houston once
again<00:02:00.560> we<00:02:00.710> believe<00:02:01.009> we<00:02:01.219> were<00:02:01.610> just<00:02:01.880> able<00:02:02.090> to

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
again we believe we were just able to

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.319 
again we believe we were just able to
his<00:02:02.689> spot<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.829> mirror<00:02:04.369> spacecraft<00:02:05.000> as<00:02:05.270> it

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
his spot the mirror spacecraft as it

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.420 
his spot the mirror spacecraft as it
flies<00:02:05.840> about<00:02:06.170> eight<00:02:06.560> hundred<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:07.070> fifty

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
flies about eight hundred and fifty

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.660 
flies about eight hundred and fifty
