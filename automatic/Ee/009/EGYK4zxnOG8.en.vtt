00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the only thing that I was thinking is

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.360 
the only thing that I was thinking is
that<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> lot<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.530> people<00:00:55.860> are<00:00:55.949> hearing<00:00:56.219> me

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
that a lot of people are hearing me

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.889 
that a lot of people are hearing me
scream<00:00:56.610> at<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.059> top<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.239> my<00:00:57.390> lungs<00:00:57.539> right<00:00:57.719> now

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
scream at the top of my lungs right now

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.510 
scream at the top of my lungs right now
and<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.170> was<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.379> little<00:00:58.710> bit<00:00:58.859> awkward<00:00:59.160> at

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
and that was a little bit awkward at

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.740 
and that was a little bit awkward at
first<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.059> closed<00:01:00.239> my<00:01:00.329> eyes<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.660> they're

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
first I just closed my eyes and they're

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.240 
first I just closed my eyes and they're
saying<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.590> actually<00:01:01.859> sounded<00:01:02.129> pretty

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
saying and it actually sounded pretty

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.990 
saying and it actually sounded pretty
good<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.300> think<00:01:04.220> we<00:01:05.220> recorded<00:01:05.640> outside

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
good so I think we recorded outside

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.660 
good so I think we recorded outside
because<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.450> wanted<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.369> we<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.490> want<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
because we wanted to we just want to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.250 
because we wanted to we just want to
have<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> different<00:01:08.970> sound<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.659> song<00:01:09.930> we

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
have a different sound on that song we

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.870 
have a different sound on that song we
wanted<00:01:10.710> also<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.070> see<00:01:11.280> what<00:01:11.430> would<00:01:11.490> happen<00:01:11.670> to

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
wanted also to see what would happen to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.100 
wanted also to see what would happen to
the<00:01:11.970> neighborhood<00:01:12.360> when<00:01:12.510> he<00:01:12.600> when<00:01:12.840> they<00:01:12.930> heard

him<00:01:13.320> screaming<00:01:14.250> at<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.520> top<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.820> his<00:01:14.880> lungs

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
him screaming at the top of his lungs

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.590 
him screaming at the top of his lungs
also<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.100> love<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.369> way<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.880> echo<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.390> out

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.649 
the birds twittering and all kinds of
stuff<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.820> was<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.390> also<00:01:27.540> I

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
stuff so it was just so and also I

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.539

wanted to give him a different vibe out
there<00:01:30.000> he<00:01:30.390> sang<00:01:30.630> probably<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> little<00:01:31.320> harder

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
there he sang probably a little harder

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.630 
there he sang probably a little harder
than<00:01:31.650> he<00:01:31.799> normally<00:01:31.920> would<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.310> sung<00:01:32.490> but

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
than he normally would have sung but

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.010 
than he normally would have sung but
that<00:01:32.790> was<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.030> kind<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.270> song<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.659> had<00:01:33.810> for

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
that was the kind of song we had for

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.780 
that was the kind of song we had for
that<00:01:34.140> anyway<00:01:34.470> he<00:01:35.100> wasn't<00:01:35.280> sort<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.759> a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
that anyway he wasn't sort of in a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.880 
that anyway he wasn't sort of in a
little<00:01:36.030> room<00:01:36.210> he<00:01:36.420> was<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> big<00:01:37.110> huge<00:01:37.500> open
