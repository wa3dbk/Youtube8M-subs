to<00:02:58.790> supply<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.540> buyer<00:03:00.020> so<00:03:00.500> they<00:03:00.620> have<00:03:00.740> to<00:03:00.920> slip

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
to supply a buyer so they have to slip

to supply a buyer so they have to slip
that<00:03:01.310> 6%<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:02.510> now<00:03:02.780> that's<00:03:03.500> 3%<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:04.520> they're

they're a broker then they're going to

there's no way for me to tell you that

but there's the max that they can make

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.750 
but there's the max that they can make
your<00:03:21.680> street<00:03:21.950> down<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.340> they're<00:03:22.430> not<00:03:22.550> going

depending on the repairs all that's

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.970 
depending on the repairs all that's

making<00:03:46.549> at<00:03:46.760> least<00:03:47.090> ten<00:03:47.330> thousand<00:03:47.840> off<00:03:47.959> that

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
making at least ten thousand off that

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.160 
making at least ten thousand off that
same<00:03:48.440> deal<00:03:49.150> it<00:03:50.150> was<00:03:50.420> a<00:03:50.510> hundred<00:03:50.690> thousand

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
same deal it was a hundred thousand

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.509 
same deal it was a hundred thousand
dollar<00:03:51.290> transactions<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.130> always<00:03:52.310> been

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
dollar transactions and always been

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.670 
dollar transactions and always been
taken<00:03:52.910> out<00:03:53.000> just<00:03:53.209> just<00:03:53.450> from<00:03:53.900> experience

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
taken out just just from experience

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.190 
taken out just just from experience
so<00:03:55.040> that's<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.340> difference<00:03:55.580> in<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:56.930> in

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
so that's the difference in it in

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.050 
so that's the difference in it in
towards<00:03:57.590> money<00:03:57.890> there's<00:03:58.670> really<00:03:58.850> no

towards money there's really no

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.240 
towards money there's really no

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
comparison it's for whole selling and
