people<00:01:58.940> too<00:01:59.119> so<00:01:59.149> I<00:01:59.360> think<00:01:59.450> it's<00:01:59.659> a<00:01:59.720> great<00:01:59.960> mix

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
people too so I think it's a great mix

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.609 
people too so I think it's a great mix
of<00:02:00.619> people<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.899> they<00:02:02.899> love<00:02:03.259> all<00:02:03.470> the

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
of people and they love all the

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.399 
of people and they love all the
different<00:02:03.920> variety<00:02:04.340> of<00:02:04.369> homes<00:02:04.789> from<00:02:05.300> a<00:02:05.810> patio

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
different variety of homes from a patio

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.650 
different variety of homes from a patio
home<00:02:06.679> type<00:02:06.979> situation<00:02:07.640> clear<00:02:07.909> up<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.209> a<00:02:08.239> larger

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
home type situation clear up to a larger

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.419 
home type situation clear up to a larger
single-family<00:02:09.200> homes<00:02:09.649> so<00:02:09.950> I<00:02:09.979> think<00:02:10.100> that

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
single-family homes so I think that

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.250 
single-family homes so I think that
gives<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.729> large<00:02:11.120> variety<00:02:11.420> of<00:02:11.780> homes
