00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.980
 Let's use this noodle to set up an outlet 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.480
 First of all , the location of the serial number or location to take power 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.760
 Let's decide the joint location from the distribution board 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:57.120
 In the home use, usually use a 2.0 mm dotted line up to the joint box 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.880
 The end of the joint box uses a 1.6 mm wire so it 's actually an outlet 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.240
 Wiring 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.240
 Let's look 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:13.360
 And the wiring of the electric wires of the destination from the write-minute serial number to joint box 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:18.540
 Let's write the name firmly what kind of electric wire is in the joint box 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:25.500
 This time the wire from the man in minutes wrote the power supply and the name 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:28.290
 Next , wire an 81.6 mm wire from the joint box to the outlet box. 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.030
 I wrote the outlet and the name 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:39.960
 Let's peel off these two wires and make a joint 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:45.320
 The wires are trimmed to the same length , leaving the name and peeling away . If the dotted line is short 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:51.229
 Try to get the joint is to cut with spears easy length because hesitation 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:53.330
 100 volt outlet + verb-so you can connect the pro line urban route 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:02:00.650
 Connect each one 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:02.540
 This time using the connection that the issue of parts out insert to firmly back and connect the wire 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.600
 Let's try not to 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:11.080
 Then install the outlet device 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:15.730
 I'm inserting here because there is a socket for defeat on the other side 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:19.150
 Insert a certain Shi routes in minus to those who are written as w 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.890
 Then plug the pro line into the left hole 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:28.700
 Let's confirm the connection method by donation 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:32.900
 Fix the device firmly to the box when the connection is made 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:38.030
 The above is the approximate flow of outlet wiring 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:41.959
 Let's work calmly so that there is no connection error 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:48.610
 Then check if the outlet can be used 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.610
 This time I do not pass electricity except lighting confirmation
