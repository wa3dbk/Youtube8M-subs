the last race no be hungry it's a

brake<00:00:43.570> is<00:00:43.780> not<00:00:44.050> so<00:00:44.320> important<00:00:45.100> there<00:00:45.310> but<00:00:45.880> it's

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
brake is not so important there but it's

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.020 
brake is not so important there but it's
also<00:00:46.450> a<00:00:46.660> beautiful<00:00:46.960> flowing<00:00:47.620> circuit<00:00:48.310> the<00:00:48.880> one

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
also a beautiful flowing circuit the one

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.890 
also a beautiful flowing circuit the one
is<00:00:49.210> always<00:00:49.420> among<00:00:50.410> the<00:00:50.920> drivers<00:00:51.160> favorite<00:00:51.900> so

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
is always among the drivers favorite so

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.590 
is always among the drivers favorite so
we<00:00:53.740> were<00:00:53.890> trying<00:00:54.130> as<00:00:54.550> usual<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:55.090> do<00:00:55.210> our<00:00:55.390> best

right there knowing
it's<00:00:59.420> a<00:00:59.600> completely<00:01:00.410> different<00:01:01.000> challenge

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
it's a completely different challenge

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.049 
it's a completely different challenge
from<00:01:02.240> from<00:01:02.540> the<00:01:02.660> last<00:01:02.840> one<00:01:03.080> we<00:01:03.200> had<00:01:03.440> and<00:01:04.059> also

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
from from the last one we had and also

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.300 
from from the last one we had and also
that<00:01:05.660> we<00:01:05.840> will<00:01:05.870> probably<00:01:06.260> be<00:01:06.500> facing<00:01:06.800> some

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
that we will probably be facing some

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.030 
that we will probably be facing some
typical<00:01:07.990> Belgian<00:01:08.990> in<00:01:09.200> predictable<00:01:09.860> weather

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
typical Belgian in predictable weather

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
the last race before the summer so this

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.370 
the last race before the summer so this
could<00:01:13.160> really<00:01:13.220> take<00:01:14.180> a<00:01:14.210> fantastic<00:01:14.960> win<00:01:15.170> with

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
could really take a fantastic win with

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.070 
could really take a fantastic win with
Sebastian<00:01:15.950> better<00:01:16.300> that's<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:17.420> tree<00:01:17.720> is<00:01:17.900> our

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
Sebastian better that's the tree is our

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.920 
Sebastian better that's the tree is our
expectation<00:01:18.470> for<00:01:19.100> Belgium<00:01:19.690> absolutely<00:01:20.690> not

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
expectation for Belgium absolutely not

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.930 
expectation for Belgium absolutely not
there's<00:01:21.620> nothing<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.070> change<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.610> we<00:01:22.760> are

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
there's nothing to change and we are

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.460 
there's nothing to change and we are
approached<00:01:23.300> in<00:01:23.330> this<00:01:23.660> race<00:01:23.900> with<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.230> same

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
approached in this race with the same

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.550 
approached in this race with the same
humble<00:01:25.310> approach<00:01:25.580> we<00:01:25.820> have<00:01:25.870> kept<00:01:26.870> throughout

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
humble approach we have kept throughout

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.860 
humble approach we have kept throughout
the<00:01:27.710> season<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:28.130> far<00:01:28.340> we<00:01:29.330> keep<00:01:29.570> our<00:01:29.720> feet

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
the season so far we keep our feet

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.830 
the season so far we keep our feet
solidly<00:01:30.229> firmly<00:01:30.800> on<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:30.979> ground<00:01:31.220> because<00:01:32.000> we

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
solidly firmly on the ground because we

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.340 
solidly firmly on the ground because we
know<00:01:33.080> that<00:01:33.470> we're<00:01:33.619> facing<00:01:33.890> a<00:01:34.220> very<00:01:34.550> hard

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
know that we're facing a very hard

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.160 
know that we're facing a very hard
competition<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.979> we<00:01:37.670> still<00:01:37.970> try<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.810> do<00:01:38.990> our

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
competition and we still try to do our

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.140 
competition and we still try to do our
best

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
best

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.080 
best
we<00:01:41.150> never<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:42.440> for<00:01:43.160> a<00:01:43.250> minute<00:01:43.520> that<00:01:43.729> we<00:01:43.790> very

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
we never so for a minute that we very

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.740 
we never so for a minute that we very
much<00:01:44.300> lump<00:01:44.600> as<00:01:44.869> many<00:01:45.170> people<00:01:45.530> so<00:01:45.920> they<00:01:46.160> wrote

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
much lump as many people so they wrote

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.790 
much lump as many people so they wrote
before<00:01:47.750> Hungary<00:01:48.350> we<00:01:48.890> do<00:01:49.700> not<00:01:49.820> think<00:01:50.180> we<00:01:50.330> have

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
before Hungary we do not think we have

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.920 
before Hungary we do not think we have
phenomenal<00:01:51.800> right<00:01:52.670> now<00:01:52.910> just<00:01:53.240> because<00:01:53.570> we<00:01:53.720> won

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
phenomenal right now just because we won

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.100 
phenomenal right now just because we won
the<00:01:54.440> race<00:01:54.619> in<00:01:54.650> Budapest<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:55.759> once<00:01:56.479> again<00:01:56.660> is

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
the race in Budapest so once again is

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.280 
the race in Budapest so once again is
the<00:01:57.350> same<00:01:57.680> approach<00:01:57.860> and<00:01:58.520> try<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.420> get<00:02:00.170> the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
the same approach and try to get the

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.320 
the same approach and try to get the
most<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:01.100> best<00:02:01.280> possible<00:02:01.729> result<00:02:02.090> for<00:02:02.270> the

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
most the best possible result for the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.719 
most the best possible result for the
school<00:02:02.509> year<00:02:02.600> can<00:02:03.410> we<00:02:03.440> do<00:02:03.679> a<00:02:03.710> quick<00:02:04.009> recap<00:02:04.520> of

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
school year can we do a quick recap of

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.029 
school year can we do a quick recap of
this<00:02:04.910> season<00:02:05.330> so<00:02:05.509> far<00:02:05.539> what<00:02:06.410> one<00:02:06.560> figure<00:02:06.920> I'd

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
this season so far what one figure I'd

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.150 
this season so far what one figure I'd
like<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.490> give<00:02:07.700> this<00:02:07.970> is<00:02:08.800> we<00:02:09.800> are<00:02:09.920> halfway

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
like to give this is we are halfway

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.640 
like to give this is we are halfway
through<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.670> season<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.180> we<00:02:11.300> have<00:02:11.650> currently

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
through the season and we have currently

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.080 
through the season and we have currently
more<00:02:13.040> points<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:14.569> we<00:02:14.870> collected<00:02:15.770> in<00:02:16.280> the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
more points that we collected in the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.370 
more points that we collected in the
whole<00:02:17.620> 2014<00:02:18.620> season<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:19.280> this<00:02:19.550> is<00:02:19.730> probably

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
whole 2014 season so this is probably

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.770 
whole 2014 season so this is probably
quite<00:02:21.380> more<00:02:21.560> promising<00:02:22.240> it's<00:02:23.240> certainly<00:02:23.660> a

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
quite more promising it's certainly a

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.900 
quite more promising it's certainly a
better<00:02:23.960> season<00:02:24.260> than<00:02:24.410> last<00:02:24.680> year<00:02:25.250> but<00:02:25.460> it

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
better season than last year but it

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.320 
better season than last year but it
doesn't<00:02:26.270> mean<00:02:26.420> we<00:02:26.780> have<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.380> let<00:02:28.280> go<00:02:28.310> we<00:02:28.910> still

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
doesn't mean we have to let go we still

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.210 
doesn't mean we have to let go we still
have<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.630> keep<00:02:32.840> working<00:02:33.080> hard<00:02:33.500> because<00:02:33.920> we

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
have you to keep working hard because we

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.300 
have you to keep working hard because we

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
know we have a lot to improve but still

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.470 
know we have a lot to improve but still
it's<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:37.810> few<00:02:38.810> wins<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.490> total<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:40.940> a<00:02:41.150> podium

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
it's a few wins and a total of a podium

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.680

bit like history in the making now we

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.070 
bit like history in the making now we
certainly<00:02:57.770> come<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.160> long<00:02:58.400> way<00:02:58.610> since<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:59.209> 1950

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
certainly come a long way since the 1950

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.550 
certainly come a long way since the 1950
and<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:00.410> has<00:03:00.620> Formula<00:03:01.130> One<00:03:01.310> as<00:03:01.580> a<00:03:01.610> whole<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.560> I

summer break are there any opportunities
for<00:03:48.950> development<00:03:49.570> well<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.690> summer<00:03:50.960> break<00:03:51.200> is
