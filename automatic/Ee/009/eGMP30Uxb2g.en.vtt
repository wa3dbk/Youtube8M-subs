John<00:00:21.250> good<00:00:21.400> to<00:00:21.550> see<00:00:21.700> I<00:00:22.050> guess<00:00:23.050> the<00:00:23.170> first<00:00:23.320> thing

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
John good to see I guess the first thing

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.950 
John good to see I guess the first thing
would<00:00:23.680> be<00:00:23.890> a<00:00:24.160> definition<00:00:25.030> of<00:00:25.120> 4G<00:00:25.600> I<00:00:25.630> think

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
would be a definition of 4G I think

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.900 
would be a definition of 4G I think
people<00:00:26.350> sometimes<00:00:26.530> might<00:00:27.430> sort<00:00:27.700> of<00:00:27.760> have<00:00:27.880> a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
people sometimes might sort of have a

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.150 
people sometimes might sort of have a
misconception<00:00:28.270> about<00:00:28.690> what<00:00:29.110> it<00:00:29.230> is<00:00:29.350> if<00:00:30.010> you

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
misconception about what it is if you

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.100 
misconception about what it is if you
were<00:00:30.250> sort<00:00:30.430> of<00:00:30.460> nailed<00:00:30.730> down<00:00:30.910> the<00:00:31.120> term<00:00:31.450> what

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
were sort of nailed down the term what

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.530 
were sort of nailed down the term what
would<00:00:32.290> 4gb<00:00:32.739> the<00:00:33.100> big<00:00:33.280> trend<00:00:33.640> is<00:00:33.850> the<00:00:34.329> use<00:00:34.510> of

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
would 4gb the big trend is the use of

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.419 
would 4gb the big trend is the use of
data<00:00:34.870> services<00:00:35.500> in<00:00:35.710> a<00:00:36.039> mobile<00:00:36.280> environment

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:36.429 
data services in a mobile environment

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:39.630 
data services in a mobile environment
and<00:00:36.999> 4G<00:00:37.839> is<00:00:37.870> that<00:00:38.109> next<00:00:38.350> generation<00:00:38.980> network<00:00:39.160> I

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
and 4G is that next generation network I

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.090 
and 4G is that next generation network I
guess<00:00:40.480> some<00:00:40.629> people<00:00:40.870> could<00:00:40.960> ask<00:00:41.199> then<00:00:41.589> why<00:00:41.829> is

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
guess some people could ask then why is

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.759 
guess some people could ask then why is
4G<00:00:42.730> necessary<00:00:43.269> there<00:00:43.629> are<00:00:43.749> applications<00:00:43.929> that

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
4G necessary there are applications that

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.509 
4G necessary there are applications that
really<00:00:45.219> require<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:46.539> use<00:00:46.780> of<00:00:46.809> heavy<00:00:47.519> heavy

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
really require the use of heavy heavy

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:50.700 
really require the use of heavy heavy
data<00:00:48.819> speeds<00:00:49.269> and<00:00:49.600> so<00:00:50.079> the<00:00:50.199> example<00:00:50.440> would<00:00:50.620> be

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
data speeds and so the example would be

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.759 
data speeds and so the example would be
video<00:00:51.129> video<00:00:51.999> chat<00:00:52.449> that<00:00:52.719> you're<00:00:52.899> seeing<00:00:53.170> as<00:00:53.379> a

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
video video chat that you're seeing as a

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.399 
video video chat that you're seeing as a
capability<00:00:54.370> people<00:00:55.239> are<00:00:55.329> downloading<00:00:55.629> larger

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
capability people are downloading larger

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.369 
capability people are downloading larger
files<00:00:56.769> you've<00:00:57.460> got<00:00:57.729> flash<00:00:58.269> you've<00:00:58.899> got<00:00:59.109> things

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
files you've got flash you've got things

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.619 
files you've got flash you've got things
like<00:00:59.559> tablets<00:01:00.249> that<00:01:00.460> are<00:01:00.519> coming<00:01:00.909> out<00:01:01.030> those

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
like tablets that are coming out those

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.219 
like tablets that are coming out those
all<00:01:01.929> require<00:01:02.530> high<00:01:03.489> speed<00:01:03.969> applications<00:01:04.360> and

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
all require high speed applications and

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.770 
all require high speed applications and
that's<00:01:05.530> really<00:01:05.770> what<00:01:05.950> 4G<00:01:06.460> does<00:01:06.670> it<00:01:06.940> pushes<00:01:07.630> at

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
that's really what 4G does it pushes at

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.780 
that's really what 4G does it pushes at
high<00:01:08.200> bandwidth<00:01:08.619> applications<00:01:08.770> down<00:01:09.520> and

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
high bandwidth applications down and

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.219 
high bandwidth applications down and
allows<00:01:10.240> a<00:01:10.360> user<00:01:10.390> to<00:01:10.630> have<00:01:10.810> a<00:01:10.840> good<00:01:11.020> experience

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
allows a user to have a good experience

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.200 
allows a user to have a good experience
sort<00:01:12.219> of<00:01:12.280> adding<00:01:12.490> on<00:01:12.579> to<00:01:12.700> what<00:01:12.820> you<00:01:12.939> said<00:01:13.180> I

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
sort of adding on to what you said I

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.819 
sort of adding on to what you said I
guess<00:01:13.570> why<00:01:13.840> would<00:01:14.049> the<00:01:14.170> average<00:01:14.350> consumer

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
guess why would the average consumer

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.130 
guess why would the average consumer
care<00:01:15.399> about<00:01:15.610> 4G<00:01:16.060> so<00:01:16.240> what<00:01:16.630> we're<00:01:16.810> going<00:01:16.930> to<00:01:17.020> do

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
care about 4G so what we're going to do

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.319 
care about 4G so what we're going to do
for<00:01:17.380> them<00:01:17.560> today<00:01:18.219> they<00:01:18.759> think<00:01:18.939> well<00:01:19.090> would<00:01:19.299> I

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
for them today they think well would I

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.959 
for them today they think well would I
really<00:01:19.659> do<00:01:19.780> a<00:01:19.810> video<00:01:20.079> chat<00:01:20.200> or<00:01:20.829> am<00:01:21.640> I<00:01:21.759> really

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969 
really do a video chat or am I really

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.899 
really do a video chat or am I really
going<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.149> download<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:23.049> movie<00:01:24.009> on<00:01:24.250> to<00:01:24.399> my<00:01:24.520> phone

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
going to download a movie on to my phone

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.260 
going to download a movie on to my phone
and<00:01:25.329> the<00:01:25.840> answer<00:01:26.170> is<00:01:26.340> absolutely<00:01:27.340> they<00:01:28.090> will

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
and the answer is absolutely they will

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.999 
and the answer is absolutely they will
and<00:01:28.479> once<00:01:28.659> they<00:01:28.810> experience<00:01:29.350> it<00:01:29.560> all<00:01:29.860> of<00:01:29.979> a

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
and once they experience it all of a

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.499 
and once they experience it all of a
sudden<00:01:30.250> I<00:01:30.520> don't<00:01:30.549> know<00:01:30.789> how<00:01:30.969> I<00:01:31.000> live<00:01:31.360> without

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
sudden I don't know how I live without

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.620 
sudden I don't know how I live without
this<00:01:32.200> capability<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.909> sprint<00:01:34.180> obviously<00:01:34.509> has

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
this capability so sprint obviously has

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.899 
this capability so sprint obviously has

4g now you're launching 4g and 11
markets<00:01:37.240> but<00:01:37.960> besides<00:01:38.229> that<00:01:38.320> why<00:01:38.590> should

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
markets but besides that why should

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.679 
markets but besides that why should
someone<00:01:39.340> choose<00:01:39.640> sprint<00:01:39.939> over<00:01:40.180> a<00:01:40.210> competitor

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
someone choose sprint over a competitor

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.209 
someone choose sprint over a competitor
there<00:01:40.990> are<00:01:41.049> a<00:01:41.079> couple<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.350> things<00:01:41.560> one<00:01:41.649> our

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
there are a couple of things one our

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.099 
there are a couple of things one our
