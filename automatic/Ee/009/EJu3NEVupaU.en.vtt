00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:28.890
 for multi friends the one we're in 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.890
 the 2014 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.020
 although it is the name of this boy 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.670
 start attending school 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.980
 regularly because he wants to spend more 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.360
 time with zizou with the costumes and 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.350
 start to get better grades 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.350
 that she 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.059
 music is a key factor in this 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.829
 game not only each melody is 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.629
 incredible but when all 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.030
 elements around the world these 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.980
 they also produce sounds alva 5 bad 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.360
 style of sandwiches this time 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.430
 let's talk about my alcohol 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.260
 Jan Kodes on television already know 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.860
 directed to the male audience more or 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.170
 less between 13 and 18 years and this 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.700
 the type will dissipate are these 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.500
 series there's a guy and there's a 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.119
 bunch of kids move by this one 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.190
 Chahuan that not even this thong 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.250
 which, well, today is created by 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.729
 saint fujiwara and came out first in flex 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.729
 comics 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.119
 if I had meeting time soon I 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.520
 I think it was one of his pieces that 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.520
 Take off like this miss 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.990
 It has some some good qualities 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.750
 that the pandas call us the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.490
 good panda attention and this is the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.920
 figure to which so welcome to the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.900
 comics recommendations like you 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.340
 you know the zombies are very fashionable without 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.649
 However I will not recommend it and it's because 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.110
 it a comic full of clichÃ©s of the 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.600
 typical we are in this occasion we have 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.430
 cross a very interesting comic book 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.470
 although it presents a kind of zombies 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.770
 I really do not know if we can call them that 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.050
 there is a kind of plague or something that 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.520
 it appears that they never explain to us well that 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.710
 It makes humans become 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.810
 terribly aggressive creatures 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.810
 something like red nexus crack 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.920
 and the others are those of anne rice when 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.650
 I was a girl and I wanted to see vampires wanted 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.690
 these beings that are evil and that attack 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.730
 humans but do not possess pure evil 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.190
 they are smart and they are bastards 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.959
 I had to read a lot of books and it was not 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.470
 until I hit the back ones I could 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.470
 satiate the appetite
