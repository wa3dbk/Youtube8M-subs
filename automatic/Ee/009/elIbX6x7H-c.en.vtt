00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:14.080
 before being a musician my passion was 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.930
 sport of cycling sport which still 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.950
 practical but only to maintain a 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.950
 good physical condition 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.140
 for me cycling is not only 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.570
 a way to stay healthy but 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.900
 that is a great moment where I can spend 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:35.230
 alone time with my god talk to him 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.840
 and at the same time he blesses me by giving me 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.000
 lyrics for some song in this I've 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.760
 could see that god has no patterns 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.850
 specific forms or place in particular 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.160
 to bless more he is always 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.440
 willing to bless us only that 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.420
 we must have the attitude 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.820
 correct for this to happen 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.300
 talking about this comes to my memory 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.609
 memories of my childhood when I was a child 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.739
 I remember that every time it rained I 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.049
 he was annoying and fighting because he could not 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.020
 go out to play space my mother I 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.830
 he said the rain is god's blessing not 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.080
 bother you why she was right and 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.049
 I think it's the best example for 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.600
 explain what it is I wish to project ourselves 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.880
 as we said before the rain 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.100
 what is God's blessing and our 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.190
 attitude in this example will be 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.409
 represented by an umbrella parasol 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.869
 that when we keep it open we are 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.289
 preventing God's blessing from falling 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.780
 about us but if we close the same 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:42.530
 we will be soaked by his blessing and 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.020
 we will see his glory in a special way in 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.959
 the bible in the psalm 100 psalm 4 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.659
 says enter through its doors with the 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:54.690
 thanksgiving for their tables with 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:58.080
 praise the abbot bless 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.320
 if we do not apply what it says in 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.720
 this psalm we will be entering by their 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.230
 atriums and by their doors with the 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.830
 umbrella open now well just me 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.790
 it remains to say you close your umbrella and 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.790
 let yourself get wet
