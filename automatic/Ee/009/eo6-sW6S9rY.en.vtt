00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.599
 today I will unpack with you 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.850
 the park blues before buying this mic 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.010
 I had a b12 studio project 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.630
 I decided to change the microphone for 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.490
 have better sound quality for 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.660
 my videos 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.849
 so it's a microphone that I bought 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.230
 directly on the site of toman you 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.800
 find links of course in the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.630
 frozen description received like these on 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.739
 the box you have a small glimpse of the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.230
 product and at the back of the box a few 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.809
 small specifications and something else 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.239
 but good enough lost time we're going 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.289
 open the box 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.180
 when we saw the wood was good we 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.250
 found with another box a box 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.140
 entirely made of wood to be able to 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.090
 carry the microphone at least that's it 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.460
 they say now when I'm 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.199
 gone on vacation with my microphone I 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.149
 pray with me in a small pouch 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.449
 And we in the wooden box butt 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.850
 was not too practical now 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.560
 we're going to shoot the tongue is like this 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.180
 to find out what's in it 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.500
 starts with the instructions first 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.500
 of use of the product 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.290
 then a little sticker of the 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.920
 mark so blue go let's do a 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.300
 little bit of pub for the mark is 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.100
 finally another little advertisement on 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.700
 will lift that part right now 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.780
 to access the microphone itself and the 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.540
 here is right on the right 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.910
 to start we will take care of the shock 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.280
 mint sold with spark 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.009
 it will allow you to fix your 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.020
 microphone on a foot or on a pole by 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.560
 example so that it stays well fixed 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.140
 when you record your voice here 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.930
 it is the anti pop filter also sold 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:08.360
 with the spark it is really superb 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:12.759
 and finally here is the spark in orange 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.759
 everything is beautiful 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.420
 that's how to put the shaq 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.340
 funny it's super simple and more 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.859
 he's holding on super well so you go 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:31.599
 power tilted the microphone as you 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:34.450
 want is how puts and 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:39.639
 the pop filter you have to remove the life that 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:46.150
 is on the back of the spark is then 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:49.090
 life is the poor filter so it holds 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.290
 very well it does not move at all 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.480
 which is good is that it is really 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.269
 little ones with the sound of the microphone and 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.519
 especially it does not spoil the style at all 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:03.010
 of this one with the blues park I 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.650
 also bought the blue insight mouth that 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.319
 will allow you to go out in usb no 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.569
 lic seiler when i'm at home i 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.250
 my map are so fine I can 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.659
 quietly record my voice but 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.400
 when I'm traveling 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.859
 I can not take my card are 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.780
 with me so thanks to this accessory I 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.799
 can take my microphone everywhere and that's 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.799
 by the way what I did this summer 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.049
 here he is really super pretty 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.389
 really little milk barely bigger 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.739
 that my hand is especially very original 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.109
 that's why I took 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.949
 my choice turned to this microphone there 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.979
 and have no other 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:42.759
 in addition its quality is absolutely sound 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:44.379
 bluffing for its price if you want 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:47.049
 buy a microphone I recommend it 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.729
 is not excessively expensive and the sound 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.549
 that we record with is really 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:52.500
 nickel 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.940
 so if you want 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.010
