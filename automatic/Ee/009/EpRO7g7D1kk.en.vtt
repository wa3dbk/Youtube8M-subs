00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.030 
there's a famous analogy between
basketball<00:06:53.380> and<00:06:53.530> Jess

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:54.040 
basketball and Jess

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.260 
basketball and Jess
some<00:06:54.340> people<00:06:54.580> say<00:06:54.700> basketball<00:06:54.910> it's<00:06:55.180> not

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
some people say basketball it's not

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.840 
some people say basketball it's not
Jessica's<00:06:55.750> it's<00:06:55.960> it's<00:06:56.620> a<00:06:56.710> team<00:06:56.950> concept<00:06:57.190> that

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850 
Jessica's it's it's a team concept that

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.780 
Jessica's it's it's a team concept that
gives<00:06:58.450> the<00:06:59.050> solos<00:06:59.500> space<00:07:00.430> for

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:00.790 
gives the solos space for

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.880 
gives the solos space for
self-expression<00:07:01.510> I<00:07:02.140> think<00:07:02.530> that's<00:07:02.680> great

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:02.890 
self-expression I think that's great

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.380 
self-expression I think that's great
analogy<00:07:03.400> and<00:07:03.580> really<00:07:03.820> explains<00:07:04.120> what<00:07:04.300> the

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.390 
analogy and really explains what the

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:09.330 
analogy and really explains what the
game<00:07:04.540> is<00:07:04.570> about<00:07:07.530> whatever<00:07:08.530> it<00:07:08.800> is<00:07:08.830> you<00:07:09.190> know

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 
of basketball the way you handle the

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.630 
of basketball the way you handle the
rock<00:07:14.050> man<00:07:14.320> is<00:07:14.500> basically<00:07:14.920> how<00:07:15.130> you<00:07:15.160> handle
