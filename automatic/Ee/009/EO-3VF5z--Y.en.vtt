trouble it was a draw
it<00:02:07.270> was<00:02:07.540> obviously<00:02:08.229> for<00:02:08.530> me<00:02:08.649> that<00:02:08.860> he<00:02:09.700> should

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
it was obviously for me that he should

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.870 
it was obviously for me that he should
he<00:02:11.290> should<00:02:12.480> save<00:02:13.480> this<00:02:13.690> position<00:02:14.230> but<00:02:14.880> after

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
he should save this position but after

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.059 
he should save this position but after
time<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.330> not<00:02:16.450> bother<00:02:16.660> b5<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.680> was<00:02:17.860> already

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
time to not bother b5 it it was already

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.330 
time to not bother b5 it it was already
not<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:18.489> easy<00:02:18.819> because<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.840> keep<00:02:20.440> my<00:02:20.500> extra<00:02:21.100> pawn

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
not so easy because I keep my extra pawn

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.059 
not so easy because I keep my extra pawn
I<00:02:21.610> would<00:02:21.850> say<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.840> was<00:02:23.080> very<00:02:23.290> nice<00:02:23.590> to

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
I would say that it was very nice to

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.470 
I would say that it was very nice to
play<00:02:25.410> kill<00:02:26.410> kill<00:02:26.769> kill<00:02:27.370> before<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.060> then

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
play kill kill kill before and then

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.990 
play kill kill kill before and then
looky-looky<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:29.620> 7<00:02:31.230> rocky<00:02:32.230> 7<00:02:32.560> back<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.040> looks

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
looky-looky is 7 rocky 7 back and looks

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.330 
looky-looky is 7 rocky 7 back and looks
like<00:02:35.370> ok<00:02:36.370> looks<00:02:36.760> like<00:02:36.850> it's<00:02:37.150> over
