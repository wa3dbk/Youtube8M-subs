00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.910
 January together I want to show you how your new Samsung TVs correct 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.789
 as lived everywhere in Indonesia 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:11.709
 in this case it is one 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.919
 Luigi 46 c6000 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:16.619
 Juan 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.660
 the problem is always a very difficult race for us to face 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.900
 to the decisive 1 and St 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.060
 as a reminder for Heisig is not 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.039
 64 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.300
 to see 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.249
 the resolution is set correctly and that, of course, in 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.569
 ISI invokes if that with a zoom is much more so very keen 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.970
 some may have seen the video he was shown with 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.850
 how to get the names of that 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.130
 that must change 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.190
 around 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.440
 that was not always the case that the Greens now also the tourist centers 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.190
 Hamann name work to be pending 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.540
 then 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.650
 the EU has to put Ireland first 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.850
 the Bayern seem but not enough for the name Sony after also one 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.870
 different setting of TV channels 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.530
 you can see it differently 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.580
 location 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.300
 then TVs had shines 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.300
 his attitude 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.050
 that seems to be first moments 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.290
 we see so the image of Islam is viewed 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.130
 Disadvantage is however 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.160
 that the colors are not completely so completely 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.800
 the whole thing smells kind of matching the 1 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.530
 unlike before 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.910
 the stupid thing in this is she's attitudes 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.780
 You can not apply the color to the rain in the rain 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.590
 I do not know for sure 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.930
 to be for real help but I did not make it 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.930
 to adjust the colors so that it looks like this again 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.600
 in the 4th 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.010
 he does not have to 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.990
 There are other possibilities, and again and again 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.040
 undoing the whole makes Vitus press button 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.570
 but work 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.710
 to enrich female chefs 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.710
 after all, see Löw and 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:10.449
 July elected 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.619
 around 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:14.829
 so it looked also for the MfS were active 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.259
 that's easy we can 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.339
 the mothers saint-etienne 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.499
 the sunbathing area will be first setting 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:25.499
 the Lonza us still with option 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.359
 there we can take our roots 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.980
 Being 16 to 9 can give Bucher accommodations 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.569

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.769
 spider-man is the office though 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.790
 where German means the economic department and now see here more endures whether 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.139
 Eck 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:46.589
 It also works 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.199

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:52.199
 the bust of the beautiful one-to-one or posed these are presented 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:53.699
 should 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:57.879
 at the first time maybe but if you read through texts 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.709
 they do not look like it looks on a computer monitor 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:02.829
 should 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.999
 Hero Days ago repeatedly the EKZ pulled pulled on the Kander 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.549
 You can also put it in the trash here 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:13.929
 to confirm that and a diesel

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.679
 came 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:25.679
 this is at the bottom 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.869
 read the cards 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:30.599
 issue the media 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.429

 he is very old 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:39.129
 but first try it yourself 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.210
 Daum "I am quite Happy Percent 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.349
 That's a beautiful backdrop to Israel 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.429
 Percent I was of the opinion that all this was the first time I saw that

 in the cup rating is turned on 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.369
 the opposite is just one 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:55.119
 all diesel engines should 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:58.939
 This comes across better but that makes the whole picture dominated
