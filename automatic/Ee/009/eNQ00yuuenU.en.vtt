00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
that it was designed or created for

that it was designed or created for
color-treated<00:02:39.400> hair<00:02:39.570> so<00:02:40.570> if<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:41.080> are<00:02:41.170> natural

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
color-treated hair so if you are natural

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.350 
color-treated hair so if you are natural
that<00:02:41.830> colors<00:02:42.220> your<00:02:42.370> hair<00:02:42.610> then<00:02:42.940> this<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.330> a

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
that colors your hair then this is a

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.330 
that colors your hair then this is a
line<00:02:43.570> that<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:43.810> definitely<00:02:44.140> want<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.710> try<00:02:44.980> and

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
line that you definitely want to try and

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.980 
line that you definitely want to try and
I<00:02:45.880> take<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.240> that<00:02:46.360> this<00:02:46.510> is<00:02:46.690> something<00:02:46.960> that

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
I take it that this is something that

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.540 
I take it that this is something that
would<00:02:47.170> probably<00:02:47.470> be<00:02:47.590> really<00:02:47.860> good<00:02:48.070> for

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
would probably be really good for

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.400 
would probably be really good for
relaxed<00:02:49.300> or<00:02:49.420> texture<00:02:49.780> eyes<00:02:49.870> here<00:02:50.140> as<00:02:50.230> well

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
relaxed or texture eyes here as well

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.500 
relaxed or texture eyes here as well
because<00:02:50.590> it's<00:02:50.890> chemically<00:02:51.370> treated<00:02:51.730> hair<00:02:51.760> so

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
because it's chemically treated hair so

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.170 
because it's chemically treated hair so
it<00:02:52.780> protects<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.500> know<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:54.070> color<00:02:54.310> protects

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
it protects you know the color protects

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.020 
it protects you know the color protects
your<00:02:55.360> hair<00:02:55.600> from<00:02:56.020> chemicals<00:02:56.800> or<00:02:57.070> whatever<00:02:57.370> so

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
your hair from chemicals or whatever so

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.460 
your hair from chemicals or whatever so
this<00:02:58.270> is<00:02:58.420> definitely<00:02:58.720> something<00:02:59.080> that<00:02:59.230> you

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
this is definitely something that you

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.950 
this is definitely something that you
want<00:02:59.770> to<00:02:59.830> try<00:03:00.070> if<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.730> color<00:03:01.210> your<00:03:01.270> hair<00:03:01.420> if

want to try if you color your hair if

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.310 
want to try if you color your hair if
you<00:03:02.170> are<00:03:02.430> relaxed<00:03:03.430> your<00:03:03.930> tech<00:03:04.930> slacks

whatever

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.370 
whatever
if<00:03:06.760> your<00:03:06.940> hair<00:03:07.180> is<00:03:07.210> chemically<00:03:07.960> treated<00:03:08.260> in

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
any way then I take it that this is

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.830
