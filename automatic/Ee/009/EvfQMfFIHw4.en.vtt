00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
in my situation was that then I was in a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.270 
in my situation was that then I was in a
little<00:01:37.049> bit<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.259> an<00:01:37.409> awkward<00:01:37.650> position

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
little bit of an awkward position

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.950 
little bit of an awkward position
because<00:01:38.430> pretty<00:01:38.970> much<00:01:39.150> all<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.659> English

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
because pretty much all the English

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.960 
because pretty much all the English
teachers<00:01:40.350> there<00:01:40.590> were<00:01:40.829> older<00:01:41.250> married<00:01:41.490> women

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
teachers there were older married women

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.550 
teachers there were older married women
with<00:01:42.000> kids<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.899> was<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.110> little<00:01:43.290> bit<00:01:43.380> awkward

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
with kids so it was a little bit awkward

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.170 
with kids so it was a little bit awkward
for<00:01:43.979> me<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.250> friends<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.610> them<00:01:44.729> because<00:01:45.030> in

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
for me to be friends of them because in

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.179 
for me to be friends of them because in
Korea<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.600> not<00:01:46.140> appropriate<00:01:46.590> for<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
Korea is just not appropriate for a

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.280 
Korea is just not appropriate for a
married<00:01:47.610> guy<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.119> be<00:01:48.240> friends<00:01:48.659> with<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.840> married

inappropriate because I'm a married guy

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
inappropriate because I'm a married guy
