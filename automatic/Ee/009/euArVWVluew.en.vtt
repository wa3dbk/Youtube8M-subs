00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.849 
set up a few settings in the Wacom
tablet<00:00:15.809> properties<00:00:15.839> for<00:00:17.000> various<00:00:18.000> programs

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
tablet properties for various programs

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.599 
tablet properties for various programs
so<00:00:19.859> these<00:00:20.850> are<00:00:21.060> my<00:00:21.180> default<00:00:21.539> settings<00:00:22.020> here

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
so these are my default settings here

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.960 
so these are my default settings here
I've<00:00:23.609> set<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:25.199> pressure<00:00:25.740> sensitivity<00:00:27.349> the

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
I've set the pressure sensitivity the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.030 
I've set the pressure sensitivity the
buttons<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.510> mapping<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.019> just<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.619> fault

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
buttons and the mapping is just a fault

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.370 
buttons and the mapping is just a fault
and<00:00:34.219> I'll<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.280> use<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:36.600> program<00:00:37.020> for

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
and I'll just use this program for

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.280 
and I'll just use this program for
example<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.280> our<00:00:38.579> traits<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:40.129> so<00:00:42.290> basically

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
example so our traits to do so basically

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.360 
example so our traits to do so basically
what<00:00:43.890> I've<00:00:43.980> set<00:00:44.250> here<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:46.110> right<00:00:46.920> buttons

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
what I've set here is the right buttons

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.709 
what I've set here is the right buttons
to<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.789> inked<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.450> an<00:00:48.719> eraser<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:50.329> I've<00:00:51.329> set

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
to be inked in an eraser and I've set

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.459 
to be inked in an eraser and I've set
the<00:00:51.960> pin<00:00:53.090> so<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.340> feel<00:00:57.199> pressure<00:00:58.199> is

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
the pin so that the to feel pressure is

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.570 
the pin so that the to feel pressure is
indeed<00:00:59.719> what<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:01.109> feels<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:01.739> them<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:04.580> I've

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
indeed what it feels like them and I've

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.890 
indeed what it feels like them and I've
set<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.960> down<00:01:07.220> keys<00:01:08.220> or<00:01:09.000> undo<00:01:09.630> and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
set the up and down keys or undo and

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.760 
set the up and down keys or undo and
redo<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.390> very<00:01:12.630> important<00:01:13.260> I've<00:01:13.470> set

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
redo so this is very important I've set

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.120 
redo so this is very important I've set
them<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.070> undo<00:01:14.430> redo<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.560> on<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.710> default

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
them to undo redo and on the default

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.270 
them to undo redo and on the default
I've<00:01:17.939> set<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.450> right<00:01:18.780> click<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.350> pan<00:01:20.070> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
I've set it to right click and pan and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.100 
I've set it to right click and pan and
scroll<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:24.630> program<00:01:24.840> I'm

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
scroll so this is the program I'm

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.109 
scroll so this is the program I'm
talking<00:01:25.470> about<00:01:25.619> ArtRage<00:01:26.100> studio<00:01:28.850> seems<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.030> be

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
talking about ArtRage studio seems to be

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.710 
talking about ArtRage studio seems to be
lacking<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.600> bit<00:01:30.630> because<00:01:30.960> my<00:01:31.619> screen<00:01:31.890> recorder

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
lacking a bit because my screen recorder

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:45.649 
lacking a bit because my screen recorder
I'll<00:01:33.720> start<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.290> new<00:01:34.439> file<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:44.420> I'll<00:01:45.420> show

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
I'll start up a new file and I'll show

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.649 
I'll start up a new file and I'll show
you<00:01:45.750> what<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:45.960> mean<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:47.030> just<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.270> reiterate

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
you what I mean so just to reiterate

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.270 
you what I mean so just to reiterate
again<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.880> have<00:01:50.880> undo<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.689> reduce<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.740> for<00:01:53.130> my

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
again I have undo and reduce it for my

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.539 
again I have undo and reduce it for my
in<00:01:53.729> buttons<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:55.470> it's<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.520> program<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:58.549> as

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
in buttons so it's the program and as

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.550 
in buttons so it's the program and as
you<00:01:59.759> can<00:01:59.880> see<00:01:59.939> I'm<00:02:00.450> drawing<00:02:01.259> pretty<00:02:01.560> normally

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
you can see I'm drawing pretty normally

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.560 
you can see I'm drawing pretty normally
apart<00:02:04.560> from<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.100> really<00:02:05.820> bad<00:02:06.030> lag<00:02:06.299> what's

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
apart from the really bad lag what's

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.839 
apart from the really bad lag what's
happening<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.789 

I'll<00:02:11.849> show<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.260> when<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.290> undo<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.760> redo<00:02:15.799> it

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
I'll show you when I undo and redo it

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.349 
I'll show you when I undo and redo it
works<00:02:17.540> but<00:02:18.540> as<00:02:18.749> soon<00:02:19.019> as<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.439> lift<00:02:19.739> my<00:02:20.280> pin<00:02:21.090> off

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
works but as soon as I lift my pin off

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:28.190 
works but as soon as I lift my pin off
the<00:02:21.840> tablet<00:02:22.319> out<00:02:24.349> of<00:02:25.349> um<00:02:26.120> whether<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:27.750> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
the tablet out of um whether we the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.949 
the tablet out of um whether we the
tablet<00:02:28.709> will<00:02:28.829> sense<00:02:29.040> again<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:30.239> then<00:02:30.689> put<00:02:30.840> it

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
tablet will sense again and then put it

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.490 
tablet will sense again and then put it
back<00:02:31.079> down<00:02:32.810> my<00:02:33.810> settings<00:02:34.409> seemed<00:02:35.219> to<00:02:35.489> be<00:02:35.819> reset

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
back down my settings seemed to be reset

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.610 
back down my settings seemed to be reset
so<00:02:37.760> it's<00:02:38.760> no<00:02:38.939> longer<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:40.019> is<00:02:40.200> bright<00:02:40.409> cliff

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
so it's no longer this is bright cliff

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.619 
so it's no longer this is bright cliff
by<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:40.859> way<00:02:41.359> it's<00:02:42.359> no<00:02:42.569> longer<00:02:42.750> undoing<00:02:43.319> redo

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
by the way it's no longer undoing redo

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:50.020 
by the way it's no longer undoing redo
its<00:02:46.189> pan<00:02:47.189> and<00:02:47.400> scroll<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.969> right<00:02:48.870> click<00:02:49.139> and

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
its pan and scroll and right click and

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.780 
its pan and scroll and right click and
the<00:02:51.030> only<00:02:51.180> way<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.989> fix<00:02:52.169> this<00:02:52.439> is<00:02:53.280> for<00:02:53.489> me<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:53.669> go

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
the only way to fix this is for me to go

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.770 
the only way to fix this is for me to go
out<00:02:53.939> the<00:02:54.180> window<00:02:54.329> and<00:02:56.000> get<00:02:57.000> out<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.359> program

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
out the window and get out the program

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.390 
out the window and get out the program
so<00:02:57.959> it's<00:02:58.109> not<00:02:58.260> maximized<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:58.980> then<00:02:59.069> go<00:02:59.219> back

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
so it's not maximized and then go back

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.020 
so it's not maximized and then go back
in<00:02:59.579> and<00:02:59.879> then<00:03:00.780> it'll<00:03:01.739> start<00:03:02.010> working<00:03:02.069> again<00:03:05.030> so

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
in and then it'll start working again so

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.559 
in and then it'll start working again so
I<00:03:06.620> actually<00:03:07.620> did<00:03:08.010> look<00:03:08.549> up<00:03:08.699> on<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:08.969> forums<00:03:09.359> for

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
I actually did look up on the forums for

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.360 
I actually did look up on the forums for
this<00:03:09.719> and<00:03:12.169> someone<00:03:13.169> else<00:03:13.349> is<00:03:13.620> also<00:03:14.069> having

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
this and someone else is also having

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.240 
this and someone else is also having
this<00:03:14.489> problem<00:03:14.819> I<00:03:15.239> can't<00:03:15.870> find<00:03:16.199> a<00:03:16.439> solution<00:03:16.859> to

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
this problem I can't find a solution to
