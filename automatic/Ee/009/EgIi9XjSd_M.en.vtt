are firstly got milk protein which is

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.030 
are firstly got milk protein which is
quite<00:01:14.340> surprising<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.890> protein<00:01:16.890> bar

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
quite surprising in a protein bar

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.310 
quite surprising in a protein bar
usually<00:01:17.490> find<00:01:18.590> hydrolyzed<00:01:19.590> gelatin<00:01:20.040> above

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
usually find hydrolyzed gelatin above

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.870 
usually find hydrolyzed gelatin above
things<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.530> milk<00:01:22.830> protein<00:01:23.160> or<00:01:23.280> whey<00:01:23.430> protein

in<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> ingredients<00:01:24.690> list<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.430> next<00:01:26.430> you've

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
in the ingredients list and next you've

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.360 
in the ingredients list and next you've
got<00:01:27.060> hydrolyzed<00:01:27.540> gelatin<00:01:27.990> as<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.830> use

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
got hydrolyzed gelatin as you use

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.150 
got hydrolyzed gelatin as you use
usually<00:01:30.030> find<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.600> products<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.260> this<00:01:31.620> then

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
usually find in products like this then

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.880 
usually find in products like this then
you've<00:01:32.280> got<00:01:32.400> gly<00:01:32.670> Suren<00:01:33.110> vegetable<00:01:34.110> oil<00:01:34.320> soy

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
you've got gly Suren vegetable oil soy

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.790 
you've got gly Suren vegetable oil soy
protein<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:36.200> chocolate<00:01:37.200> chips<00:01:37.410> is<00:01:37.530> next

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
protein and chocolate chips is next

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.410 
protein and chocolate chips is next
which<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.010> six<00:01:38.250> percent<00:01:38.580> so<00:01:38.730> I<00:01:38.760> doubt<00:01:39.090> there<00:01:39.390> is

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
which is six percent so I doubt there is

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.390 
which is six percent so I doubt there is
much<00:01:39.660> soy<00:01:40.170> protein<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.800> there<00:01:40.980> if<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.190> next

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
much soy protein in there if it's next

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.980 
much soy protein in there if it's next
to<00:01:41.640> chocolate<00:01:42.300> chips<00:01:42.480> and<00:01:42.630> chocolate<00:01:42.780> chips

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
to chocolate chips and chocolate chips

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.580 
to chocolate chips and chocolate chips
was<00:01:43.290> six<00:01:43.560> percent<00:01:45.020> then<00:01:46.020> you've<00:01:46.260> got<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
was six percent then you've got the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.720 
was six percent then you've got the
candied<00:01:46.950> orange<00:01:47.250> pro<00:01:47.400> so<00:01:47.460> you've<00:01:47.640> actually

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
candied orange pro so you've actually

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.420 
candied orange pro so you've actually
got<00:01:48.210> actual<00:01:48.870> orange<00:01:49.170> peel<00:01:49.410> inside<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.190> then

like their individual flavors the white
chocolate<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:15.459> me<00:03:15.609> there<00:03:16.060> wasn't<00:03:16.269> much<00:03:16.720> taste

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
chocolate to me there wasn't much taste

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.569 
chocolate to me there wasn't much taste

of white chocolate sometimes white
chocolate<00:03:19.000> chips<00:03:19.269> but<00:03:19.629> I<00:03:19.900> didn't<00:03:20.500> get<00:03:20.560> much

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
chocolate chips but I didn't get much

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
white chocolate flavoring there it's

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.740 
white chocolate flavoring there it's
white<00:03:23.379> chocolate<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:23.769> almond<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.519> did<00:03:25.299> get<00:03:25.569> a

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
white chocolate and almond I did get a

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.979 
white chocolate and almond I did get a
hell<00:03:26.079> of<00:03:26.109> a<00:03:26.319> lot<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.590> marzipan<00:03:27.549> flavor<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.419> i

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
hell of a lot of marzipan flavor and i

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.289 
hell of a lot of marzipan flavor and i
really<00:03:29.290> like<00:03:29.440> marzipan<00:03:29.829> but<00:03:30.340> for<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.819> couple<00:03:31.269> of

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
really like marzipan but for a couple of

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.720 
really like marzipan but for a couple of
my<00:03:31.480> friends<00:03:31.690> they<00:03:32.049> found<00:03:32.349> it<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.709> bit<00:03:32.980> too<00:03:33.220> much

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
my friends they found it a bit too much

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.000 
my friends they found it a bit too much
i'm<00:03:33.940> quite<00:03:34.120> sickly<00:03:34.329> but<00:03:34.569> me<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.500> my<00:03:35.709> brother

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.430 
i'm quite sickly but me and my brother
we<00:03:36.190> both<00:03:36.569> realized<00:03:37.569> because<00:03:37.720> we're<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:37.959> big<00:03:38.230> fan

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
we both realized because we're a big fan

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.000 
we both realized because we're a big fan
of<00:03:38.470> marzipan<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:40.599> chocolate<00:03:41.169> flavor<00:03:41.709> I

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
of marzipan the chocolate flavor I

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.969 
of marzipan the chocolate flavor I
didn't<00:03:42.459> like<00:03:42.579> whatsoever<00:03:43.329> I<00:03:43.810> really<00:03:44.769> didn't

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:44.979 
didn't like whatsoever I really didn't

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.309 
didn't like whatsoever I really didn't
like<00:03:45.099> it<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.609> had<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.790> bad<00:03:46.060> aftertaste<00:03:46.629> and<00:03:47.079> it

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
like it it had a bad aftertaste and it

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.719 
like it it had a bad aftertaste and it
didn't<00:03:47.530> really<00:03:47.620> taste<00:03:47.859> chocolate<00:03:48.069> to<00:03:48.400> me<00:03:48.519> at

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:48.729 
didn't really taste chocolate to me at

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.270 
didn't really taste chocolate to me at
all<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:49.030> was<00:03:49.090> quite<00:03:49.419> sour<00:03:49.750> as<00:03:50.109> well<00:03:50.290> the

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
all it was quite sour as well the

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.280 
all it was quite sour as well the
chocolate<00:03:51.459> mint<00:03:51.849> was<00:03:52.120> really<00:03:52.569> really<00:03:52.750> nice<00:03:52.959> I

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
chocolate mint was really really nice I

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.719 
chocolate mint was really really nice I
enjoyed<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.829> chocolate<00:03:54.159> mint<00:03:54.310> a<00:03:54.370> lot<00:03:54.549> and

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:54.729 
enjoyed the chocolate mint a lot and

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:57.059 
enjoyed the chocolate mint a lot and
there<00:03:55.359> wasn't<00:03:55.510> much<00:03:55.720> chocolate<00:03:55.989> flavor<00:03:56.500> quite

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
there wasn't much chocolate flavor quite

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.740 
there wasn't much chocolate flavor quite
a<00:03:57.099> strong<00:03:57.340> mint<00:03:57.579> flavor<00:03:57.909> but<00:03:58.239> it<00:03:58.359> wasn't

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
a strong mint flavor but it wasn't

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.559 
a strong mint flavor but it wasn't
overpowering<00:03:59.819> it<00:04:00.819> didn't<00:04:01.180> taste<00:04:01.299> anything

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
overpowering it didn't taste anything
