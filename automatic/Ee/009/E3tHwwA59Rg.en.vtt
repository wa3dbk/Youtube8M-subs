too<00:00:20.609> fancy<00:00:20.760> because<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.210> really<00:00:21.420> exciting

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
too fancy because I was really exciting

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.000 
too fancy because I was really exciting
to<00:00:21.750> think<00:00:21.840> about<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.350> know<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.470> go<00:00:22.680> where<00:00:22.890> we're

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
to think about you know I go where we're

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.259 
to think about you know I go where we're
gonna<00:00:23.070> be<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> couple<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.580> years<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:24.090> did

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
gonna be in a couple of years we did

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.509 
gonna be in a couple of years we did
this<00:00:24.390> video<00:00:24.660> like<00:00:24.869> future<00:00:25.529> rock<00:00:25.710> band<00:00:25.980> where

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
this video like future rock band where

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.620 
this video like future rock band where
we<00:00:26.670> sort<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.849> like<00:00:26.970> well<00:00:27.119> what's<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.449> future

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
we sort of like well what's the future

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.450 
we sort of like well what's the future
of<00:00:27.810> rhythm<00:00:28.710> gaming<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.279> thought<00:00:29.369> it'd

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
of rhythm gaming and so we thought it'd

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.009 
of rhythm gaming and so we thought it'd
be<00:00:29.490> kind<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.670> fun<00:00:29.820> like<00:00:29.849> well<00:00:30.179> what's<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
be kind of fun like well what's the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.319 
be kind of fun like well what's the
future<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.349> like<00:00:31.980> motion<00:00:32.399> control<00:00:32.730> gaming<00:00:33.149> and

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
future of like motion control gaming and

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.549 
future of like motion control gaming and
so<00:00:33.570> what<00:00:33.719> we<00:00:33.809> do<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.020> field<00:00:34.170> isn't<00:00:34.380> like

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
so what we do in this field isn't like

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.440 
so what we do in this field isn't like
entirely<00:00:35.010> made<00:00:35.610> up<00:00:35.820> or<00:00:35.969> not<00:00:36.030> just<00:00:36.270> like<00:00:36.360> you

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
lot of the pieces of technology that

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.049 
lot of the pieces of technology that
we're<00:00:39.719> showing<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:40.260> exists<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.550> as

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
we're showing like exists not in as

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.180 
we're showing like exists not in as
advanced<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.690> form<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.680> know<00:00:44.010> like

motion control stuff and we sort of took

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.139 
motion control stuff and we sort of took
all<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.860> all<00:00:50.219> these<00:00:50.370> pieces<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.940> brought

were like I level it's going to

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.670 
were like I level it's going to
procedurally<00:00:56.730> generate<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.449> place<00:00:58.199> enemies

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
procedurally generate and place enemies

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.330 
procedurally generate and place enemies
and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
and

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.880 
and
we<00:00:59.550> made<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.120> sort<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.840> fake<00:01:01.050> rig<00:01:01.320> what<00:01:01.860> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
we made this sort of fake rig what a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.650 
we made this sort of fake rig what a
pipe<00:01:02.130> look<00:01:02.310> liking<00:01:02.580> with<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.910> head<00:01:03.360> mount<00:01:03.510> the

any environment you follow to figure out

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.070 
any environment you follow to figure out

whenever you doing a CG object you're in

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.710 
whenever you doing a CG object you're in

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
a comp into a shot it's key to find as

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.210 
a comp into a shot it's key to find as
many<00:03:09.900> ways<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.410> make<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.620> interact<00:03:11.010> with<00:03:11.160> a

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
many ways to make it interact with a

shot in like a real a real world way as

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.210 
shot in like a real a real world way as
possible<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.350> easiest<00:03:13.680> way<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.890> do<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.130> not

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
possible the easiest way to do it not

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.560 
possible the easiest way to do it not
like<00:03:14.280> obviously<00:03:14.700> if<00:03:14.820> we<00:03:14.880> could<00:03:15.000> pick<00:03:15.390> things

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
like obviously if we could pick things

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.300 
like obviously if we could pick things
up<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:15.930> move<00:03:16.049> things<00:03:16.290> around<00:03:16.410> that's<00:03:17.010> best

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
up and move things around that's best

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.860 
up and move things around that's best
but<00:03:17.519> that's<00:03:17.640> really<00:03:17.790> hard<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.120> do<00:03:18.269> so<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
but that's really hard to do so the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.060 
but that's really hard to do so the
easiest<00:03:19.110> way<00:03:19.200> making<00:03:19.470> rent<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:19.739> obviously

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
easiest way making rent is obviously

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.100 
easiest way making rent is obviously
shadows<00:03:20.670> ambient<00:03:21.120> occlusion<00:03:21.239> like<00:03:21.630> contact

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
shadows ambient occlusion like contact

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.960 
shadows ambient occlusion like contact
shadows<00:03:22.440> proximity<00:03:22.920> so<00:03:23.459> for<00:03:23.670> a<00:03:23.700> video<00:03:23.910> game

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
shadows proximity so for a video game

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.699 
shadows proximity so for a video game
normally<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.480> animators<00:03:24.930> they<00:03:25.170> complete<00:03:25.620> the

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
normally the animators they complete the

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.229 
normally the animators they complete the
animations<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.310> then<00:03:26.400> obviously<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.880> engine

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
animations and then obviously the engine

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.789 
animations and then obviously the engine
and<00:03:27.390> handles<00:03:28.019> all<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.170> rendering<00:03:28.410> when<00:03:28.709> it

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
and handles all the rendering when it

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.410 
and handles all the rendering when it
goes<00:03:28.890> out<00:03:29.100> but<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:29.880> today<00:03:30.090> we're<00:03:30.209> showing<00:03:30.330> a

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
goes out but so today we're showing a

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.310 
goes out but so today we're showing a
little<00:03:30.510> bit<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.720> our<00:03:30.840> world<00:03:31.019> which<00:03:31.230> was

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
little bit of our world which was

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.570 
little bit of our world which was
worried<00:03:31.500> actually<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.860> render<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.370> out<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.519> the

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
worried actually to render it out of the

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.650 
worried actually to render it out of the
computer<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:32.940> get<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.209> frames<00:03:33.480> and

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
computer and get the frames and

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.180 
computer and get the frames and
compositing<00:03:34.170> ourselves<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:34.950> our<00:03:35.040> date

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
compositing ourselves so our date

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.830 
compositing ourselves so our date
insomniac<00:03:35.610> was<00:03:35.730> ultimately<00:03:35.880> success<00:03:36.360> mainly

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
insomniac was ultimately success mainly

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.210 
insomniac was ultimately success mainly
because<00:03:36.959> it<00:03:37.170> was<00:03:37.200> only<00:03:37.440> one<00:03:37.860> day<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.160> I

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
because it was only one day and I

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.039 
because it was only one day and I
suppose<00:03:38.489> took<00:03:38.700> many<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.180> get<00:03:39.269> it<00:03:39.360> right<00:03:39.780> during

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
suppose took many to get it right during

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.170 
suppose took many to get it right during
those<00:03:40.440> many<00:03:40.739> days<00:03:40.920> it<00:03:41.190> often<00:03:41.549> can<00:03:41.700> take<00:03:41.880> we

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
those many days it often can take we

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.130 
those many days it often can take we
went<00:03:42.360> in<00:03:42.420> there<00:03:42.540> in<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.660> middle<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:42.900> crunch

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
went in there in the middle of crunch

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.940 
went in there in the middle of crunch
time<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.500> should<00:03:43.650> get

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
time and should get

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.559 
time and should get
eleven<00:03:44.250> shots<00:03:44.430> out<00:03:44.730> after<00:03:45.060> we<00:03:45.150> got<00:03:45.239> them<00:03:45.450> back

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
eleven shots out after we got them back

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.510 
eleven shots out after we got them back
though<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.930> was<00:03:46.110> our<00:03:46.230> job<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.530> composite<00:03:47.400> them

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
though it was our job to composite them

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.650 
though it was our job to composite them
in<00:03:47.670> normally<00:03:48.090> we<00:03:48.209> go<00:03:48.360> with<00:03:48.510> like<00:03:48.629> a

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
in normally we go with like a

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.300 
in normally we go with like a
photorealistic<00:03:49.170> thing<00:03:49.650> like<00:03:49.890> the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
photorealistic thing like the

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.009 
photorealistic thing like the
helicopters<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.150> some<00:03:51.300> of<00:03:51.420> obviously<00:03:51.810> okay

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
helicopters and some of obviously okay

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.300 
helicopters and some of obviously okay
we<00:03:52.379> have<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.530> do<00:03:52.620> all<00:03:52.709> this<00:03:52.830> stuff<00:03:52.890> to<00:03:53.190> make

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
we have to do all this stuff to make

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.520 
we have to do all this stuff to make
sure<00:03:53.459> it<00:03:53.550> looks<00:03:53.810> photorealistic<00:03:54.810> but<00:03:55.319> with

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
sure it looks photorealistic but with

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.990 
sure it looks photorealistic but with
this<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.890> idea<00:03:55.920> is<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.250> it's<00:03:56.730> being

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
this the idea is that it's being

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.240 
this the idea is that it's being
projected<00:03:57.180> from<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:57.920> projector<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:58.980> my<00:03:59.040> head

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
projected from the projector of my head

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.910 
projected from the projector of my head
so<00:03:59.849> we<00:03:59.970> kind<00:04:00.239> of<00:04:00.300> go<00:04:00.420> for<00:04:00.569> like<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.690> ghostly<00:04:01.260> sort

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
so we kind of go for like a ghostly sort

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.860 
so we kind of go for like a ghostly sort
of<00:04:02.010> projected<00:04:02.610> look<00:04:02.819> it's<00:04:03.030> got<00:04:03.180> fun<00:04:03.390> because

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
of projected look it's got fun because

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.630 
of projected look it's got fun because
you<00:04:04.170> can<00:04:04.200> do<00:04:04.380> all<00:04:04.410> sorts<00:04:04.709> of<00:04:04.739> weird<00:04:04.890> things

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
you can do all sorts of weird things

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.310 
you can do all sorts of weird things
there's<00:04:05.820> an<00:04:05.970> experiment<00:04:06.420> around<00:04:06.660> with<00:04:06.840> it<00:04:06.990> to

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
there's an experiment around with it to

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.280 
there's an experiment around with it to
get<00:04:07.500> cavity
