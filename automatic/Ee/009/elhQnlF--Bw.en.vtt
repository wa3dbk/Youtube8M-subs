you might want to know the double
rainbow<00:00:29.349> which<00:00:30.349> is<00:00:30.560> a<00:00:30.829> trick<00:00:31.160> that<00:00:31.189> James

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 
rainbow which is a trick that James

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.069 
rainbow which is a trick that James
Kelly<00:00:31.730> made<00:00:31.970> up<00:00:32.119> so<00:00:32.450> you<00:00:32.509> can<00:00:32.660> check<00:00:32.840> that<00:00:32.900> out

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
Kelly made up so you can check that out

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.010 
Kelly made up so you can check that out
its<00:00:34.010> a<00:00:34.100> mix<00:00:34.250> between<00:00:34.610> a<00:00:34.880> foot<00:00:35.390> under<00:00:35.660> shove<00:00:35.870> it

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
its a mix between a foot under shove it

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.189 
its a mix between a foot under shove it
and<00:00:36.200> double<00:00:37.129> rainbow<00:00:37.460> overview<00:00:38.300> of<00:00:38.539> the<00:00:38.989> foot

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
and double rainbow overview of the foot

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.350 
and double rainbow overview of the foot
under<00:00:39.410> shove<00:00:39.590> it's<00:00:39.800> not<00:00:39.980> that<00:00:40.160> hard<00:00:40.309> going<00:00:41.180> up

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
under shove it's not that hard going up

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.630 
under shove it's not that hard going up
pretty<00:00:42.140> much<00:00:42.230> what<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.440> trick<00:00:42.620> is<00:00:42.649> just<00:00:43.070> shove

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
pretty much what the trick is just shove

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.270 
pretty much what the trick is just shove
it<00:00:43.670> be<00:00:43.969> using<00:00:44.390> your<00:00:44.840> back<00:00:45.050> foot<00:00:45.379> to<00:00:45.890> push<00:00:45.920> the

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
it be using your back foot to push the

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.959 
it be using your back foot to push the
board<00:00:46.520> around<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:47.989> use<00:00:48.649> back<00:00:49.160> on<00:00:49.309> ok<00:00:49.699> foot

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
board around and use back on ok foot

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.569 
board around and use back on ok foot
position<00:00:50.390> won't<00:00:50.809> have<00:00:50.899> it<00:00:51.019> here<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:51.829> when<00:00:52.519> you

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
position won't have it here so when you

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.580 
position won't have it here so when you
put<00:00:52.730> all<00:00:52.969> your<00:00:53.000> weight<00:00:53.149> on<00:00:53.300> it<00:00:53.600> will<00:00:54.199> only<00:00:54.320> come

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
put all your weight on it will only come

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.680 
put all your weight on it will only come
up<00:00:54.620> a<00:00:54.739> little<00:00:55.039> and<00:00:55.219> then<00:00:55.850> for<00:00:56.149> your<00:00:56.239> back<00:00:56.449> foot

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
up a little and then for your back foot

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.229 
up a little and then for your back foot
you<00:00:57.679> want<00:00:57.829> to<00:00:57.890> have<00:00:58.010> it<00:00:58.160> kind<00:00:58.879> of<00:00:59.000> in<00:00:59.120> the

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
you want to have it kind of in the

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.729 
you want to have it kind of in the
center<00:00:59.449> of<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.629> board<00:00:59.899> wherever<00:01:00.679> is

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
center of the board wherever is

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:01.810 
center of the board wherever is
comfortable<00:01:00.859> but<00:01:01.190> you<00:01:01.370> don't<00:01:01.519> want<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:01.699> have

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
comfortable but you don't want to have

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.790 
comfortable but you don't want to have
it<00:01:01.940> too<00:01:02.090> close<00:01:02.239> otherwise<00:01:03.140> it's<00:01:03.350> too<00:01:03.500> hard<00:01:03.739> to

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
it too close otherwise it's too hard to

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.610 
it too close otherwise it's too hard to
rotate<00:01:04.220> you<00:01:04.640> don't<00:01:04.820> want<00:01:04.970> it<00:01:05.030> too<00:01:05.150> far<00:01:05.620> over

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
rotate you don't want it too far over

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.770 
rotate you don't want it too far over
rotate<00:01:07.100> so<00:01:07.520> you<00:01:07.580> want<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:07.850> just<00:01:07.880> right<00:01:08.300> so

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
rotate so you want to just right so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.220 
rotate so you want to just right so
basically<00:01:09.350> for<00:01:09.380> this<00:01:09.620> trick<00:01:10.990> all<00:01:11.990> you're

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
basically for this trick all you're

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.860 
basically for this trick all you're
doing<00:01:12.500> did<00:01:13.010> you<00:01:13.130> love<00:01:13.220> your<00:01:13.340> foot<00:01:13.520> there<00:01:13.870> once

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
doing did you love your foot there once

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.180 
doing did you love your foot there once
you<00:01:14.930> get<00:01:15.050> the<00:01:15.110> right<00:01:15.200> foot<00:01:15.500> placement<00:01:15.950> and

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
you get the right foot placement and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.160 
you get the right foot placement and
then<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:16.880> flip<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:17.270> board<00:01:17.480> and<00:01:17.690> then<00:01:17.900> click

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
then you flip the board and then click

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.020 
then you flip the board and then click
when<00:01:18.380> it's<00:01:18.500> about<00:01:18.680> right<00:01:18.920> there<00:01:19.100> you<00:01:19.820> want<00:01:19.970> to

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
when it's about right there you want to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.110 
when it's about right there you want to
jump<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:22.250> board<00:01:22.520> will<00:01:22.700> already<00:01:23.000> be

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
jump and the board will already be

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.210 
jump and the board will already be
rotating<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:23.690> want<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:23.900> jump<00:01:24.110> back<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.130> way

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
rotating you want to jump back the way

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:35.040 
rotating you want to jump back the way
you<00:01:25.250> came<00:01:25.870> so<00:01:26.870> you'll<00:01:27.230> win<00:01:28.510> like<00:01:29.510> that

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.200 

you<00:01:36.050> rotate<00:01:36.440> opposite<00:01:37.250> of<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:37.430> board<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:38.120> the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
you rotate opposite of the board to the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.750 
you rotate opposite of the board to the
board<00:01:38.480> goes<00:01:39.350> counter<00:01:39.800> clockwise<00:01:39.830> while<00:01:40.580> your

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
board goes counter clockwise while your

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.930 
board goes counter clockwise while your
body<00:01:40.940> goes<00:01:41.810> clockwise<00:01:42.520> that's<00:01:43.520> what<00:01:43.640> makes<00:01:43.820> it

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
body goes clockwise that's what makes it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.540 
body goes clockwise that's what makes it
hard<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:44.690> you<00:01:45.320> really<00:01:45.530> have<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.680> jump<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:46.460> you

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
hard so you really have to jump so you

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.730 
hard so you really have to jump so you
can<00:01:46.700> go<00:01:47.150> all<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.420> way<00:01:47.540> around<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:48.170> then<00:01:48.200> back

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
can go all the way around and then back

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.810 
can go all the way around and then back
on<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:48.979> board<00:01:49.190> the<00:01:49.610> board<00:01:49.910> won't<00:01:50.150> rotate<00:01:51.820> your

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
on the board the board won't rotate your

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:02.620 
on the board the board won't rotate your
land<00:01:53.000> switched<00:01:59.740> so<00:02:00.740> uh<00:02:00.770> common<00:02:01.610> problems<00:02:02.060> with

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
land switched so uh common problems with

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.010 
land switched so uh common problems with
this<00:02:02.780> trick<00:02:03.110> or<00:02:04.300> you're<00:02:05.300> getting<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.720> flip

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
this trick or you're getting the flip

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.810 
this trick or you're getting the flip
down<00:02:06.170> all<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.650> way<00:02:06.740> around<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:07.520> once<00:02:07.700> you

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
down all the way around and once you

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.110 
down all the way around and once you
rotate<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.989> land<00:02:09.259> that<00:02:09.610> with<00:02:10.610> your<00:02:10.700> feet<00:02:10.880> side

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
rotate you land that with your feet side

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.180 
rotate you land that with your feet side
by<00:02:11.270> side<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:11.870> board<00:02:12.200> will<00:02:12.350> shoot<00:02:12.590> out<00:02:12.739> from

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
by side and board will shoot out from

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.440 
by side and board will shoot out from
are<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.550> most<00:02:13.730> likely<00:02:15.459> for<00:02:16.459> that<00:02:16.640> all<00:02:17.000> you

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
are you most likely for that all you

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.199 
are you most likely for that all you
need<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.170> do<00:02:18.320> is<00:02:18.590> just<00:02:19.220> like<00:02:19.400> jump<00:02:19.670> higher<00:02:19.910> so

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
need to do is just like jump higher so

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.090 
need to do is just like jump higher so
you<00:02:20.239> have<00:02:20.390> more<00:02:20.570> rotation<00:02:21.290> another<00:02:21.890> problem

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
you have more rotation another problem

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.640 
you have more rotation another problem
is<00:02:23.560> you'll<00:02:24.560> land<00:02:24.890> with<00:02:25.820> your<00:02:26.350> front<00:02:27.350> foot<00:02:27.410> on

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
is you'll land with your front foot on

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.050 
is you'll land with your front foot on
with<00:02:27.920> your<00:02:28.010> back<00:02:28.190> foot<00:02:28.220> off<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.880> it's<00:02:28.970> like

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
with your back foot off and it's like

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.479 
with your back foot off and it's like
way<00:02:29.239> out<00:02:29.390> here<00:02:31.270> we<00:02:32.270> want<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.540> do<00:02:32.630> with<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.750> is

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
way out here we want to do with that is

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.310 
way out here we want to do with that is
you're<00:02:34.489> probably<00:02:34.730> like<00:02:34.970> spinning<00:02:35.450> too<00:02:35.989> hard

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
you're probably like spinning too hard

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.650 
you're probably like spinning too hard
and<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.709> board<00:02:36.950> shoots<00:02:37.250> out<00:02:37.459> with<00:02:37.760> it<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.600> you

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
and the board shoots out with it so you

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.360 
and the board shoots out with it so you
need<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:38.930> just<00:02:39.049> jump<00:02:39.320> higher<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:40.070> get<00:02:40.190> more

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
need to just jump higher to get more

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.970 
need to just jump higher to get more
rotations<00:02:40.880> than<00:02:40.880> just<00:02:41.420> rotating<00:02:42.230> harder<00:02:42.590> so

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
rotations than just rotating harder so

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.530 
rotations than just rotating harder so
the<00:02:43.100> board<00:02:43.310> will<00:02:43.459> end<00:02:43.580> up<00:02:43.700> shooting<00:02:44.060> out<00:02:44.209> a

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
the board will end up shooting out a

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.740 
the board will end up shooting out a
little<00:02:44.989> farther<00:02:45.290> as<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:46.070> kick<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.690> ok<00:02:47.690> so

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
little farther as you kick it ok so

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.750 
little farther as you kick it ok so
another<00:02:48.170> problem<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:49.070> might<00:02:49.190> be<00:02:49.250> having<00:02:49.459> is

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
another problem you might be having is

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.300 
another problem you might be having is
you<00:02:50.360> get<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.660> flip<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.560> board<00:02:51.769> flips<00:02:52.040> all<00:02:52.220> the

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
you get the flip the board flips all the

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.370 
you get the flip the board flips all the
way<00:02:52.400> around<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:53.360> you're<00:02:53.480> also<00:02:53.600> rotating<00:02:54.170> but

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
way around and you're also rotating but

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.289 
way around and you're also rotating but
you<00:02:54.470> only<00:02:54.560> have<00:02:54.769> one<00:02:55.010> foot<00:02:55.280> on<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.880> board<00:02:56.090> and

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
you only have one foot on the board and

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.560 
you only have one foot on the board and
the<00:02:56.390> other<00:02:56.540> one<00:02:56.690> lands<00:02:57.019> right<00:02:57.650> beside<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:58.570> for

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
the other one lands right beside it for

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.820 
the other one lands right beside it for
this<00:02:59.660> you<00:02:59.810> just<00:02:59.989> have<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.230> commit<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:00.650> can't

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
this you just have to commit you can't

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.070 
this you just have to commit you can't
be<00:03:00.920> scared<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:01.910> like<00:03:02.120> scary<00:03:02.420> rotating<00:03:03.019> the

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
be scared it is like scary rotating the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.380 
be scared it is like scary rotating the
opposite<00:03:03.440> way<00:03:03.590> but<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:04.430> just<00:03:04.489> gotta<00:03:04.760> like<00:03:05.000> try

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
opposite way but you just gotta like try

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.819 
opposite way but you just gotta like try
to<00:03:05.450> land<00:03:05.810> as<00:03:06.079> close<00:03:06.320> to<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.500> board's<00:03:06.739> you

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
to land as close to the board's you

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.250 
to land as close to the board's you
can't<00:03:07.070> just<00:03:07.730> hop<00:03:07.940> on<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.299> and<00:03:08.450> then<00:03:08.540> won't<00:03:08.750> like

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
can't just hop on it and then won't like

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.800 
can't just hop on it and then won't like
you<00:03:09.290> may<00:03:09.560> get<00:03:09.739> hurt<00:03:09.890> like<00:03:10.480> it'll<00:03:11.480> shoot<00:03:11.630> out

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
you may get hurt like it'll shoot out

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.090 
you may get hurt like it'll shoot out
something<00:03:12.140> but<00:03:12.290> you'll<00:03:12.410> eventually<00:03:12.560> get<00:03:12.950> it

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
something but you'll eventually get it

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.090 
something but you'll eventually get it
to<00:03:13.370> each<00:03:13.430> can<00:03:13.700> be<00:03:13.730> scared
