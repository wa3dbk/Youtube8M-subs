00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
but um it's it's quite a bit bigger than

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.260 
but um it's it's quite a bit bigger than
than<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.040> advertised<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.850> was<00:02:29.940> supposed<00:02:30.239> to

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
than the advertised it was supposed to

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.490

be<00:02:30.530> supposed<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.620> be<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.739> lot<00:02:31.980> smaller<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:33.500> you

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
be supposed to be a lot smaller so you

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.930 
be supposed to be a lot smaller so you
know<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:34.800> it's<00:02:35.130> always<00:02:35.370> nice<00:02:35.580> when<00:02:35.790> a

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
know it's it's always nice when a

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
nursery when they give you a little bit

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.860 
nursery when they give you a little bit
more<00:02:40.830> than<00:02:41.010> what<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.280> expected<00:02:41.870> that's

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
more than what you expected that's

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.949 
more than what you expected that's
always<00:02:43.110> nice<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:47.239> it<00:02:48.239> doesn't<00:02:48.540> look<00:02:48.630> like<00:02:48.690> much

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959

always nice so it doesn't look like much
now<00:02:49.019> but<00:02:52.130> maybe<00:02:53.130> in<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.430> few<00:02:53.670> years<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:54.269> know

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
now but maybe in a few years you know

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.880 
now but maybe in a few years you know
it'll<00:02:55.830> sit<00:02:56.070> on<00:02:56.100> some<00:02:56.459> treat<00:02:57.440> what<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.470> was<00:02:58.709> gonna

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
it'll sit on some treat what I was gonna

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.690 
it'll sit on some treat what I was gonna
say<00:02:59.190> is<00:02:59.400> that<00:03:00.230> these<00:03:01.230> can<00:03:01.800> fruit<00:03:02.220> all<00:03:02.489> year

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
say is that these can fruit all year

round if you if you get them

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.480 
round if you if you get them
continuously

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.060 

and<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:12.780> know<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.050> go<00:03:13.230> on<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:13.530> dump<00:03:13.950> a

resembles a pomegranate

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.040 
resembles a pomegranate
but<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:32.040> bark<00:03:32.370> flakes<00:03:32.850> off<00:03:33.120> kinda<00:03:33.420> very

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
similar to a guava so the it's really

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:55.040 
similar to a guava so the it's really
beautiful<00:03:53.270> well<00:03:54.270> it<00:03:54.330> looks<00:03:54.540> like<00:03:54.600> maybe<00:03:54.900> this

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
beautiful well it looks like maybe this

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.260 
beautiful well it looks like maybe this
tree<00:03:55.320> was<00:03:55.470> bigger<00:03:55.740> cuz<00:03:56.100> I'm<00:03:56.340> hearing<00:03:56.910> some<00:03:57.090> see

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
tree was bigger cuz I'm hearing some see

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.020 
tree was bigger cuz I'm hearing some see
that<00:03:57.450> they<00:03:58.220> they<00:03:59.220> had<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.460> prune<00:03:59.670> it<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.850> little

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
that they they had to prune it a little

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:07.480 
that they they had to prune it a little
bit<00:04:00.180> probably<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.540> fit<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:01.020> box<00:04:05.030> so<00:04:06.030> that's

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
bit probably to fit the box so that's

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:24.920 
bit probably to fit the box so that's
that's<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.730> tree

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.879 

it's<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:25.500> nice<00:04:25.680> tree<00:04:26.570> very<00:04:27.570> very<00:04:27.870> nice<00:04:30.889> okay

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
it's a nice tree very very nice okay

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.090 
it's a nice tree very very nice okay
thanks<00:04:32.610> for<00:04:32.639> watching
