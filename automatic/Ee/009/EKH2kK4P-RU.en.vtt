00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
components will end up in the guitar

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:01.610 
components will end up in the guitar
once<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.659> start<00:01:00.870> taking<00:01:01.409> it<00:01:01.499> off<00:01:01.589> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
we're putting the stuff into the F hole

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.900 
we're putting the stuff into the F hole
to<00:01:15.540> get<00:01:15.630> them<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.870> the<00:01:15.930> right<00:01:16.080> order<00:01:16.730> now<00:01:17.730> once

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
to get them in the right order now once

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.250 
to get them in the right order now once
you<00:01:18.030> flip<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.330> over<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:18.870> get<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.050> little

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
you flip this over it can get a little

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.720 
you flip this over it can get a little
confusing<00:01:19.680> where<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> wires<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.490> going<00:01:20.520> to

end up once they're installed in the
guitar<00:01:22.620> it's<00:01:23.550> a<00:01:23.610> good<00:01:23.730> idea<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.970> tape<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.450> a

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
when we're getting set up but we can tie

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.540

tuck it down underneath the switch by

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.980 
tuck it down underneath the switch by
the<00:01:46.140> pickups<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.740> it'll<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:47.040> out<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.190> sight

now<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.200> time<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.470> prepare<00:01:49.620> the<00:01:49.830> components

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
now it's time to prepare the components

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.370 
now it's time to prepare the components
to<00:01:50.610> pull<00:01:50.790> through<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.120> F<00:01:51.240> hole<00:01:51.510> and<00:01:51.870> rather

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
to pull through the F hole and rather

when<00:01:54.090> you're<00:01:54.210> removing<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.780> electronics<00:01:55.350> I

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
when you're removing the electronics I

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.899 
when you're removing the electronics I
recommend<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.220> just<00:01:56.370> wait<00:01:56.520> until<00:01:56.790> you're

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
recommend you just wait until you're

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.060 
recommend you just wait until you're
ready<00:01:56.940> to<00:01:57.390> reinstall<00:01:57.780> them<00:01:58.260> as<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.620> see<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:58.950> a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
ready to reinstall them as I see in a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.560 
ready to reinstall them as I see in a
minute<00:01:59.190> it's<00:01:59.490> pretty<00:01:59.700> easy<00:01:59.850> just<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.240> fish<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
minute it's pretty easy just to fish the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.390 
minute it's pretty easy just to fish the
strings<00:02:00.840> through<00:02:00.990> at<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.200> time<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.979> tie

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
strings through at that time and tie

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.680 
strings through at that time and tie
them<00:02:02.550> onto<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.790> components<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.450> you'll<00:02:03.600> be

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
them onto the components and you'll be

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.170 
them onto the components and you'll be
ready<00:02:03.870> to<00:02:04.020> go<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.460> we<00:02:05.550> need<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.760> select<00:02:05.909> some

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
ready to go so we need to select some

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.089 
ready to go so we need to select some
string<00:02:06.510> first<00:02:07.320> we'll<00:02:07.440> start<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:07.650> what<00:02:07.860> not

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
string first we'll start with what not

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.219 
string first we'll start with what not
to<00:02:08.250> use<00:02:08.450> sewing<00:02:09.450> thread<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.019> good

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
to use sewing thread is not a good

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.990 
to use sewing thread is not a good
choice<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.739> too<00:02:10.979> lightweight<00:02:11.220> which<00:02:11.790> means

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
choice it's too lightweight which means

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.459 
choice it's too lightweight which means
it'll<00:02:12.180> be<00:02:12.239> really<00:02:12.510> hard<00:02:12.719> to<00:02:12.780> feed<00:02:13.079> through<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:13.469 
it'll be really hard to feed through the

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.399 
it'll be really hard to feed through the
holes<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.430> it's<00:02:15.389> really<00:02:15.599> easy<00:02:15.719> to<00:02:15.840> break<00:02:16.109> so

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
holes and it's really easy to break so

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.580 
holes and it's really easy to break so
it's<00:02:16.530> just<00:02:16.620> not<00:02:16.799> worth<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.010> trouble

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
it's just not worth the trouble

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.470 
it's just not worth the trouble
now<00:02:18.310> I've<00:02:18.370> heard<00:02:18.520> some<00:02:18.730> people<00:02:18.819> using<00:02:19.239> rubber

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
now I've heard some people using rubber

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.390 
now I've heard some people using rubber
bands<00:02:19.780> or<00:02:20.050> chains<00:02:20.260> of<00:02:20.440> rubber<00:02:20.620> bands<00:02:20.890> but<00:02:21.160> I

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
bands or chains of rubber bands but I

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.890 
bands or chains of rubber bands but I
don't<00:02:21.819> much<00:02:21.880> see<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.180> point<00:02:22.360> using<00:02:22.690> anything

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
don't much see the point using anything

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.540 
don't much see the point using anything
elastic<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.680> mean<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.890> last<00:02:24.069> thing<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.370> want

when<00:02:24.610> you're<00:02:24.790> working<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.390> slingshot<00:02:25.900> pot

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
when you're working is a slingshot pot

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.820 
when you're working is a slingshot pot
to<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.709> eye<00:02:26.739> you<00:02:26.860> know<00:02:27.870> now<00:02:28.870> dental<00:02:29.470> floss<00:02:29.620> is

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.070 
to the eye you know now dental floss is
a<00:02:29.860> pretty<00:02:30.040> good<00:02:30.250> choice<00:02:30.430> it's<00:02:31.239> strong<00:02:31.660> and

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
a pretty good choice it's strong and

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.470 
a pretty good choice it's strong and
thin<00:02:33.069> so<00:02:33.099> when<00:02:33.580> you're<00:02:33.700> tying<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.030> around<00:02:34.090> the

thin so when you're tying it around the

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.940 
thin so when you're tying it around the
threads<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.019> pots<00:02:35.260> it'll<00:02:35.620> stay<00:02:35.800> out<00:02:35.920> of

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.699 
grab with with the pliers the thickness
will<00:02:58.450> make<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:58.780> get<00:02:59.019> in<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.230> way<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.380> little<00:02:59.560> bit

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
will make it get in the way a little bit

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.140 
will make it get in the way a little bit
when<00:02:59.950> we're<00:03:00.069> tying<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.400> around<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.670> pots<00:03:00.880> but

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
when we're tying it around the pots but

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.330 
when we're tying it around the pots but
I<00:03:01.180> think<00:03:01.360> we<00:03:01.450> can<00:03:01.600> work<00:03:01.720> around<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:02.080> so<00:03:02.500> let's

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
I think we can work around that so let's

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.479 
I think we can work around that so let's
use<00:03:03.489> this<00:03:03.640> one<00:03:04.860> now<00:03:05.860> what<00:03:05.980> I'm<00:03:06.040> gonna<00:03:06.130> do<00:03:06.340> is

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
use this one now what I'm gonna do is

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:07.830 
use this one now what I'm gonna do is
take<00:03:06.610> a<00:03:06.670> link<00:03:06.910> of<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.120> string<00:03:07.360> maybe<00:03:07.569> about

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
take a link of the string maybe about

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.009 
take a link of the string maybe about
two<00:03:08.319> feet<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:09.120> just<00:03:10.120> use<00:03:10.269> scissors<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.690> cut<00:03:10.900> it

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
two feet and just use scissors to cut it

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.229 
two feet and just use scissors to cut it
off<00:03:14.220> now<00:03:15.220> this<00:03:15.370> next<00:03:15.549> part<00:03:15.730> may<00:03:15.910> require<00:03:16.209> a

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
off now this next part may require a

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.910 
off now this next part may require a
little<00:03:16.390> bit<00:03:16.569> of<00:03:16.660> practice<00:03:16.810> but<00:03:17.290> it's<00:03:17.620> not<00:03:17.769> too

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
little bit of practice but it's not too

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.110 
little bit of practice but it's not too
bad<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.280> should<00:03:18.430> be<00:03:18.519> able<00:03:18.580> to<00:03:18.700> get<00:03:18.849> it<00:03:18.970> in<00:03:19.060> a

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
bad you should be able to get it in a

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.349 
bad you should be able to get it in a
few<00:03:19.150> tries<00:03:20.069> take<00:03:21.069> the<00:03:21.220> string<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.730> feed<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.239> on

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
few tries take the string and feed it on

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:23.819 
few tries take the string and feed it on
into<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.690> hole<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.079> start<00:03:23.290> pushing<00:03:23.500> the

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
into the hole and start pushing the

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.340 
into the hole and start pushing the
slack<00:03:24.160> in<00:03:24.489> through<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.820> hole<00:03:24.970> towards<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:26.019> F

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
slack in through the hole towards the F

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.640 
slack in through the hole towards the F
hole<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.920> then<00:03:27.880> you<00:03:28.810> should<00:03:28.900> be<00:03:29.049> able<00:03:29.140> to<00:03:29.260> look

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
hole and then you should be able to look

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.380 
hole and then you should be able to look
down<00:03:29.859> and<00:03:30.160> see<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.730> string<00:03:30.970> inside<00:03:31.239> the

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
down and see the string inside the

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.030 
down and see the string inside the
guitar<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:32.350> can<00:03:32.440> take<00:03:32.560> your<00:03:32.680> needle<00:03:32.829> nose

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
guitar you can take your needle nose

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.580 
guitar you can take your needle nose
pliers<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.850> you<00:03:34.690> can<00:03:34.810> give<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.019> a<00:03:35.109> nudge<00:03:35.350> if

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
pliers and you can give it a nudge if

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.020 
pliers and you can give it a nudge if
it's<00:03:35.739> not<00:03:35.890> quite<00:03:36.069> in<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.340> right<00:03:36.370> place<00:03:36.730> and

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
it's not quite in the right place and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.640 
it's not quite in the right place and
then<00:03:37.269> just<00:03:37.540> reach<00:03:37.720> in<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:37.900> grab<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.440> pull

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
then just reach in and grab it and pull

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.190 
then just reach in and grab it and pull
it<00:03:38.680> on<00:03:38.829> through<00:03:39.329> now<00:03:40.329> the<00:03:40.359> jack<00:03:40.690> hole<00:03:40.930> is<00:03:41.170> a

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
it on through now the jack hole is a

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.720 
it on through now the jack hole is a
little<00:03:41.470> bit<00:03:41.590> further<00:03:41.739> from<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.100> F<00:03:42.220> hole<00:03:42.459> so<00:03:42.670> it

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
little bit further from the F hole so it

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.130 
little bit further from the F hole so it
might<00:03:42.880> be<00:03:43.000> a<00:03:43.030> little<00:03:43.180> bit<00:03:43.390> harder<00:03:43.690> but<00:03:43.870> it

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
might be a little bit harder but it

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.319 
might be a little bit harder but it
still<00:03:44.350> shouldn't<00:03:44.590> be<00:03:44.680> too<00:03:44.859> bad<00:03:45.040> if<00:03:45.819> you're

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
still shouldn't be too bad if you're

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.699 
still shouldn't be too bad if you're
having<00:03:46.480> trouble<00:03:46.900> like<00:03:47.109> if<00:03:47.290> your<00:03:47.410> string<00:03:47.650> is

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
having trouble like if your string is

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.800 
having trouble like if your string is
too<00:03:48.010> lightweight<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:49.060> can<00:03:49.090> try<00:03:49.359> tying<00:03:49.630> a

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
too lightweight you can try tying a

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.509 
too lightweight you can try tying a
little<00:03:49.989> weight<00:03:50.139> to<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.380> end<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:50.769> to<00:03:51.370> help

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
little weight to the end of it to help

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.940 
little weight to the end of it to help
out<00:03:51.700> my<00:03:52.630> string<00:03:52.989> is<00:03:53.109> heavy<00:03:53.290> enough<00:03:53.350> so<00:03:53.590> that<00:03:53.920> I

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
out my string is heavy enough so that I

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.330 
out my string is heavy enough so that I
can<00:03:54.130> just<00:03:54.160> feed<00:03:54.790> it<00:03:54.910> into<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.329> hole<00:03:55.480> here<00:03:55.870> and

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
can just feed it into the hole here and

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.640 
can just feed it into the hole here and
get<00:03:57.340> enough<00:03:57.579> slack<00:03:57.850> into<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.239> hole<00:03:58.420> and<00:03:58.810> then

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
get enough slack into the hole and then

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.559 
get enough slack into the hole and then
just<00:03:59.920> use<00:04:00.100> gravity<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:01.090> body<00:04:01.269> of<00:04:01.450> the

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
just use gravity and the body of the

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.410 
just use gravity and the body of the
guitar<00:04:02.010> just<00:04:03.010> give<00:04:03.160> it<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.340> little<00:04:03.670> shake<00:04:04.090> once

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
guitar just give it a little shake once

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.180 
guitar just give it a little shake once
there's<00:04:04.600> enough<00:04:04.660> slack<00:04:05.049> there<00:04:05.350> and<00:04:05.560> that<00:04:06.100> will

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
there's enough slack there and that will

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.520 
there's enough slack there and that will
guide<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.459> string<00:04:06.790> towards<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.690> F<00:04:08.019> hole<00:04:08.260> so

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
guide the string towards the F hole so

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.520 
guide the string towards the F hole so
that<00:04:08.560> I<00:04:08.709> can<00:04:08.980> just<00:04:09.120> reach<00:04:10.120> in<00:04:10.299> with<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.720> even

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
that I can just reach in with the even

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.630 
that I can just reach in with the even
those<00:04:11.650> pliers<00:04:11.889> and<00:04:12.220> pull<00:04:12.609> it<00:04:12.700> on<00:04:12.790> through

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.770 

now<00:04:17.640> you<00:04:17.730> may<00:04:17.850> not<00:04:18.000> need<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.240> put<00:04:18.420> strings

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
now you may not need to put strings

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.330 
now you may not need to put strings
through<00:04:18.990> every<00:04:19.320> hole<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.740> ones<00:04:19.890> closest<00:04:20.310> to

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
through every hole the ones closest to

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.040 
through every hole the ones closest to
the<00:04:20.520> F<00:04:20.640> hole<00:04:20.880> may<00:04:21.120> be<00:04:21.180> easy<00:04:21.600> enough<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:21.930> just

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 
the F hole may be easy enough to just

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.540 
the F hole may be easy enough to just
push<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.680> components<00:04:23.130> through<00:04:23.250> with<00:04:23.400> your

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
push the components through with your

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.520 
push the components through with your
finger<00:04:23.850> later<00:04:24.140> but<00:04:25.140> I'm<00:04:25.200> going<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.380> go<00:04:25.440> ahead

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
finger later but I'm going to go ahead

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.710 
finger later but I'm going to go ahead
and<00:04:25.710> do<00:04:25.770> these<00:04:25.950> ones<00:04:26.220> for<00:04:26.580> good<00:04:26.730> measure

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
and do these ones for good measure

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.120 
and do these ones for good measure
I<00:04:27.750> won't<00:04:28.230> do<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.440> switch<00:04:28.680> because<00:04:28.890> I<00:04:29.070> know

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
I won't do the switch because I know

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.450 
I won't do the switch because I know
that<00:04:29.370> one's<00:04:29.550> easy<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:29.880> push<00:04:30.060> through<00:04:31.460> all

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
that one's easy to push through all

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.890 
that one's easy to push through all
right<00:04:32.550> before<00:04:32.670> starting<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.270> tie<00:04:33.450> any<00:04:33.660> strings

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
right before starting to tie any strings

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.150 
right before starting to tie any strings
to<00:04:34.050> components<00:04:34.500> it's<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.680> good<00:04:34.800> idea<00:04:35.040> to<00:04:35.130> just

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
to components it's a good idea to just

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.530 
to components it's a good idea to just
tape<00:04:35.580> these<00:04:35.760> to<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.060> body<00:04:36.210> of<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.420> guitar

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
tape these to the body of the guitar

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.760 
tape these to the body of the guitar
real<00:04:36.900> quick<00:04:37.140> so<00:04:37.380> that<00:04:37.410> you<00:04:37.620> don't

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
real quick so that you don't

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.770 
real quick so that you don't
accidentally<00:04:38.280> pull<00:04:38.730> them<00:04:39.270> in<00:04:39.390> through<00:04:39.600> one<00:04:39.720> of

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
accidentally pull them in through one of

accidentally pull them in through one of
the<00:04:39.900> holes<00:04:40.020> it's<00:04:40.860> always<00:04:41.100> frustrating<00:04:41.280> when

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
the holes it's always frustrating when

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.740 
the holes it's always frustrating when
you're<00:04:41.790> in<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:41.940> middle<00:04:42.120> of<00:04:42.240> doing<00:04:42.360> this<00:04:42.600> that

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
you're in the middle of doing this that

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.210 
you're in the middle of doing this that
you<00:04:42.810> have<00:04:42.900> to<00:04:43.080> go<00:04:43.200> on<00:04:43.290> a<00:04:43.380> fishing<00:04:43.560> trip<00:04:43.740> trying

you have to go on a fishing trip trying

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.110 
you have to go on a fishing trip trying
to<00:04:44.310> find<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.640> strings<00:04:44.910> again<00:04:46.940> okay<00:04:47.940> I'm<00:04:48.030> going

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
to find the strings again okay I'm going

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.920 
to find the strings again okay I'm going
to<00:04:48.180> start<00:04:48.420> with<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:48.660> tone<00:04:49.140> pot<00:04:49.410> here<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:50.750> as<00:04:51.750> I

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
to start with the tone pot here and as I

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.840 
to start with the tone pot here and as I
pull<00:04:52.140> the<00:04:52.260> string<00:04:52.530> I<00:04:52.680> can<00:04:52.830> see<00:04:53.070> the<00:04:53.490> other<00:04:53.640> end

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
pull the string I can see the other end

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.460 
pull the string I can see the other end
of<00:04:53.880> the<00:04:53.970> string<00:04:54.180> moving<00:04:54.540> so<00:04:54.750> I<00:04:54.780> can<00:04:55.020> find<00:04:55.290> it

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
of the string moving so I can find it

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.780 
of the string moving so I can find it
and<00:04:55.620> then<00:04:55.680> you<00:04:55.950> know<00:04:56.040> just<00:04:56.250> double<00:04:56.460> check<00:04:56.640> by

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
and then you know just double check by

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.340 
and then you know just double check by
giving<00:04:57.090> both<00:04:57.450> ends<00:04:57.720> of<00:04:57.780> the<00:04:57.870> string<00:04:58.080> a<00:04:58.140> tug

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
giving both ends of the string a tug

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.750 
giving both ends of the string a tug
make<00:04:58.800> sure<00:04:58.980> you<00:04:59.070> got<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.280> right<00:04:59.310> one

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.250 

now<00:05:05.760> rather<00:05:06.000> than<00:05:06.120> tying<00:05:06.540> it<00:05:06.690> directly<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.170> the

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
now rather than tying it directly to the

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.560 
now rather than tying it directly to the
pot<00:05:07.440> I<00:05:07.470> like<00:05:07.800> to<00:05:07.920> start<00:05:08.460> a<00:05:08.700> loop<00:05:09.000> in<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.300> string

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
pot I like to start a loop in the string

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.390 
pot I like to start a loop in the string
first<00:05:09.990> it<00:05:10.650> makes<00:05:10.830> it<00:05:10.950> a<00:05:10.980> lot<00:05:11.070> easier<00:05:11.130> when

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
first it makes it a lot easier when

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.160 
first it makes it a lot easier when
you've<00:05:11.610> got<00:05:11.730> both<00:05:11.940> hands-free<00:05:12.390> to<00:05:12.540> it<00:05:12.900> to<00:05:13.050> get

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
you've got both hands-free to it to get

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.630 
you've got both hands-free to it to get
a<00:05:13.200> little<00:05:13.410> loop<00:05:13.560> going<00:05:13.770> at<00:05:14.100> least<00:05:14.280> with<00:05:14.430> my

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
a little loop going at least with my

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.810 
a little loop going at least with my
fingers<00:05:15.320> and<00:05:16.320> then<00:05:16.680> slip<00:05:17.040> that<00:05:17.190> over<00:05:17.430> the<00:05:17.550> the

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
fingers and then slip that over the the

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.370 
fingers and then slip that over the the
shaft<00:05:18.030> of<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.270> pot<00:05:18.450> and<00:05:18.930> what<00:05:19.020> we're<00:05:19.110> gonna<00:05:19.200> do

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
shaft of the pot and what we're gonna do

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.590 
shaft of the pot and what we're gonna do
is<00:05:19.500> tighten<00:05:19.800> it<00:05:19.860> down<00:05:19.890> over<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.580> knurled<00:05:21.060> tip

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
is tighten it down over the knurled tip

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.720 
is tighten it down over the knurled tip
of<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:21.900> shaft<00:05:22.080> not<00:05:22.350> onto<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.800> threads<00:05:23.100> if<00:05:23.610> you

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
of the shaft not onto the threads if you

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.400 
of the shaft not onto the threads if you
tie<00:05:23.910> it<00:05:23.970> onto<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.270> threads<00:05:24.540> you'll<00:05:25.050> find<00:05:25.320> that

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
tie it onto the threads you'll find that

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.660 
tie it onto the threads you'll find that
you<00:05:25.530> won't<00:05:25.680> be<00:05:25.830> able<00:05:25.920> to<00:05:26.040> pull<00:05:26.280> it<00:05:26.370> through<00:05:26.550> the

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
you won't be able to pull it through the

you won't be able to pull it through the
hole<00:05:26.700> the<00:05:27.120> knot<00:05:27.570> in<00:05:27.900> the<00:05:28.080> string<00:05:28.590> will<00:05:28.950> be<00:05:29.070> too

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
hole the knot in the string will be too

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.670 
hole the knot in the string will be too
big<00:05:29.550> and<00:05:29.870> the<00:05:30.870> hole<00:05:31.020> isn't<00:05:31.200> big<00:05:31.440> enough<00:05:31.530> to

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
big and the hole isn't big enough to

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.650 
big and the hole isn't big enough to
pull<00:05:32.250> the<00:05:32.520> threaded<00:05:33.360> part<00:05:33.450> of<00:05:33.540> the<00:05:33.600> shaft

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
pull the threaded part of the shaft

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.110 
pull the threaded part of the shaft
through<00:05:34.140> if<00:05:34.710> you<00:05:34.860> tie<00:05:35.010> it<00:05:35.070> just<00:05:35.370> over<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.760> end

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
through if you tie it just over the end

through if you tie it just over the end
of<00:05:36.270> the<00:05:36.330> shaft<00:05:36.600> here<00:05:36.990> there'll<00:05:37.710> be<00:05:37.740> enough

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
of the shaft here there'll be enough

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.010 
of the shaft here there'll be enough
room<00:05:38.190> to<00:05:38.250> pull<00:05:38.520> it<00:05:38.610> all<00:05:38.670> the<00:05:38.700> way<00:05:38.790> through<00:05:39.120> so

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
room to pull it all the way through so

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.720 
room to pull it all the way through so
give<00:05:40.170> it<00:05:40.200> a<00:05:40.320> nice<00:05:40.500> tight<00:05:40.800> double<00:05:41.070> knot<00:05:41.370> and

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
give it a nice tight double knot and

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.940 
give it a nice tight double knot and
then<00:05:41.940> trim<00:05:42.210> off<00:05:42.450> any<00:05:42.750> slack<00:05:43.260> here<00:05:43.560> just<00:05:43.770> to<00:05:43.830> get

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
then trim off any slack here just to get

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.290 
then trim off any slack here just to get
it<00:05:44.040> out<00:05:44.100> of<00:05:44.220> the<00:05:44.280> way<00:05:46.520> and<00:05:47.990> then

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
it out of the way and then

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.490 
it out of the way and then
go<00:05:49.330> ahead<00:05:49.479> and<00:05:49.599> tie<00:05:49.750> the<00:05:49.810> string<00:05:50.110> to<00:05:50.259> the<00:05:50.319> other

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
go ahead and tie the string to the other

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.899 
go ahead and tie the string to the other
