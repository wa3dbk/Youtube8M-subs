and ultimately the cabinet members

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.390 
and ultimately the cabinet members
really<00:00:15.929> understand<00:00:16.590> what<00:00:17.189> are<00:00:17.310> the

really understand what are the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.089 
really understand what are the
opportunities<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:18.300> their<00:00:18.509> agency<00:00:19.230> what<00:00:20.009> are

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
opportunities of their agency what are

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:21.649 
opportunities of their agency what are
some<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.460> challenges<00:00:20.489> what<00:00:21.419> will<00:00:21.569> they

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:21.659 
some of the challenges what will they

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:23.300 
some of the challenges what will they
want<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.960> do<00:00:22.079> is<00:00:22.140> for<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.349> first<00:00:22.650> second<00:00:23.159> and

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
want to do is for the first second and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.099 
want to do is for the first second and
third<00:00:23.579> and<00:00:23.880> within<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.449> context<00:00:24.929> of<00:00:24.989> the

third and within the context of the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.870 
third and within the context of the
transition<00:00:25.710> there's<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.009> lot<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.310> work<00:00:26.669> to

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
transition there's a lot of work to

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.109 
transition there's a lot of work to
think<00:00:27.839> through<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.319> the<00:00:28.470> next<00:00:28.499> 60<00:00:29.339> some<00:00:29.789> days

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
think through in the next 60 some days

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.450 
think through in the next 60 some days
in<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.839> area<00:00:31.169> of<00:00:31.259> climate<00:00:31.739> change<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:32.130> isn't

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
in the area of climate change this isn't

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.550 
in the area of climate change this isn't
something<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.810> United<00:00:34.230> States<00:00:34.260> is

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
something that the United States is

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.550 
something that the United States is
necessarily<00:00:35.160> engaged<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.210> aggressively<00:00:36.810> but

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
necessarily engaged in aggressively but

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.830 
necessarily engaged in aggressively but
for<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.370> president-elect<00:00:38.910> he<00:00:39.330> sees<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.660> as

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
for the president-elect he sees this as

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.440 
for the president-elect he sees this as
a<00:00:39.870> true<00:00:40.200> opportunity<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:41.160> us<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.520> create<00:00:42.060> new

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
a true opportunity for us to create new

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.630 
a true opportunity for us to create new
jobs<00:00:42.590> but<00:00:43.590> at<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.830> same<00:00:44.070> time<00:00:44.340> we're

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
jobs but at the same time we're

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.780 
jobs but at the same time we're
increasing<00:00:45.240> our<00:00:45.360> security<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.800> stabilizing

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
increasing our security and stabilizing

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.360 
increasing our security and stabilizing
the<00:00:47.940> economy<00:00:47.970> by<00:00:48.810> you<00:00:49.260> know<00:00:49.380> really<00:00:49.620> focusing

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the economy by you know really focusing

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.940 
the economy by you know really focusing
on<00:00:50.490> a<00:00:50.520> clean<00:00:51.000> energy<00:00:51.270> future<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.380> obviously

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
on a clean energy future and obviously

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.830 
on a clean energy future and obviously
these<00:00:53.130> two<00:00:53.370> issues<00:00:53.490> go<00:00:53.850> hand-in-hand<00:00:54.180> energy

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
these two issues go hand-in-hand energy

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.980 
these two issues go hand-in-hand energy
policy<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.440> climate<00:00:55.829> policy<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.780> was<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 
policy and climate policy I was the

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.690 
policy and climate policy I was the
energy<00:00:58.410> environment<00:00:58.860> and<00:00:59.040> AG<00:00:59.190> policy

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
energy environment and AG policy

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.750 
energy environment and AG policy
director<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.510> Obama<00:01:00.840> campaign<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
director for the Obama campaign and

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.520 
director for the Obama campaign and
during<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.790> time<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.630> think<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> exciting

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
during that time I think the exciting

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.559 
during that time I think the exciting
thing<00:01:04.710> from<00:01:04.860> my<00:01:05.040> perspective<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.999> that<00:01:06.030> energy

00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:06.569 
thing from my perspective is that energy

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:08.809 
thing from my perspective is that energy
policy<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.109> climate<00:01:07.499> policy<00:01:07.920> were<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.460> front

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:08.819 
policy and climate policy were so front

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:10.789 
policy and climate policy were so front
and<00:01:08.939> center<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.869> we<00:01:09.960> had<00:01:10.049> an<00:01:10.170> opportunity<00:01:10.409> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
and center so we had an opportunity to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.340 
and center so we had an opportunity to
really<00:01:11.189> help<00:01:11.759> voters<00:01:12.030> understand<00:01:12.869> what

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
really help voters understand what

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.489 
really help voters understand what
change<00:01:14.179> Barack<00:01:15.179> Obama<00:01:15.600> wanted<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.079> bring<00:01:16.259> to

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:16.499 
change Barack Obama wanted to bring to

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:18.620 
change Barack Obama wanted to bring to
the<00:01:16.530> White<00:01:16.799> House<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.819> know<00:01:17.909> aggressively

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the White House you know aggressively

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.379 
the White House you know aggressively
investing<00:01:19.109> in<00:01:19.229> renewable<00:01:19.319> energy<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:21.270> know

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:21.389 
investing in renewable energy you know

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:23.870 
investing in renewable energy you know
making<00:01:21.749> sure<00:01:22.079> that<00:01:22.409> energy<00:01:22.889> efficiency<00:01:23.549> what

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
making sure that energy efficiency what

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.370 
making sure that energy efficiency what
we<00:01:23.969> do<00:01:24.090> with<00:01:24.240> our<00:01:24.389> appliances<00:01:24.929> and<00:01:25.079> what<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.259> do

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
we do with our appliances and what we do

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.080 
we do with our appliances and what we do
with<00:01:25.499> our<00:01:25.649> buildings<00:01:26.100> really<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.670> make<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> big

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
with our buildings really can make a big

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.520 
with our buildings really can make a big
difference<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.659> terms<00:01:27.899> of<00:01:28.020> our<00:01:28.139> carbon

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
difference in terms of our carbon

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.190 
difference in terms of our carbon
footprint<00:01:29.069> and<00:01:29.310> how<00:01:29.880> we<00:01:29.939> rethink<00:01:30.450> our<00:01:30.689> energy

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
footprint and how we rethink our energy

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.620 
footprint and how we rethink our energy
policy<00:01:31.969> one<00:01:32.969> of<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.119> great<00:01:33.270> things<00:01:33.299> about

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
policy one of the great things about

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.029 
policy one of the great things about
this<00:01:34.020> transition<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.770> one<00:01:34.859> of<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.009> things

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
this transition and one of the things

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.379 
this transition and one of the things
that's<00:01:35.249> sort<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.579> different<00:01:35.999> from<00:01:36.179> prior

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:36.389 
that's sort of different from prior

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:38.840 
that's sort of different from prior
transitions<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.499> recognition<00:01:38.069> that<00:01:38.459> you

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
transitions is this recognition that you

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.550 
transitions is this recognition that you
do<00:01:38.999> have<00:01:39.149> to<00:01:39.359> work<00:01:39.479> across<00:01:39.780> lines<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.409> that

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
do have to work across lines and that

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.690 
do have to work across lines and that
you<00:01:40.649> don't<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:40.889> to<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:41.189> sit<00:01:41.399> in<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
you don't have to just sit in the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.699 
you don't have to just sit in the
traditional<00:01:42.389> government<00:01:42.899> stovepipes<00:01:43.499> that

00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:43.709 
traditional government stovepipes that

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.620 
traditional government stovepipes that
some<00:01:43.859> of<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> best<00:01:44.219> ideas<00:01:44.729> will<00:01:44.999> be<00:01:45.029> ones<00:01:45.509> that

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
some of the best ideas will be ones that

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.719 
some of the best ideas will be ones that
can<00:01:45.929> you<00:01:46.439> know<00:01:46.529> move<00:01:46.889> back<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.310> forth<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
can you know move back and forth and

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.999
