00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
today is we are removing the fuel pump

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.780 
today is we are removing the fuel pump
first<00:00:22.260> thing<00:00:22.439> we<00:00:22.529> want<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.770> do<00:00:22.950> is<00:00:23.130> remove<00:00:23.520> the

first thing we want to do is remove the

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.810 
first thing we want to do is remove the
fuel<00:00:24.119> cap<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.720> relieve<00:00:25.020> pressure<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.520> fuel

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
fuel cap to relieve pressure in the fuel

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.580 
fuel cap to relieve pressure in the fuel
tank<00:00:26.850> then<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:28.109> want<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:29.029> remove<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.690> fuel

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
tank then we want to remove the fuel

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.700 
tank then we want to remove the fuel
pump<00:00:31.949> fuse<00:00:32.340> or<00:00:32.550> relay<00:00:32.910> start<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.480> engine<00:00:33.870> and

then<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.949> will<00:00:35.100> stall<00:00:35.400> and<00:00:35.699> that<00:00:36.330> will<00:00:36.540> relieve

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
then it will stall and that will relieve

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.070 
then it will stall and that will relieve
the<00:00:36.930> pressure<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.460> system<00:00:38.850> then<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:40.050> can

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
the pressure in the system then we can

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.009 
the pressure in the system then we can
remove<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.220> negative<00:00:41.760> battery<00:00:42.120> cable<00:00:42.360> from

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019

should<00:03:14.120> have<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.389> bucket<00:03:15.099> because<00:03:16.099> there<00:03:16.790> might

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
should have a bucket because there might

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.809 
should have a bucket because there might
be<00:03:17.060> some<00:03:17.540> fuel<00:03:19.150> left<00:03:20.150> in<00:03:21.639> this<00:03:24.639> unit<00:03:25.639> right

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
be some fuel left in this unit right

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.860 
be some fuel left in this unit right
here<00:03:28.479> okay

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:39.810 

there<00:03:32.870> is<00:03:33.049> the<00:03:33.199> pump<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:35.000> she's<00:03:35.299> all<00:03:35.479> out

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.820 

while<00:03:40.820> we<00:03:40.970> got<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.380> unit<00:03:42.380> out<00:03:42.500> we're<00:03:42.650> going<00:03:42.740> to

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
while we got the unit out we're going to

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:50.890 
while we got the unit out we're going to
check<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:43.490> sending<00:03:44.090> unit<00:03:45.580> clip<00:03:47.170> one<00:03:49.900> clip

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
check the sending unit clip one clip

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.790 
check the sending unit clip one clip
from<00:03:51.680> our<00:03:51.860> multimeter<00:03:52.600> to<00:03:53.600> this<00:03:53.780> lead<00:03:54.350> that

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
from our multimeter to this lead that

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:05.250 
from our multimeter to this lead that
goes<00:03:54.980> down<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.490> the<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:03.160> we<00:04:04.160> want<00:04:04.400> to<00:04:04.490> see<00:04:04.610> some

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
goes down to the and we want to see some

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:19.530 
goes down to the and we want to see some
smooth<00:04:07.630> operation<00:04:08.630> of<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:09.370> sending<00:04:10.370> unit

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:26.110 

okay<00:04:21.550> five<00:04:22.550> ohms<00:04:22.880> folder<00:04:24.700> well<00:04:25.700> let's<00:04:25.910> go

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
okay five ohms folder well let's go

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.710 
okay five ohms folder well let's go
empty<00:04:28.450> okay

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
empty okay

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.740 
empty okay
seems<00:04:30.230> to<00:04:30.320> be<00:04:30.380> working<00:04:30.650> smoothly

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.080 

okay<00:04:38.130> it's<00:04:39.130> sending<00:04:39.430> you<00:04:39.610> it<00:04:39.730> looks<00:04:39.880> pretty

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
okay it's sending you it looks pretty

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.510 
okay it's sending you it looks pretty
good<00:04:40.270> so<00:04:42.990> that's<00:04:43.990> all<00:04:44.320> there<00:04:44.470> is<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:44.889> removing

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
good so that's all there is to removing

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.010 
good so that's all there is to removing
a<00:04:45.700> fuel<00:04:46.090> pump<00:04:46.300> in<00:04:46.570> your<00:04:46.840> Nissan<00:04:47.500> Sentra
