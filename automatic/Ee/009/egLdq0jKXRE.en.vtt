00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
speed limit all right so I made that

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.340 
speed limit all right so I made that

it's because senior citizens eyes are so

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.620 
it's because senior citizens eyes are so
bad<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.319> they<00:02:07.439> can't<00:02:07.799> read<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.220> signs<00:02:08.630> but
