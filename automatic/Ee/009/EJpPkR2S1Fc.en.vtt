00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.210
 we start 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.789
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.199

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:32.399
 some boiled potatoes a tomato pepper 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:37.329

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.140
 of tuna in oil an onion and for the 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.500
 seasoning we are going to need olive oil 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.720
 vinegar and pepper first thing we're going 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.559
 to do is peel and cut the 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.860
 ingredients 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:56.339
 we will start peeling the potatoes after 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.339
 the eggs 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.739
 and finally the cucumber 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.159
 now we will begin to chop the cucumber 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.159
 squares 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.579
 and we will continue with the pepper 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.100
 and I'm going to cut it like that so it's 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.470
 nicest 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.850
 in slices and we will continue with the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.930
 Red pepper 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:34.170
 we're going to do it in juliana 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.170
 because doing so fat is going to be better 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:43.080
 now we will cut the onion 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.080
 we will also cut it in juliana 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.310
 and let's go with the tomato we will remove the 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.310
 seeds here the nuggets 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.910
 and we're cutting it in side was like 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.910
 the cucumber 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.630
 and finally another c we will make the potatoes 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.700
 also and we will throw them directly in 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.430
 the bowl where we will mix all our 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.040
 ingredients and now we will be throwing 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.170

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.650
 on the cross 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.659
 I have drained the oil so that 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:29.120
 have so many we are removing it for 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.790
 that we mix everything well and now 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.290
 let's cut the egg into small pieces 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.760
 regular 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.220
 neither too big nor too small 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.780
 let's cut only one the others 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.910
 two we are going to leave to decorate the 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.100
 plate 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.430
 now we will throw a few 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.190
 olives and we will also leave these for 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.550
 to decorate we will throw here a good stream 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.550
 of oil 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.690
 we will pour a splash of vinegar 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.049
 the vinegar of taste if you like more 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.069
 strong you throw a little more and you 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.069
 we put a little pepper 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.740
 pepper is also to taste 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.910
 and now we are going to evolve 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.240
 once we have mixed and it has 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:38.420
 evolved everything well let's dress the 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.190
 salad let's throw it over and 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.010
 now we will remove 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.900
 so that it takes well in the line 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.470
 and now we're going to take a little 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.989
