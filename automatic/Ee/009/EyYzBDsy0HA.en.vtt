be<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.840> sum<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.200> first<00:02:07.350> things<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.710> you

be the sum of the first things that you

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.650 
be the sum of the first things that you
learned<00:02:09.289> so<00:02:10.289> yeah<00:02:10.440> if<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.739> go<00:02:10.860> back<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.660> if

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
learned so yeah if we go back and if

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.820

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
you here by default the JavaScript

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.290 
you here by default the JavaScript
runtime<00:02:31.080> that's<00:02:31.560> being<00:02:31.740> used<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.400> what

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
runtime that's being used is is what

for that i'll put the link up right away

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.340 
for that i'll put the link up right away
when<00:02:59.070> i<00:02:59.100> upload<00:02:59.580> this<00:02:59.880> file<00:03:00.180> or<00:03:00.510> upload<00:03:01.230> this

video and that will walk you through the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.840 
video and that will walk you through the
installation<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.560> nodejs<00:03:04.890> which<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.610> really

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
installation of nodejs which is really

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.110 
installation of nodejs which is really
straightforward<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.950> then<00:03:07.950> after<00:03:08.580> you<00:03:08.790> do

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
straightforward and then after you do

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.300 
straightforward and then after you do
that<00:03:09.150> then<00:03:09.600> we<00:03:09.720> have<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:10.110> now<00:03:10.260> add<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.890> exit

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
that then we have to now add the exit

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.060 
that then we have to now add the exit
the<00:03:11.459> path<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.120> executable<00:03:12.870> of<00:03:12.959> node<00:03:13.200> 2<00:03:13.740> r

space road bat and what we're going to
what<00:04:21.120> we're<00:04:21.209> going<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.419> do<00:04:21.570> is<00:04:21.840> we're<00:04:22.020> going<00:04:22.109> to

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.700 
what we're going to do is we're going to
add<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:23.039> path

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
add to the path

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.590 
add to the path
the<00:04:24.710> executable<00:04:25.640> for<00:04:26.180> node<00:04:26.660> okay<00:04:27.410> so<00:04:28.600> we're

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
the executable for node okay so we're

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.850 
the executable for node okay so we're
going<00:04:29.690> to<00:04:29.780> do<00:04:29.930> this<00:04:30.080> percent<00:04:30.560> path<00:04:31.300> percent

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
going to do this percent path percent

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
going to do this percent path percent
semicolon<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.010> then<00:04:34.220> now<00:04:34.400> we<00:04:34.460> need<00:04:34.730> to<00:04:34.760> go

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
semicolon and then now we need to go

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.730 
semicolon and then now we need to go
find<00:04:35.090> out<00:04:35.240> where<00:04:35.510> is<00:04:35.630> node<00:04:35.900> installed<00:04:36.380> and<00:04:36.680> in

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
find out where is node installed and in

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.010 
find out where is node installed and in
my<00:04:36.890> case<00:04:37.540> I'll<00:04:38.540> just<00:04:38.600> do<00:04:38.900> go<00:04:39.530> to<00:04:39.560> explore<00:04:41.020> they

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
my case I'll just do go to explore they

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.850 
my case I'll just do go to explore they
installed<00:04:42.410> it<00:04:42.530> under<00:04:42.770> program<00:04:43.160> files<00:04:43.190> and

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
installed it under program files and

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.540 
installed it under program files and
then<00:04:45.860> you'll<00:04:46.070> notice<00:04:46.400> here<00:04:46.670> there's<00:04:46.790> a<00:04:46.910> nodejs

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
then you'll notice here there's a nodejs

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.060 
then you'll notice here there's a nodejs
folder<00:04:49.550> or<00:04:49.790> directory<00:04:49.850> and<00:04:50.780> you<00:04:51.530> can<00:04:51.650> see<00:04:51.830> here

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
folder or directory and you can see here

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.100 
folder or directory and you can see here
no<00:04:52.280> dot<00:04:52.610> exe<00:04:52.730> right<00:04:53.360> so<00:04:53.510> I'm<00:04:53.570> going<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:53.780> click

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
no dot exe right so I'm going to click

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.140 
no dot exe right so I'm going to click
up<00:04:54.350> here<00:04:54.380> and<00:04:54.890> see<00:04:55.310> how<00:04:55.460> it<00:04:55.580> highlights<00:04:56.030> the

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
up here and see how it highlights the

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.330 
up here and see how it highlights the
path<00:04:56.480> we're<00:04:56.720> going<00:04:56.840> to<00:04:56.900> right<00:04:57.080> click<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:57.650> copy

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
path we're going to right click and copy

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.290 
path we're going to right click and copy
and<00:04:59.020> then<00:05:00.020> go<00:05:00.230> back<00:05:00.410> to<00:05:00.470> notepad<00:05:00.950> and<00:05:01.460> we're

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
and then go back to notepad and we're

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.470 
and then go back to notepad and we're
going<00:05:02.420> to<00:05:02.450> paste<00:05:02.750> that<00:05:03.350> in<00:05:03.590> just<00:05:03.860> like<00:05:04.040> that

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
going to paste that in just like that

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.640 
going to paste that in just like that
okay<00:05:05.480> so<00:05:05.540> now<00:05:05.900> what<00:05:06.080> we're<00:05:06.230> doing<00:05:06.260> is<00:05:06.470> we're

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
okay so now what we're doing is we're

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.790 
okay so now what we're doing is we're
appending<00:05:07.160> that<00:05:07.940> directory<00:05:08.450> to<00:05:08.750> the<00:05:09.350> path

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
appending that directory to the path

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.930 
appending that directory to the path
environment<00:05:10.280> variable<00:05:10.810> so<00:05:11.810> let's<00:05:11.990> save<00:05:12.590> that

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
environment variable so let's save that

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.880 
environment variable so let's save that
will<00:05:13.940> close<00:05:14.240> that<00:05:14.270> and<00:05:14.900> we'll<00:05:15.290> close<00:05:15.500> this

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
will close that and we'll close this

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.860 
will close that and we'll close this
close<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.880> command<00:05:17.240> prompt<00:05:17.630> because<00:05:17.780> we're

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
close the command prompt because we're

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.560 
close the command prompt because we're
going<00:05:17.960> to<00:05:18.050> have<00:05:18.140> to<00:05:18.230> restart<00:05:18.620> it<00:05:18.800> and<00:05:19.570> I'll

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570
