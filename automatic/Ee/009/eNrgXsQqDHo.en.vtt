 kevin and I have for you the unboxing of 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.769
 The motherboard 797 mx gaming 5 thanks to 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.450
 gb's friends well this is a 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.250
 motherboard oriented to those

 users looking to have the best 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.380
 experience in what comes to be gaming 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.060
 and also have the best performance and 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.970
 all that is offered by the gigabyte in this 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.770
 death and we started seeing in the part 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.960
 front that came already changed what 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.160
 comes are the characteristic colors 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.809
 this opportunity we see this eye that 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.910
 previously I was restricted what 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.070
 it's coming from geas we see it now 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.460
 also in the new gamer series 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.679
 gb in what are motherboards the name 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.719
 from the motherboard the manufacturer's logo 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:49.270
 after ultra durable what of the 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.190
 chipsets 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.320
 on the back what we can 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.940
 appreciate it comes to be an impression of the 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.680
 motherboard in which they are explained 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.530
 each of its features more 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.550
 highlights here also an impression of 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.760
 what comes to be the connectors 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.890
 later and for this part we can see 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.720
 that emphasis is placed on the key points 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.170
 of the gb gaming series what comes to 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:15.010
 be the performance the audio the network and the 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.360
 look good now we open the box and 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.659
 we found what are the accessories 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.450
 we found four sata cables 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.670
 the back panel 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.990
 a bridge for sl and in black color 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.409
 flexible 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.469
 user manual 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.380
 the multilanguage guide is the disk with 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.569
 the drivers and finally a pamphlet that 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.369
 it reminds us that it arrived and has what 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.679
 which is the guarantee and center of 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.319
 reme service locally now 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.270
 We proceed to remove the motherboard fits 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.069
 remember that this motherboard comes 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.890
 protected with an antistatic bag 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:54.500
 but to help in the unboxing we have 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.240
 removed the first impression that we 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.179
 provides this woman board is that it is a 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.829
 small size but retains almost all 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.009
 the indispensable characteristics in 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.599
 a motherboard gaming likewise we 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.819
 draws attention to the new scheme of 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:10.099
 gigabyte laser and gaming colors that 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.150
 it is predominantly red and black 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.510
 in what comes to be the heatsinks 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.459
 along with the characteristic eye of this 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.560
 series starting with what comes to be 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.790
 the components of the motherboard we 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.260
 we focus on what becomes the new 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:27.019
 socket 11 54 ce psh adores fourth and 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.599
 fifth generation intel followed also 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.010
 we see that there are four phases 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.290
 of power 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.879
 and which also come refrigerated 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.760
 so it comes to be the heatsinks 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.349
 with the new gb design in terms of 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.900
 chipset this motherboard comes 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.680
 powered by Intel's 797 chipset 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.860
 which gives us up to six ports 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.690
 sata 3 a sata express port and a 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.720
 port m point 2 that is located 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.269
 located under the chipset the difference 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.730
 between the sata 3 and sat ports 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.680
 express is that the sata 3 ports come 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.480
 with a top speed and up to 6 gigs 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.030
 per second while the sat express 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.519
 has a speed of gigabyte djs 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.099
 per second the same thing happens with what 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.959
 that comes is in the port m2 which 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.150
 also runs at a speed of up 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.040
 10 gigas per second as is 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.810
 characteristic with motherboards gb 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.970
 this motherboard also comes equipped 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.129
 with what comes to be the dual bios to what 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.659
 which allows us to have a backup bio 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.840
 in case our main video 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.239
 fail the audio of this motherboard is 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.819
 in charge of an amplifier 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.489
 Interchangeable game console bus one 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.160
 real tech 1150 codec found 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.870
 protected by this aluminum plate and 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.819
 we can also offer that it arrived 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.099
 has decided to opt for trainers 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.290
 Japanese professionals nor chicÃ³n for 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.690
 this audio section a feature 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.430
 highlighting and that is beneficial at the same 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.319
 time for gamers and people 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.290
 who are looking for the best sound quality 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.699
 is that this section of the psd is isolated 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.489
 to avoid any kind of 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:00.230
 interference in the audio connectors 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.379
 that this motherboard offers us in the 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.760
 back are two ps2 connectors 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.269
 for keyboard and mouse port vga dvi and 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.370
 hdmi 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.819
 in case we decide to use the video 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.120
 integrated four usb ports 3.0 four 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:20.479
 five USB 2.0 connectors 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.120
 audio bathed in gold an optical output and 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.460
 finally a red port of 45 to 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.960
 our lang and well this has been 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.030
 our in boxing thank you very much for 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.960
 see us and with me it will be until next
