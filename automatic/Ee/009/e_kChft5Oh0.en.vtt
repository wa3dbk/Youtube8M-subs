00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
you're gonna want to start off by

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:51.369 
you're gonna want to start off by
figuring<00:00:39.570> out<00:00:39.960> how<00:00:40.829> much<00:00:40.950> paper<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.550> need<00:00:49.550> and

paper that way if you fold it over like
this<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:46.560> don't<00:01:46.710> see<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.310> jagged<00:01:48.240> edge

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
this you don't see like a jagged edge

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.670 
this you don't see like a jagged edge
it's<00:01:49.110> all<00:01:49.640> nice<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.670> smooth<00:01:51.380> then<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.470> take<00:01:52.649> my

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
it's all nice and smooth then I take my

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.190 
it's all nice and smooth then I take my
tape<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.579> can<00:01:53.610> use<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> double-sided<00:01:54.930> tape

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
tape and you can use a double-sided tape

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.770 
tape and you can use a double-sided tape
if<00:01:55.409> you're<00:01:55.829> smarter<00:01:56.250> than<00:01:56.280> me<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.880> just<00:01:57.570> have

showing now I'm just going to trim the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.060 
showing now I'm just going to trim the
edges<00:02:19.820> because<00:02:20.150> these<00:02:20.720> are<00:02:21.080> too<00:02:21.350> long<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.890> the

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
edges because these are too long and the

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
some twine from Paper Chase as well if

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.610 
some twine from Paper Chase as well if
you<00:05:19.979> wanted<00:05:20.220> to<00:05:20.340> do<00:05:20.490> a<00:05:20.520> really<00:05:21.419> homemade<00:05:21.870> kind

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
you wanted to do a really homemade kind

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.880 
you wanted to do a really homemade kind
of<00:05:22.710> look<00:05:22.979> I<00:05:23.190> just<00:05:23.250> think<00:05:23.669> the<00:05:24.000> sparkles<00:05:24.890> look

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
of look I just think the sparkles look

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.100 
of look I just think the sparkles look
really<00:05:26.190> well<00:05:26.340> and<00:05:26.460> they<00:05:26.580> just<00:05:26.610> lift<00:05:27.390> the<00:05:27.900> whole

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
really well and they just lift the whole

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.750 
really well and they just lift the whole
present<00:05:28.710> so<00:05:28.950> it's<00:05:29.160> kind<00:05:29.370> of<00:05:29.430> like<00:05:29.640> the

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
present so it's kind of like the

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.080 
present so it's kind of like the
contrast<00:05:30.090> between<00:05:30.390> the<00:05:30.780> sparkles<00:05:31.380> and<00:05:31.560> the

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
contrast between the sparkles and the

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.730 
contrast between the sparkles and the
homemade<00:05:33.090> recycled<00:05:33.720> materials<00:05:34.260> so<00:05:34.470> that<00:05:34.620> is

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
homemade recycled materials so that is

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.710 
homemade recycled materials so that is
