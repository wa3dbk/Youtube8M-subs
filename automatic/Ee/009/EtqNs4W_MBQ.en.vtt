00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.580
 on 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.890
 Welcome back to youtube 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.330
 on the channel and yes I am a unicat 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.070
 is and before I get to the topic now 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.390
 and / or to the new comments 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.350
 or I just do not know 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.090
 call so I have come now 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.410
 easy fast to the gameplay background 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.940
 In any case it is a triple loop 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.800
 small eight minutes from jenix 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.210
 attentive plays and I could 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.770
 Definitely give up because I think 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.600
 it played really well and generally 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.920
 our gameplay players give themselves up 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.200
 really much effort and is still right 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.150
 lately so the games can be 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.010
 you give yourself and yes the commentators 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.600
 Of course, but no matter now, come on 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.400
 on the subject or will we come to new ones 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.110
 series that I will start here 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.140
 and that's probably how it is 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.430
 truth or lie or was or lying 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.720
 so what in fact it is simply a question 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.070
 that I take a story 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.360
 where exactly the story is coming now 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.770
 not really important and I hope 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.270
 you will not google anyways either 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.310
 and so if that 's all the tension 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.630
 broken and yes that's just so here 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.009
 just pay a story take you 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.660
 found somewhere on the internet and 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.430
 which is then either true or 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.360
 wrong then that would have to be in the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.610
 Write comments 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.630
 At the end of the videos writing was easy 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.460
 or I was because or a lie because of it 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.929
 impossible blah guys a fucking half 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.789
 and in the next video just says then 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:27.899
 very briefly whether it is true or false I am 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.729
 I just thought about that 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.289
 somehow the community needs more 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.789
 should involve and that is 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.080
 actually a good idea I think so 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.280
 I tell stories and me 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.050
 also tell love story telling 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.000
 times and here you can still join 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.110
 and discuss in the comments so 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.819
 I believe that no schalke now 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.110
 Just start because the 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:44.610
 story that I tell it right 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.530
 great guys and please do not think 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.000
 simply the same is wrong that is one 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.619
 truth or something but deliberate 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.569
 simply times everything can really everything 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.280
 Believe in it and yes start right away 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.649
 The story is about a couple 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.259
 So the man jack and the woman 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.849
 Somehow what was her name again Lisa and 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.979
 yes, truth does not fight 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:03.929
 fight like in cod but just fight 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.250
 on the wilderness or in a forest 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.780
 and then I believe theirs there 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.280
 honeymoon so spent the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.319
 were just so passionate camper 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.569
 and then stop fighting 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.819
 a couple of days were left and a tent 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.569
 I had a radio with it 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.890
 they have a little bit 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.420
 busy music belonged to one 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.590
 shit and then it's time to 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.450
 been through that somehow 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.069
 Speakers there already speak that 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.049
 echoes through the news as through 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.340
 radio has come that a famous 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.850
 man died 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.740
 where they fight 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.590
 and that some runaway there 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.060
 running around and Lisa laughed a bit 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.470
 but jack was worried because 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.640
 he just did not want to die there 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.170
 because there is no reason to 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.120
 just imagined honestly 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.100
 let's just say before it's too risky 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.240
 is after the lisa meant no you 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.740
 but know the news the 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.510
 always overdo the lies always 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.640
 bit is somehow more interesting 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.860
 international jack persuade that 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.600
 He stays there and is still there 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.380
 the wood was left the next day 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.000
 gone search 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.440
 they had sustained enough wood for that 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.090
 fire and content wanted again 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.890
 go back but down so they have 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.660
 just a little higher and was down the shore 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.520
 his husband and he has to be 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.920
 Anyhow somehow tell yourself cleaned 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.360
 content sharpened and then he meant 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.010
 yes that could actually everything as 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.780
 cantor and normal hunter are so 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.430
 Do not worry Lisa and then 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.110
 you see the two up there and see 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.240
 He immediately started running, he just wanted to stop 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.710
 catch and lisa and 6 are right 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.570
 Run away so fast through the whole 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.980
 Rolling whole just ran forever 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.480
 on and on and the man has 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.920
 are the whole pursued because he wanted 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.030
 she stops how should I say 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.860
 I do not say what you want him to say 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.000
 just followed and then stop 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.130
 We think we must come closer 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.140
 but they have lisa and james somehow 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.490
 manages to escape them, and then 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.560
 have you been others seen at 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.580
 him his yellow vest and the content 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.260
 shown as he did not say anything 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.940
 just showed that she had him 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.310
 should follow and on but jack and 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.930
 let it follow and choose 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.340
 that he somehow after one 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.870
 time has disappeared and you have then 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.190
 not seen anymore and then they have 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.720
 stopped briefly and then they have themselves 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.520
 asked each other yes where is there 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.590
 do you see the and second blabla and 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.810
 then has this man the hunter 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.070
 alleged alleged because I put on 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.630
 suddenly came from the side again 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.920
 and Lisa and Jackson are still on 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.360
 So she ran again begun to 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.620
 race and then you have this man 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.360
 as they saw this with the 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.610
 yellow vest and that said the stop 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.320
 trends continue straight to the street 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.000
 and since it has been the street and 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.680
 then a car drove by and 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.640
 The hunter where I do not get caught 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.650
 I will think then again 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.930
 ran away and then I stopped 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.359
 there called to a police blabla and 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.280
 then the police came to the scene there 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.690
 the cop has asked yes what 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.400
 it happens here why is it here ? 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.020
 this is exactly what we say in our house 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.670
 were done by a guy with one 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.560
 knife in hand and then the policeman 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.180
 asked yes how sightseeing com or will 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.340
 found it to the street and then has the 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.200
 yes, wehrmann yellow tells jec 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.000
 valid announcement so if you have time 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.620
 not seen the yellow vest has us 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.240
 shown the way and told us 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.190
 should go there and there and the man 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.020
 So then the policeman meant here 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.880
 But there is no one nobody can 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.270
 somehow have shown after the way and 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.080
 then you are back with the purse 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.970
 surfaced and he then said you have 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.130
 So just announced yeah back there he is 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.169
 but that's exactly the type of us 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.660
 shown the way and then turned around 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.940
 and there was just no one and that 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.490
 Manie's Yellow Vest has a short break 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.470
 a place shown a little further away from 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.120
 there and jacket meant yes the type 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.350
 with the finger there in this direction 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.630
 shown and then we went there 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.190
 So the policeman and Jack and of course 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.930
 Also lisa is simply gone 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.669
 looked at what is there somehow because of 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.900
 man clearly showed there and 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.620
 there was just this man with the yellow 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.840
 vest and that was the type of miss 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.000
 was killed or allegedly killed 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.650
 who was in the news and he had 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.880
 also a yellow vest on and jack and 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.530
 let's think about how can this 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.210
 that he showed us the way if he did 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.950
 hurt the whole of the floor and 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.510
 the boys they can now 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.530
 just form your own opinion 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.300
 Maybe it was just a lie 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.890
 or to be the truth 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.140
 maybe have jack and let 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.300
 something imaginary and louder 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.620
 So what do I know guys in my own right ? 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.330
 the comments just write there 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.830
 fall already if we have a reason 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.180
 have it true or false anyway 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.979
 then it just screams below 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.360
 and I ask you again if you 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.860
 knows the story or if it 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.479
 know where I got the story please 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.530
 do not write in the comments below 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.510
 because we just break everything 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.800
 increased the rest also look up because 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.120
 You can actually do that easily 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.650
 but maybe I will 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.000
 try at the next like 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.350
 inventing stories equal to itself 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.240
 or somehow still any 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.320
 to read news and then 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.180
 easy to tell so she does not like that 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.740
 are easy to find again and guys if 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.790
 you liked the whole you know where 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.560
 I think I'll probably 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.150
 continue on my channel, too 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.710
 this series and you know of course 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.240
 where he finds the gameplay player so 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.440
