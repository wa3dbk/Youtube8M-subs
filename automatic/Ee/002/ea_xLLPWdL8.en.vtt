who to understand maintenance calories

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.840 
who to understand maintenance calories
everyone<00:00:58.530> has<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> baseline<00:00:59.220> or<00:00:59.519> a<00:00:59.550> maintenance

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
everyone has a baseline or a maintenance

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.910 
everyone has a baseline or a maintenance
level<00:01:00.360> of<00:01:00.449> calories<00:01:00.930> where<00:01:01.199> they<00:01:01.350> maintain

level of calories where they maintain

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.040 
level of calories where they maintain
their<00:01:02.160> current<00:01:02.370> weight<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.269> for<00:01:03.480> example

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
their current weight so for example

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.710 
their current weight so for example
let's<00:01:04.559> say<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.739> am<00:01:04.949> 200<00:01:05.489> pounds<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.030> my

let's say I am 200 pounds and my

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.530 
let's say I am 200 pounds and my
maintenance<00:01:07.080> calories<00:01:07.860> are<00:01:08.010> 3,000<00:01:08.940> that

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
maintenance calories are 3,000 that

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.270 
maintenance calories are 3,000 that
means<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.380> eat<00:01:10.500> 3,000<00:01:11.159> calories

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
means that I can eat 3,000 calories
