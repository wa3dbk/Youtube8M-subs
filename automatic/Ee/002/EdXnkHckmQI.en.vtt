like<00:05:29.960> I<00:05:30.110> mean<00:05:30.349> I'm<00:05:30.560> okay<00:05:30.710> with<00:05:31.159> people<00:05:31.460> knowing

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
like I mean I'm okay with people knowing

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.180 
like I mean I'm okay with people knowing
about<00:05:31.880> it<00:05:32.060> obviously<00:05:32.300> I<00:05:33.080> just<00:05:33.770> didn't<00:05:34.010> want<00:05:34.159> to

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
about it obviously I just didn't want to

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.860 
about it obviously I just didn't want to
have<00:05:34.310> to<00:05:34.430> tell<00:05:34.639> them<00:05:34.909> like<00:05:35.270> I<00:05:35.389> wanted<00:05:35.599> them<00:05:35.750> to

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
have to tell them like I wanted them to

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.990 
have to tell them like I wanted them to
figure<00:05:36.110> it<00:05:36.289> out<00:05:36.409> themselves<00:05:36.620> so<00:05:37.460> I<00:05:37.490> guess<00:05:37.849> if

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
figure it out themselves so I guess if

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.430 
figure it out themselves so I guess if
they're<00:05:38.150> figuring<00:05:38.479> out<00:05:38.599> it's<00:05:38.810> cool<00:05:39.050> like<00:05:39.320> I

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
don't really care to be honest they can

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.350 
don't really care to be honest they can
figure<00:05:42.080> it<00:05:42.260> out<00:05:42.409> themselves<00:05:42.740> like<00:05:43.370> seriously

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
would go on to go back to probably the

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.460 
would go on to go back to probably the
1960s<00:06:20.820> and<00:06:21.150> be<00:06:21.360> like<00:06:21.510> a<00:06:21.540> teenager<00:06:22.080> in<00:06:22.350> the

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
1960s and be like a teenager in the

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.670 
1960s and be like a teenager in the
1960s<00:06:23.370> because<00:06:23.670> honestly<00:06:24.510> their<00:06:25.170> fashion

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
1960s because honestly their fashion

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.890 
1960s because honestly their fashion
sense<00:06:25.710> was<00:06:26.310> on<00:06:26.550> point<00:06:27.000> but<00:06:27.540> I<00:06:27.570> mean<00:06:27.750> there's

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
sense was on point but I mean there's

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.320 
sense was on point but I mean there's
also<00:06:28.110> bad<00:06:28.470> that<00:06:28.770> was<00:06:28.920> going<00:06:29.250> on<00:06:29.370> in<00:06:29.460> the<00:06:29.550> 1960s

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
also bad that was going on in the 1960s

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.120 
also bad that was going on in the 1960s
there's<00:06:30.540> that<00:06:30.720> all<00:06:30.960> the<00:06:31.110> time<00:06:31.350> but<00:06:31.950> there's

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
there's that all the time but there's

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.850 
there's that all the time but there's
also<00:06:32.280> good<00:06:32.610> so<00:06:33.140> 1960s<00:06:34.230> how<00:06:34.530> would<00:06:34.590> your

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
also good so 1960s how would your

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.760 
also good so 1960s how would your
friends<00:06:35.280> describe<00:06:35.310> you<00:06:36.380> my<00:06:37.380> friends<00:06:37.680> would

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
friends describe you my friends would

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.070 
friends describe you my friends would
probably<00:06:37.800> describe<00:06:38.310> me<00:06:38.670> as<00:06:38.700> like<00:06:39.060> shy<00:06:39.600> and

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
probably describe me as like shy and

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.620 
probably describe me as like shy and
quiet<00:06:40.320> then<00:06:40.980> once<00:06:41.190> you<00:06:41.310> get<00:06:41.460> to<00:06:41.610> know<00:06:41.790> me<00:06:42.000> I'm

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 
quiet then once you get to know me I'm

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.560 
quiet then once you get to know me I'm
like<00:06:42.840> I<00:06:43.080> have<00:06:43.290> a<00:06:43.350> like<00:06:44.100> big<00:06:44.460> imagination<00:06:45.450> I

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.570 
like I have a like big imagination I

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.230 
like I have a like big imagination I
guess<00:06:45.780> that's<00:06:46.680> probably<00:06:47.310> what<00:06:47.520> they'd<00:06:47.700> say<00:06:47.970> I

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
guess that's probably what they'd say I

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.370 
guess that's probably what they'd say I
don't<00:06:48.450> know<00:06:48.510> they<00:06:48.660> could<00:06:48.840> say<00:06:48.990> the<00:06:49.110> complete

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
don't know they could say the complete

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.690 
don't know they could say the complete
opposite<00:06:49.890> I<00:06:49.950> don't<00:06:50.220> know<00:06:50.400> what<00:06:50.520> they're

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
opposite I don't know what they're

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.730 
opposite I don't know what they're
thinking<00:06:50.750> so<00:06:51.750> I<00:06:51.780> guess<00:06:52.260> that's<00:06:52.410> all<00:06:52.590> the

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
thinking so I guess that's all the

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.620 
thinking so I guess that's all the
questions<00:06:52.860> I'm<00:06:53.280> gonna<00:06:53.400> answer<00:06:53.670> yeah<00:06:54.300> I<00:06:54.330> hope
