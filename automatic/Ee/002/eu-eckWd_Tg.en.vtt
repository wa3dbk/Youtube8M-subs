that Firebug is there and installed okay

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.810 
that Firebug is there and installed okay
let's<00:01:38.880> try<00:01:39.060> using<00:01:39.180> Firebug<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.490> find<00:01:41.490> an<00:01:41.640> error

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
let's try using Firebug to find an error

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.429 
let's try using Firebug to find an error
in<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.299> simple<00:01:42.810> program<00:01:43.670> is<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.570> file<00:01:45.840> I'll

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
in a simple program is the file I'll

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.120 
in a simple program is the file I'll
just<00:01:46.890> start<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.670> show<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.909> what<00:01:48.149> goes<00:01:48.570> on

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
just start this to show you what goes on

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.399 
just start this to show you what goes on
it<00:01:50.130> asks<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:50.460> two<00:01:50.670> numbers<00:01:50.960> first<00:01:51.960> one<00:01:52.200> will

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
it asks for two numbers first one will

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.550 
it asks for two numbers first one will
type<00:01:52.619> 23<00:01:53.240> then<00:01:54.240> we'll<00:01:54.659> type<00:01:54.869> another<00:01:55.229> number

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
type 23 then we'll type another number

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.149 
type 23 then we'll type another number
46<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.750> are<00:01:57.750> they<00:01:58.350> should<00:01:58.619> print<00:01:58.799> out<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
46 so are they should print out the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.999 
46 so are they should print out the
biggest<00:01:59.340> but<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.450> doesn't<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.290> prints<00:02:01.619> out<00:02:01.740> a

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
biggest but it doesn't it prints out a

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.280 
biggest but it doesn't it prints out a
smallest<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.700> says<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> biggest<00:02:03.450> so

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
smallest and says it's the biggest so

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.700 
smallest and says it's the biggest so
there's<00:02:04.530> obviously<00:02:04.649> something<00:02:05.189> wrong<00:02:06.710> so

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
there's obviously something wrong so

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.100 
there's obviously something wrong so
what<00:02:07.950> we'll<00:02:08.129> do<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.310> we'll<00:02:08.640> start<00:02:09.270> fire<00:02:09.810> book

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
what we'll do is we'll start fire book

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.470 
what we'll do is we'll start fire book
by<00:02:10.319> clicking<00:02:10.830> on<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:10.979> little<00:02:11.550> insect<00:02:12.090> down

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.320 
and two windows appear in the left-hand
window<00:02:16.830> here<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:18.440> code<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.799> you've<00:02:20.730> written

window here the code that you've written
will<00:02:21.959> appear<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.709> in<00:02:22.860> here<00:02:23.190> as<00:02:23.730> you'll<00:02:24.060> see

will appear and in here as you'll see
later<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:25.290> values<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.799> the<00:02:26.280> different

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
later the values of the different

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.550 
later the values of the different
variables<00:02:27.239> in<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.569> program<00:02:28.019> will<00:02:28.409> be

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
variables in the program will be

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.089 
variables in the program will be
displayed<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.319> first<00:02:31.470> thing<00:02:31.620> we<00:02:31.829> want<00:02:31.950> to

displayed so the first thing we want to
do<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.579> to<00:02:32.940> use<00:02:33.780> Firebug<00:02:34.349> to<00:02:34.670> stop<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:36.000> program

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
do is to use Firebug to stop the program

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.390 
do is to use Firebug to stop the program
when<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.870> gets<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.260> certain<00:02:37.319> point<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.190> we

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
when it gets to a certain point so we

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.100 
when it gets to a certain point so we
can<00:02:38.549> look<00:02:38.700> at<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:38.970> values<00:02:39.299> of<00:02:39.329> the<00:02:39.540> variables

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
can look at the values of the variables

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.440 
can look at the values of the variables
and<00:02:40.530> I'm<00:02:41.010> going<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.280> do<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.640> by<00:02:41.879> clicking<00:02:41.909> on

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
and I'm going to do this by clicking on

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.680 
and I'm going to do this by clicking on
line<00:02:42.959> 9<00:02:43.290> here<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.430> left<00:02:44.579> of<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.940> nine<00:02:45.120> so

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
line 9 here to the left of the nine so

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.500 
line 9 here to the left of the nine so
it's<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.900> red<00:02:46.109> blob<00:02:46.379> appears<00:02:46.970> this<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.150> called<00:02:48.390> a

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
it's a red blob appears this is called a

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.490 
it's a red blob appears this is called a
break<00:02:48.720> point<00:02:49.519> when<00:02:50.519> you<00:02:51.170> start<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.319> program

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
break point when you start the program

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.650 
break point when you start the program
again<00:02:52.829> which<00:02:53.549> I'm<00:02:53.700> going<00:02:53.849> to<00:02:53.940> do<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.239> second

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
again which I'm going to do in a second

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.580 
again which I'm going to do in a second
it<00:02:55.290> will<00:02:55.560> run<00:02:55.829> and<00:02:56.750> stop<00:02:57.750> as<00:02:57.959> soon<00:02:57.989> as<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.409> gets

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
it will run and stop as soon as it gets

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.460 
it will run and stop as soon as it gets
to<00:02:58.799> that<00:02:58.829> point<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.989> just<00:03:00.989> before<00:03:01.170> it

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
to that point and just before it

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.460 
to that point and just before it
actually<00:03:01.650> execute<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:02.640> line<00:03:03.109> so<00:03:04.109> I'm<00:03:04.260> going

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
see and on the right now the values of

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.180 
see and on the right now the values of
the<00:03:21.269> variables<00:03:21.870> have<00:03:21.989> appeared<00:03:22.410> there's<00:03:22.919> lots

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
the variables have appeared there's lots

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.180 
the variables have appeared there's lots
of<00:03:23.340> other<00:03:23.430> stuff<00:03:24.530> all<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.739> do<00:03:25.859> with<00:03:25.889> web

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
of other stuff all to do with web

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.030 
of other stuff all to do with web
browsers<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.150> on<00:03:27.299> which<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.720> can<00:03:27.930> ignore<00:03:28.169> but

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
browsers so on which you can ignore but

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.710 
browsers so on which you can ignore but
basically<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.790> can<00:03:30.000> see<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.480> three

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
basically you can see the three

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.900 
basically you can see the three
variables<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:31.349> we've<00:03:31.590> got<00:03:31.769> biggest<00:03:32.129> input

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
variables that we've got biggest input

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.860 
variables that we've got biggest input
one<00:03:33.090> input<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.989> as<00:03:34.620> these<00:03:34.980> are<00:03:35.160> here<00:03:35.430> and

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
one input to as these are here and

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.629 
one input to as these are here and
they're<00:03:36.870> currently<00:03:37.079> all<00:03:37.410> undefined<00:03:38.220> which<00:03:38.430> is

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
they're currently all undefined which is

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.990 
they're currently all undefined which is
what<00:03:38.790> you'd<00:03:38.940> expect<00:03:40.010> now<00:03:41.010> up<00:03:41.160> here<00:03:41.190> there<00:03:41.879> are

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
what you'd expect now up here there are

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.390 
what you'd expect now up here there are
a<00:03:42.239> series<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.900> icons<00:03:43.379> that<00:03:43.919> are<00:03:44.069> used<00:03:44.250> to

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
a series of icons that are used to

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.539 
a series of icons that are used to
control<00:03:45.169> fire<00:03:46.169> bug<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.709> what<00:03:46.799> it<00:03:46.949> does<00:03:47.190> and

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
control fire bug and what it does and

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.909 
control fire bug and what it does and
the<00:03:47.699> one<00:03:47.849> we're<00:03:48.030> interested<00:03:48.180> in<00:03:48.780> are<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.739> one

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
the one we're interested in are the one

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.119 
the one we're interested in are the one
you<00:03:50.069> use<00:03:50.280> most<00:03:50.549> is<00:03:50.940> this<00:03:51.090> step<00:03:51.510> /<00:03:51.980> icon<00:03:52.980> which

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
you use most is this step / icon which

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.420 
you use most is this step / icon which
basically<00:03:53.519> says<00:03:54.109> step<00:03:55.109> over<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.680> execute<00:03:56.400> the

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
basically says step over and execute the

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.039 
basically says step over and execute the
statement<00:03:56.879> at<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.870> cursor<00:03:58.760> which<00:03:59.760> I'll<00:04:00.000> do<00:04:00.239> as

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
statement at the cursor which I'll do as

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.559 
statement at the cursor which I'll do as
you<00:04:01.079> can<00:04:01.349> see<00:04:01.620> it<00:04:02.069> is<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.910> first<00:04:03.120> input

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
you can see it is the first input

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:10.789 
you can see it is the first input
request<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:05.310> we<00:04:05.370> enter<00:04:05.760> 23<00:04:07.129> click<00:04:08.129> OK<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:09.799> it

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
request so we enter 23 click OK and it

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.900 
request so we enter 23 click OK and it
stops<00:04:11.310> on<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.609> next<00:04:11.910> statement<00:04:12.230> that<00:04:13.230> is

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
stops on the next statement that is

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.479 
stops on the next statement that is
which<00:04:14.910> is<00:04:14.940> in<00:04:15.269> fact<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.780> next<00:04:15.959> input<00:04:16.530> prompt

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
which is in fact the next input prompt

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.640 
which is in fact the next input prompt
but<00:04:18.060> before<00:04:18.209> then<00:04:18.539> you<00:04:18.599> can<00:04:18.870> see<00:04:19.079> that<00:04:19.109> input

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
but before then you can see that input

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.390 
but before then you can see that input
one<00:04:19.889> has<00:04:20.849> got<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.180> value<00:04:21.449> 23<00:04:22.079> in<00:04:22.200> it<00:04:22.349> which<00:04:23.280> is

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
one has got the value 23 in it which is

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.260 
one has got the value 23 in it which is
what<00:04:23.550> we'd<00:04:23.700> expect

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.990 

click<00:04:26.360> on<00:04:26.449> the<00:04:26.599> little<00:04:26.750> icon<00:04:27.259> again<00:04:27.410> and<00:04:28.000> it

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
click on the little icon again and it

asks<00:04:29.240> for<00:04:29.300> a<00:04:29.449> second<00:04:29.840> number<00:04:30.610> 36<00:04:33.580> okay<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:36.250> now

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
asks for a second number 36 okay and now

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.969 
asks for a second number 36 okay and now
it's<00:04:37.940> moved<00:04:38.210> on<00:04:38.509> down<00:04:38.930> here<00:04:39.319> to<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.680> next

statement which is the if statement and
you've<00:04:42.409> got<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.620> two<00:04:42.860> variables<00:04:43.220> set<00:04:43.639> up<00:04:43.819> here

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
you've got the two variables set up here

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.610 
you've got the two variables set up here
for<00:04:44.690> 23<00:04:44.900> and<00:04:45.289> 24<00:04:46.039> 46<00:04:46.970> and<00:04:47.150> 23<00:04:48.669> so<00:04:49.669> it<00:04:49.909> will<00:04:50.180> now

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
for 23 and 24 46 and 23 so it will now

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.540 
for 23 and 24 46 and 23 so it will now
get<00:04:51.620> it<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:52.159> execute<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.270> if<00:04:53.509> statement

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
get it to execute the if statement

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.629 
get it to execute the if statement
because<00:04:55.550> input<00:04:56.360> 1<00:04:56.569> is<00:04:56.750> less<00:04:56.960> than<00:04:57.169> in<00:04:57.349> put<00:04:58.310> to

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
because input 1 is less than in put to

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.649 
because input 1 is less than in put to
it<00:04:59.569> should<00:04:59.900> go<00:05:00.319> on<00:05:00.470> to<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:00.800> first<00:05:01.659> branch

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:02.659 
it should go on to the first branch

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:05.770 
it should go on to the first branch
which<00:05:03.139> it<00:05:03.319> does<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:05.000> it<00:05:05.120> says<00:05:05.360> biggest

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
which it does and it says biggest

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.270 
which it does and it says biggest
becomes<00:05:06.229> input<00:05:06.800> 1<00:05:08.380> which<00:05:09.380> I<00:05:09.740> think<00:05:10.039> you<00:05:10.130> can

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
becomes input 1 which I think you can

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.719 
becomes input 1 which I think you can
see<00:05:10.490> it's<00:05:10.729> a<00:05:10.849> problem<00:05:11.090> because<00:05:11.240> input<00:05:11.810> one<00:05:12.020> is

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
see it's a problem because input one is

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.770 
see it's a problem because input one is
actually<00:05:13.729> the<00:05:14.150> smallest<00:05:14.919> now<00:05:16.449> that<00:05:17.449> pretty

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
actually the smallest now that pretty

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.839 
actually the smallest now that pretty
quickly<00:05:18.110> tells<00:05:18.530> you<00:05:18.710> where<00:05:19.280> the<00:05:19.310> source<00:05:19.669> of

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
quickly tells you where the source of

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.379 
quickly tells you where the source of
the<00:05:19.969> problem<00:05:20.330> is<00:05:20.479> it<00:05:20.710> eats<00:05:21.710> this<00:05:22.039> test<00:05:22.430> here<00:05:22.849> it

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
the problem is it eats this test here it

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.209 
the problem is it eats this test here it
should<00:05:23.659> say<00:05:23.870> if<00:05:23.990> input<00:05:24.169> 1<00:05:24.530> is<00:05:24.680> greater<00:05:24.860> than

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:25.219 
should say if input 1 is greater than

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:29.589 
should say if input 1 is greater than
input<00:05:25.610> too<00:05:27.009> okay<00:05:28.009> so<00:05:28.789> what<00:05:29.150> we're<00:05:29.300> going<00:05:29.389> to<00:05:29.509> do

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
input too okay so what we're going to do

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.760 
input too okay so what we're going to do
is<00:05:29.750> we'll<00:05:29.990> now<00:05:30.259> fix<00:05:31.099> that<00:05:32.259> I'll<00:05:33.259> just<00:05:33.469> let<00:05:33.620> the

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
is we'll now fix that I'll just let the

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.379 
is we'll now fix that I'll just let the
program<00:05:34.190> we're<00:05:34.340> going<00:05:34.370> on<00:05:34.580> to<00:05:35.000> completion

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
program we're going on to completion

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.320 
program we're going on to completion
that<00:05:35.719> says<00:05:35.930> 23<00:05:36.349> is<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.680> biggest<00:05:37.099> and<00:05:38.030> I'll<00:05:38.180> get

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
that says 23 is the biggest and I'll get

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.409 
that says 23 is the biggest and I'll get
the<00:05:38.449> source<00:05:38.719> down<00:05:39.139> here<00:05:40.000> there's<00:05:41.000> the<00:05:41.150> source

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
the source down here there's the source

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.670 
the source down here there's the source
code<00:05:42.219> change<00:05:43.219> the<00:05:44.060> less<00:05:44.810> down<00:05:45.050> there<00:05:45.319> to

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
code change the less down there to

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.909 
code change the less down there to
greater<00:05:46.099> them<00:05:47.529> save<00:05:48.529> the<00:05:48.800> code<00:05:50.620> it'll<00:05:51.620> go<00:05:51.800> away

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
greater them save the code it'll go away

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.969 
greater them save the code it'll go away
again<00:05:52.190> and<00:05:52.750> start<00:05:53.750> off<00:05:53.960> again<00:05:53.990> I'll<00:05:54.650> do<00:05:54.949> a

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
again and start off again I'll do a

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:01.689 
again and start off again I'll do a
refresh<00:05:55.340> up<00:05:56.270> here<00:05:58.479> okay<00:05:59.650> now<00:06:00.650> you<00:06:01.250> can<00:06:01.460> see

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:01.699 
refresh up here okay now you can see

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:04.839 
refresh up here okay now you can see
down<00:06:01.940> here<00:06:02.300> it's<00:06:02.750> got<00:06:03.080> the<00:06:03.259> new<00:06:03.409> code<00:06:03.680> in<00:06:03.889> it<00:06:03.979> so

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
down here it's got the new code in it so

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.379 
down here it's got the new code in it so
we'll<00:06:05.060> step<00:06:05.330> through<00:06:05.599> this<00:06:05.750> this<00:06:05.990> time<00:06:07.389> 23

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
we'll step through this this time 23

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:15.899 
we'll step through this this time 23
again<00:06:10.240> ok<00:06:11.529> that's<00:06:12.529> the<00:06:12.710> 23<00:06:13.370> in<00:06:13.580> the<00:06:13.880> variable

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
again ok that's the 23 in the variable

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:21.370 
again ok that's the 23 in the variable
46<00:06:17.469> that<00:06:18.469> goes<00:06:18.710> into<00:06:18.919> its<00:06:19.190> variable<00:06:20.199> and<00:06:21.199> now

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
46 that goes into its variable and now

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.100 
46 that goes into its variable and now
the<00:06:21.440> test<00:06:21.889> is<00:06:22.250> if<00:06:22.789> input<00:06:22.969> one's<00:06:23.389> greater<00:06:23.810> than

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
the test is if input one's greater than

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.279 
the test is if input one's greater than
input<00:06:24.500> too<00:06:25.509> I've<00:06:26.509> jumps<00:06:26.870> onto<00:06:27.050> the<00:06:27.259> other

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:27.289 
input too I've jumps onto the other

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:32.820 
input too I've jumps onto the other
branch<00:06:27.620> and<00:06:28.270> sets<00:06:29.270> biggest<00:06:30.550> to<00:06:31.550> input<00:06:31.940> to

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
branch and sets biggest to input to

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.950 
branch and sets biggest to input to
click<00:06:33.830> on<00:06:34.039> that<00:06:34.190> and<00:06:34.430> if<00:06:35.419> you<00:06:35.509> look<00:06:35.659> over<00:06:35.839> here

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
click on that and if you look over here

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.360 
click on that and if you look over here
now<00:06:36.430> biggest<00:06:37.430> has<00:06:37.550> got<00:06:37.729> 46<00:06:38.389> in<00:06:38.570> it

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
now biggest has got 46 in it

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.219 
now biggest has got 46 in it
which<00:06:39.520> is<00:06:39.699> in<00:06:39.850> fact<00:06:40.120> the<00:06:40.330> right<00:06:40.510> answer<00:06:41.020> and

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:41.229 
which is in fact the right answer and

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:44.520 
which is in fact the right answer and
then<00:06:42.070> the<00:06:42.190> last<00:06:42.340> statement<00:06:43.199> outputs<00:06:44.199> the

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
then the last statement outputs the

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:51.080 
then the last statement outputs the
result<00:06:45.690> so<00:06:46.690> that<00:06:46.930> is<00:06:47.639> how<00:06:48.639> you<00:06:49.740> debug<00:06:50.740> programs

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
result so that is how you debug programs

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.920 
result so that is how you debug programs
using<00:06:52.090> Firebug<00:06:52.990> is<00:06:53.290> a<00:06:53.350> very<00:06:53.650> useful<00:06:53.860> tool<00:06:54.930> and

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 
using Firebug is a very useful tool and

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.409 
using Firebug is a very useful tool and
it's<00:06:56.139> can<00:06:56.710> save<00:06:56.979> you<00:06:57.130> hours<00:06:57.340> of<00:06:57.820> sitting<00:06:58.150> and

00:06:58.409 --> 00:06:58.419 
it's can save you hours of sitting and

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:01.409 
it's can save you hours of sitting and
staring<00:06:58.720> at<00:06:58.990> code<00:06:59.520> and<00:07:00.520> not<00:07:00.910> being<00:07:01.090> able<00:07:01.210> to

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:01.419 
staring at code and not being able to

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:03.420 
staring at code and not being able to
see<00:07:01.660> what's<00:07:01.900> wrong<00:07:02.080> with<00:07:02.290> it<00:07:02.350> so<00:07:02.830> I<00:07:03.070> would

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
see what's wrong with it so I would

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.590 
see what's wrong with it so I would
seriously<00:07:04.360> recommend<00:07:05.070> giving<00:07:06.070> it<00:07:06.340> a<00:07:06.460> go

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
seriously recommend giving it a go

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.060 
seriously recommend giving it a go
there's<00:07:07.600> a<00:07:07.660> lot<00:07:07.810> more<00:07:07.840> in<00:07:08.139> it<00:07:08.290> than<00:07:08.320> you<00:07:08.949> would

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
there's a lot more in it than you would

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.670 
there's a lot more in it than you would
ever<00:07:09.160> need<00:07:09.310> on<00:07:09.610> this<00:07:09.760> course<00:07:10.320> but<00:07:11.320> if<00:07:11.560> you

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 
ever need on this course but if you

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.860 
ever need on this course but if you
stick<00:07:11.919> to<00:07:12.100> the<00:07:12.250> bits<00:07:12.880> and<00:07:13.150> pieces<00:07:13.479> I've<00:07:13.630> just

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870 
stick to the bits and pieces I've just

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.190 
stick to the bits and pieces I've just
shown<00:07:14.110> you<00:07:14.139> you<00:07:14.440> shouldn't<00:07:14.740> have<00:07:14.919> any<00:07:14.949> trouble
