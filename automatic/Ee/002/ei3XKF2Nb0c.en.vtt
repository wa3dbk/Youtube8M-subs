00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.680
 tranquility and reflection words that 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.680
 make back that they encourage with marisa 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.869
 our lives are a series of 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.230
 decisions in which we choose the 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.910
 projects that we are going to carry out 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.269
 activities in which we have to 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:38.290
 participate the friendships that we will have 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:40.930
 cultivate and often the lack of 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.140
 time and energy make us give up 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.130
 to some of them 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.440
 it is better to assume a total commitment 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.320
 concentrated in certain activities and 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.579
 cultivate a few friendships that 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.820
 devote little attention to many of them 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.940
 total attention to the present moment 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.199
 and everything he contains will enrich 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.360
 our lives 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.479
 we can only develop the talents 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.310
 with which we have been favored if 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.950
 we use them fully for 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.450
 benefit our life and that of the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.659
 the rest 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.180
 the fullness of individual life and 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.039
 collective is proportional to the 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.490
 depth of our relationship with 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:30.119
 ourselves with our friends and 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.119
 Our activities
