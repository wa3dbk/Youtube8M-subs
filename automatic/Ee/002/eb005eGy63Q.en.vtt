 hello how are i giorgio and in this video 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:16.930
 I show you how to make this purse 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:19.330
 Keychain The first thing we need is the 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.100
 seat of two cans so with help 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.100
 of scissors we are going to cut 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.750
 once cut, you should cut two 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.750
 circles in a size larger than the seat 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.420
 of the can in brown felt or the 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.790
 color of your preference will now be 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.519
 it is necessary to put some small sparks 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.470
 that will be chaquiras the color you what 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.870
 you choose and it will only be necessary with 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.190
 thread and needle go sewing them from the 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.190
 way that seems best to you 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.460
 with the help of thread and needle you are going to baste 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.589
 all the outline of the felt circle 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.510
 once you finish sewing you should 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.969
 pull the thread to tighten and this 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.690
 way the felt becomes chinito and 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.790
 embrace well the seat of the tin 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.560
 then cut out a small 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.050
 Felt rectangle that is going to 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.810
 serve to join the closure do not forget 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.960
 to measure the contour of the balls and 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.340
 lined and sealed at the close 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.340
 forming a circle 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.570
 d 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.520
 with the help of thread and needle we will do what 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.630
 same as we did with the felt but in 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.630
 this occasion in the closing 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.690
 let's baste the whole contour to 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.090
 then pull tense and close a little 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.200
 circle 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.200
 in this way 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.410
 let's now put glue on 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.210
 contact and we will join the three pieces one 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.460
 stage of each side leaving the closure in 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.400
 center 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.500
 finally we will perform with the help 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.020
 of foami color black or the color that you 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.660
 you prefer a lining for the interior of 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.400
 this way we will cover the closures and 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.400
 we will give a more aesthetic finish 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.280
 if we stick it 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:30.440
 and ready we will have finished well our 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:34.150
