first thing that we've spotted is an

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.610 
first thing that we've spotted is an
alternative<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.660> sm57<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.590> a

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
standard 57 and Tony here has got a new

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.650 
standard 57 and Tony here has got a new
version<00:00:16.740> which<00:00:17.070> which<00:00:17.430> they're<00:00:17.699> making<00:00:18.359> Tony

version which which they're making Tony
tell<00:00:18.869> me<00:00:18.960> about<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.580> it's<00:00:20.580> called<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.820> 57<00:00:21.449> 90

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
tell me about it it's called the 57 90

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.679 
tell me about it it's called the 57 90
we<00:00:21.960> put<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> 90<00:00:22.650> degree<00:00:22.890> angle<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.340> there<00:00:23.689> pretty

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
we put a 90 degree angle in there pretty

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.019 
we put a 90 degree angle in there pretty
simple<00:00:25.109> but<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.500> helps<00:00:25.769> us<00:00:25.830> get<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
simple but it helps us get in the in the

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.080 
simple but it helps us get in the in the

takes up a lot less space if you look at
the<00:00:32.520> other<00:00:32.610> mic<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.510> put<00:00:33.660> put<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.559> cable<00:00:34.920> on

the other mic you put put a cable on
this<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.430> goes<00:00:35.520> out<00:00:35.760> about<00:00:35.969> 10<00:00:36.239> inches<00:00:36.450> this

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
this it goes out about 10 inches this

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.770 
this it goes out about 10 inches this
goes<00:00:37.020> out<00:00:37.200> about<00:00:37.440> three<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.829> half<00:00:37.860> and

goes out about three and a half and
porton<00:00:39.780> thing<00:00:39.899> as<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.110> sounds<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.469> same<00:00:40.649> so

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
porton thing as it sounds the same so

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.979 
porton thing as it sounds the same so
mic<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.219> everybody<00:00:41.579> knows<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.120> trusts<00:00:42.390> it's

great Mike's been around for 40 years it
just<00:00:45.960> fits<00:00:46.170> better<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.559> instruments<00:00:47.039> now<00:00:47.190> so

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
just fits better in instruments now so

just fits better in instruments now so
he's<00:00:47.579> identical<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.210> every<00:00:48.390> form<00:00:48.600> apart<00:00:48.930> from

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
he's identical in every form apart from

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.139 
he's identical in every form apart from
your<00:00:49.230> right<00:00:49.440> angle<00:00:49.649> piece<00:00:50.129> there<00:00:50.399> yeah<00:00:50.760> yeah

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
your right angle piece there yeah yeah

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.340 
your right angle piece there yeah yeah
we<00:00:51.300> had<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.660> had<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.780> do<00:00:51.899> some<00:00:52.050> things<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
we had it we had to do some things to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.310 
we had it we had to do some things to
make<00:00:52.379> sure<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.710> sounded<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> same<00:00:53.219> but

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
make sure it sounded the same but

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.750 
make sure it sounded the same but
because<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:55.680> couldn't<00:00:55.949> increase<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.640> air

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
because we couldn't increase the air

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.250 
because we couldn't increase the air
inside<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.210> mic<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.660> we<00:00:57.750> had<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.140> had<00:00:58.170> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
inside the mic so we had to we had to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.290 
inside the mic so we had to we had to
put<00:00:58.500> something<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.829> kept<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.430> air<00:00:59.879> volume

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
put something that kept the air volume

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.240 
put something that kept the air volume
the<00:01:00.390> same<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> mic<00:01:01.079> but<00:01:01.680> when<00:01:01.859> we<00:01:01.949> did<00:01:02.070> that

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
the same in the mic but when we did that

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.250 
the same in the mic but when we did that
we<00:01:02.309> we<00:01:02.910> tested<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:03.570> sent<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.960> some

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
we we tested it we sent it to some

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.870 
we we tested it we sent it to some
testing<00:01:04.589> people<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.100> Nashville<00:01:05.549> and

said yes it's right on sounds the same
just<00:01:10.890> fits<00:01:11.100> better<00:01:11.310> what's<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> right<00:01:12.060> angle

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
just fits better what's the right angle

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.310 
just fits better what's the right angle
joint<00:01:12.630> made<00:01:12.840> open<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.799> um<00:01:14.840> it's<00:01:15.840> aluminum

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
joint made open it's um it's aluminum

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.810 
joint made open it's um it's aluminum
it's<00:01:17.250> solid<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.090> uh<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:18.840> filled<00:01:19.080> inside

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
it's solid it's uh it's filled inside

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.410 
it's solid it's uh it's filled inside
unfortunately<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:20.939> couldn't<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.330> these

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
unfortunately we couldn't get these

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.969 
unfortunately we couldn't get these
things<00:01:21.689> at<00:01:21.810> Home<00:01:21.960> Depot<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.500> definitely<00:01:22.860> had

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
things at Home Depot we definitely had

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.160 
things at Home Depot we definitely had
to<00:01:23.009> make<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.340> ourselves<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.080> see

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
to make of ourselves and as you can see

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.340 
to make of ourselves and as you can see
it<00:01:25.259> fits<00:01:25.409> right<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.830> there<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.780> it<00:01:27.780> goes<00:01:28.110> down

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
it fits right in there it it goes down

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.289 
it fits right in there it it goes down
into<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> other<00:01:28.950> mic<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.490> fills<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.000> air

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
into the other mic and fills the air

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.120 
into the other mic and fills the air
cavity<00:01:30.750> from<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.960> other<00:01:31.170> mic<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.680> makes<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.009> new

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
cavity from the other mic it makes a new

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.789 
cavity from the other mic it makes a new
air<00:01:32.280> cavity<00:01:32.990> that's<00:01:33.990> measured<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.560> be<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
air cavity that's measured to be the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.880 
air cavity that's measured to be the
same<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:36.270> solid<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.140> we<00:01:37.259> use

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
same and it's solid and we use

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.710 
same and it's solid and we use
threadlock<00:01:38.220> or<00:01:38.610> when<00:01:38.729> we're<00:01:38.880> done<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.360> it's

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
threadlock or when we're done so it's

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.249 
threadlock or when we're done so it's
sealed<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.670> rugged<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.970> ready<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> abuse

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
sealed and rugged and ready to abuse

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.499 
sealed and rugged and ready to abuse
like<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> original<00:01:43.950> Mike<00:01:44.180> how<00:01:45.180> much<00:01:45.329> does<00:01:45.450> it

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
like the original Mike how much does it
