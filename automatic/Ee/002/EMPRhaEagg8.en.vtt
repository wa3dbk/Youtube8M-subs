00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
an extra controller it's pretty simple

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.709 
an extra controller it's pretty simple
the<00:00:43.050> controller<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.950> new<00:00:44.129> one<00:00:44.309> has<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.360> little

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the controller the new one has a little

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.020 
the controller the new one has a little
touch<00:00:46.020> pad<00:00:46.410> that's<00:00:46.620> clickable<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.730> middle

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030

like actual triggers instead of buttons
and<00:00:52.379> other<00:00:53.129> than<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:53.760> pretty<00:00:53.850> similar

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
and other than that it's pretty similar

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.869 
and other than that it's pretty similar
to<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.440> last<00:00:55.620> generation<00:00:56.010> PlayStation

makes<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.830> kind<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.159> exciting<00:01:08.670> i<00:01:08.790> used<00:01:08.970> to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
makes this kind of exciting i used to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.560 
makes this kind of exciting i used to
have<00:01:09.150> at<00:01:09.270> xbox<00:01:10.010> 360<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> xbox<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.090> really

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
have at xbox 360 but the xbox one really

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.690 
have at xbox 360 but the xbox one really
didn't<00:01:12.840> appeal<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.170> me<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:14.070> presentation

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
didn't appeal to me the presentation

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.940 
didn't appeal to me the presentation
made<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.939> sound<00:01:15.180> more<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.540> DVR<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
made it sound more like a DVR and the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.380 
made it sound more like a DVR and the
whole<00:01:17.100> point<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.460> getting<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.759> game<00:01:17.909> system

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
whole point in getting the game system

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.080 
whole point in getting the game system
obviously<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.500> play<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.799> games<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.970> you're

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
obviously is to play the games so you're

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.670 
obviously is to play the games so you're
probably<00:01:21.270> interested<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> console<00:01:22.590> itself

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
probably interested is a console itself

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.460 
probably interested is a console itself
so<00:01:23.220> I'll<00:01:23.400> be<00:01:23.520> open<00:01:23.790> up<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.119> box<00:01:24.360> right<00:01:24.630> now<00:01:24.840> you

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
controller obviously if it didn't it'd

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.499 
controller obviously if it didn't it'd
be<00:01:31.259> pretty<00:01:31.409> terrible<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.240> that

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
be pretty terrible and we have that

be pretty terrible and we have that
right<00:01:34.110> here<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.829> then<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.720> plugs<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.799> you

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
right here and then the plugs that you

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
need to give it power and hdmi cable to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.389 
need to give it power and hdmi cable to
plug<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.979> into<00:01:44.159> your<00:01:44.340> actual<00:01:44.670> TV<00:01:45.119> now<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:47.130> do

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
plug it into your actual TV now you do

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.550 
plug it into your actual TV now you do
get<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.880> little<00:01:48.090> earpiece<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.259> comes<00:01:49.470> with

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
get a little earpiece that it comes with

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.240 
get a little earpiece that it comes with
for<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:51.060> online<00:01:51.240> playing<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.070> can

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
for the online playing and so you can

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.069 
for the online playing and so you can
record<00:01:53.549> your<00:01:54.090> voice<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.659> stuff<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:55.020> that

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
record your voice and stuff like that

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.170 
record your voice and stuff like that
but<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.649> not<00:01:55.680> very<00:01:55.950> good<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.759> I'd<00:01:56.850> recommend

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
but it's not very good and I'd recommend

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.730 
but it's not very good and I'd recommend
getting<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.630> headset<00:01:58.020> if<00:01:58.259> you're<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> hardcore

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
getting a headset if you're a hardcore

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.870 
getting a headset if you're a hardcore
gamer<00:02:00.079> have<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.140> closer<00:02:01.409> look<00:02:01.740> at<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.579> actual

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
gamer have a closer look at the actual

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.580 
gamer have a closer look at the actual
console<00:02:03.360> itself<00:02:03.509> now<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.079> design<00:02:04.439> looks

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590

the<00:02:14.780> side<00:02:14.989> on<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.500> back<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.920> have<00:02:16.209> all<00:02:17.209> your

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
the side on the back you have all your

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.870 
the side on the back you have all your
outputs<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.860> can<00:02:19.010> see<00:02:19.160> right<00:02:19.190> here<00:02:19.700> I

outputs that you can see right here I

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.470 
outputs that you can see right here I
believe<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.840> don't<00:02:21.050> get<00:02:21.230> another<00:02:21.910> USB<00:02:22.910> cable

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
believe you don't get another USB cable

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.830 
believe you don't get another USB cable
on<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.950> back<00:02:25.160> but<00:02:25.670> on<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.940> front<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:26.360> have<00:02:26.540> to

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
on the back but on the front you have to

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.420 
on the back but on the front you have to
and<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.140> can<00:02:27.349> use<00:02:27.560> those<00:02:27.770> to<00:02:28.010> charge<00:02:28.280> your

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
and you can use those to charge your

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.800 
and you can use those to charge your
controllers<00:02:28.970> so<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.269> chart<00:02:29.510> the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
controllers so the chart the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.140 
controllers so the chart the
controller's<00:02:30.260> come<00:02:30.580> where<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:31.670> can<00:02:31.819> recharge

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
controller's come where you can recharge

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.759 
controller's come where you can recharge
them<00:02:32.330> like<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.900> they<00:02:33.080> don't<00:02:33.260> support

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
them like that and they don't support

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.530 
them like that and they don't support
batteries<00:02:34.250> like<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.120> previous<00:02:35.330> generation

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
batteries like the previous generation

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.190 
batteries like the previous generation
so<00:02:36.230> that's<00:02:36.410> pretty<00:02:36.680> nice<00:02:36.830> improvement

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
so that's pretty nice improvement

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.080 
so that's pretty nice improvement
anyways<00:02:39.200> hope<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:39.650> enjoyed<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.250> video<00:02:40.670> keep

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
it sort of short because it doesn't have

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.070 
it sort of short because it doesn't have
