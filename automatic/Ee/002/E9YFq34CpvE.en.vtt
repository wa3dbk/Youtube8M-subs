00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
about that it's perfect conjunction if

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.859 
about that it's perfect conjunction if
we<00:01:41.280> take<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.549> look<00:01:42.619> this<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.890> setup<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.610> have

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
we take a look this is the setup I have

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.710 
we take a look this is the setup I have
now<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.369> see<00:01:47.610> how<00:01:47.850> long<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.270> arm<00:01:48.450> is

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
now and you can see how long the arm is

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.200 
now and you can see how long the arm is
let<00:01:49.470> me<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.770> give<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:49.950> an<00:01:50.130> example<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
let me just give you an example the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.830 
let me just give you an example the
screen<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.899> middle<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.920> 29<00:01:53.729> inch<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.329> 21

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
screen in the middle is a 29 inch and 21

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.560 
screen in the middle is a 29 inch and 21
by<00:01:55.020> 9<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:57.270> arm<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.630> pretty<00:01:57.960> long<00:01:59.570> it's

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
by 9 so the arm is pretty long it's

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.010 
by 9 so the arm is pretty long it's
perfectly<00:02:01.079> just<00:02:01.439> 2

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
perfectly just 2

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.050 
perfectly just 2

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
don't get that sound through with the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.070 
don't get that sound through with the
microphone<00:02:41.040> which<00:02:41.340> might<00:02:41.730> be<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.270> pain<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:42.959> the

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
microphone which might be a pain in the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.479 
microphone which might be a pain in the
butt<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.500> had<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.190> before<00:02:44.340> with<00:02:44.970> another

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
butt I had it before with another

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.500 
butt I had it before with another
microphone<00:02:47.489> where<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:47.910> didn't<00:02:48.239> have<00:02:48.270> the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
microphone where I didn't have the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.260 
microphone where I didn't have the
spider<00:02:48.810> mount<00:02:49.050> as<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.410> one<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.670> was<00:02:50.850> just

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
spider mount as this one and it was just

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.570 
spider mount as this one and it was just
making<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.170> sound<00:02:52.590> all<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.070> time<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.489> it

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
making that sound all the time and it

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.310 
making that sound all the time and it
kind<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:53.970> pissed<00:02:54.239> me<00:02:54.390> off<00:02:54.420> because<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.810> couldn't

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
kind of pissed me off because I couldn't

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.430 
kind of pissed me off because I couldn't
really<00:02:55.530> create<00:02:55.920> any<00:02:55.950> quality<00:02:56.580> content<00:02:57.110> if<00:02:58.110> we

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
really create any quality content if we

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.170 
really create any quality content if we
take<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.680> look<00:02:58.860> at<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.100> blue<00:02:59.280> icicle<00:02:59.489> here<00:03:00.000> you

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
take a look at the blue icicle here you

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.050 
take a look at the blue icicle here you
can<00:03:00.360> see<00:03:00.630> that<00:03:02.570> it's<00:03:03.570> just<00:03:04.130> XLR<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.430> at<00:03:05.820> the

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
can see that it's just XLR and at the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.420 
can see that it's just XLR and at the
right<00:03:06.239> side<00:03:06.540> in<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.019> use<00:03:07.500> P<00:03:07.739> out<00:03:07.920> on<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.250> other

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
right side in and use P out on the other

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.880 
right side in and use P out on the other
side<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:09.090> have<00:03:09.269> a<00:03:09.299> little<00:03:09.510> knob<00:03:09.930> where<00:03:10.709> you're

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
side you have a little knob where you're

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.949 
side you have a little knob where you're
able<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.190> turn<00:03:11.519> it<00:03:11.700> up<00:03:11.850> and<00:03:12.150> down<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.570> volume

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
able to turn it up and down the volume

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.970 
able to turn it up and down the volume
you<00:03:13.709> can't<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.780> you<00:03:15.780> can't<00:03:16.049> Dallas<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.769> what's

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
would be a button to mute it totally but

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.910 
would be a button to mute it totally but
yeah<00:03:25.530> that's<00:03:25.950> what<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:26.790> got<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.560> take<00:03:28.560> up<00:03:28.709> with

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.979 
very happy about it it makes it awesome
cause<00:03:42.810> even<00:03:43.590> though<00:03:43.769> it's<00:03:44.010> only<00:03:44.250> 16-bit<00:03:45.120> but

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
cause even though it's only 16-bit but

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.220 
cause even though it's only 16-bit but
at<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.280> other<00:03:47.340> hand<00:03:47.730> almost<00:03:48.420> all<00:03:48.660> USB

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
at the other hand almost all USB

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.710 
at the other hand almost all USB
microphones<00:03:49.769> are<00:03:49.980> 16<00:03:50.310> bits<00:03:50.549> so<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:51.030> don't<00:03:51.420> think

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
microphones are 16 bits so I don't think

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.490 
microphones are 16 bits so I don't think
I<00:03:51.810> know<00:03:51.870> anyone<00:03:52.260> that's<00:03:52.410> 24-bit<00:03:53.330> but<00:03:54.500> yeah

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
I know anyone that's 24-bit but yeah
