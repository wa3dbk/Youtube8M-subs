00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:11.447
Randone - You should not forget

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:15.895
Linea di confine (Electromantic Music 2010)

00:00:43.194 --> 00:00:45.908
You should not forget 

00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:50.283
my sincere glances

00:00:51.827 --> 00:00:54.651
Of a love so intense 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.469
that the poets wrote about

00:01:00.412 --> 00:01:03.339
You should not forget 

00:01:04.908 --> 00:01:08.054
the embraces under sky

00:01:09.158 --> 00:01:12.559
Outside of the thought-stopping 

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:17.551
fashion norm

00:01:20.182 --> 00:01:23.223
You should not forget 

00:01:24.456 --> 00:01:27.552
all the passion’s nights

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:31.961
Delicate flavours 

00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:36.712
from another dimension

00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:40.633
Then when the boredom 

00:01:41.962 --> 00:01:45.019
clasped your hand

00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:49.355
You knew dear lady 

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:55.883
that I was already far away

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.797
away

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.799
You should not forget 

00:02:23.286 --> 00:02:26.008
in the chill of the events

00:02:27.712 --> 00:02:30.655
The tight warmth 

00:02:31.936 --> 00:02:35.577
of our mutual belonging

00:02:36.424 --> 00:02:39.706
I’ve seen you on a road 

00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:43.818
which is no more mine

00:02:45.138 --> 00:02:48.291
But if you turn back now, 

00:02:49.418 --> 00:02:54.291
you must not forget

00:02:59.788 --> 00:03:14.109
That I’ve loved you true

00:03:39.754 --> 00:03:42.803
You would not forget 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.316
that you swept away my heart

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:51.565
But crazy as I was 

00:03:52.804 --> 00:03:56.069
I could see your innocence

00:03:56.924 --> 00:04:00.365
You should not forget 

00:04:01.517 --> 00:04:04.781
that we were swell

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:09.039
Hearing the morning song 

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:14.326
and the evening silence

00:04:16.872 --> 00:04:20.033
But when the boredom 

00:04:21.153 --> 00:04:24.080
clasped your hand

00:04:25.545 --> 00:04:28.777
I saw how my bride 

00:04:29.841 --> 00:04:33.361
walked away from me

00:04:34.194 --> 00:04:37.361
I’ve seen you on a road 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.698
which is no more mine

00:04:42.956 --> 00:04:45.955
But if you turn back now,

00:04:47.107 --> 00:04:52.589
you must not forget

00:04:57.548 --> 00:05:11.710
That I’ve loved you true

00:06:00.041 --> 00:06:02.728
