 pechuga daughter the pichu the one of albert 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:10.260

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.880
 well we decided to be and good to take 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.950
 the comment he had put because 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.470
 remember that this I played and good 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.660
 and record the microphone but to say that 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.940
 such the original audio of the game and 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.760
 tell them a doubt that a stick 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.230
 answering him is a cat of the world 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.890
 many people many subscribers tell me 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.520
 looks to why you do not buy the xbox 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.440
 360 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.970
 dukes to us the subscribers of 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.570
 these zetas buttons we want to play 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:02.410
 with you ducsa you should buy the xbox 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.410
 to be able to upload more videos 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.190
 or that I'm going to tell you why I do not 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.000
 I buy the xbox 360 because it's going to buy 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.000
 first because 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.720
 I do not know I think that although you have to pay for 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.939
 play all that I think I'm doing 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.399
 enough I'm spending a lot of money 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.920
 believe me with the prestige 3 with the plus 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.560
 with the games, that is, although I did not want 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.380
 having a console is an investment and 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.060
 have two is strong obligation imagine 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.500
 my case for example I have many games 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.299
 of playstation 3 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.860
 you create station plus that use and 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.200
 maximum as has been realized for what 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.479
 others imagine that I go now to the 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.420
 xbox would have to pay about 60 dollars or 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.000
 50 dollars more expensive for the year and apart 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.080
 I would have to buy more things 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.909
 other reasons why I did not 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.850
 I buy second because I do not 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.000
 we bought because still but now 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.539
 I'm already practically did what I 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.330
 promised I have passed more than two videos already 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.099
 people react to watch the videos and 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.619
 I love that or I do not care if I get there 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:09.019
 I care but before we arrived 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.840
 with the photos to 100 200 but now 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.760
 we went to a thousand to four thousand sometimes to 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.410
 five thousand that I really like that and 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.900
 that in doubt in the area by the test 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.490
 motivates your videos 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.110
 I keep on with the box not telling you not to 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.970
 I'm going to buy friends, I 'm going to 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.250
 buy but we have to have more 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.250
 Most Viewed Most Viewed readers 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.840
 more view of the video or I'm going to put the 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.100
 exclusive xbox games on this channel 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.730
 and also it is to gain more subscribers more 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.930
 views and so power your video not because I 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.330
 I would like to make everyone happy 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.860
 but but only here is also missing 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.200
 money not money money or money 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.040
 to buy games hundred of the money is 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.430
 investment 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.290
 and with the partner's 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:02.719
 I do not get tired that everything I do 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.719
 I buy my work 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:11.879
 intermediate that he scored in terms 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:15.689
 annuals or citizens yes otan or so believe 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:24.500
 I would worry about the xbox and kinect and other 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:24.500
 thing more but I'm not going to buy it 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.530
 that does not mean that it is always 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.019
 talking more about the side of the xbox to 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.519
 only thing I said is that I do not like 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.290
 nothing more and points I did not say that the 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.669
 devotion to my queens are already consoles 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.669
 different but 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.890
 but did not rule out the possibility of 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.510
 buy me the xbox ok so good that 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.580
 It was a doubt that a lot of people were 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.709
 saying and I also want to tell you that 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.120
 there is a user in spots told me 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.700
 many people who have created an account 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.440
 with my name with me with a gamertag that 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.060
 subjective say of I say one thing I do not 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.769
 I have is that there is a there is a person and 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.540
 point that sometimes goes by me I do not 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.250
 I have xbox so I take care of another one 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.269
 feels that he represents him playing with a 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.280
 educational failures 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.560

 I'm going to talk very quickie quickie this is not 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.140

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.460
 vital protection that is and is confirmed

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:08.300

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.460
 of connection that we would have with the 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.779
