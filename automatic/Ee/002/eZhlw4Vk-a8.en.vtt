you'll<00:00:37.020> see<00:00:38.000> we're<00:00:39.000> about<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.510> look<00:00:39.600> at<00:00:39.720> today

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
you'll see we're about to look at today

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.130 
you'll see we're about to look at today
our<00:00:40.350> draggable<00:00:41.100> transitions<00:00:41.960> see<00:00:42.960> I'm

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
our draggable transitions see I'm

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.640 
our draggable transitions see I'm
dragging<00:00:43.530> out<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.650> tol<00:00:44.010> a3<00:00:44.550> here<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.570> stub<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
dragging out a tol a3 here to stub and

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.310 
dragging out a tol a3 here to stub and
then<00:00:46.949> I'm<00:00:47.070> going<00:00:47.159> to<00:00:47.220> draw<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.400> road<00:00:47.909> stub<00:00:48.870> out

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
then I'm going to draw a road stub out

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.229 
then I'm going to draw a road stub out
from<00:00:49.620> here<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.760> do<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.879> know<00:00:51.000> it's

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
from here and what do you know it's

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.360 
from here and what do you know it's
connecting<00:00:51.839> up<00:00:52.050> with<00:00:52.229> the<00:00:52.379> Toa<00:00:52.739> three<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.309> we

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
connecting up with the Toa three and we

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.869 
connecting up with the Toa three and we
got<00:00:53.519> a<00:00:53.550> transition<00:00:54.120> there<00:00:57.409> that<00:00:58.729> you'll<00:00:59.729> see

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
got a transition there that you'll see

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.789 
got a transition there that you'll see
it<00:00:59.970> works<00:01:00.210> for<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.479> few<00:01:00.690> more<00:01:00.870> instances<00:01:01.650> as

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:01.799 
it works for a few more instances as

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:05.930 
it works for a few more instances as
well<00:01:03.470> and<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.710> plot<00:01:04.920> would<00:01:05.070> see<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> five<00:01:05.700> down

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
well and the plot would see a five down

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:14.179 
well and the plot would see a five down
here<00:01:09.979> I'm<00:01:10.979> sure<00:01:11.100> they'd<00:01:11.340> add<00:01:11.490> out<00:01:13.130> then<00:01:14.130> I

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
here I'm sure they'd add out then I

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.469 
here I'm sure they'd add out then I
dragged<00:01:14.399> an<00:01:14.520> Avenue<00:01:14.850> into<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.119> end<00:01:15.240> here

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
dragged an Avenue into the end here

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.149 
dragged an Avenue into the end here
rather<00:01:15.750> than<00:01:15.810> using<00:01:16.020> stubs<00:01:16.380> neck<00:01:16.649> technique

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
rather than using stubs neck technique

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.649 
rather than using stubs neck technique
this<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.369> actually<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> direct<00:01:17.880> connection<00:01:18.390> as

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
this is actually a direct connection as

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.800 
this is actually a direct connection as
you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:18.990> see<00:01:19.079> we<00:01:19.229> got<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.409> TLA<00:01:19.829> five<00:01:20.479> app<00:01:21.479> new

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
you can see we got a TLA five app new

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.010 
you can see we got a TLA five app new
connection<00:01:25.219> and<00:01:26.219> this<00:01:27.180> even<00:01:27.420> works<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
connection and this even works on the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.279 
connection and this even works on the
new<00:01:28.890> triple<00:01:29.549> tile<00:01:29.850> networks<00:01:30.780> they'll<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.079> part

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
new triple tile networks they'll be part

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:37.789 
new triple tile networks they'll be part
of<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.469> 2.0<00:01:32.130> release<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:35.240> now<00:01:36.240> connect<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.799> TL

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
of the 2.0 release and now connect a TL

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.279 
of the 2.0 release and now connect a TL
a<00:01:37.890> seven<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.640> six<00:01:38.700> here<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:42.140> well<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.229> know

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
a seven and a six here and well you know

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.319 
a seven and a six here and well you know
there's<00:01:43.619> direct<00:01:44.399> connection<00:01:44.850> using<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.119> step

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
there's direct connection using the step

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:57.810 
there's direct connection using the step
technique

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:13.190 

and<00:01:58.770> see<00:01:59.770> here

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.010 

and<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:13.950> got<00:02:14.180> tridiagonal<00:02:15.770> connection<00:02:16.770> here

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
and I got tridiagonal connection here

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.750 
and I got tridiagonal connection here
from<00:02:19.020> itla<00:02:19.530> three<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.010> Road<00:02:22.280> tryout<00:02:23.280> diagonals

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
from itla three to Road tryout diagonals

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.010 
from itla three to Road tryout diagonals
does<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.450> there<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.200> go<00:02:25.319> another<00:02:26.190> edible

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
does and there you go another edible

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.970 
does and there you go another edible
transition<00:02:28.020> there<00:02:28.200> makes<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.770> a<00:02:28.830> lot<00:02:28.920> easier

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
transition there makes it a lot easier

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.030 
transition there makes it a lot easier
than<00:02:30.260> flipping<00:02:31.260> through<00:02:31.410> all<00:02:31.530> those<00:02:31.680> puzzle

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
than flipping through all those puzzle

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:43.120 
than flipping through all those puzzle
pieces<00:02:40.850> I'm<00:02:41.850> just<00:02:42.000> going<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.180> show<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.420> the

stub technique that allows us to get

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.789 
stub technique that allows us to get
around<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.060> problem<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.569> trying<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.470> connect
