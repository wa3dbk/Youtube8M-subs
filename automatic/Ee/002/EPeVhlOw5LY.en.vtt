00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
so you can't really see it but I haven't

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.300 
so you can't really see it but I haven't
really<00:03:56.049> played<00:03:56.350> around<00:03:56.590> with<00:03:56.680> this<00:03:56.859> too<00:03:57.130> much

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
really played around with this too much

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.970 
really played around with this too much
I<00:03:57.639> used<00:03:57.880> to<00:03:57.970> have<00:03:58.560> another<00:03:59.560> one<00:03:59.739> but<00:03:59.889> the

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
I used to have another one but the

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.770 
I used to have another one but the
formulas<00:04:00.489> change<00:04:00.790> so<00:04:01.060> I<00:04:01.120> you<00:04:01.209> feel<00:04:01.510> like<00:04:01.660> it

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
formulas change so I you feel like it

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.349 
formulas change so I you feel like it
can't<00:04:02.049> really<00:04:02.440> give<00:04:03.100> my<00:04:03.280> full<00:04:03.609> of<00:04:03.730> me<00:04:03.940> not<00:04:04.060> yet

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
can't really give my full of me not yet

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.490 
can't really give my full of me not yet
but<00:04:06.269> from<00:04:07.269> what<00:04:07.450> I've<00:04:07.750> heard<00:04:07.780> from<00:04:08.019> a<00:04:08.350> lot<00:04:08.440> of

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
but from what I've heard from a lot of

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.170 
but from what I've heard from a lot of
people<00:04:08.709> that<00:04:08.980> crease<00:04:09.310> but<00:04:09.519> I've<00:04:09.669> had<00:04:09.850> these<00:04:10.000> on

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
people that crease but I've had these on

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.960 
people that crease but I've had these on
my<00:04:10.209> hand<00:04:10.600> for<00:04:10.870> about<00:04:11.199> an<00:04:11.500> hour<00:04:11.590> now

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
my hand for about an hour now

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.420 
my hand for about an hour now
they<00:04:13.030> haven't<00:04:13.210> creased<00:04:13.510> it<00:04:13.630> all<00:04:13.750> so<00:04:14.350> I<00:04:14.710> guess

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
they haven't creased it all so I guess

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.090 
they haven't creased it all so I guess
it<00:04:15.700> just<00:04:15.730> depends<00:04:16.150> on<00:04:16.239> your<00:04:16.360> body's<00:04:16.630> chemistry

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
it just depends on your body's chemistry

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.100 
it just depends on your body's chemistry
but<00:04:18.100> for<00:04:18.489> now<00:04:18.519> I<00:04:18.910> really<00:04:19.360> love<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.870> UM<00:04:20.079> the
