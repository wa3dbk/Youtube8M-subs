sudden you are ready to go you've got a
couple<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.350> adapters<00:02:21.800> for<00:02:21.830> different

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
couple of adapters for different

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.850 
couple of adapters for different
generations<00:02:23.240> of<00:02:23.510> iPhones<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.440> make<00:02:24.560> sure<00:02:24.709> that

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
generations of iPhones to make sure that

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.680 
generations of iPhones to make sure that
they<00:02:24.980> all<00:02:25.100> fit<00:02:25.370> in<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.910> charger<00:02:26.270> just<00:02:26.450> fine

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
they all fit in the charger just fine

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.190 
they all fit in the charger just fine
and<00:02:26.959> last<00:02:27.740> but<00:02:27.890> not<00:02:28.040> least<00:02:28.310> there<00:02:28.670> is<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:29.209> USB

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
and last but not least there is a USB

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.550 
and last but not least there is a USB
cable<00:02:30.560> presumably<00:02:31.540> for<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.810> power<00:02:33.020> the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
cable presumably for to power the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.850 
cable presumably for to power the
charger<00:02:33.950> as<00:02:34.130> well<00:02:34.190> as<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.420> get<00:02:36.350> presumably<00:02:36.770> a

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
charger as well as to get presumably a

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.880 
charger as well as to get presumably a
power<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.730> iPhone<00:02:38.239> charger<00:02:38.890> actually

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
power the the iPhone charger actually

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.140 
power the the iPhone charger actually
what<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.190> heck<00:02:40.340> would<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.640> before<00:02:41.030> because

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
what the heck would that before because

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.020 
what the heck would that before because
it<00:02:41.330> already<00:02:41.480> has<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.810> wall<00:02:42.170> wart<00:02:42.700> okay<00:02:43.700> well

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
it already has a wall wart okay well

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.460 
it already has a wall wart okay well
let's<00:02:44.300> just<00:02:44.390> assume<00:02:44.660> that's<00:02:44.959> useful<00:02:45.260> for

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
let's just assume that's useful for

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.080 
let's just assume that's useful for
something<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.220> leave<00:02:46.520> it<00:02:46.640> at<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:47.320> okay<00:02:48.320> so

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
something and leave it at that okay so

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.760 
something and leave it at that okay so
okay<00:02:50.090> yes<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.660> will<00:02:50.840> get<00:02:50.989> to<00:02:51.140> that<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.470> will<00:02:51.680> get

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
okay yes I will get to that I will get

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.560 
okay yes I will get to that I will get
to<00:02:51.830> that<00:02:52.100> believe<00:02:52.430> me<00:02:52.640> I'm<00:02:52.790> not<00:02:53.030> I'm<00:02:53.270> not<00:02:53.330> gonna

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
to that believe me I'm not I'm not gonna

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.520 
to that believe me I'm not I'm not gonna
pass<00:02:53.870> up<00:02:54.050> that<00:02:54.110> opportunity<00:02:56.110> okay<00:02:57.110> so<00:02:57.170> let's

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
pass up that opportunity okay so let's

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.140 
pass up that opportunity okay so let's
just<00:02:57.590> take<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.310> thing<00:02:58.489> is<00:02:58.610> surprisingly

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
just take it the thing is surprisingly

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.640 
just take it the thing is surprisingly
heavy<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.600> mean<00:02:59.810> they<00:02:59.930> say<00:03:00.110> it's<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.320> weighted

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
heavy I mean they say it's a weighted

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.260 
heavy I mean they say it's a weighted
base<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.160> can<00:03:01.370> see<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.670> value<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.090> a

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
base and I can see the value of a

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.479 
base and I can see the value of a
weighted<00:03:02.570> base<00:03:02.720> because<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:04.040> way<00:03:04.190> it's<00:03:04.340> not

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
weighted base because that way it's not

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.360 
weighted base because that way it's not
gonna<00:03:04.700> fall<00:03:05.450> very<00:03:06.230> easily<00:03:06.440> I<00:03:06.830> mean<00:03:07.040> if<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:07.220> does

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
gonna fall very easily I mean if it does

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.400 
gonna fall very easily I mean if it does
fall<00:03:07.670> it'll<00:03:08.030> probably<00:03:08.209> hurt<00:03:08.420> your<00:03:08.630> foot<00:03:08.870> so<00:03:09.230> be

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
fall it'll probably hurt your foot so be

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.830 
fall it'll probably hurt your foot so be
careful<00:03:09.769> so<00:03:10.580> go<00:03:10.760> ahead<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.000> pull<00:03:11.570> that<00:03:11.690> open

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
careful so go ahead and pull that open

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.289 
careful so go ahead and pull that open
just<00:03:12.170> got<00:03:12.350> some<00:03:12.530> elastic<00:03:13.010> cords<00:03:13.340> here<00:03:13.580> tying

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
just got some elastic cords here tying

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.590 
just got some elastic cords here tying
together<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.870> packaging<00:03:15.970> okay<00:03:16.970> there<00:03:17.269> we<00:03:17.390> go

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
together the packaging okay there we go

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.110 
together the packaging okay there we go
all<00:03:17.900> right<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:19.310> actually<00:03:19.730> feels<00:03:19.940> pretty

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
all right that actually feels pretty

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.720 
all right that actually feels pretty
good<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.870> feels<00:03:21.080> pretty<00:03:21.230> slick<00:03:21.590> so<00:03:21.860> I'd<00:03:22.489> say

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
good that feels pretty slick so I'd say

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.199 
good that feels pretty slick so I'd say
the<00:03:22.910> base<00:03:23.090> weighs<00:03:23.480> maybe<00:03:23.810> about<00:03:25.060> it's<00:03:26.060> gotta

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
the base weighs maybe about it's gotta

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.729 
the base weighs maybe about it's gotta
weigh<00:03:26.330> at<00:03:26.450> least<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.750> pound<00:03:26.989> and<00:03:27.140> a<00:03:27.200> half<00:03:27.380> pound

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
weigh at least a pound and a half pound

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.830 
weigh at least a pound and a half pound
pound<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.190> half<00:03:28.340> or<00:03:28.549> so<00:03:28.700> okay<00:03:29.360> right<00:03:29.540> here

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
pound and a half or so okay right here
