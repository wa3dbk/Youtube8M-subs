00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.819
 something quite important for the sport 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.160
 the only third place in Chile and what 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.840
 only world that is good the truth 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.440

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:20.590

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:23.080

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.810
 to the hours are our faces here 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:32.529
 Recoleta where I also live 35 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:34.980
 years and she accepted on the stone that 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.500
 He decides that I hate him 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.329
 and thank her anyway 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.400
 we are all stickers of it so 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.030
 that comes so at least we hope 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.699
 that later this is nice and 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.970
 that people who come by here to see 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.850
 their families 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.710
 like what the nation was made 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.380
 the works or stopped it in the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.510
 mayor that the sectors of life and 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.730
 giving them put a better reason you give 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.500
 account of the lion in football you 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.270
 is to be happy because you were a scorer 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.530
 of the World Cup the four are remembered 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.230
 goals that made the only goal scorer 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.750
 Chilean in a good world I had in 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:16.460
 where he has been in two worlds on 62 and 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.230
 66 and I'm proud and I had for the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.840
 third place that we get here that what 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.700
 we always dedicate when we start already is 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.440
 because this one we look at all Chileans 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.420
 that went to the stadium at that time 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.130
 support us 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.979
 and happier and still that has been 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.470
 global choice that I think the country 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.619
 it also serves you and demonstrating that 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.960
 there are Chilean players who hide a 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.540
 World Cup gives players the chance 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.090
 of the 32 countries of other teams like 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.979
 We are now many players that is 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.250
 they are abroad and they are doing 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.619
 goals also all none miss us 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.100
 let him do a goal boy guys so 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.899
 it has already cost him that I already did 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.640
 two goals in a row and that has already 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.380
 demonstrated in what what are the 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.940
 Chilean players like the many 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.470
 young people who are in clear salt if that 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.259
 for your staff for Chilean football 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.720
 I think they saw more of the world that 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.450
 sense of what was done also because 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.209
 he struggled a lot with a man who put 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.069
 everything he brought from europe that was 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.520
 talking to our father for us 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.950
 that for barefoot 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.400
 and I think he took the biggest step 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.910
 of this and here we are all together with him 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.650
 and we hope that by the end of the year we can 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.330
 have something and it will read well 50 years 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.040
 that will accelerate us to the people who 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.990
 want I think you have been asked 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.580
 millions of times but as you remember that 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.950
 the goal he made to the black spider and 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.640
 arica good are things that that in that 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.300
 moment there are many things to say in 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.300
 that moment 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.660
 he said 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.800
 it was criminal was criminal because after 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:58.220
 he saw but he was jurist martÃ­nez that 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.430
 fish was close and the warning did not 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.010
 He took the penalty and color outside arrived 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.440
 jorge bull and I made myself lyon I said let me 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.210
 be dawn I was written gentlemen who do not 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.280
 chose to leave me because I have the 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.760
 gx hunch and I hit him like me 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.020
 I think I want to hit him something can happen 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.610
 then how are the novices love that 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.610
 part told me called 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.810
 we look for in that part I went and 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.250
 I directed 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:33.489
 the by leito and the blow came the goal 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.230
 to go without and there then July 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.440
 martinez after he got the word out 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.860
 divine justice saying is that grief and 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.560
 after he even said they did not know what 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.440
 that with the life that they found that 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.489
 fear every strong and place qualities 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.590
 there is the answer 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.239
 finally what practical systems 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.360
 you remember were with italy italy 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.450
 germany russia brasil because for me 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.580
 all the parties that are the winners and 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.840
 that we play the poplars is what gave them 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.010
 the third place and that's why we're in 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.010
 this moment very happy and very happy
