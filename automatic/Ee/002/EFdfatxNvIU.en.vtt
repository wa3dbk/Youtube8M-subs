00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hey people and hearts comes to one 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.930
 new episode of the bar tutorials and 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.320
 Today, let's get the car in 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.780
 santa by mindfactory reloaded and that 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.610
 There was a last important tutorial 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.500
 to that i hope i forget myself 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.650
 somewhere in the picture it is now 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.410
 links the other animal to the 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.330
 founder or matt winner with which one the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.359
 called for so-called fluids from 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.699
 liquid zeus or so we manufacture 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.019
 someone needs this device 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.579
 have to ask my we put do 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.520
 somehow a liquid that's the one 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.350
 that's how he looks like 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.690
 always place it with you for a short time 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.920
 a little booklet on it 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.450
 funny enough is when crafting recipe 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.129
 I also have a book 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.140
 I already thought and indeed we need 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.710
 for the updraft center three gold bars 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.059
 three books, two diamonds only 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.399
 factory machines blog we out 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.719
 stones and plastic difference make this one 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.399
 three plastic divorced here respectively 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:03.390
 So we get four out of every four 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.549
 rob annoying the turn we make by 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.920
 but we're done in oven 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.200
 Tourport of Ace the normal oven here 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.880
 It does not matter if we just go in here 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.320
 and then we get a robbery casual 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.040
 program but you can only but 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.750
 perceive 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.310
 but that's another one now 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.619
 History comes sometime different 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.200
 again , so there is guaranteed 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.600
 still tutorial to what it was then 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.759
 so you have taken on it 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.439
 just clever and cool is good 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.210
 Now we need a seat again 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.250
 here I always have to fly on 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.920
 I can see them soon 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.570
 cards in between stand here 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.310
 We've already set up that 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.619
 I explain the last episode everyone explains 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.110
 I do not have much to do except that everyone 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.850
 founder is the one here with far too many 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.880
 high voltage compartments is driven 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.829
 one reaches the councils already arrive 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.000
 the mother drops in and below 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.549
 is just in water pipes 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.649
 stone what's this from liquid 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.000
 by pumping low automatically and that 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.420
 somehow have to take a pump or 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.990
 so 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.840
 here the same with a sense again 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.459
 said so-called so what I 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.030
 just explained to the car here 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.110
 We removed a tool up here 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.700
 do it in a different way 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.120
 also get out putin that you can then 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.350
 later also with machines moderate things 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.200
 rausbringen or so you filter below 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.100
 install or and then pipe comes up 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.450
 this rhine is good here 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.100
 come set what level that 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.940
 30 could decide 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.620
 accept 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.040
 I take now but to show only what 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.750
 small and we decide on an iron 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.530
 Pick the tower in here up here 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.350
 Well 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.970
 he begins as you can see he needs it 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.540
 starts already to the mob liquid 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.920
 Get the one we get by here like 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.990
 I explained the last time happ this 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.810
 this feature it is on how the 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.180
 the movable scroll Lecheler 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.209
 Textures looks like if I am here now 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.540
 born then that there a little that 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:04.020
 do not start right now 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.580
 which die thanks to the machine and 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.320
 from the machine when it becomes so 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.410
 then, so to speak, it's micky zeus 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:14.489
 made the hormone so do that 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.690
 now extra-time get there very briefly 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.549
 logically again black powder 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.500
 rhine d league like zeus becomes hereby 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.040
 pumped and already as you can see 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.019
 it works that way 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.820
 unimportant here that has something to do with the net 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.380
 and to do input when I say that 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.390
 then that flashes so that actually has 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.600
 do not use it like me 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.970
 At least that's what it's got here 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.310
 relative to the liquid we in here 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.959
 get in as soon as there is then here 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.630
 the queen if i turn on then 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.760
 collects that if nothing bothers 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.950
 then directly on board then he collects 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.709
 the then so does it again 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.690
 I recommend doing that to yourself 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.150
 fill up here slowly if then 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.470
 lies as zeus is there so it takes 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.150
 already a while because there already have to 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.160
 many monsters show up 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.040
 I'm already here many you have to 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.410
 really really either many founders 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.560
 put or wait quite a long time 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.880
 every time sometime monsters appear 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.180
 But usually it works outright because you 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.329
 it just casually makes it so here comes 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.660
 the convincing again we do purely good but 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.400
 Let's see how we see this bar 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.980
 the important thing here is this 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.810
 electricity, then 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.150
 Importing electricity is important to me too 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.040
 high voltage and too much actually 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.250
 you can take much less is only too 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.670
 show that as well as we do 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.850
 see 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.780
 take that now the moment of the beginning 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.110
 So this bar I'm currently in 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.030
 showed that is important this 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.780
 yellow that I fill so slowly 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.680
 and that's because when it's full 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.900
 will decide first 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.640
 that means when he is at the top 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.770
 the level is lower 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.540
 one does it more quickly up look 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.440
 you now at the w30 who takes this 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.300
 a bit longer 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.560
 we want you to be level 30 now 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.750
 make so I make the time now 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.170
 just in the moment they pretend small 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.170
 a bit longer 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:15.130
 My mouse is already loud as well as loud 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:22.910
 we see it is still going up nicely 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:24.560
 It feels good to be here again 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.350
 us too dark so really that 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.280
 does not work 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.200
 By the way, I can already say something 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.490
 I wanted that last episode 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.940
 I have not announced this yet 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:38.300
 made and that I link here once 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:42.530
 someone yes the guy there is so to speak 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.420
 little partner of us tutorials you 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.340
 Do a few tech tutorials yourself 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.850
 I link the now easy to talk 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.590
 above 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.330
 that you also stop by there 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.850
 he could make very nice tutorials has 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.980
 So very few has lived on 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.760
 much more also earn 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.920
 subscribers 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.940
 That's where I imagined 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.770
 let's do that 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.370
 and that's why we're going for the 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.810
 So I'm going for that now and yes 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.060
 So it would be nice if you could 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.190
 maybe drop by 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.630
 comment last or sometimes this one 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.950
 or other like or abo yes that works 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.150
 nice quick I'll do it now 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.750
 Try a bit down me 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.520
 have seen 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.100
 every step I take makes it all possible 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.410
 faster and because he has 27 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.300
 we got three efficiency yes one 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.400
 should make 30 so that's not 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.500
 that's how it works so well 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.060
 then you also mechanically what ever ago 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.220
 One always leads one again 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.280
 is rausholt brings out reintroduce 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.980
 Really nice I found you could 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.240
 the later really good use at 11 in 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.160
 maybe not the right one at the beginning 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.330
 but later you should look at the 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.000
 maybe create it maybe that makes 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.620
 even in let's play so that was all 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.950
 besides, if you like it gives me 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.360
 sorry if you still have questions you can 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:57.050
 you are welcome to pose yourself 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:00.100
 ask tutorial wishes and you can 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:02.060
 also like what I wanted for now 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.010
 could improve me if i did 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.820
 or something has forgotten so no 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:09.230
 always be and yes you can already 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.640
 be curious in the next few episodes 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.280
 come back some interesting ones 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.740
 things for example the teleporter that 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.450
 will feel again and then i would 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.870
 Just say it until next time 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.870
 bye
