00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
can't keep going on with it well is that

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.199 
can't keep going on with it well is that
possible<00:04:05.739> for<00:04:05.950> manga<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.400> would<00:04:06.640> say<00:04:06.880> no

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
possible for manga I would say no

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.180 
possible for manga I would say no
because<00:04:07.599> in<00:04:08.110> order<00:04:08.200> to<00:04:08.290> produce<00:04:08.440> a<00:04:08.650> manga<00:04:09.040> it

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
because in order to produce a manga it

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.360 
because in order to produce a manga it
doesn't<00:04:09.520> take<00:04:09.730> nearly<00:04:10.540> as<00:04:11.020> much<00:04:11.560> money<00:04:11.890> I<00:04:12.160> mean

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
doesn't take nearly as much money I mean

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.590 
doesn't take nearly as much money I mean
obviously<00:04:12.599> to<00:04:13.599> make<00:04:13.780> an<00:04:13.989> anime<00:04:14.380> it<00:04:14.880> it's<00:04:15.880> a<00:04:16.329> lot

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
obviously to make an anime it it's a lot

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.310 
obviously to make an anime it it's a lot
of<00:04:16.660> work<00:04:17.230> to<00:04:17.470> do<00:04:17.680> that<00:04:17.980> so<00:04:18.639> with<00:04:19.299> anime<00:04:20.109> and

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
of work to do that so with anime and

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.050 
of work to do that so with anime and
comparison<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.160> manga<00:04:21.549> I<00:04:21.579> would<00:04:21.760> say<00:04:21.910> the

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
comparison the manga I would say the

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.110 
comparison the manga I would say the
manga<00:04:22.480> is<00:04:22.830> not<00:04:23.830> going<00:04:24.160> to<00:04:24.250> necessarily<00:04:24.460> end

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
manga is not going to necessarily end

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.450 
manga is not going to necessarily end
and<00:04:25.480> just<00:04:25.510> gonna<00:04:25.900> like<00:04:26.169> just<00:04:26.650> go<00:04:26.889> straight<00:04:27.310> to

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
and just gonna like just go straight to

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.220 
and just gonna like just go straight to
the<00:04:27.490> rock<00:04:27.700> bottom<00:04:27.910> because<00:04:28.419> if<00:04:28.630> they<00:04:28.930> want<00:04:29.169> to

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
the rock bottom because if they want to

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.690 
the rock bottom because if they want to
keep<00:04:29.350> working<00:04:29.500> on<00:04:29.860> it<00:04:29.980> obviously<00:04:30.490> they<00:04:30.610> are

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
keep working on it obviously they are

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.610 
keep working on it obviously they are
but<00:04:31.030> for<00:04:31.150> anime<00:04:31.419> is<00:04:31.630> possible<00:04:32.139> they<00:04:32.320> could<00:04:32.500> get

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
but for anime is possible they could get

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.960 
but for anime is possible they could get
canceled<00:04:33.100> even<00:04:33.280> if<00:04:33.370> it's<00:04:33.520> not<00:04:33.610> a<00:04:33.669> financial

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
canceled even if it's not a financial

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.090 
canceled even if it's not a financial
issue<00:04:34.360> it<00:04:34.600> could<00:04:34.630> be<00:04:34.810> something<00:04:35.050> else<00:04:35.410> maybe

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
issue it could be something else maybe

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.219 
issue it could be something else maybe
something<00:04:36.580> about<00:04:36.760> the<00:04:36.880> Monica<00:04:37.090> not<00:04:37.810> wanting

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
something about the Monica not wanting

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.730 
something about the Monica not wanting
to<00:04:38.580> work<00:04:39.580> on<00:04:39.880> any<00:04:40.330> I<00:04:40.360> don't<00:04:40.510> even<00:04:40.660> think<00:04:40.810> do<00:04:41.620> the

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
to work on any I don't even think do the

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.680 
to work on any I don't even think do the
creators<00:04:42.190> even<00:04:42.430> work<00:04:42.639> on<00:04:42.760> the<00:04:42.910> episodes<00:04:43.330> I

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
creators even work on the episodes I

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.770 
creators even work on the episodes I
don't<00:04:43.990> I<00:04:44.380> wouldn't<00:04:45.280> expect<00:04:45.520> them<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:46.210> honestly

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
don't I wouldn't expect them to honestly

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.930 
don't I wouldn't expect them to honestly
I<00:04:47.139> really<00:04:47.590> wouldn't<00:04:48.280> I<00:04:48.430> mean<00:04:48.580> they<00:04:48.700> would<00:04:48.820> have

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
I really wouldn't I mean they would have

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.940 
I really wouldn't I mean they would have
a<00:04:48.970> good<00:04:49.180> whole<00:04:49.570> crew<00:04:49.930> to<00:04:50.080> do<00:04:50.229> that<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.740> whole

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
a good whole crew to do that a whole

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.370 
a good whole crew to do that a whole
animating<00:04:51.639> crew<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:52.150> they<00:04:52.600> would<00:04:52.720> just<00:04:52.900> make

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
animating crew and they would just make

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.219 
animating crew and they would just make
it<00:04:53.410> all<00:04:53.800> I<00:04:54.130> don't<00:04:54.700> think<00:04:54.880> they<00:04:55.000> would<00:04:55.240> get<00:04:55.810> too

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
it all I don't think they would get too

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.290 
it all I don't think they would get too
involved<00:04:56.770> with<00:04:57.100> that<00:04:57.250> what<00:04:57.520> they<00:04:57.700> I<00:04:58.030> mean<00:04:58.150> they

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
involved with that what they I mean they

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.710 
involved with that what they I mean they
have<00:04:58.510> a<00:04:58.540> part<00:04:58.870> in<00:04:58.990> it<00:04:59.110> but<00:04:59.320> not<00:04:59.380> wait<00:04:59.770> the<00:05:00.340> whole

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
have a part in it but not wait the whole

animation<00:05:01.889> cross<00:05:02.889> I<00:05:03.190> don't<00:05:03.340> I<00:05:03.580> don't<00:05:03.850> think<00:05:04.240> so

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
animation cross I don't I don't think so

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.610 
animation cross I don't I don't think so
at<00:05:04.479> least<00:05:04.600> but<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.020> main<00:05:05.140> point<00:05:05.350> is<00:05:05.560> that

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
at least but the main point is that

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.340 
at least but the main point is that
fairy<00:05:06.070> tale<00:05:06.190> is<00:05:06.729> coming<00:05:07.150> to<00:05:07.330> an<00:05:07.450> end<00:05:07.600> I<00:05:07.900> wish
