00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.090 
giant problem to begin with second of
all<00:01:42.329> our<00:01:42.479> way<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.780> measuring<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.409> absurd

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
all our way of measuring it is absurd

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.550 
all our way of measuring it is absurd
they<00:01:44.610> don't<00:01:44.790> take<00:01:45.030> into<00:01:45.060> account<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.930> you

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
they don't take into account the you

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.920 
they don't take into account the you
know<00:01:46.890> joke<00:01:47.250> about<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:48.210> know<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.810> with

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
know joke about you know it's it with

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.330 
know joke about you know it's it with
this<00:01:49.079> would<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> fat<00:01:49.680> letter<00:01:49.890> would<00:01:50.159> be<00:01:50.310> a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
this would be a fat letter would be a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.490 
this would be a fat letter would be a
big<00:01:50.579> bone<00:01:50.790> letter<00:01:51.090> right<00:01:51.479> yeah<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.049> know<00:01:52.259> about

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
big bone letter right yeah I know about

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.429 
big bone letter right yeah I know about
big<00:01:52.770> bones<00:01:52.979> iana<00:01:53.399> right<00:01:53.670> but<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.689> muscle

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
big bones iana right but the it muscle

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.560 
big bones iana right but the it muscle
they<00:01:56.130> don't<00:01:56.340> take<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.549> account<00:01:57.030> either<00:01:57.210> no

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
they don't take that account either no

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.370 
they don't take that account either no
residual<00:01:58.350> it's<00:01:58.649> really<00:01:59.130> unfair<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> uh<00:02:00.509> decide

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
residual it's really unfair to uh decide

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.990 
residual it's really unfair to uh decide
whether<00:02:01.619> or<00:02:01.680> not<00:02:01.740> someone's<00:02:02.130> obese<00:02:02.430> by<00:02:02.640> taking

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
whether or not someone's obese by taking

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.469 
whether or not someone's obese by taking
their<00:02:03.119> BMI<00:02:03.540> into<00:02:03.810> account<00:02:04.170> because<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:05.479> might

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
their BMI into account because you might

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.690 
their BMI into account because you might
have<00:02:06.689> more<00:02:07.079> muscle<00:02:07.500> mass<00:02:07.530> as<00:02:07.979> opposed<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.399> fat

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
have more muscle mass as opposed to fat

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.740 
have more muscle mass as opposed to fat
mass<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.450> makes<00:02:09.750> more<00:02:09.959> sense<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.410> measure

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
mass so it makes more sense to measure

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.960 
mass so it makes more sense to measure
child's<00:02:12.170> body<00:02:12.440> fat<00:02:12.770> as<00:02:13.040> opposed<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.550> just

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
child's body fat as opposed to just

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.210 
child's body fat as opposed to just
doing<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.360> simple<00:02:14.540> BMI<00:02:15.110> because<00:02:15.680> everyone's

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
doing a simple BMI because everyone's

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.160 
doing a simple BMI because everyone's
obese<00:02:16.550> if<00:02:16.730> they<00:02:16.850> do<00:02:16.910> BMI<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.870> know<00:02:17.990> what<00:02:18.110> I

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
obese if they do BMI you know what I

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
reasonable way to measure it and then

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.900 
reasonable way to measure it and then
they<00:02:45.590> have<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.860> encourage<00:02:46.459> people<00:02:46.670> in<00:02:46.850> the
