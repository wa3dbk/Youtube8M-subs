00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
some problems getting here so I'm gonna

00:00:48.909 --> 00:02:15.390 
some problems getting here so I'm gonna
get<00:00:49.089> dressed<00:00:49.299> I'm<00:00:49.629> gonna<00:00:49.780> let<00:00:49.899> it<00:00:49.930> rip

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.319 

first<00:02:16.400> practice<00:02:16.519> was<00:02:16.760> good<00:02:16.939> it<00:02:17.060> was<00:02:17.150> pretty

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
first practice was good it was pretty

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.209 
first practice was good it was pretty
deep<00:02:17.540> but<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:18.530> think<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.769> tracks<00:02:18.980> would<00:02:19.129> be

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:19.219 
deep but I think the tracks would be

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:23.500 
deep but I think the tracks would be
sick<00:02:19.400> today<00:02:21.700> it's<00:02:22.700> about<00:02:22.849> it's<00:02:23.209> gonna<00:02:23.329> be

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
sick today it's about it's gonna be

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.429 
sick today it's about it's gonna be
rough

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.770 

I<00:02:27.969> don't<00:02:28.969> know<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.150> sand<00:02:29.359> whoops<00:02:29.510> are<00:02:29.629> pretty

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
I don't know the sand whoops are pretty

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.479 
I don't know the sand whoops are pretty
tough<00:02:29.959> there<00:02:30.170> they're<00:02:30.769> deep<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.159> like<00:02:31.340> just

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
tough there they're deep and like just

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.280 
tough there they're deep and like just
real<00:02:31.639> washy<00:02:31.879> right<00:02:32.209> now<00:02:32.359> but<00:02:32.599> I<00:02:32.840> think<00:02:33.230> the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
real washy right now but I think the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
real washy right now but I think the
whole<00:02:33.379> tracks<00:02:33.650> gonna<00:02:33.799> break<00:02:33.980> in<00:02:34.129> for<00:02:34.250> the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
whole tracks gonna break in for the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.929 
whole tracks gonna break in for the
second<00:02:34.579> practice<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.030> it's<00:02:35.120> gonna<00:02:35.239> be<00:02:35.359> good

holeshot device broke on the hot lap ran
it<00:06:28.110> without<00:06:28.350> it<00:06:28.590> didn't<00:06:29.580> get<00:06:29.670> a<00:06:29.700> good<00:06:29.910> start

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
it without it didn't get a good start

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.260 
it without it didn't get a good start
like<00:06:30.540> I<00:06:30.890> worked<00:06:31.890> my<00:06:31.980> way<00:06:32.100> up<00:06:32.160> to<00:06:32.220> like<00:06:32.550> tenth

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
like I worked my way up to like tenth

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.590 
like I worked my way up to like tenth
and<00:06:33.690> then<00:06:34.460> my<00:06:35.460> bike<00:06:35.640> started<00:06:36.060> losing<00:06:36.570> power

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
and then my bike started losing power

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.240 
and then my bike started losing power
and<00:06:36.980> then<00:06:37.980> it<00:06:38.130> was<00:06:38.250> over<00:06:38.630> so<00:06:40.100> hopefully<00:06:41.100> we<00:06:41.160> got

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
and then it was over so hopefully we got

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:49.750 
and then it was over so hopefully we got
the<00:06:41.370> parts<00:06:41.580> to<00:06:41.670> fix<00:06:41.850> it<00:06:42.090> race<00:06:42.570> moto<00:06:42.810> 2

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:49.760 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.180 

I<00:06:49.790> mean<00:06:50.630> it<00:06:50.780> was<00:06:50.900> it<00:06:51.200> wasn't<00:06:51.410> bad<00:06:51.680> I<00:06:51.710> was<00:06:52.010> just

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190 
I mean it was it wasn't bad I was just

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.010 
I mean it was it wasn't bad I was just
trying<00:06:52.940> to<00:06:53.000> pass<00:06:53.150> as<00:06:53.360> fast<00:06:53.570> as<00:06:53.720> I<00:06:53.750> could<00:06:53.810> and

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
trying to pass as fast as I could and

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.460 
trying to pass as fast as I could and
then<00:06:55.270> it<00:06:56.270> started<00:06:56.630> losing<00:06:56.840> power<00:06:56.990> I<00:06:57.140> had<00:06:57.320> to

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:57.470 
then it started losing power I had to

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.050 
then it started losing power I had to
shift<00:06:57.680> into<00:06:57.860> first<00:06:58.190> in<00:06:58.370> the<00:06:58.460> corners<00:06:58.880> and

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
shift into first in the corners and

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.160 
shift into first in the corners and
stuff<00:06:59.300> and<00:06:59.510> it<00:06:59.630> was<00:06:59.660> just<00:06:59.950> no<00:07:00.950> good<00:07:01.160> so

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.170 
stuff and it was just no good so

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.830 
stuff and it was just no good so
hopefully<00:07:03.170> the<00:07:03.230> next<00:07:03.260> mode<00:07:03.530> is<00:07:03.560> better
