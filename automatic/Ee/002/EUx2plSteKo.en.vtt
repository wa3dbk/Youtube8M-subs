you<00:00:36.630> can<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:37.440> more<00:00:37.860> energy<00:00:38.239> all<00:00:39.239> no<00:00:39.600> such

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
you can have more energy all no such

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.299 
you can have more energy all no such
thing<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.230> too<00:00:40.410> much<00:00:40.590> energy<00:00:41.390> anyways<00:00:42.390> I

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
Falcons really cool in this game he

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.460 
Falcons really cool in this game he
seems<00:01:04.860> about<00:01:05.280> as<00:01:05.339> good<00:01:05.700> his<00:01:05.970> he<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:07.049> melee

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
seems about as good his he is in melee

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.070 
seems about as good his he is in melee
but<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.070> different<00:01:08.220> reasons<00:01:08.510> yeah<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.750> it's

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
but for different reasons yeah it's it's

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.840 
but for different reasons yeah it's it's
less<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.590> combo<00:01:10.920> potential<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.610> more<00:01:11.760> of

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
less of like combo potential and more of

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.030 
less of like combo potential and more of
just<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.479> actually<00:01:13.470> haven't<00:01:13.770> watched

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
just like I actually haven't watched

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.160 
just like I actually haven't watched
enough<00:01:14.310> Falcon<00:01:14.640> my<00:01:15.210> guess<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.570> probably<00:01:15.689> stage

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
enough Falcon my guess is probably stage

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.020 
enough Falcon my guess is probably stage
control<00:01:16.560> simply<00:01:17.070> because<00:01:17.189> characters<00:01:17.880> when

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
control simply because characters when

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.820 
control simply because characters when
good<00:01:18.150> mobility<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.810> game<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.409> run

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
good mobility in this game can just run

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.370 
good mobility in this game can just run
around<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.189> stage<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.670> yeah<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.689> he<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.259> do

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
around the stage and yeah so he can do

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.960 
around the stage and yeah so he can do
that<00:01:22.530> like<00:01:22.860> one<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> things<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.759> dash

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
that like one of the things the dash

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.550 
that like one of the things the dash
crab<00:01:24.240> lets<00:01:24.420> him<00:01:24.570> punish<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.900> lot<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.200> stuff<00:01:25.380> like

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560

about an even game slight lead Ford NT

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.420 
about an even game slight lead Ford NT
yeah<00:03:02.810> he's<00:03:03.139> gotta<00:03:03.349> get<00:03:03.470> bags<00:03:03.709> I'm<00:03:04.159> like<00:03:04.310> in

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
yeah he's gotta get bags I'm like in

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.309 
yeah he's gotta get bags I'm like in
past<00:03:04.549> games<00:03:04.760> Falcon<00:03:05.239> side<00:03:05.419> B<00:03:05.599> isn't<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:06.019> combo

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
past games Falcon side B isn't a combo

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.569 
past games Falcon side B isn't a combo
move<00:03:06.500> it's<00:03:06.620> actually<00:03:06.859> like<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:07.010> kill<00:03:07.250> move<00:03:07.400> now

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
move it's actually like a kill move now

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.030 
move it's actually like a kill move now
so<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.329> guess<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:08.900> could<00:03:09.019> be<00:03:09.049> a<00:03:09.139> combo<00:03:09.590> movement

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
so I guess it could be a combo movement

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.069 
so I guess it could be a combo movement
uh<00:03:10.250> it's<00:03:10.849> guy<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.239> think<00:03:11.450> it<00:03:11.540> has<00:03:11.599> too<00:03:11.780> much<00:03:11.870> base

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079

the first time so you don't know their
tech<00:04:07.729> habits<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:08.239> just<00:04:08.419> kind<00:04:08.629> of<00:04:08.689> throw<00:04:08.930> out

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
tech habits you just kind of throw out

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.780 
tech habits you just kind of throw out
something<00:04:09.319> random<00:04:09.709> in<00:04:09.769> its<00:04:09.889> list

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.620 

alright<00:04:15.790> so<00:04:16.300> I<00:04:17.100> think<00:04:18.100> typo<00:04:18.670> really<00:04:19.030> needs<00:04:19.270> to

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
alright so I think typo really needs to

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.510 
alright so I think typo really needs to
just<00:04:19.930> if<00:04:20.260> this<00:04:20.440> gym<00:04:20.620> I<00:04:20.770> mean<00:04:20.890> he<00:04:20.950> was<00:04:21.070> really

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
just if this gym I mean he was really

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.610 
just if this gym I mean he was really
good<00:04:21.700> it<00:04:22.090> would<00:04:22.240> she'll<00:04:22.510> drop<00:04:22.750> and<00:04:23.050> then<00:04:23.230> and

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
good it would she'll drop and then and

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.740 
good it would she'll drop and then and
then<00:04:23.860> break<00:04:24.040> it<00:04:24.160> sugar<00:04:24.400> oh<00:04:24.670> dude<00:04:25.090> shield

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
then break it sugar oh dude shield

rapping<00:04:26.080> is<00:04:26.200> exactly<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:26.800> same<00:04:26.920> in<00:04:27.100> melee<00:04:27.400> in

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
rapping is exactly the same in melee in

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.240 
rapping is exactly the same in melee in
this<00:04:27.670> game<00:04:28.230> it's<00:04:29.230> great<00:04:29.560> except<00:04:30.040> with<00:04:30.160> an

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
this game it's great except with an

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.730 
this game it's great except with an
analog<00:04:30.670> thingy<00:04:30.970> oh<00:04:31.210> it's<00:04:31.660> yeah<00:04:32.200> it's<00:04:32.230> kind<00:04:32.650> of

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
analog thingy oh it's yeah it's kind of

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.220 
analog thingy oh it's yeah it's kind of
I<00:04:32.890> mean<00:04:32.920> but<00:04:33.190> it's<00:04:33.340> always<00:04:33.490> hard<00:04:33.910> I<00:04:34.300> actually

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
I mean but it's always hard I actually

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.430 
I mean but it's always hard I actually
think<00:04:35.470> it's<00:04:35.590> easier<00:04:35.950> on<00:04:36.070> this<00:04:36.340> because<00:04:36.730> uh<00:04:37.440> the

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
think it's easier on this because uh the

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.590 
think it's easier on this because uh the
stick<00:04:38.740> is<00:04:38.950> smaller<00:04:39.400> so<00:04:39.550> there's<00:04:39.910> less<00:04:40.060> for<00:04:40.540> you

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
stick is smaller so there's less for you

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.410 
stick is smaller so there's less for you
to<00:04:40.720> move<00:04:41.160> our<00:04:42.160> identity<00:04:42.640> is<00:04:42.670> in<00:04:42.760> total<00:04:43.090> control

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
to move our identity is in total control

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.880 
to move our identity is in total control
right<00:04:43.780> now<00:04:43.810> but<00:04:44.080> he<00:04:44.140> has<00:04:44.230> not<00:04:44.380> done<00:04:44.590> that<00:04:44.650> much
