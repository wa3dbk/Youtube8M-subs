00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
into the mine cart somehow basically all

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.210 
into the mine cart somehow basically all
other<00:01:11.490> mugs<00:01:11.820> just<00:01:12.619> hitting<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.650> edge<00:01:13.920> and

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
flames and my texture pack to try some

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.150 
flames and my texture pack to try some
things<00:01:45.650> out<00:01:46.070> to<00:01:46.370> the<00:01:46.520> frame<00:01:46.820> rate<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.650> I<00:01:48.650> came

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
things out to the frame rate and I came

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.600 
things out to the frame rate and I came
to<00:01:49.370> a<00:01:49.400> conclusion<00:01:50.410> basically<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:52.400> mob

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
to a conclusion basically the mob

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.440 
to a conclusion basically the mob
Kenneth<00:01:53.650> with<00:01:54.650> my<00:01:54.800> setup<00:01:55.100> right<00:01:55.430> now<00:01:55.670> is<00:01:55.940> not

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
Kenneth with my setup right now is not

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.480 
Kenneth with my setup right now is not
interfering<00:01:57.110> with<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.350> frame<00:01:57.590> rate<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:58.220> much

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
interfering with the frame rate so much

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.480 
interfering with the frame rate so much
it's<00:01:59.300> not<00:01:59.479> it's<00:01:59.930> not<00:02:00.080> that<00:02:00.350> bad<00:02:00.560> it's<00:02:00.860> it's<00:02:01.100> you

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
it's not it's not that bad it's it's you

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.780 
it's not it's not that bad it's it's you
know<00:02:01.640> you<00:02:01.700> can<00:02:02.090> live<00:02:02.570> with<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.810> but<00:02:03.790> the

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
know you can live with it but the

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.749 
know you can live with it but the
blinking<00:02:05.450> thing<00:02:06.190> that<00:02:07.190> was<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.520> thing<00:02:07.700> that

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
blinking thing that was the thing that

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.190 
blinking thing that was the thing that
really<00:02:08.090> destroyed<00:02:08.630> my<00:02:09.790> framerate<00:02:10.790> so<00:02:11.360> there

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
really destroyed my framerate so there

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.770 
really destroyed my framerate so there
might<00:02:12.500> I<00:02:12.770> don't<00:02:13.010> know<00:02:13.100> if<00:02:13.280> it's<00:02:13.400> confirmed<00:02:13.880> but

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
might I don't know if it's confirmed but

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.729 
might I don't know if it's confirmed but
it<00:02:15.110> seems<00:02:15.440> that<00:02:15.860> all<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.200> redstone<00:02:18.200> repeaters

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
it seems that all the redstone repeaters

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.420 
it seems that all the redstone repeaters
and<00:02:18.770> sing<00:02:19.430> Specter<00:02:20.000> really<00:02:20.510> like<00:02:20.750> my<00:02:20.959> game

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
and sing Specter really like my game

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.270 
and sing Specter really like my game
maybe<00:02:22.430> there's<00:02:22.700> some<00:02:22.940> I<00:02:23.739> don't<00:02:24.739> know<00:02:24.830> wrong

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
maybe there's some I don't know wrong

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.979 
maybe there's some I don't know wrong
implementation<00:02:26.180> maybe<00:02:26.390> it<00:02:26.570> needs<00:02:26.780> some

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
implementation maybe it needs some

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.900 
implementation maybe it needs some
tweaking<00:02:27.260> or<00:02:27.560> whatnot<00:02:27.770> I<00:02:28.130> don't<00:02:28.310> know<00:02:28.400> just

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
tweaking or whatnot I don't know just

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.449 
tweaking or whatnot I don't know just
just<00:02:29.209> a<00:02:29.360> theory<00:02:29.840> but<00:02:30.970> yeah<00:02:32.769> because<00:02:33.769> of<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.250> I

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
just a theory but yeah because of that I

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.850 
just a theory but yeah because of that I
changed<00:02:34.940> a<00:02:35.330> little<00:02:35.630> bit<00:02:37.180> down<00:02:38.180> there<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.860> I

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
changed a little bit down there and I

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.479 
changed a little bit down there and I
thought<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.489> am<00:02:40.670> my<00:02:41.150> editor<00:02:42.100> override<00:02:43.100> for<00:02:43.430> the

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
thought I am my editor override for the

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.590 
thought I am my editor override for the
blinking<00:02:43.730> light<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:45.880> yeah<00:02:46.880> I<00:02:46.910> chopped<00:02:47.390> off

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
blinking light and yeah I chopped off

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.930 
blinking light and yeah I chopped off
all<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.019> other<00:02:48.220> torches<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:49.459> didn't<00:02:49.790> help

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
all the other torches that didn't help

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.490 
all the other torches that didn't help
so<00:02:50.739> yeah<00:02:51.739> I<00:02:51.980> narrowed<00:02:52.370> it<00:02:52.370> down<00:02:52.549> to<00:02:52.790> the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
so yeah I narrowed it down to the

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.740 
so yeah I narrowed it down to the
repeaters<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.890> repeaters<00:02:55.430> really<00:02:56.299> do<00:02:56.480> like

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
repeaters the repeaters really do like

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.199 
repeaters the repeaters really do like
my<00:02:56.959> game<00:02:57.340> so<00:02:58.340> right<00:02:58.549> now<00:02:58.580> it's<00:02:58.880> in<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.060> different

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
my game so right now it's in a different

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.449 
my game so right now it's in a different
configuration<00:02:59.630> as<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:00.709> can<00:03:00.890> see<00:03:01.040> only<00:03:01.220> the

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
configuration as you can see only the

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.030 
configuration as you can see only the
middle<00:03:01.790> light<00:03:02.030> is<00:03:02.239> blinking<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.930> whenever<00:03:03.739> a

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
middle light is blinking and whenever a

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.850 
middle light is blinking and whenever a
new<00:03:04.160> mop<00:03:04.610> enters<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.209> system<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:06.170> show<00:03:06.350> starts

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
new mop enters the system to show starts

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.680 
new mop enters the system to show starts
for<00:03:07.130> two<00:03:07.400> seconds<00:03:07.850> or<00:03:08.000> something<00:03:08.390> then<00:03:08.570> it

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
for two seconds or something then it

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.949 
for two seconds or something then it
stops<00:03:08.989> again<00:03:09.140> so<00:03:10.070> that's<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.120> compromise<00:03:11.330> I'm

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
stops again so that's the compromise I'm

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.190 
stops again so that's the compromise I'm
having<00:03:12.500> or<00:03:13.160> not<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:13.640> too<00:03:14.299> much<00:03:14.450> leg<00:03:14.780> because

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
having or not and too much leg because

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.170 
having or not and too much leg because
yeah<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.799> don't<00:03:16.100> want<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.489> destroy<00:03:16.820> all<00:03:17.030> the

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
yeah I don't want to destroy all the

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.310 
yeah I don't want to destroy all the
redstone<00:03:17.660> vector<00:03:18.110> it<00:03:18.230> was<00:03:18.410> a<00:03:19.390> painting<00:03:20.390> yes<00:03:20.690> so

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320
