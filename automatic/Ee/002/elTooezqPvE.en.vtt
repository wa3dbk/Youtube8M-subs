00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
one to two points to make sure that we

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.490 
one to two points to make sure that we
make<00:04:29.370> it<00:04:29.490> out<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.760> group<00:04:30.000> stage<00:04:30.270> so<00:04:30.630> hopefully

we pick up at least one more win losing
to<00:04:33.690> Olympiakos<00:04:34.320> is<00:04:34.410> probably<00:04:34.740> not<00:04:34.980> a<00:04:35.010> good

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
to Olympiakos is probably not a good

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.980 
to Olympiakos is probably not a good
thing<00:04:35.520> but<00:04:35.700> it<00:04:35.820> wasn't<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.150> terrible<00:04:36.540> thing<00:04:36.750> as

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
thing but it wasn't a terrible thing as

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.870 
thing but it wasn't a terrible thing as
you<00:04:37.500> can<00:04:37.680> see<00:04:37.830> here<00:04:38.100> if<00:04:38.160> we<00:04:38.370> win<00:04:38.610> this<00:04:38.820> game

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
you can see here if we win this game

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.970 
you can see here if we win this game
because<00:04:39.450> we're<00:04:39.630> game<00:04:39.840> behind<00:04:40.170> everybody<00:04:40.560> if

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980
