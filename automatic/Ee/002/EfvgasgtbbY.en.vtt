little map here just a very tiny little
map<00:02:46.849> like<00:02:47.849> I<00:02:47.879> said<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.420> very<00:02:48.810> rare<00:02:49.110> spawn

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500

map like I said it's a very rare spawn
but<00:02:50.250> it's<00:02:50.940> definitely<00:02:51.120> worth<00:02:51.450> doing<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:52.370> what

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
but it's definitely worth doing so what

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.490 
but it's definitely worth doing so what
you<00:02:53.430> can<00:02:53.550> do<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.910> once<00:02:54.390> you've<00:02:54.540> got<00:02:54.569> this<00:02:54.810> NPC

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
you can do is once you've got this NPC

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.839 
you can do is once you've got this NPC
up<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.129> think<00:02:56.730> EPC<00:02:57.000> spawns<00:02:57.540> here<00:02:57.659> or<00:02:58.610> here<00:02:59.610> no

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
up I think EPC spawns here or here no

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.869 
up I think EPC spawns here or here no
map<00:03:00.150> here<00:03:00.420> unfortunately<00:03:01.430> it's<00:03:02.430> not<00:03:02.550> come<00:03:02.790> up

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
map here unfortunately it's not come up

on<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.120> particular<00:03:03.300> run<00:03:03.840> but<00:03:04.500> hey<00:03:04.650> guys<00:03:04.830> it's

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
on this particular run but hey guys it's

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.399 
on this particular run but hey guys it's
really<00:03:06.120> worth<00:03:06.269> doing<00:03:06.629> because<00:03:06.720> what<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.379> can

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
really worth doing because what you can

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.410 
really worth doing because what you can
do<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:07.920> when<00:03:08.519> you<00:03:08.610> buy<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.790> plan<00:03:09.060> off<00:03:09.209> them

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
do is when you buy the plan off them

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.869 
do is when you buy the plan off them
every<00:03:09.959> 10<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.319> 15<00:03:10.620> minutes<00:03:11.159> you<00:03:11.340> will<00:03:11.400> generate

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
every 10 to 15 minutes you will generate

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.460 
every 10 to 15 minutes you will generate
another<00:03:12.180> plan<00:03:12.569> on<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:12.989> have<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.110> legendary

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.190 
another plan on it and have a legendary
plan<00:03:13.769> so<00:03:14.489> it's<00:03:14.849> very<00:03:15.030> very<00:03:15.480> hard<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.930> get<00:03:16.080> him

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
plan so it's very very hard to get him

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.199 
plan so it's very very hard to get him
to<00:03:16.230> spawn<00:03:16.769> but<00:03:17.010> if<00:03:17.099> you<00:03:17.190> do<00:03:17.400> just<00:03:17.760> keep<00:03:17.849> them<00:03:18.090> in

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
though it's a very very rare spawn but

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.930 
though it's a very very rare spawn but

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
you do manage to get me the game we

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.809 
you do manage to get me the game we
could<00:03:33.030> just<00:03:33.180> farm<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.480> hell<00:03:33.659> out<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:33.780> them<00:03:34.019> and

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
could just farm the hell out of them and

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.580 
could just farm the hell out of them and
get<00:03:35.819> all<00:03:35.909> those<00:03:36.030> patterns<00:03:36.629> done<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.379> get<00:03:37.470> them

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
get all those patterns done and get them

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.350 
get all those patterns done and get them
out<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.739> way<00:03:37.860> so<00:03:37.890> then<00:03:38.340> dropping<00:03:38.610> instead<00:03:39.269> of
