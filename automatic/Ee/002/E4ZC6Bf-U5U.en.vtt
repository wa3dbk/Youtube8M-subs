00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 Well, we hello everyone 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.460
 tutorial and today we find ourselves 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.899
 for a little video today I 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.599
 will show some secrets on google 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.710
 I know it has already been done but 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.710
 this is actually I do not care a little bit 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.949
 so that's the already the answer of 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.619
 life according to google 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.900
 that's equal to 42 then in my opinion and 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.670
 a few small ones and snacks for for 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.070
 find that but of course it's 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.420
 pretty phony it's a little joke all 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.700
 so just the second the second 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.610
 list rule necessarily you typed do 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.030
 a barrel roll on google the dough goes 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.950
 to make a 360 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.449
 so here it was the second one 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.960
 third little trick is that you 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:59.340
 go and type dr grrrr on your 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.469
 google browser is simply 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.470
 little round google will come 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.799
 eat your research and in the end it's fine 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.430
 to write 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.260
 gg once they have eaten all your 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.260
 stuff the goal of a success 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.219
 the third is a code 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.789
 when you hit him in the bar 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:27.729
 research will model an egg from 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.600
 easter it's funny because in this 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.100
 moment i'm showing you 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.719
 extracts rule ie an egg 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.000
 easter or more commonly things 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.130
 hidden 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.780
 so that's pretty funny and 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.000
 third thing it's tilt all 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.090
 I just showed you when you 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.579
 go tap tilt up the page will get 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.240
 is it going to shift you are simply 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:51.729
 so that's it for this 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.159
