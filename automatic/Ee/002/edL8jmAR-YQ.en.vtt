that's here 20 percent actually the
second<00:04:40.610> box<00:04:40.759> yielded<00:04:41.300> more<00:04:41.449> copper<00:04:41.960> which

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
second box yielded more copper which

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.909

so I had one box that was a little lean
the<00:05:10.820> second<00:05:11.210> box<00:05:11.360> a<00:05:11.720> little<00:05:11.900> bit<00:05:12.020> more<00:05:12.229> richer

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
the second box a little bit more richer

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.409 
the second box a little bit more richer
and<00:05:12.680> copper<00:05:13.099> but<00:05:13.400> you<00:05:13.639> know<00:05:13.759> I'll<00:05:14.000> wrap<00:05:14.240> this

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
and copper but you know I'll wrap this

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.150 
and copper but you know I'll wrap this
up<00:05:14.630> once<00:05:14.960> I<00:05:15.080> get<00:05:15.229> to<00:05:15.259> about<00:05:15.380> a<00:05:15.590> hundred<00:05:15.770> dollars

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
up once I get to about a hundred dollars

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.029 
up once I get to about a hundred dollars
face<00:05:16.460> I'll<00:05:16.729> turn<00:05:16.970> and<00:05:17.150> flip<00:05:17.360> it<00:05:17.419> and<00:05:17.949> you<00:05:18.949> know

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
face I'll turn and flip it and you know

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:20.860 
face I'll turn and flip it and you know
makes<00:05:19.280> seventy-five<00:05:19.759> hundred<00:05:20.030> bucks<00:05:20.360> in<00:05:20.690> the

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
makes seventy-five hundred bucks in the

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.640 
makes seventy-five hundred bucks in the
process<00:05:21.340> so<00:05:22.340> that<00:05:22.370> is<00:05:22.940> how<00:05:23.570> I<00:05:23.599> go<00:05:24.289> through<00:05:24.319> a

process so that is how I go through a

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.469 
process so that is how I go through a
box<00:05:25.099> of<00:05:25.460> cents

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479

videos<00:05:56.750> it<00:05:57.259> didn't<00:05:57.889> quite<00:05:57.979> work<00:05:58.280> out<00:05:58.490> the<00:05:58.669> way

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
videos it didn't quite work out the way

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.450 
videos it didn't quite work out the way
I<00:05:59.139> anticipated<00:06:00.139> only<00:06:00.740> because<00:06:01.159> I<00:06:02.949> I<00:06:03.949> couldn't

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
I anticipated only because I I couldn't

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.550 
I anticipated only because I I couldn't
keep<00:06:04.550> track<00:06:04.610> of<00:06:05.060> the<00:06:05.150> time<00:06:05.360> on<00:06:05.719> the<00:06:05.990> video<00:06:06.259> and

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
keep track of the time on the video and

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.770 
keep track of the time on the video and
I<00:06:06.680> ended<00:06:06.889> up<00:06:06.949> going<00:06:07.099> the<00:06:07.430> last<00:06:07.849> video<00:06:08.270> the<00:06:08.539> part

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
I ended up going the last video the part

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.969 
I ended up going the last video the part
two<00:06:09.080> ended<00:06:10.009> up<00:06:10.159> going<00:06:10.330> 25<00:06:11.330> minutes<00:06:11.750> so<00:06:12.620> I<00:06:12.650> was

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
two ended up going 25 minutes so I was

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:16.029 
two ended up going 25 minutes so I was
forced<00:06:13.039> to<00:06:13.460> split<00:06:13.849> it<00:06:13.940> in<00:06:14.090> half<00:06:14.120> which<00:06:15.110> kind<00:06:15.979> of

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
forced to split it in half which kind of

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.980 
forced to split it in half which kind of
sucked<00:06:16.340> because<00:06:16.669> you<00:06:17.210> know<00:06:17.360> when<00:06:17.750> you<00:06:17.840> watch

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
sucked because you know when you watch

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.899 
sucked because you know when you watch
the<00:06:18.229> videos<00:06:18.560> you're<00:06:18.889> probably<00:06:19.310> wondering<00:06:19.759> why

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:19.909 
the videos you're probably wondering why

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:22.420 
the videos you're probably wondering why
why<00:06:20.240> did<00:06:20.449> it<00:06:20.570> stop<00:06:20.840> where<00:06:21.080> it<00:06:21.199> did<00:06:21.380> and<00:06:21.650> then

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
why did it stop where it did and then

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.459 
why did it stop where it did and then
the<00:06:22.759> continuation<00:06:23.240> yeah<00:06:23.900> it<00:06:24.169> was<00:06:24.289> just

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:24.469 
the continuation yeah it was just

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:28.300 
the continuation yeah it was just
awkward<00:06:25.270> so<00:06:26.270> next<00:06:26.900> time<00:06:27.199> I'll<00:06:27.650> make<00:06:27.830> sure<00:06:28.070> that

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
awkward so next time I'll make sure that

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.659 
awkward so next time I'll make sure that
I<00:06:28.370> keep<00:06:29.090> better<00:06:29.360> track<00:06:29.630> of<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:29.990> time<00:06:30.229> and<00:06:30.770> yeah

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
I keep better track of the time and yeah

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.300 
I keep better track of the time and yeah
