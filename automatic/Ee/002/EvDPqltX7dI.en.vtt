00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
really won't have much of a problem

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.590 
really won't have much of a problem
especially<00:00:37.469> if<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.980> do<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.160> slowly<00:00:38.579> but<00:00:39.510> if

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
especially if you do it slowly but if

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.490

some leverages you will lose some

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.760 
some leverages you will lose some
strength<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:48.030> some<00:00:48.420> sort<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.809> lift<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.649> may

will be down slightly and there's really

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.700 
will be down slightly and there's really
not<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.860> great<00:01:05.129> way<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.460> avoid<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.710> dieting

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710
