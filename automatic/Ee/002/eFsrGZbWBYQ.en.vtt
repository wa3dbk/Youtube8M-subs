00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.339 

just<00:00:14.500> finish<00:00:15.630> using<00:00:17.340> lock<00:00:18.340> sound<00:00:19.349> micro

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
just finish using lock sound micro

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.730 
just finish using lock sound micro
actually<00:00:21.160> like<00:00:21.369> sound<00:00:21.670> select<00:00:22.330> micro<00:00:22.990> which

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
actually like sound select micro which

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.990 
actually like sound select micro which
is<00:00:23.980> newer<00:00:24.369> decoder<00:00:24.939> for<00:00:25.330> me<00:00:25.570> I<00:00:26.669> thought<00:00:27.669> for

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
is newer decoder for me I thought for

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.689 
is newer decoder for me I thought for
each<00:00:28.390> show<00:00:28.750> but<00:00:29.020> they<00:00:29.259> were<00:00:29.320> just<00:00:30.279> the<00:00:30.550> regular

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
each show but they were just the regular

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.470 
each show but they were just the regular
like<00:00:31.090> sound<00:00:31.390> select<00:00:31.840> this<00:00:32.590> one<00:00:32.650> is<00:00:33.480> much

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
like sound select this one is much

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.299 
like sound select this one is much
thinner<00:00:34.840> and<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:37.030> did<00:00:37.540> new<00:00:37.780> approach<00:00:38.260> and<00:00:39.100> I'll

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
thinner and I did new approach and I'll

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.660 
thinner and I did new approach and I'll
tell<00:00:39.550> you<00:00:39.670> about<00:00:39.760> it<00:00:40.680> real<00:00:41.680> quick

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
tell you about it real quick

tell you about it real quick
so<00:00:43.150> that's<00:00:43.420> gorgeous<00:00:44.710> B&amp;O<00:00:45.190> locomotive<00:00:46.200> sw9

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
so that's gorgeous B&amp;O locomotive sw9

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.479 
so that's gorgeous B&amp;O locomotive sw9
switcher<00:00:47.800> and<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:49.300> put<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:50.289> correct<00:00:50.829> sound<00:00:51.100> on

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
switcher and I put the correct sound on

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.040 
switcher and I put the correct sound on
it<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:51.910> it<00:00:52.059> looks<00:00:52.390> great

it and it looks great

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.430 
it and it looks great
we'll<00:00:53.739> run<00:00:54.070> it<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.690> I'll<00:00:55.690> tell<00:00:56.079> you<00:00:56.230> more

it out a little bit later I just want to
show<00:01:21.960> how<00:01:22.229> nice<00:01:22.710> engine<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.579> looking<00:01:24.149> and<00:01:25.110> I'm

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.160 
show how nice engine is looking and I'm
going<00:01:26.429> to<00:01:26.670> run<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.770> with<00:01:29.569> my<00:01:30.569> lamps<00:01:31.140> set<00:01:31.860> 0r1

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170

again telling me telling the decoder

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.889 
again telling me telling the decoder
what<00:01:54.929> to<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.549> okay<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.209> coder<00:01:57.450> if<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.720> has

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
what to do okay and the coder if it has

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.779 
what to do okay and the coder if it has
the<00:01:58.079> feature<00:01:58.349> supported<00:01:58.979> all<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.189> decoders

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
the feature supported all the decoders

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.300 
the feature supported all the decoders
for<00:02:00.000> example<00:02:00.450> supporting<00:02:01.200> only<00:02:01.409> 28<00:02:02.009> speed

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
for example supporting only 28 speed

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.179 
for example supporting only 28 speed
step<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.849> you're<00:02:03.390> selecting<00:02:03.869> 128<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.920> just

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
step so you're selecting 128 a you just

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.029 
step so you're selecting 128 a you just
can<00:02:05.369> run<00:02:05.640> at<00:02:06.229> 128<00:02:07.229> but<00:02:08.209> I'm<00:02:09.209> running<00:02:09.690> at<00:02:10.200> step

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
can run at 128 but I'm running at step

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.580 
can run at 128 but I'm running at step
one<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:12.030> takes<00:02:12.829> you<00:02:13.829> few<00:02:14.430> minutes<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:15.090> run

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
one and it takes you few minutes to run

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.390 
one and it takes you few minutes to run
just

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:38.729 

please<00:02:23.400> sound

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.649 

it's<00:02:39.739> running<00:02:40.189> engine<00:02:40.819> and<00:02:40.970> running<00:02:41.360> running

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
it's running engine and running running

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.929 
it's running engine and running running
but<00:02:42.049> is<00:02:42.530> running<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:43.010> other<00:02:43.189> without<00:02:43.310> I'll

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
but is running the other without I'll

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:44.770 
but is running the other without I'll
get<00:02:44.360> there

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
get there

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:53.759 
get there
couple<00:02:45.200> couple<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.860> sound<00:02:49.720> it's<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:50.930> nice

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:09.809 

yeah<00:02:54.769> there<00:02:54.950> is<00:02:55.069> some<00:02:55.280> days<00:02:56.200> talking

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.180 

okay<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:11.349> can<00:03:11.560> close

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
okay you can close

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.150 
okay you can close
so<00:03:13.790> this<00:03:14.030> time<00:03:14.300> took<00:03:15.080> me<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.260> while<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.830> use

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
so this time took me a while I use

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.340 
so this time took me a while I use
different<00:03:16.400> technique<00:03:17.030> I<00:03:17.210> didn't<00:03:17.630> cut<00:03:17.930> in

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
different technique I didn't cut in

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.150 
different technique I didn't cut in
weight<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:20.180> original<00:03:20.780> weight<00:03:21.140> in<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.650> engine

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
weight the original weight in the engine

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.270 
weight the original weight in the engine
is<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:23.540> same<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.170> that<00:03:24.400> is<00:03:25.400> great<00:03:26.260> news

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
is the same and that is great news

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.480 
is the same and that is great news
because<00:03:28.900> extra<00:03:29.900> weight<00:03:30.140> engine<00:03:30.830> is<00:03:30.950> so<00:03:31.190> small

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
because extra weight engine is so small

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.020 
because extra weight engine is so small
and<00:03:31.730> extra<00:03:32.060> weight<00:03:32.330> is<00:03:32.600> critical<00:03:34.030> not

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
and extra weight is critical not

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.360 
and extra weight is critical not

original<00:03:38.060> weight<00:03:38.600> is<00:03:38.810> very<00:03:39.140> good<00:03:41.980> extra

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
original weight is very good extra

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.910 
original weight is very good extra
weight<00:03:43.250> will<00:03:45.190> affect<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:47.360> amount<00:03:47.450> of<00:03:47.840> cars<00:03:48.320> it

weight will affect the amount of cars it

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.170

pointing down I'm very happy about this
installation<00:05:16.280> and<00:05:16.700> this<00:05:17.300> engine<00:05:18.200> is<00:05:18.320> very

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
installation and this engine is very

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.460 
installation and this engine is very
rare<00:05:18.890> it's<00:05:19.190> actually<00:05:19.580> written<00:05:19.730> in<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:20.150> box

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
rare it's actually written in the box

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.880 
rare it's actually written in the box
yeah<00:05:21.470> it's<00:05:21.740> I<00:05:22.100> wish<00:05:23.060> I<00:05:23.210> can<00:05:23.270> look<00:05:24.170> at<00:05:24.410> the<00:05:24.590> shell

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
yeah it's I wish I can look at the shell

yeah it's I wish I can look at the shell
some<00:05:25.250> days<00:05:25.520> maybe<00:05:26.450> bill<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:27.230> get<00:05:27.410> because<00:05:27.740> if

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
some days maybe bill to get because if

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.250 
some days maybe bill to get because if
it<00:05:28.130> was<00:05:28.340> it<00:05:28.610> was<00:05:29.000> brand-new<00:05:29.420> condition<00:05:32.140> if<00:05:33.140> the

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
it was it was brand-new condition if the

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.460 
it was it was brand-new condition if the
waters<00:05:33.860> maybe<00:05:34.420> rerun<00:05:35.420> them<00:05:35.630> someday<00:05:36.170> but

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:45.870 

count<00:05:39.470> on<00:05:39.710> this<00:05:39.950> kind<00:05:40.340> of<00:05:42.670> very<00:05:44.800> questionable

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
count on this kind of very questionable

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.990 
count on this kind of very questionable
so<00:05:46.880> better<00:05:47.210> just<00:05:47.800> look<00:05:48.800> at<00:05:49.010> it<00:05:49.130> great<00:05:49.550> engine

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
so better just look at it great engine

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.690 
so better just look at it great engine
