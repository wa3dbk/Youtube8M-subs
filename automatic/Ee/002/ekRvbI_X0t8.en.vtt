thunder wave and nuzzle or whatever so
it's<00:01:04.769> great<00:01:04.890> which<00:01:05.400> means<00:01:05.640> his<00:01:05.880> speed<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.540> be

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
it's great which means his speed can be

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.120 
it's great which means his speed can be
cut<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:06.990> since<00:01:07.200> app<00:01:07.350> tells<00:01:07.500> already<00:01:07.860> use<00:01:07.950> fast

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
next we can see the Team Aqua and team

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.729 
next we can see the Team Aqua and team
magma<00:03:58.159> have<00:03:59.030> sort<00:03:59.719> of<00:03:59.750> like<00:03:59.900> a<00:03:59.959> new<00:04:00.169> redesign

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:07.009 
yourself team magma is looking uh pretty

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.949 
yourself team magma is looking uh pretty
nice<00:04:07.189> but<00:04:07.579> a<00:04:07.639> team<00:04:07.939> aqua<00:04:08.239> probably<00:04:08.629> has<00:04:08.780> the

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
nice but a team aqua probably has the

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.529 
nice but a team aqua probably has the
biggest<00:04:09.259> change<00:04:09.799> like<00:04:10.310> overall<00:04:10.819> but<00:04:11.090> I<00:04:11.269> mean

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:11.539

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
moving software the restore just they

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:20.920 
moving software the restore just they
were<00:04:19.159> just<00:04:19.280> push<00:04:19.519> overs<00:04:19.880> and<00:04:20.120> I<00:04:20.329> didn't<00:04:20.900> really

were just push overs and I didn't really
care<00:04:21.469> for<00:04:21.529> them<00:04:21.799> at<00:04:21.919> all<00:04:22.099> that<00:04:22.370> they<00:04:22.610> weren't

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
care for them at all that they weren't

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.820 
care for them at all that they weren't
rememberable<00:04:23.360> so<00:04:23.599> hopefully<00:04:23.870> this<00:04:24.020> games<00:04:24.260> the

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
rememberable so hopefully this games the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.210

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
really glad mega evolutions stuck around

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.700 
really glad mega evolutions stuck around
because<00:04:56.850> I<00:04:57.000> mean<00:04:57.120> I<00:04:57.330> was<00:04:58.020> hard<00:04:58.200> I'm<00:04:58.440> sort<00:04:58.650> of

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
because I mean I was hard I'm sort of

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.380 
because I mean I was hard I'm sort of
skeptical<00:04:59.310> that<00:04:59.520> they<00:04:59.640> would<00:04:59.880> include<00:05:00.180> mega

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
skeptical that they would include mega

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.620 
skeptical that they would include mega
evolution<00:05:00.840> or<00:05:00.960> they<00:05:01.140> would<00:05:02.000> because<00:05:03.000> if<00:05:03.480> you

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
evolution or they would because if you

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.080 
evolution or they would because if you
know<00:05:03.810> is<00:05:04.020> I<00:05:04.260> think<00:05:04.380> Cohen<00:05:04.860> and<00:05:05.040> canto<00:05:05.700> have<00:05:05.910> the

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
know is I think Cohen and canto have the

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.140 
know is I think Cohen and canto have the
most<00:05:06.330> mega<00:05:06.690> evolutions<00:05:07.550> from<00:05:08.550> like<00:05:08.730> the<00:05:08.940> games

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
most mega evolutions from like the games

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.510 
most mega evolutions from like the games
like<00:05:09.450> x<00:05:10.410> and<00:05:10.560> y<00:05:10.620> of<00:05:10.740> course<00:05:10.770> like<00:05:11.190> they<00:05:11.280> haven't
