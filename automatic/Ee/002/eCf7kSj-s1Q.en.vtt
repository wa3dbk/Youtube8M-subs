00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.410
 hi girls like with this again 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.240
 is a new video today 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.330
 today I present to you a new video about mine 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.889
 creations are my latest creations there 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.840
 it will surely be something new 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.830
 that something they rearranged me 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.170
 and as always I show you then 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.270
 certainly we begin with new things 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.820
 one of the new things I did and 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.880
 this water necklace that as you see 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.680
 very grateful I know but unfortunately not there 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.739
 I can do anything I like very much 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.979
 things very large necklaces and try to 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.620
 always doing a little bit absurd 

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:43.409
 because in any case I am really a 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.050
 however, it is too large 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:48.600
 here I did with this braid a 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.879
 of natural stones as well as the cat 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.409
 blue then of the blue course and course 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.350
 heavenly then the crystalline ones of these 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.269
 here and there are both large and large dishes 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.359
 small svarowski grandchildren I put 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:06.659
 rill and blues and from this side instead 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.960
 I made this crochet work 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.580
 with these flowers some ring and then 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.150
 as you can see I have also put these 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.220
 crystals here one big and one small e 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.320
 these are svarowsky svarowsky here 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.030
 original and also the crystal and all 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.480
 how many around are always svarowsky 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.960
 these are the first here too 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.060
 column as always I repeat already you know 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.280
 where to find me on my facebook page 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.100

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.620
 minimum understand the snail 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.620
 hotmail.it or keep sidereal from whom 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.380
 at dinner gmail.com which would be the email 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.570
 of this channel 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.090
 another new thing I created and 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.920
 this necklace which is very simple 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:55.159
 very light but very beautiful and this is it 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.159
 here 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.820
 as you can see, it's all done in 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.820
 aluminum in this aluminum chain 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.780
 here it is then I did this 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.810
 sort of crochet rings always on 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.870
 which I called swarovski 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.360
 Brown 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.360
 instead dark rino instead a little more 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.390
 clear is brown again and is 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.909
 really very elegant in my opinion 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.470
 beautiful and very light and very much 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:37.079
 then this light chain is light 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:40.319
 really beautiful can also what 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:43.409
 still that I've always created a thing 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.620
 very big and I know it unfortunately 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:49.140
 like these things so great and 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:55.799
 this necklace I made in crochet 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:57.260
 and then embroidered it all by hand a 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:02.400
 koran is this one 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.470
 as you can see it is really very elegant 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.790
 I put these pearls here for a while 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.879
 more than light because it is a bit over anyway 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.299
 brownish bronze let's say around or 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:19.049
 embroidered of the stones that are in 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:21.180
 carnelian then all these 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:25.709
 outline some see bright are 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:28.319
 crushed crystals and nothing this is 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:32.819
 the effect for actually opening up 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:36.540
 stupendous I really like it so much then 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.579
 still behind the hair 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.669
 another column a little simpler and 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:45.109
 much longer is this here that I have 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:49.709
 made in fluorite and swarovski crystals 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:53.609
 gray I wear this I like because yes 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.109
 can wear both summer and winter 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:04:00.989
 how you see this embroidered these 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:06.599
 platelets with a green and colored stone 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:09.120
 then with a natural berlin in the middle and 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:13.040
 the final effect here is a lot 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.040
 delicate and very nice 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.150
 then another thing I created that though 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:24.599
 it's not a necklace but earrings 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:27.479
 these are these and they are very nice 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:29.460
 I think this is the effect close to 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.860
 face then are her beautiful hair 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.500
 dark ones are all made in 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.479
 crystals and then committed also in the barrier 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:42.270
 ski with this little ball that goes 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:45.060
 directly to the lobe a little then hanging 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.150
 other things that I did because of me 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.979
 they have ordered 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:54.289
 these are the things I am doing here first 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:59.270
 see this necklace which is very large 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.270
 and it is made entirely in crochet 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.570
 and this is how you see it really is 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.090
 they are all beautiful flowers 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.070
 made crochet on which I have then 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.039
 proceeds of swarovski crystals for 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:20.210
 natural crystals and how you have a lot 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:20.210
 particular and certainly very light 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.260
 then another column of Milan 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.590
 ordered this is the fullest of 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.570
 natural stones and crystals really is 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:36.990
 stupendous one of my favorites 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:41.490
 or do you prefer to try and use it? 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:44.450
 you have just any snack 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.450
 much more elegant 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:51.900
 then another yet much series 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:57.539
 more simple and this is proved that 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:06:02.219
 you saw in some videos ago me 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:06.360
 I call to place an order anyway 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:12.000
 made entirely of aluminum and brass 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:15.120
 with natural color quartz stones 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.800
 heavenly and then of the Apulians and this is it 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:23.099
 here it's all silvery and a lot 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.590
 simple but very elegant even this 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:28.550
 and then finally another column always 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.550
 very big 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:38.469
 this one made with these flowers 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:41.770
 really beautiful and this is a thread 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:44.409
 of natural fluorite stone that as of already 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.569
 I told you a very precious stone 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:50.800
 and then these two strips here that are 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:55.240
 made of crystals we only see mass 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:57.939
 well this is the final effect with 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:04.840
 these flowers so next do the 

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:11.319
 son of brass and very pretty flowers 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:13.000
 these too are made of crystal and 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:14.740
 nothing even this very flashy 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.569
 like almost all the ones you've seen 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.009
