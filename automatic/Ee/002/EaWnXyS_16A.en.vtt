00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.950 
let you decide over here we have like
this<00:01:29.039> giant<00:01:29.520> water<00:01:29.969> mill<00:01:30.240> area<00:01:30.450> basically

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
this giant water mill area basically

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.190 
this giant water mill area basically
it's<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.530> starts<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.100> right<00:01:32.479> here<00:01:33.479> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
it's like starts like right here and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.910 
it's like starts like right here and
goes<00:01:35.189> over<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:36.119> here<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.659> there's<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.409> 60

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
goes over to here and there's like 60

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.639 
goes over to here and there's like 60
water<00:01:38.159> mills<00:01:38.429> right<00:01:39.049> so<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.170> comes<00:01:40.350> over<00:01:40.590> to

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
water mills right so it comes over to

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.249 
water mills right so it comes over to
here<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:40.950> pumps<00:01:41.280> up<00:01:41.399> through<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.670> hole

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
here and pumps up through this hole

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.169 
here and pumps up through this hole
these<00:01:43.259> are<00:01:43.619> recyclers<00:01:44.249> with<00:01:44.459> overclocker<00:01:44.939> up

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
these are recyclers with overclocker up

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.690 
these are recyclers with overclocker up
grids<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.219> then<00:01:47.219> it<00:01:47.429> goes<00:01:47.579> up<00:01:47.639> into<00:01:48.090> an<00:01:48.929> M<00:01:49.109> FSU

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
grids and then it goes up into an M FSU

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.319 
grids and then it goes up into an M FSU
the<00:01:50.700> same<00:01:50.850> FSU<00:01:51.359> is<00:01:51.770> mostly<00:01:52.770> full<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:54.060> then<00:01:54.209> we

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the same FSU is mostly full and then we

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.899 
the same FSU is mostly full and then we
have<00:01:54.600> medium<00:01:55.229> bowl<00:01:55.590> or<00:01:55.799> high<00:01:56.009> voltage<00:01:56.399> medium

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
have medium bowl or high voltage medium

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.669 
have medium bowl or high voltage medium
voltage<00:01:57.029> low<00:01:57.509> voltage<00:01:57.929> and<00:01:58.229> then<00:01:58.319> it<00:01:58.409> pumps

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
voltage low voltage and then it pumps

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:00.760 
voltage low voltage and then it pumps
out<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.979> our<00:01:59.130> machines<00:01:59.549> down<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.029> line<00:02:00.240> here

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
out to our machines down the line here

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.099 
out to our machines down the line here
um<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.249> what<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.789> want<00:02:03.029> to<00:02:03.060> know<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.899> this

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
um so what I want to know is is this

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.410 
um so what I want to know is is this
safe<00:02:04.469> because<00:02:05.249> i<00:02:05.459> feel<00:02:05.639> like<00:02:05.819> if<00:02:06.029> i<00:02:06.179> add<00:02:06.389> a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
safe because i feel like if i add a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.240 
safe because i feel like if i add a
machine<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:06.990> i'm<00:02:07.109> gonna<00:02:07.170> die<00:02:07.469> basically

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
machine in i'm gonna die basically

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.150 
machine in i'm gonna die basically
that's<00:02:08.970> like<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.660> bad<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.349> i<00:02:11.099> know

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
that's like it's that bad and i know

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.320 
that's like it's that bad and i know
something<00:02:11.610> you'll<00:02:11.730> say<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.240> an

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
something you'll say this is an

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.449 
something you'll say this is an
efficient<00:02:12.840> setup<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.440> we<00:02:13.470> can<00:02:13.830> hook<00:02:13.980> up<00:02:14.190> the

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
efficient setup that we can hook up the

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.140 
efficient setup that we can hook up the
the<00:02:15.390> mass<00:02:15.630> fabs<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.650> directly<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.580> from<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
the mass fabs to directly to from the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.730 
the mass fabs to directly to from the
EMFs<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:18.810> but<00:02:19.020> i<00:02:19.080> really<00:02:19.290> don't<00:02:19.320> want<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.650> do

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
EMFs you but i really don't want to do

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.090 
EMFs you but i really don't want to do
that

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
that

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.290 
that
I<00:02:20.160> feel<00:02:20.460> comfortable<00:02:20.790> with<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.000> way<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.240> is

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
I feel comfortable with the way it is

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.030 
I feel comfortable with the way it is
now<00:02:21.570> I<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:22.170> don't<00:02:22.470> feel<00:02:22.530> comfortable<00:02:22.680> doing

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
now I just don't feel comfortable doing

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.010 
now I just don't feel comfortable doing
