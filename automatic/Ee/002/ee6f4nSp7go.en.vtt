00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
tutorial and we left off with these two

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.660 
tutorial and we left off with these two
tubes<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.650> small<00:00:10.889> tubes<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.280> can<00:00:11.429> slide

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
tubes and the small tubes that can slide

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.509 
tubes and the small tubes that can slide
out<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.030> them<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.740> these<00:00:13.740> bottom<00:00:14.040> tubes<00:00:14.309> right

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
out of them and these bottom tubes right

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.510 
out of them and these bottom tubes right
here<00:00:14.700> now<00:00:15.420> we're<00:00:15.870> almost<00:00:16.109> finished<00:00:16.440> but<00:00:16.770> this

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
here now we're almost finished but this

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.670 
here now we're almost finished but this
is<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.730> tricky<00:00:18.029> farm<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.990> need<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.230> take<00:00:19.410> these

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
is a tricky farm you need to take these

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.490 
is a tricky farm you need to take these
two<00:00:19.890> tubes<00:00:20.100> right<00:00:20.400> here<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.880> somehow<00:00:21.869> tape

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
two tubes right here and somehow tape

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500 
two tubes right here and somehow tape
them<00:00:22.769> on<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.670> they're<00:00:23.910> at<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> slight<00:00:24.480> angle

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
them on so they're at a slight angle

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.689 
them on so they're at a slight angle
like<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.109> for<00:00:26.039> your<00:00:26.130> handle

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
like that for your handle

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.830 
like that for your handle
so<00:00:27.420> do<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.849> it<00:00:29.849> might<00:00:30.029> take<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> few<00:00:30.510> tries

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
so do that it might take you a few tries

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.950 
so do that it might take you a few tries
because<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.920> took<00:00:32.880> me<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.120> couple<00:00:33.180> tries<00:00:33.660> when<00:00:33.930> I

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
because it took me a couple tries when I

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.020 
because it took me a couple tries when I
first<00:00:34.290> did<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:36.620> make<00:00:37.620> sure<00:00:37.790> they're<00:00:38.790> pretty

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
first did it make sure they're pretty

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.569 
first did it make sure they're pretty
stable<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.510> mean<00:00:40.040> they<00:00:41.040> have<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.190> be<00:00:41.309> pretty

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
stable I mean they have to be pretty

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:54.730 
stable I mean they have to be pretty
good<00:00:41.930> so<00:00:42.930> they're<00:00:43.170> not<00:00:43.320> moving<00:00:43.469> around

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:54.740 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.200 

okay<00:00:55.740> I'm<00:00:55.830> not<00:00:55.980> making<00:00:56.310> them<00:00:56.460> too<00:00:56.640> stable<00:00:56.910> for

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
okay I'm not making them too stable for

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
okay I'm not making them too stable for
right<00:00:57.330> now<00:00:57.360> because<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:59.090> don't<00:01:00.090> want<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.540> take
