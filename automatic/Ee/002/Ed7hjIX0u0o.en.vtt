00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
to think on the same page so you get to

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.980 
to think on the same page so you get to
a<00:02:19.740> point<00:02:19.980> where<00:02:20.250> we<00:02:20.910> all<00:02:21.030> know<00:02:21.180> exactly<00:02:21.600> what

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
a point where we all know exactly what

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.290 
a point where we all know exactly what
we<00:02:22.080> need<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.350> do<00:02:22.470> when<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.130> where<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.000> be<00:02:24.120> on

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
we need to do when and where to be on

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.790 
we need to do when and where to be on
the<00:02:24.540> map<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:24.930> we're<00:02:25.260> getting<00:02:25.530> there<00:02:25.650> slowly

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
the map and we're getting there slowly

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.550 
the map and we're getting there slowly
in<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.000> first<00:02:27.180> game<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.870> would<00:02:27.990> show<00:02:28.320> we<00:02:28.440> were

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
in the first game it would show we were

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.040 
in the first game it would show we were
all<00:02:28.680> there<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.070> in<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.580> third<00:02:29.760> game<00:02:29.940> we<00:02:30.150> we

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
all there and in the third game we we

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.870 
all there and in the third game we we
struggled<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.530> little<00:02:31.740> bit<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.190> close<00:02:32.580> out<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
struggled a little bit to close out the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.030 
struggled a little bit to close out the
game<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.350> because<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.380> these<00:02:34.560> mistakes<00:02:34.830> we

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
game and because of these mistakes we

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.470 
game and because of these mistakes we
kind<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.370> fell<00:02:35.640> apart<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.970> little<00:02:36.060> bit<00:02:36.270> we're<00:02:36.450> a

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
kind of fell apart a little bit we're a

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.180 
kind of fell apart a little bit we're a
little<00:02:36.570> lost<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:37.110> what<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.530> do<00:02:37.650> how<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:37.860> do<00:02:38.070> it

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
little lost on what to do how to do it

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.340 
little lost on what to do how to do it
like<00:02:38.790> um<00:02:39.000> if<00:02:39.300> we<00:02:39.480> would<00:02:39.630> have<00:02:39.720> just<00:02:39.840> took<00:02:40.200> the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
like um if we would have just took the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.750 
like um if we would have just took the
buildings<00:02:40.680> instead<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.100> trying<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.490> kill

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
buildings instead of trying to kill

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.330 
buildings instead of trying to kill
heroes<00:02:41.970> then<00:02:42.720> we<00:02:42.840> probably<00:02:43.080> would<00:02:43.320> have<00:02:43.440> we

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
heroes then we probably would have we

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.500 
heroes then we probably would have we
might<00:02:44.490> have<00:02:44.580> been<00:02:44.670> able<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.910> close<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.240> game

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
might have been able to close that game

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.460 
might have been able to close that game
out<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.780> bit<00:02:45.930> better<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.340> just<00:02:47.340> mostly<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.690> have

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
out a bit better and just mostly I have

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.840 
out a bit better and just mostly I have
a<00:02:49.530> lot<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.650> confidence<00:02:49.860> in<00:02:50.220> myself<00:02:50.340> I'm<00:02:50.700> not

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
a lot of confidence in myself I'm not

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
and even if we don't do so well here we

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.179 
and even if we don't do so well here we
can<00:05:25.110> still<00:05:25.349> stick<00:05:25.620> there<00:05:25.770> that<00:05:25.860> will<00:05:25.949> have<00:05:26.069> an

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:26.189 
can still stick there that will have an

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:28.040 
can still stick there that will have an
advantage<00:05:26.400> over<00:05:26.789> the<00:05:27.029> teams<00:05:27.270> that<00:05:27.419> do<00:05:27.599> want<00:05:27.960> to

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
advantage over the teams that do want to

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.170 
advantage over the teams that do want to
disband<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:29.009> shift<00:05:29.580> players<00:05:29.789> or<00:05:29.969> whatever

disband and shift players or whatever

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.519

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:31.529 
because they have to start over they

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:32.689 
because they have to start over they
have<00:05:31.620> to<00:05:31.740> rebuild<00:05:31.860> their<00:05:32.099> teamwork<00:05:32.339> and

communication and everything and we plan
to<00:05:35.370> stick<00:05:35.610> with<00:05:35.759> that<00:05:35.879> so<00:05:36.569> we'll<00:05:36.719> still<00:05:36.900> have

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
to stick with that so we'll still have

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.320

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
that over those tubes yeah it sounds

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.389 
that over those tubes yeah it sounds
natural<00:05:39.509> because<00:05:39.960> if<00:05:40.110> you<00:05:40.259> put<00:05:40.560> a<00:05:40.949> lot<00:05:41.069> of<00:05:41.219> at

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:41.399 
natural because if you put a lot of at

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:43.249 
natural because if you put a lot of at

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
boot camp lens locations maybe we're

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.320

probably going to boot camp somewhere on

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.300 
probably going to boot camp somewhere on
the<00:06:00.449> East<00:06:00.599> Coast<00:06:00.839> we<00:06:01.500> wanted<00:06:01.800> to<00:06:01.949> do<00:06:02.129> it<00:06:02.250> in

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
the East Coast we wanted to do it in

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.529 
the East Coast we wanted to do it in
Europe<00:06:02.520> at<00:06:02.729> first<00:06:02.939> but<00:06:03.060> we<00:06:03.180> couldn't<00:06:03.389> get<00:06:03.479> a

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
Europe at first but we couldn't get a

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:05.869 
Europe at first but we couldn't get a
visa<00:06:03.779> from<00:06:04.110> stinking<00:06:04.529> because<00:06:04.800> he's<00:06:05.009> he's

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:05.879 
visa from stinking because he's he's

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:08.059 
visa from stinking because he's he's
Chinese<00:06:06.180> so<00:06:07.110> it<00:06:07.229> would<00:06:07.319> take<00:06:07.439> too<00:06:07.620> long<00:06:07.649> for

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:08.069 
Chinese so it would take too long for

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:09.619 
Chinese so it would take too long for
that<00:06:08.159> process<00:06:08.550> to<00:06:08.639> happen<00:06:08.699> so<00:06:09.180> it'll<00:06:09.539> be

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:09.629 
that process to happen so it'll be

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:10.999 
that process to happen so it'll be
somewhere<00:06:09.899> on<00:06:09.990> the<00:06:10.050> East<00:06:10.229> Coast<00:06:10.349> and<00:06:10.800> we'll

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:11.009 
somewhere on the East Coast and we'll

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:14.329 
somewhere on the East Coast and we'll
play<00:06:11.189> mostly<00:06:11.879> European<00:06:12.240> teams<00:06:12.979> and<00:06:13.979> now
