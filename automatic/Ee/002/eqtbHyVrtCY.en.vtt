and i got me as a couple years ago and

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.639 
and i got me as a couple years ago and
you<00:00:41.730> can<00:00:41.879> see<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.989> chain<00:00:43.260> it's<00:00:43.469> really

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
you can see that a chain it's really

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.670 
you can see that a chain it's really
pink<00:00:44.570> that's<00:00:45.570> because<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.110> not<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.379> actual

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
pink that's because it's not the actual

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.830 
pink that's because it's not the actual
chain<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.340> broke<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.850> chain<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.180> Cawood<00:00:48.600> and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
chain I broke the chain that Cawood and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.690 
chain I broke the chain that Cawood and
I<00:00:49.079> replaced<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.250> from<00:00:50.370> Claire's

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
I replaced it with the one from Claire's

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.799 
I replaced it with the one from Claire's
because<00:00:50.940> that's<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> only<00:00:51.210> one<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.570> fit

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
because that's the only one that fit

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.920 
because that's the only one that fit
with<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.969> so<00:00:53.969> that's<00:00:54.059> what<00:00:54.300> happened<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.809> now
