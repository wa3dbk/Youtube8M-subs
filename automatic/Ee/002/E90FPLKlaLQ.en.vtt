appropriate goals for the the patient

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.040 
appropriate goals for the the patient
and<00:00:07.470> we<00:00:08.570> diagnosed<00:00:09.570> them<00:00:09.750> with<00:00:09.870> some

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
and we diagnosed them with some

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.930 
and we diagnosed them with some
particular<00:00:10.469> nursing<00:00:10.889> problem<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.610> now<00:00:11.880> we

want to start to take action to improve
this<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:16.080> they're<00:00:16.260> usually<00:00:16.440> step-by-step

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
this so they're usually step-by-step

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.970 
this so they're usually step-by-step
objectives<00:00:18.119> they<00:00:18.300> need<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.630> be<00:00:18.750> realistic<00:00:19.080> the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
objectives they need to be realistic the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.130 
objectives they need to be realistic the
patient<00:00:20.369> has<00:00:20.520> kidney<00:00:20.970> disease<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.660> they<00:00:21.869> have

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
patient has kidney disease and they have

patient has kidney disease and they have
altered<00:00:23.100> unary<00:00:23.820> elimination<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:24.930> aren't

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
altered unary elimination we aren't

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.740 
altered unary elimination we aren't
going<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.920> able<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.220> fix<00:00:26.369> their<00:00:26.580> kidneys<00:00:26.970> so

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
going to be able to fix their kidneys so

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.599 
going to be able to fix their kidneys so
we<00:00:27.900> can't<00:00:28.170> say<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.220> has<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.460> be

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
we can't say that so it has to be

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.510 
we can't say that so it has to be
realistic<00:00:29.939> they<00:00:30.840> are<00:00:31.050> centered<00:00:32.040> around<00:00:32.160> the

realistic they are centered around the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.420 
realistic they are centered around the

single factors the best way to write an
outcome<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.640> be<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:45.379> measurable

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
outcome is to have it be a measurable

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.490 
outcome is to have it be a measurable
change<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.420> want<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.719> see<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.320> is

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
change that we want to see this is

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.930 
change that we want to see this is
because<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.039> nursing<00:00:50.309> care<00:00:50.460> points<00:00:50.789> we're

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
because the nursing care points we're

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.450 
because the nursing care points we're
writing<00:00:51.469> are<00:00:52.469> used<00:00:52.890> by<00:00:53.129> everyone

all<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.460> week<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.509> case<00:02:06.719> of

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
all of this week so in the case of

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.119 
all of this week so in the case of
physiologic<00:02:09.119> problems<00:02:09.989> we<00:02:10.229> usually<00:02:10.679> say<00:02:10.920> that

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
physiologic problems we usually say that

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.520 
physiologic problems we usually say that
patients<00:02:11.520> will<00:02:11.670> maintain

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
patients will maintain

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.559 
patients will maintain
so<00:02:12.650> in<00:02:12.770> an<00:02:12.890> ongoing<00:02:13.190> fashion<00:02:13.670> they<00:02:14.300> will<00:02:14.450> be

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
so in an ongoing fashion they will be

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:21.510 
so in an ongoing fashion they will be
meeting<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.020> goals<00:02:19.630> just<00:02:20.630> as<00:02:20.840> there<00:02:21.080> is<00:02:21.230> a

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
meeting the goals just as there is a

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.040 
meeting the goals just as there is a
North<00:02:22.520> American<00:02:22.670> nursing<00:02:23.510> diagnosis

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
North American nursing diagnosis

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.470 
North American nursing diagnosis
association<00:02:24.770> there<00:02:24.980> is<00:02:25.130> also<00:02:25.480> standardized

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
association there is also standardized

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.170 
association there is also standardized
language<00:02:26.870> for<00:02:27.620> discussing<00:02:27.980> patient<00:02:28.640> outcomes

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
language for discussing patient outcomes

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.780 
language for discussing patient outcomes
and<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:29.900> is<00:02:30.110> called<00:02:30.380> knock<00:02:30.709> or<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.280> national

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
and this is called knock or the national

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.350 
and this is called knock or the national
outcome<00:02:32.239> classification<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:35.120> is

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
outcome classification this is

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.780 
outcome classification this is
standardized<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.230> expected<00:02:37.040> outcomes<00:02:37.190> from

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
standardized and expected outcomes from

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.479 
standardized and expected outcomes from
a<00:02:37.910> given<00:02:38.239> nursing<00:02:38.690> action<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:40.220> here's<00:02:40.430> a

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
a given nursing action so here's a

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.520 
a given nursing action so here's a
sample<00:02:40.819> knock<00:02:41.300> statement<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.020> these<00:02:42.230> are

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
sample knock statement and these are

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.680 
sample knock statement and these are
printed<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.280> your<00:02:43.489> nursing<00:02:43.640> diagnosis<00:02:44.420> book

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
printed in your nursing diagnosis book

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.350 
printed in your nursing diagnosis book
so<00:02:45.170> once<00:02:45.410> you've<00:02:45.590> determined<00:02:45.800> what<00:02:46.790> you<00:02:46.970> think

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
so once you've determined what you think

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.930 
so once you've determined what you think
the<00:02:47.810> nursing<00:02:48.140> diagnosis<00:02:48.739> is<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.190> look<00:02:49.489> you

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
the nursing diagnosis is you look you

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.000 
the nursing diagnosis is you look you
look<00:02:50.090> at<00:02:50.209> defining<00:02:50.690> characteristics<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.830> and

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
look at defining characteristics and and

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.640 
look at defining characteristics and and
see<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.880> yes<00:02:53.030> indeed<00:02:53.300> that<00:02:53.660> was<00:02:53.840> patient's

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
see that yes indeed that was patient's

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.920 
see that yes indeed that was patient's
actual<00:02:54.800> problem<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.580> then<00:02:55.760> below<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.120> it

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
actual problem and then below that it

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.990 
actual problem and then below that it
will<00:02:57.050> actually<00:02:57.260> have<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:57.950> appropriate<00:02:58.790> goal

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
will actually have the appropriate goal

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.900 
will actually have the appropriate goal
for<00:02:59.269> that<00:02:59.300> given<00:02:59.630> patient<00:03:00.319> problem<00:03:00.800> so<00:03:01.700> the

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
for that given patient problem so the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.930 
for that given patient problem so the
nandha<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.450> nursing<00:03:02.780> diagnosis<00:03:03.440> is<00:03:03.760> has<00:03:04.760> an

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
you will have to do is one of three

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.290 
you will have to do is one of three
things<00:06:07.630> which<00:06:07.990> is<00:06:08.200> either<00:06:08.590> the<00:06:08.800> plan<00:06:09.300> didn't

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
things which is either the plan didn't

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.350 
things which is either the plan didn't
work<00:06:10.360> and<00:06:10.780> it<00:06:11.169> requires<00:06:11.590> revision<00:06:12.580> so<00:06:13.000> it<00:06:13.180> now

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
work and it requires revision so it now

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.990 
work and it requires revision so it now
is<00:06:13.570> going<00:06:13.810> to<00:06:13.900> have<00:06:14.080> new<00:06:14.380> goals<00:06:14.590> new<00:06:15.039> timelines

maybe<00:06:16.720> the<00:06:16.870> interventions<00:06:17.650> need<00:06:18.460> to<00:06:18.490> be

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
maybe the interventions need to be

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.790 
maybe the interventions need to be
altered<00:06:19.150> or<00:06:19.360> perhaps<00:06:20.080> the<00:06:20.350> problem<00:06:20.560> is
