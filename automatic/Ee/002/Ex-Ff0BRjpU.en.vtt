00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
about thirty which is pretty crazy and

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.100 
about thirty which is pretty crazy and
it<00:01:09.850> can<00:01:10.000> get<00:01:10.090> really<00:01:10.360> expensive<00:01:10.510> especially

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
it can get really expensive especially

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.830

if<00:01:11.500> you<00:01:11.680> need<00:01:11.800> multiples<00:01:12.370> so<00:01:13.000> I<00:01:13.330> just<00:01:13.540> decided

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
if you need multiples so I just decided

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.080 
if you need multiples so I just decided
to<00:01:13.990> make<00:01:14.470> my<00:01:14.680> own<00:01:14.710> so<00:01:15.160> I<00:01:15.190> go<00:01:15.550> through<00:01:15.580> orange

a<00:01:28.450> lot<00:01:28.960> of<00:01:29.320> juice<00:01:29.680> containers<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:30.550> it's<00:01:30.640> kind

a lot of juice containers and it's kind

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.480 
a lot of juice containers and it's kind
of<00:01:30.940> crazy<00:01:31.150> so<00:01:31.930> instead<00:01:32.440> of<00:01:32.500> just<00:01:32.740> recycling<00:01:33.370> it

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
of crazy so instead of just recycling it

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.650 
of crazy so instead of just recycling it
and<00:01:33.640> getting<00:01:33.820> rid<00:01:33.940> of<00:01:34.030> it<00:01:34.150> it's<00:01:34.420> definitely

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
and getting rid of it it's definitely

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.500 
and getting rid of it it's definitely
better<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.380> reuse<00:01:35.500> it<00:01:35.800> for<00:01:35.830> something<00:01:36.310> else<00:01:36.510> so

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
better to reuse it for something else so

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.660 
better to reuse it for something else so
all<00:01:37.900> you<00:01:38.080> have<00:01:38.170> to<00:01:38.290> do<00:01:38.410> for<00:01:38.590> this<00:01:38.710> is<00:01:38.950> literally

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
all you have to do for this is literally

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.940

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.620 
clean it out make sure it's all dry and
the<00:01:42.340> orange<00:01:42.610> juice<00:01:42.760> is<00:01:42.940> actually<00:01:43.330> out<00:01:43.480> of<00:01:43.510> the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.530 

so<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.980> decided<00:01:50.370> to<00:01:50.490> reuse<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.120> orange<00:01:51.390> juice

ready<00:03:40.710> for<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.940> that's<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.140> DIY<00:03:43.590> was

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
ready for and that's it that DIY was

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.530

super<00:03:44.100> simple<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.520> it<00:03:44.670> definitely<00:03:45.090> felt<00:03:45.300> a

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
super simple and it definitely felt a

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.660 
super simple and it definitely felt a
lot<00:03:45.900> better<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.470> pay<00:03:46.620> about<00:03:46.830> five<00:03:47.130> dollars<00:03:47.490> to

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
lot better to pay about five dollars to

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.580 
lot better to pay about five dollars to
make<00:03:47.820> this<00:03:48.030> instead<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.600> thirty<00:03:48.900> dollars<00:03:49.080> just

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
make this instead of thirty dollars just

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.270 
make this instead of thirty dollars just
to<00:03:49.710> buy<00:03:49.860> it

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.450 

and<00:03:57.020> this<00:03:58.020> final<00:03:58.350> DIY<00:03:58.890> wasn't<00:03:59.280> really

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
and this final DIY wasn't really

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.070 
and this final DIY wasn't really
inspired<00:03:59.850> by<00:04:00.030> anything<00:04:00.300> that<00:04:00.450> I've<00:04:00.690> seen<00:04:00.900> in

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
inspired by anything that I've seen in

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.170 
inspired by anything that I've seen in
stores<00:04:01.380> but<00:04:01.680> it<00:04:01.800> was<00:04:01.950> super<00:04:02.310> easy<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.670> really

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
stores but it was super easy and really

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.820 
stores but it was super easy and really
inexpensive<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.990> do<00:04:04.110> so<00:04:04.320> I<00:04:04.380> thought<00:04:04.560> I'd<00:04:04.710> just

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
inexpensive to do so I thought I'd just

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.860 
inexpensive to do so I thought I'd just
show<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.070> guys<00:04:05.130> how<00:04:05.460> I<00:04:05.490> did<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:05.910> so<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.660> first

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
show you guys how I did it so the first

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.420 
show you guys how I did it so the first
thing<00:04:07.050> I<00:04:07.140> did<00:04:07.200> was<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:07.590> started<00:04:08.040> off<00:04:08.160> with<00:04:08.370> a

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
thing I did was I started off with a

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.610 
thing I did was I started off with a
frame<00:04:08.910> that<00:04:08.940> I<00:04:09.180> had<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.840> I<00:04:10.260> just<00:04:10.440> kind<00:04:10.560> of

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
frame that I had and I just kind of

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.500 
frame that I had and I just kind of
wanted<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:10.920> switch<00:04:11.520> it<00:04:11.640> up<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.850> little<00:04:11.940> bit<00:04:12.150> so<00:04:12.480> I

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
wanted to switch it up a little bit so I

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.569 
wanted to switch it up a little bit so I
just<00:04:12.810> took<00:04:12.959> everything<00:04:13.230> apart<00:04:15.320> and<00:04:16.549> then<00:04:17.549> I

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
just took everything apart and then I

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.910 
just took everything apart and then I
just<00:04:17.910> pulled<00:04:18.120> out<00:04:18.239> this<00:04:18.510> package<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.230> random

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
just pulled out this package of random

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.740 
just pulled out this package of random
patterned<00:04:20.400> paper<00:04:20.700> that<00:04:21.000> I<00:04:21.030> had<00:04:21.239> I<00:04:21.269> got<00:04:21.600> this

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
patterned paper that I had I got this

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.020 
patterned paper that I had I got this
from<00:04:21.959> Michaels<00:04:22.290> for<00:04:22.530> about<00:04:22.680> $3<00:04:23.430> or<00:04:23.640> less<00:04:23.820> I

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
from Michaels for about $3 or less I

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.640 
from Michaels for about $3 or less I
think<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.270> was<00:04:24.390> actually<00:04:24.660> on<00:04:24.810> sale<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:25.410> it<00:04:25.530> was

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
think it was actually on sale and it was

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.760 
think it was actually on sale and it was
super<00:04:25.920> cheap<00:04:26.250> so<00:04:27.000> all<00:04:27.330> I<00:04:27.390> had<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.660> do<00:04:27.870> was<00:04:28.290> take

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
super cheap so all I had to do was take

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.230 
super cheap so all I had to do was take
the<00:04:28.950> glass<00:04:29.190> part<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.669> frame<00:04:29.910> and<00:04:30.090> just

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
the glass part of the frame and just

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.670 
the glass part of the frame and just
trace<00:04:30.450> it<00:04:30.480> onto<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.930> paper<00:04:31.080> just<00:04:31.470> to<00:04:31.560> make

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
trace it onto the paper just to make

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.680 
trace it onto the paper just to make
sure<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:32.010> paper<00:04:32.190> was<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.610> exact<00:04:33.000> size<00:04:33.360> of<00:04:33.630> the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
sure the paper was the exact size of the

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.450 
sure the paper was the exact size of the
frame<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.200> then<00:04:34.620> I<00:04:34.650> just<00:04:34.860> cut<00:04:35.070> it<00:04:35.100> out<00:04:35.250> with

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
frame and then I just cut it out with

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.150 
frame and then I just cut it out with
some<00:04:35.610> scissors

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.619 

so<00:04:43.160> after<00:04:43.550> putting<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:43.940> frame<00:04:44.180> all<00:04:44.389> back

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:44.629 
so after putting the frame all back

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:45.309 
so after putting the frame all back
together<00:04:44.810> again

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:45.319 
together again

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.170 
together again
I<00:04:45.500> just<00:04:45.650> took<00:04:45.860> those<00:04:46.069> same<00:04:46.340> exact<00:04:46.789> stickers

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
I just took those same exact stickers

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.180 
I just took those same exact stickers
and<00:04:47.360> I<00:04:47.810> placed<00:04:48.080> them<00:04:48.229> right<00:04:48.440> on<00:04:48.560> top<00:04:48.590> of<00:04:49.039> the

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
and I placed them right on top of the

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.010 
and I placed them right on top of the
glass<00:04:49.580> part<00:04:49.940> of<00:04:50.060> the<00:04:50.180> picture<00:04:50.449> frame<00:04:50.599> and<00:04:50.840> I

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
glass part of the picture frame and I

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.050 
glass part of the picture frame and I
wrote<00:04:51.259> the<00:04:51.409> word<00:04:51.560> a<00:04:51.770> list<00:04:52.039> and<00:04:52.400> you<00:04:52.759> can<00:04:52.909> really
