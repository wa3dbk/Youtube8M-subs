00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.160
 the ball 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.710
 so the regulatory lance has to have a series of property and 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.920
 Merida 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.830
 who recovers as after explaining matters 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.480
 but once the match starts, special cases can be given 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.520
 which I will explain first of all the ball can not be replaced without the 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.970
 authorization of the referee if the ball 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.930
 During the course of the game the game will be damaged or exploited. 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.340
 interrupted and a ball will be made to land in the place where the ball 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.630
 this year exploded silver arrivals are damaged when they are not playing as per 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.750
 example a kick-off a throw-in to a corner kick the game is 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.140
 will resume according to the rule so humala an additional train the ground 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.980
 of play and this interferes in the game the referee will interrupt in game and 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.460
 will resume with a ball to the ground in the place where the ball was 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.860
 yes the ball 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.050
 the referee does not interfere in the play 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.580
 will send when removing the ball in the first interruption I hope the 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.190
 explanation to the result I refused discharges 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.740
