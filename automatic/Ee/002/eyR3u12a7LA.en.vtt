into a Smart Cover which is pretty cool
so<00:01:06.020> now<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.970> question<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.659> course<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:09.960> let's

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
so now the question of course is let's

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.960 
so now the question of course is let's
integrate<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.979> into<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.220> case<00:01:11.490> I'm<00:01:11.760> sure

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970

there's options out there but I had

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.760 
there's options out there but I had
already<00:01:14.610> invested<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.360> case<00:01:15.570> not<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.680> it

strap it in like so and for the most
part<00:01:46.549> it<00:01:47.549> works<00:01:47.909> pretty<00:01:48.450> well<00:01:49.880> my<00:01:50.880> only<00:01:51.060> gripe

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
part it works pretty well my only gripe

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.770 
part it works pretty well my only gripe
with<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.649> case<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.149> power<00:01:54.329> button

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
with this case is that the power button

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.560 
with this case is that the power button
is<00:01:55.049> behind<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.770> strap<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.909> know<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.240> still

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
is behind the strap you know it's still

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.959 
is behind the strap you know it's still
pretty<00:01:57.840> reachable<00:01:58.439> but<00:01:59.390> it<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:01.969> nonetheless

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
pretty reachable but it is nonetheless

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.999 
pretty reachable but it is nonetheless
behind<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.810> strap<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.320> it's<00:02:04.500> not<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.710> hundred

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
behind the strap so it's not a hundred

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.719 
behind the strap so it's not a hundred
percent<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.610> media<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.479> course

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
percent in the media of course

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.900 
percent in the media of course

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
if you have the Smart Cover such a case

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.170 
if you have the Smart Cover such a case
is<00:02:14.150> no<00:02:14.269> longer<00:02:14.300> needed<00:02:15.400> right<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:19.400> now<00:02:19.550> we<00:02:20.150> just

is no longer needed right so now we just

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.170 
is no longer needed right so now we just
have<00:02:20.569> to<00:02:21.580> figure<00:02:22.580> out<00:02:22.640> how<00:02:23.629> to<00:02:23.690> get<00:02:24.580> our<00:02:25.580> lovely

where<00:02:44.120> exactly<00:02:44.660> on<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:46.190> case<00:02:46.400> we<00:02:46.610> should

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
where exactly on the case we should

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.360 
where exactly on the case we should
mount<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.209> magnet<00:02:47.630> so<00:02:48.440> we<00:02:48.709> want<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:48.980> make<00:02:49.160> it

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
mount the magnet so we want to make it

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
mount the magnet so we want to make it
mounted<00:02:49.970> enough<00:02:50.269> so<00:02:50.540> when<00:02:50.750> we<00:02:50.870> close<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.410> case

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
mounted enough so when we close the case

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.030 
mounted enough so when we close the case
the<00:02:53.390> screen<00:02:53.690> turns<00:02:53.959> off<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.470> then<00:02:54.620> we<00:02:54.739> open

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
the screen turns off and then we open

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.640 
the screen turns off and then we open
the<00:02:55.069> case<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:56.060> screen<00:02:56.329> turns<00:02:56.569> on<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:57.530> this

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
the case the screen turns on so this

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.000 
the case the screen turns on so this
seems<00:02:58.549> like<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.760> good<00:02:59.030> spot<00:02:59.319> so<00:03:00.319> what<00:03:00.739> I'm<00:03:00.860> gonna

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
seems like a good spot so what I'm gonna

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.580 
seems like a good spot so what I'm gonna
do<00:03:01.720> is<00:03:02.720> just<00:03:02.959> lightly<00:03:04.780> mark<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:06.049> you<00:03:06.290> can

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
do is just lightly mark it you can

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.620 
do is just lightly mark it you can
figure<00:03:06.950> out<00:03:07.069> your<00:03:07.400> own<00:03:07.430> marking<00:03:08.120> way<00:03:08.239> if<00:03:08.450> you

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
figure out your own marking way if you

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.780 
figure out your own marking way if you
want<00:03:08.840> something<00:03:09.440> that's<00:03:09.799> not<00:03:09.980> really<00:03:10.310> sure

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
want something that's not really sure

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.390 
want something that's not really sure
but<00:03:11.410> just<00:03:12.410> marking<00:03:12.769> it<00:03:12.859> with<00:03:12.889> the<00:03:13.040> pen<00:03:13.220> is

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
but just marking it with the pen is

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:22.780 
but just marking it with the pen is
great<00:03:13.609> for<00:03:13.850> me<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.269> then<00:03:16.239> also<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:22.370> magnet

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
great for me and then also the magnet

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.330 
great for me and then also the magnet
should<00:03:23.000> work<00:03:23.269> from<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.350> opposite<00:03:24.859> side<00:03:25.160> so

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
should work from the opposite side so

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.949 
should work from the opposite side so
let's<00:03:25.549> see<00:03:27.160> okay<00:03:28.160> just<00:03:28.760> just<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:29.269> you<00:03:29.329> see<00:03:29.600> so

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
let's see okay just just so you see so

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.140 
let's see okay just just so you see so
it<00:03:30.560> does<00:03:30.859> work<00:03:31.130> when<00:03:31.370> holding<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:31.850> in<00:03:32.000> that

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
it does work when holding it in that

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.539 
it does work when holding it in that
spot<00:03:32.329> again<00:03:32.720> just<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.079> confirm<00:03:33.440> so<00:03:34.280> now<00:03:34.370> what

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
spot again just to confirm so now what

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.910 
spot again just to confirm so now what
we<00:03:34.670> want<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.940> do<00:03:35.030> is<00:03:35.150> we<00:03:35.269> want<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.510> cut<00:03:35.750> along<00:03:36.230> I

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
we want to do is we want to cut along I

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.879 
we want to do is we want to cut along I
mean<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.280> very<00:03:37.459> very<00:03:37.970> cheap<00:03:38.299> very<00:03:39.079> effective

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
mean the very very cheap very effective

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.910 
mean the very very cheap very effective
way<00:03:40.040> would<00:03:40.250> just<00:03:40.430> be<00:03:40.579> to<00:03:40.700> take<00:03:40.880> this<00:03:41.120> and<00:03:41.920> glue

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
way would just be to take this and glue

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.520 
way would just be to take this and glue
it<00:03:43.069> right<00:03:43.100> now<00:03:43.459> here<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.359> you<00:03:44.870> kinda<00:03:45.319> have<00:03:45.500> a

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
it right now here and you kinda have a

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.069 
it right now here and you kinda have a
smart<00:03:45.920> case<00:03:46.160> really<00:03:46.489> fast<00:03:46.819> that's<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.840> fast

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
smart case really fast that's the fast

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.979 
smart case really fast that's the fast
solution<00:03:48.590> on<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.489> couple<00:03:50.239> downsides<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:50.870> this

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
solution on the couple downsides to this

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.750 
solution on the couple downsides to this
is<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.349> know<00:03:51.440> you<00:03:51.500> have<00:03:51.620> this<00:03:51.889> magnet<00:03:52.340> exposed

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
is you know you have this magnet exposed

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.150 
is you know you have this magnet exposed
so<00:03:53.569> you<00:03:53.660> could<00:03:53.959> potentially<00:03:54.410> scratch<00:03:54.859> your

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
so you could potentially scratch your

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.460 
so you could potentially scratch your
screen<00:03:55.400> so<00:03:55.849> yes<00:03:56.420> you<00:03:56.599> could<00:03:56.750> put<00:03:56.810> padding<00:03:57.349> on

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
screen so yes you could put padding on

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.410 
screen so yes you could put padding on
it<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:57.799> then<00:03:58.549> the<00:03:58.670> other<00:03:58.700> thing<00:03:59.090> is<00:03:59.120> this<00:03:59.359> is

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
it and then the other thing is this is

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.059 
it and then the other thing is this is
kind<00:03:59.720> of<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.900> sore<00:04:00.109> eye<00:04:00.139> I<00:04:00.319> want<00:04:00.590> this<00:04:00.769> a<00:04:00.829> little

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
kind of a sore eye I want this a little

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.589 
kind of a sore eye I want this a little
bit<00:04:01.310> more<00:04:01.459> aesthetically<00:04:01.880> pleasing<00:04:02.000> so<00:04:02.510> I'm

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
bit more aesthetically pleasing so I'm

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.349 
bit more aesthetically pleasing so I'm
actually<00:04:02.750> going<00:04:03.049> to<00:04:03.109> cut<00:04:03.349> into<00:04:04.480> this<00:04:05.480> now<00:04:05.889> and

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
actually going to cut into this now and

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.110 
actually going to cut into this now and
we'll<00:04:08.359> make<00:04:08.650> kind<00:04:09.650> of<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:09.829> circular

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
we'll make kind of a circular

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.569 
we'll make kind of a circular
indentation<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:11.329> then<00:04:12.079> put<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.190> magnet

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
indentation and then put the magnet

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.880 
indentation and then put the magnet
insert<00:04:14.030> the<00:04:14.180> magnet<00:04:14.540> into

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
insert the magnet into

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.030 
insert the magnet into
our<00:04:16.250> folio<00:04:17.000> and<00:04:17.269> then<00:04:17.780> cover<00:04:18.049> it<00:04:18.140> back<00:04:18.320> up<00:04:18.380> with

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
our folio and then cover it back up with

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.850 
our folio and then cover it back up with
the<00:04:19.160> material<00:04:19.640> alright<00:04:20.570> so<00:04:21.500> let's<00:04:21.709> get

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
the material alright so let's get

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.100 
the material alright so let's get
started

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
started

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.460 
started
so<00:04:24.110> all<00:04:24.260> you<00:04:24.380> need<00:04:25.060> something<00:04:26.060> sharp

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
so all you need something sharp

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:35.040 
so all you need something sharp
something<00:04:27.470> that<00:04:27.590> will<00:04:27.680> get<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:27.890> job<00:04:28.100> done<00:04:33.160> and

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
something that will get the job done and

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.680 
something that will get the job done and
just<00:04:36.050> want<00:04:36.230> to<00:04:36.290> make<00:04:36.380> sure<00:04:36.410> your<00:04:36.710> dead<00:04:36.950> center

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
just want to make sure your dead center

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:46.060 
just want to make sure your dead center
you<00:04:38.690> can<00:04:38.870> start<00:04:41.770> putting<00:04:42.770> in<00:04:44.650> and<00:04:45.650> remember

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
you can start putting in and remember

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.740 
you can start putting in and remember
you<00:04:46.190> can<00:04:46.340> always<00:04:46.490> cut<00:04:47.210> more

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
you can always cut more

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.280 
you can always cut more
you<00:04:47.870> can't<00:04:48.140> cut<00:04:49.000> you<00:04:50.000> can't<00:04:50.270> cut<00:04:50.540> bless<00:04:50.960> so

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
you can't cut you can't cut bless so

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.500 
you can't cut you can't cut bless so
always<00:04:51.500> if<00:04:52.370> you<00:04:52.640> want<00:04:52.760> to<00:04:52.940> try<00:04:53.090> to<00:04:53.150> make<00:04:53.360> this

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
perfect always undershoot cut a little

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.230 
perfect always undershoot cut a little
bit<00:04:56.690> closer<00:04:57.310> to<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.430> magnet<00:04:58.850> because<00:04:58.970> you<00:04:59.120> can

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
bit closer to the magnet because you can

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.820 
bit closer to the magnet because you can
always<00:04:59.450> fit<00:04:59.690> it<00:04:59.810> in<00:04:59.930> there

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
always fit it in there

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.230 
always fit it in there
if<00:05:01.340> you're<00:05:01.580> trying<00:05:01.820> to<00:05:01.880> make<00:05:02.030> this<00:05:02.180> look

if you're trying to make this look

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.320 
if you're trying to make this look
pretty<00:05:02.450> so<00:05:03.050> you<00:05:03.230> can<00:05:03.500> see<00:05:03.710> I<00:05:04.720> roughly<00:05:07.300> cut<00:05:08.300> a

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
pretty so you can see I roughly cut a

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
pretty so you can see I roughly cut a
circle<00:05:08.810> around<00:05:09.430> all<00:05:10.430> right

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
circle around all right

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.980 
circle around all right
you<00:05:12.350> really<00:05:12.650> just<00:05:12.740> want<00:05:12.950> to<00:05:13.010> work<00:05:14.110> around<00:05:15.110> it

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
you really just want to work around it

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:30.300 
you really just want to work around it
until<00:05:17.990> it<00:05:18.320> comes<00:05:18.530> out<00:05:18.770> all<00:05:21.730> right<00:05:22.730> you<00:05:26.800> can<00:05:27.800> see

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.580 

it<00:05:31.310> fits<00:05:31.640> in<00:05:31.940> there<00:05:33.700> pretty<00:05:34.700> nicely<00:05:35.590> there's

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
it fits in there pretty nicely there's

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.640 
it fits in there pretty nicely there's
still<00:05:37.310> a<00:05:37.340> slight<00:05:37.669> bump<00:05:41.050> but<00:05:42.050> you<00:05:42.200> can<00:05:42.380> see

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
still a slight bump but you can see

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.400 
still a slight bump but you can see
we're<00:05:42.860> kind<00:05:43.070> of<00:05:43.250> at<00:05:43.460> the<00:05:43.700> base<00:05:45.250> so<00:05:46.250> I<00:05:46.280> don't

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
we're kind of at the base so I don't

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.310 
we're kind of at the base so I don't
without<00:05:48.410> chipping<00:05:48.770> away<00:05:49.040> from<00:05:49.490> this<00:05:50.320> it's

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
without chipping away from this it's

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.710 
without chipping away from this it's
just<00:05:51.410> gonna<00:05:51.680> be<00:05:51.919> a<00:05:51.950> little<00:05:52.190> bit<00:05:52.430> harder<00:05:52.760> to<00:05:52.790> do

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.920 

you<00:05:56.720> might<00:05:56.930> not<00:05:57.110> be<00:05:57.230> able<00:05:57.350> to<00:05:57.470> get<00:05:58.690> that<00:05:59.690> much

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
you might not be able to get that much

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:00.540 
you might not be able to get that much
closer

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
closer

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.820 
closer
but<00:06:01.550> what's<00:06:01.760> let's<00:06:02.120> try<00:06:02.419> for<00:06:02.720> it<00:06:04.660> you<00:06:05.660> know

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
but what's let's try for it you know

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.960 
but what's let's try for it you know
depending<00:06:06.830> on<00:06:06.950> what<00:06:07.010> case<00:06:07.370> you<00:06:07.580> get<00:06:07.760> it's

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
depending on what case you get it's

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.469 
depending on what case you get it's
really<00:06:08.240> just<00:06:08.390> a<00:06:08.570> try<00:06:09.580> trial<00:06:10.580> experience<00:06:11.060> you

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
really just a try trial experience you

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:13.090 
really just a try trial experience you
know<00:06:11.570> I'm<00:06:11.720> doing<00:06:12.020> it<00:06:12.110> yourself<00:06:12.260> this<00:06:12.740> is<00:06:12.919> here

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100

pretty<00:06:24.110> smooth<00:06:24.440> I've<00:06:24.680> worked<00:06:25.070> on<00:06:25.220> it<00:06:25.430> I<00:06:25.460> got<00:06:25.640> it

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
pretty smooth I've worked on it I got it

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.580 
pretty smooth I've worked on it I got it
down<00:06:25.970> a<00:06:26.000> little<00:06:26.210> bit<00:06:26.360> more
