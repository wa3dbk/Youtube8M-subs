00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.410
 well we saw a video interview 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.840
 now let's talk about the interviews that you 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.680
 drummers released in magazines 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.960
 specialized 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.080
 then magazines that buy boys 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.650
 I bought you big percussion 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.599
 club 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.089
 let's say the magazines that the boy 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:32.950
 buys by law of his idol gods 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:35.050
 drummers the Italian crisis well at 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.360
 he asks because he is clearly a boy 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.420
 very often with economic solidity 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.460
 the father earns well what he wants 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.050
 to know that equipment used separately 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.600
 the battery and dishes but also that 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.250
 microphones that microphones that type if there 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.870
 all these things are criteria here 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.520
 that cost a lot though so much 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.430
 full availability is said to 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.970
 sounds just like you don't 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.690
 they think of him and tall boy thinks so 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.580
 and what happens 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.530
 the interviewer does not know is obliged to 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.780
 ask him but what microphones do you use for 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.200
 miking the battery and many matris 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.509
 Italians answer but by making tournaments of 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.730
 high level but everything is always regulated 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.320
 well I take care of the musical part e 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.420
 then there are the sound technicians who 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.320
 they arrest and resolve any of 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.570
 requirement will also be true is that I do not say 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.260
 I like myself but he replied that he had 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.360
 date because how to say but I am a 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.200
 big kid I'm going to play the 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.830
 battery and then and then there are at the mercy 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.650
 of events 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.409
 are the hands of an electrician that is 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.640
 the message that comes is then one 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.460
 the very one who does not even know that 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.340
 already microphones but it takes so much one 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.710
 brand the crawford lines of the shore 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.270
 even if it is not true but you say that le 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.250
 Syrian technical papers 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.630
 a dishwasher manual 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.210
 washing machine of a founder blender 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.119
 behind it are all the specifications of 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.500
 current and here you do not say 220v why 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.189
 that is the distribution of the network 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.860
 but there are hurts and you care 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.750
 if it is not true then that the now young boys 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.950
 even better but in the store and wants 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.629
 buy a small fire of 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.090
 characteristics in a blender I say no 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.800
 but there is not and then the interview after you 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.819
 no but it's a specific thing I have 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.180
 requested her so that it is done 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.879
 but what does it cost you? 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.040
 disappointing there is a good news is not 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.280
 always so negative, there are those who are 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.280
 interviews can do and we see it now 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.280
 immediately
