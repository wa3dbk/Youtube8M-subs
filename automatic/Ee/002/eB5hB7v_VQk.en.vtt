a<00:00:08.790> little<00:00:09.210> setup<00:00:09.480> that<00:00:09.780> I've<00:00:09.900> thought<00:00:10.110> of

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
a little setup that I've thought of

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.259 
a little setup that I've thought of
doing<00:00:10.290> I'm<00:00:10.889> using<00:00:11.190> my<00:00:11.400> tablet<00:00:11.670> for<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.059> right

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
doing I'm using my tablet for the right

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.680 
doing I'm using my tablet for the right
hand<00:00:12.450> view<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.049> my<00:00:13.889> trusty<00:00:14.340> H<00:00:14.490> v40<00:00:15.299> for<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
hand view and my trusty H v40 for the

hand view and my trusty H v40 for the
left<00:00:15.929> hand<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.500> hopefully<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:16.949> going<00:00:17.160> to

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
left hand so hopefully this is going to

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.340

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.160 
do and just use fingers thumb on the a
string<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.420> we're<00:01:15.420> gonna<00:01:15.510> be<00:01:15.630> using<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.140> a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
string and we're gonna be using like a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.900 
string and we're gonna be using like a
thumb<00:01:16.650> first<00:01:17.130> finger<00:01:17.340> middle<00:01:17.790> finger

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
thumb first finger middle finger

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.000 
thumb first finger middle finger
combination<00:01:18.660> for<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.870> other<00:01:18.990> notes<00:01:19.200> I'll

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
combination for the other notes I'll

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.410 
combination for the other notes I'll
play<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.370> idea<00:01:20.670> first<00:01:20.910> and<00:01:21.120> you<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.300> just

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
play the idea first and you can just

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.610 
play the idea first and you can just
check<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.750> out<00:01:21.870> actually<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.260> think<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.530> just

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
check it out actually I think it's just

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.020 
check it out actually I think it's just
the<00:01:22.770> index<00:01:23.100> finger<00:01:23.370> I<00:01:23.430> use<00:01:23.580> with<00:01:23.700> my<00:01:23.729> thumb

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
the index finger I use with my thumb

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:37.480 
the index finger I use with my thumb
well<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.780> look<00:01:24.930> at<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.080> now

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.000 

indeed<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.450> thumb<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.410> index

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
indeed it is it is the thumb and index

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.880 
indeed it is it is the thumb and index
I<00:01:41.040> also<00:01:41.780> if<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.960> look<00:01:43.110> at<00:01:43.230> my<00:01:43.320> right<00:01:43.500> hand<00:01:43.560> I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
I also if you look at my right hand I

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.300 
I also if you look at my right hand I
just<00:01:43.920> rest<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.400> fingers<00:01:44.760> on<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:46.070> guitar<00:01:47.070> and

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
just rest the fingers on the guitar and

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.040 
just rest the fingers on the guitar and
that<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:47.610> helps<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.940> stabilize<00:01:48.180> my<00:01:48.630> hand<00:01:48.900> I

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
that just helps to stabilize my hand I

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.540 
that just helps to stabilize my hand I
find<00:01:49.260> that<00:01:49.380> quite<00:01:49.590> helpful<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.340> style

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
find that quite helpful for this style

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.250 
find that quite helpful for this style
of<00:01:50.730> playing<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.480> you<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.690> do<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.930> too<00:01:52.050> if<00:01:52.170> you

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
of playing so you can do that too if you

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.240 
of playing so you can do that too if you
would<00:01:52.410> like<00:01:52.790> if<00:01:53.790> not<00:01:54.060> really<00:01:54.390> doesn't<00:01:54.660> matter

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
would like if not really doesn't matter

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.130 
would like if not really doesn't matter
now<00:01:56.250> that's<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.000> general<00:01:57.300> idea<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.960> I'll<00:01:58.050> just

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
now that's the general idea so I'll just

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.380 
now that's the general idea so I'll just
break<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.530> up<00:01:58.620> so<00:01:58.830> we<00:01:58.860> do<00:01:59.130> pluck<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.940> a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
break that up so we do pluck the a

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.570 
break that up so we do pluck the a
string<00:02:00.810> with<00:02:00.930> our<00:02:01.020> thumb<00:02:01.250> I'm<00:02:02.250> going<00:02:02.400> to<00:02:02.490> go

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
string with our thumb I'm going to go

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.130 
string with our thumb I'm going to go
the<00:02:02.790> g-string<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.390> do<00:02:03.480> that<00:02:03.630> with<00:02:03.780> our<00:02:03.810> thumb

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
the g-string and do that with our thumb

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.880 
the g-string and do that with our thumb
sights<00:02:05.660> and<00:02:06.660> I'm<00:02:06.780> going<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:06.990> pluck<00:02:07.230> the<00:02:07.470> B

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
sights and I'm going to pluck the B

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.760 
sights and I'm going to pluck the B
string<00:02:08.190> with<00:02:08.220> our<00:02:08.399> index<00:02:08.610> finger<00:02:09.260> so<00:02:10.260> far<00:02:10.500> it

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
string with our index finger so far it

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.220 
string with our index finger so far it
is

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
is

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.690 
is
oops<00:02:14.349> and<00:02:15.349> I<00:02:15.470> messed<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.800> up<00:02:15.860> again<00:02:16.159> third<00:02:16.489> time

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
oops and I messed it up again third time

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.370 
oops and I messed it up again third time
lucky<00:02:16.879> here<00:02:17.180> we<00:02:17.269> go

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.600 

we're<00:02:24.380> going<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.560> go<00:02:24.650> back<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.130> g-string

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
we're going to go back to the g-string

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:34.140 
we're going to go back to the g-string
do<00:02:25.820> that<00:02:26.000> with<00:02:26.120> our<00:02:26.240> thumb<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.780> now<00:02:27.350> we<00:02:27.410> get

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.800 

and<00:02:35.150> then<00:02:35.450> we're<00:02:35.569> going<00:02:35.689> to<00:02:35.750> do<00:02:35.840> this

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.240 

so<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:40.930> was<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.140> index<00:02:41.500> on<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.739> e-string

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
so that was the index on the e-string

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.630 
so that was the index on the e-string
and<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:43.180> thumb<00:02:43.450> on<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.810> g-string<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.640> that's

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
and the thumb on the g-string and that's

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:54.520 
and the thumb on the g-string and that's
pretty<00:02:45.819> much<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.060> pattern

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.600 

you<00:02:55.530> might<00:02:55.710> have<00:02:55.800> noticed<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.220> bass<00:02:56.580> note

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
you might have noticed a bass note

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.340 
you might have noticed a bass note
additionally<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.450> can<00:02:57.600> use<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.900> e<00:02:57.930> string

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
additionally you can use the e string

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.870 
additionally you can use the e string
just<00:02:58.470> at<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.740> end<00:02:58.890> just<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.220> provide<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.610> bit<00:02:59.790> of

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
just at the end just to provide a bit of

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:13.500 
just at the end just to provide a bit of
variation<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.810> would<00:03:00.900> sound<00:03:01.080> like<00:03:01.140> this

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.270 

okay<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:14.570> that's<00:03:15.410> a<00:03:15.530> pretty<00:03:15.680> cool<00:03:15.860> idea<00:03:15.920> to

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
okay so that's a pretty cool idea to

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.710 
okay so that's a pretty cool idea to
start<00:03:16.550> with<00:03:16.670> but<00:03:17.000> what<00:03:17.150> we<00:03:17.240> want<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.480> do<00:03:17.600> is

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
start with but what we want to do is

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.240 
start with but what we want to do is
embellish<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:18.530> what<00:03:18.650> we're<00:03:18.770> gonna<00:03:18.860> do<00:03:19.100> is

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
embellish it so what we're gonna do is

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.070 
embellish it so what we're gonna do is
we're<00:03:19.370> gonna<00:03:19.430> add<00:03:19.670> in<00:03:19.790> some<00:03:19.820> notes<00:03:20.180> some<00:03:20.720> scale

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
we're gonna add in some notes some scale

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.160 
we're gonna add in some notes some scale
tones<00:03:21.700> from<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.880> a<00:03:22.910> minor<00:03:23.270> scale<00:03:23.390> and<00:03:23.690> these

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
tones from the a minor scale and these

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.990 
tones from the a minor scale and these
are<00:03:24.380> pretty<00:03:24.620> straightforward<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.760> first

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
are pretty straightforward so the first

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.790 
are pretty straightforward so the first
one<00:03:26.180> is<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.600> C<00:03:26.870> note<00:03:27.020> of<00:03:27.140> fret<00:03:27.350> 8<00:03:27.470> on<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.770> e

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
one is the C note of fret 8 on the e

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.090 
one is the C note of fret 8 on the e
string<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.840> then<00:03:29.840> we<00:03:30.050> will<00:03:30.230> be<00:03:30.380> adding<00:03:30.620> in<00:03:30.890> the

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
string and then we will be adding in the

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.580 
string and then we will be adding in the
B<00:03:31.370> note<00:03:31.610> next<00:03:32.510> order<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.020> 7th<00:03:33.380> fret<00:03:33.470> on

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
B note next order that the 7th fret on

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.460 
B note next order that the 7th fret on
the<00:03:33.680> E<00:03:33.740> string<00:03:34.390> and<00:03:35.390> then<00:03:35.540> descend<00:03:35.900> back<00:03:36.170> then

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
the E string and then descend back then

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.910 
the E string and then descend back then
to<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.740> root<00:03:36.950> note<00:03:38.020> so<00:03:39.020> to<00:03:39.110> show<00:03:39.350> that<00:03:39.380> idea

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
to the root note so to show that idea

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:59.660 
to the root note so to show that idea
now

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.180 

now<00:04:00.330> is<00:04:00.569> the<00:04:00.780> identical<00:04:01.380> right<00:04:01.560> hand<00:04:01.890> pattern

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
now is the identical right hand pattern

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.800 
now is the identical right hand pattern
if<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.460> look<00:04:02.700> carefully<00:04:02.910> at<00:04:03.300> that<00:04:03.450> as<00:04:03.630> I'm

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
if you look carefully at that as I'm

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.590 
if you look carefully at that as I'm
doing<00:04:03.990> it<00:04:05.030> generally<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.090> want<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.300> play<00:04:06.450> this

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
doing it generally you want to play this

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.150 
doing it generally you want to play this
L<00:04:06.780> probably<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.200> little<00:04:07.319> bit<00:04:07.500> faster<00:04:08.010> than<00:04:08.040> that

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
L probably a little bit faster than that

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:18.199 
L probably a little bit faster than that
I'll<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:08.550> show<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.850> that

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.599 

and<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.979> other<00:04:20.100> thing<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.340> want<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.549> be

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
and the other thing you want to be

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.520 
and the other thing you want to be
careful<00:04:20.850> I<00:04:21.090> was<00:04:21.269> don't<00:04:21.810> take<00:04:22.019> your<00:04:22.199> fingers

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
careful I was don't take your fingers

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.560 
careful I was don't take your fingers
off<00:04:22.650> too<00:04:22.979> soon<00:04:23.280> from<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.759> frets<00:04:24.090> they<00:04:24.330> want<00:04:24.509> to

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
off too soon from the frets they want to

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.150 
off too soon from the frets they want to
let<00:04:24.690> those<00:04:24.810> ring<00:04:25.139> out<00:04:25.320> have<00:04:25.500> a<00:04:25.560> good<00:04:25.770> listen<00:04:26.070> to

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
let those ring out have a good listen to

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.090 
let those ring out have a good listen to
that

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.030 

so<00:04:31.670> as<00:04:32.210> a<00:04:32.270> basic<00:04:32.750> rule<00:04:33.050> of<00:04:33.290> thumb<00:04:33.590> I<00:04:33.620> would<00:04:33.890> say

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
so as a basic rule of thumb I would say

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.950 
so as a basic rule of thumb I would say
just<00:04:34.280> take<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.700> finger<00:04:34.970> off<00:04:35.060> it<00:04:35.090> at<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.750> very

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
just take the finger off it at the very

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.570 
just take the finger off it at the very
last<00:04:36.140> second<00:04:36.590> before<00:04:36.680> you<00:04:36.920> make<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.250> change

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
last second before you make the change

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.480 
last second before you make the change
and<00:04:38.150> it<00:04:38.900> sounds<00:04:39.200> a<00:04:39.230> lot<00:04:39.350> better<00:04:39.590> that<00:04:39.800> that<00:04:40.010> way

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
and it sounds a lot better that that way

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.340 
and it sounds a lot better that that way
rather<00:04:41.180> than<00:04:41.360> lifting<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:41.870> finger<00:04:42.110> off<00:04:42.200> too

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
rather than lifting the finger off too

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.600 
rather than lifting the finger off too
early<00:04:42.410> and<00:04:42.830> then<00:04:42.890> you<00:04:43.010> don't<00:04:43.190> get<00:04:43.310> that<00:04:43.430> nice

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
early and then you don't get that nice

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:53.740 
early and then you don't get that nice
overlapping<00:04:44.180> sound<00:04:52.120> yeah<00:04:53.120> so<00:04:53.360> as<00:04:53.510> you<00:04:53.630> can

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
overlapping sound yeah so as you can

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.850 
overlapping sound yeah so as you can
hear<00:04:53.930> there<00:04:54.110> it<00:04:54.170> does<00:04:54.320> sound<00:04:54.560> a<00:04:54.590> little<00:04:54.620> bit

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
hear there it does sound a little bit

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.160 
hear there it does sound a little bit
funny<00:04:56.710> okay<00:04:57.710> finally<00:04:58.840> something<00:04:59.840> else<00:04:59.990> you

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
funny okay finally something else you

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.590 
funny okay finally something else you
can<00:05:00.320> do<00:05:00.560> is<00:05:00.980> like<00:05:01.700> a<00:05:01.730> hammer<00:05:02.000> on<00:05:02.180> thing<00:05:02.450> I'll

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
can do is like a hammer on thing I'll

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:14.240 
can do is like a hammer on thing I'll
just<00:05:02.660> show<00:05:02.960> you<00:05:03.020> that<00:05:03.080> so<00:05:03.440> it<00:05:03.500> looks<00:05:03.560> like<00:05:03.830> this

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.880 

so<00:05:15.250> what<00:05:15.370> I<00:05:15.400> did<00:05:15.520> was<00:05:15.850> most<00:05:16.240> of<00:05:16.450> the<00:05:16.540> pattern

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.310 

except<00:05:20.890> for<00:05:21.040> the<00:05:21.100> last<00:05:21.310> note<00:05:21.640> and<00:05:22.230> instead<00:05:23.230> of

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
except for the last note and instead of

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.360 
except for the last note and instead of
doing<00:05:23.620> that<00:05:23.800> I<00:05:23.830> picked<00:05:24.370> the<00:05:25.950> well<00:05:26.950> the<00:05:27.040> second

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
doing that I picked the well the second

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.410 
doing that I picked the well the second
last<00:05:27.490> note<00:05:27.700> from<00:05:27.790> the<00:05:27.910> pattern<00:05:28.120> which<00:05:28.240> is<00:05:28.270> the

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
last note from the pattern which is the

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.720 
last note from the pattern which is the
E<00:05:28.450> string<00:05:28.870> and<00:05:29.050> then<00:05:29.680> I<00:05:29.770> hammered<00:05:30.130> on<00:05:30.280> to<00:05:30.610> the

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
E string and then I hammered on to the

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.400 
E string and then I hammered on to the
eighth<00:05:30.880> fret<00:05:31.210> first<00:05:31.540> and<00:05:31.810> then<00:05:31.900> pulled<00:05:32.170> back

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
eighth fret first and then pulled back

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.600 
eighth fret first and then pulled back
to<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.680> fifth<00:05:32.890> fret<00:05:33.100> so<00:05:33.850> it's

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.360 

and<00:05:37.199> then<00:05:38.199> just<00:05:38.379> do<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.530> same<00:05:38.650> thing<00:05:38.830> then<00:05:39.220> but

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
and then just do the same thing then but

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.080 
and then just do the same thing then but
with<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:39.639> B<00:05:39.849> note<00:05:41.729> and<00:05:42.729> once<00:05:42.909> you've<00:05:43.060> done

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
with the B note and once you've done

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
with the B note and once you've done
that<00:05:43.300> does<00:05:43.840> revert<00:05:44.169> back<00:05:44.349> to<00:05:44.500> the<00:05:44.590> pattern<00:05:49.110> so

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
that does revert back to the pattern so

00:05:50.110 --> 00:06:11.570 
that does revert back to the pattern so
stab<00:05:50.379> look<00:05:50.560> at<00:05:50.650> that<00:05:50.740> a<00:05:50.770> bit<00:05:50.949> slower

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.130 

anyways<00:06:12.580> happy<00:06:12.790> practice<00:06:13.300> have<00:06:13.510> fun<00:06:13.750> and<00:06:14.050> I'll

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
anyways happy practice have fun and I'll

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
anyways happy practice have fun and I'll
see<00:06:14.170> you<00:06:14.560> at<00:06:14.740> the<00:06:14.860> next<00:06:15.010> lesson<00:06:15.250> bye<00:06:15.910> for<00:06:16.120> now
