 for now decoration at home.com 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.670
 this Saturday will show you how to do the 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.800
 called green roof an option for 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.929
 who wants to have a beautiful garden and does not have 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.670
 lots of space then for those who want to leave 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.670
 the most airy house 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.330
 when we look at a city like this 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.610
 high is common to see conventional roofs 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.550
 but this is changing a lot of people 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.140
 started to stay by the green roof beyond 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.510
 to improve the environment 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.220
 the house of a new space I went to check 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.379
 some tips on how you can make 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.839
 possible this system of roofs 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.420
 allows you to have gardens and 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:49.309
 in a few centimeters thick 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.470
 thanks to the technology of their land or 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.690
 substrate then crying here and 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.960
 vegetation actually forms. 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.600
 a carpet on top of the roof slab 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.789
 this carpet and weighs about 60 kilos and 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.350
 It has seven centimeters thick can 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.350
 be applied to any surface 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.300
 either lages but can also be made 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.340
 on a metallic roof tile 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.200
 metallic or even compensated 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.270
 unfeasible the assembly process is 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.460
 It's too simple for this to be a 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.860
 waterproofing against water 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.660
 from the rain over there come bedin that is 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.820
 similar to the blanket he serves 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.190
 only to separate the garden from the 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.679
 this blanket what he calls manta jandrey 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.380
 before it takes the water to the leads 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:36.530
 drain these into the special substrate 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.679
 which is where technology is and above 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.090
 comes meditation bought in the market 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.340
 floriculture even you can use 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.470
 different sizes of plants what will 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.170
 varying the thickness of the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.330
 substrate of this special land for 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.330
 you make a shrub a lawn 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.140
 this house with green roof she has to 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.090
 benefits up to minus 18 degrees in 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.130
 temperature of your cooling slab 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.440
 very home the other question are services 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.480
 environment is improved if the microclimate 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.870
 around the house prevents pollution 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.870
 sound 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.510
 but what is most advanced even in 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.790
 building sustainability issue 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.430
 green roofing that improves the 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.650
 condition of the city is the formation of 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.090
 small forests the toppings 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.130
 this here is a fragment of forest 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.800
 with an area of up to three meters 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.650
 height of different species and that 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.710
 are in 20 centimeters of substrates 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.310
 in this case, this forest has only 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.480
 300 400 kg per square meter which is 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.480
 very light a construction 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.849
 is very common in roof designs 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.819
 times also green walls to form 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:53.410
 really an integral green space in the 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.410
 your house an urban blue 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.849
 on our website you 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.220
 find other roof designs 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.959
 green including vegetation said 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.959
 wrong and medium-sized trees
