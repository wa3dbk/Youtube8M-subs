by dot PNG and most of the pictures that

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.260 
by dot PNG and most of the pictures that
come<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:45.690> are<00:01:45.810> going<00:01:45.900> to<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:46.050> winders<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.490> yeah

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
come up are going to be winders so yeah

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.210 
come up are going to be winders so yeah
that's<00:01:48.870> like<00:01:49.080> a<00:01:49.110> hold<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.620> tutorial

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that's like a hold of this tutorial

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.170 
that's like a hold of this tutorial
anyways<00:01:51.260> alright<00:01:52.260> so<00:01:52.830> Hegel's<00:01:53.670> my<00:01:53.760> picture

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
anyways alright so Hegel's my picture

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.990 
anyways alright so Hegel's my picture
and<00:01:54.360> obviously<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.500> render<00:01:55.830> is<00:01:55.920> too<00:01:56.160> big<00:01:56.400> to

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
and obviously the render is too big to

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.440 
and obviously the render is too big to
fit<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.780> 120-140<00:01:58.740> range<00:01:59.210> so<00:02:00.210> we're<00:02:00.300> going

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
fit in the 120-140 range so we're going

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.950 
fit in the 120-140 range so we're going
to<00:02:00.540> use<00:02:00.720> a<00:02:00.750> scale<00:02:01.140> tool<00:02:01.610> click<00:02:02.690> make<00:02:03.690> sure<00:02:03.810> this

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
to use a scale tool click make sure this

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.630 
to use a scale tool click make sure this
chain<00:02:04.230> is<00:02:04.380> linked<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.100> we<00:02:05.280> don't<00:02:05.400> lose

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
chain is linked so we don't lose

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.199 
chain is linked so we don't lose
anything<00:02:06.600> or<00:02:07.020> make<00:02:07.470> anything<00:02:07.500> worse<00:02:08.209> cuz

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
anything or make anything worse cuz

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.949 
anything or make anything worse cuz
scaling<00:02:09.659> is<00:02:09.780> already<00:02:10.080> bad<00:02:11.120> alright<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.629> go

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
scaling is already bad alright so go

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.990 
scaling is already bad alright so go
ahead<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.260> scale<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.650> turn<00:02:13.860> around<00:02:14.519> that<00:02:14.730> size

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
ahead and scale it turn around that size

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.630 
ahead and scale it turn around that size
went<00:02:15.239> all<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.569> way<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.260> size<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:17.550> they

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
went all the way to that size so they

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.670 
went all the way to that size so they
can<00:02:17.790> move<00:02:17.909> the<00:02:18.060> rigor<00:02:18.269> around<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.659> little<00:02:18.780> bit

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.899 

there<00:02:22.340> we<00:02:22.430> go<00:02:22.780> perfect<00:02:23.780> position<00:02:24.849> all<00:02:25.849> right

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:25.909 
there we go perfect position all right

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.809 
there we go perfect position all right
now<00:02:26.510> what<00:02:27.049> I'm<00:02:27.110> going<00:02:27.379> to<00:02:27.439> do<00:02:27.650> is<00:02:27.860> click<00:02:28.549> on<00:02:28.610> the

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
now what I'm going to do is click on the

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.920 
now what I'm going to do is click on the
render<00:02:29.030> layer<00:02:29.569> right<00:02:30.560> there<00:02:31.540> click<00:02:32.540> layer

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
render layer right there click layer

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.699 
render layer right there click layer
transparency<00:02:33.970> threshold<00:02:34.970> alpha<00:02:35.560> now<00:02:36.560> what

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
transparency threshold alpha now what

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.520 
transparency threshold alpha now what
this<00:02:36.890> will<00:02:37.069> do<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.989> roughing<00:02:38.989> off<00:02:39.109> the<00:02:39.230> edges

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
this will do is roughing off the edges

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.319 
this will do is roughing off the edges
of<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.709> render<00:02:40.069> to<00:02:40.640> make<00:02:40.849> sure<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.150> doesn't

little<00:03:20.389> color<00:03:20.959> loss<00:03:21.230> problem<00:03:21.799> if<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:22.069> haven't

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
little color loss problem if you haven't

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.000 
little color loss problem if you haven't
already<00:03:22.459> heard<00:03:22.730> about<00:03:23.000> it<00:03:23.180> so<00:03:23.959> yeah<00:03:24.409> like<00:03:24.680> um

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.229 
already heard about it so yeah like um
what<00:03:25.819> causes<00:03:26.060> that<00:03:26.359> is<00:03:26.949> pictures<00:03:28.030> that<00:03:29.030> have

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
what causes that is pictures that have

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.640 
what causes that is pictures that have
more<00:03:29.540> than<00:03:29.720> 256<00:03:30.199> colors<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:31.329> they<00:03:32.329> just<00:03:32.650> try

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
more than 256 colors and they just try

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.050 
more than 256 colors and they just try
to<00:03:33.739> even<00:03:33.980> out<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.099> color<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:34.639> everything's

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
to even out the color so everything's

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.270 
to even out the color so everything's
like<00:03:35.209> a<00:03:35.239> big<00:03:35.510> old<00:03:35.660> blob<00:03:36.319> Chisolm<00:03:36.709> messes<00:03:37.129> all

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
like a big old blob Chisolm messes all

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.699 
like a big old blob Chisolm messes all
over<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:37.609> place<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.269> this<00:03:39.019> looks<00:03:39.290> very<00:03:39.379> very

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
over the place and this looks very very

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.210 
over the place and this looks very very
hideous<00:03:40.209> so<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.900> get<00:03:42.470> around<00:03:42.500> that<00:03:42.799> you<00:03:43.069> just

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
hideous so to get around that you just

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.339 
hideous so to get around that you just
need<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.519> pick<00:03:43.669> a<00:03:43.730> render<00:03:44.060> with<00:03:44.180> low<00:03:44.329> colors<00:03:44.750> or

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
need to pick a render with low colors or

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.110 
need to pick a render with low colors or
if<00:03:45.379> you<00:03:45.590> have<00:03:45.739> a<00:03:45.769> render<00:03:46.159> that<00:03:46.579> you<00:03:46.730> really

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
if you have a render that you really

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.780 
if you have a render that you really
really<00:03:47.239> want<00:03:47.389> to<00:03:47.690> portrait<00:03:48.310> go<00:03:49.310> ahead<00:03:49.579> and<00:03:49.730> try

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
really want to portrait go ahead and try

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.330 
really want to portrait go ahead and try
to<00:03:49.879> lower<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.239> saturation<00:03:50.419> or<00:03:51.250> lessen<00:03:52.250> the

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
to lower the saturation or lessen the

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.399 
to lower the saturation or lessen the
colors<00:03:52.669> before<00:03:52.970> indexing<00:03:53.810> here<00:03:53.989> so<00:03:54.229> you'll

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
colors before indexing here so you'll

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.369 
colors before indexing here so you'll
get<00:03:54.590> is<00:03:54.799> as<00:03:55.069> much<00:03:55.760> color<00:03:56.569> loss<00:03:56.750> as<00:03:56.989> you<00:03:57.139> would

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
get is as much color loss as you would

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.050 
get is as much color loss as you would
in<00:03:58.159> little<00:03:59.060> way<00:03:59.389> go<00:04:00.199> ahead<00:04:00.620> a<00:04:00.790> enough<00:04:01.790> chitchat
