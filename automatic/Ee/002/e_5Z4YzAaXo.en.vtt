00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.379
 BMW enters completely uncharted territory and delivers after only four years 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:11.929
 development time 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.929
 mix since 2009 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.220
 to the final version 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.470
 when they join their team Motopark Academy 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.470
 since up to 7 BMW leaves 1000 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.839
 the result can really be seen slim down to the machine despite 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.100
 its 999 cc and slightly st 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.280
 ready to start with a full tank brings 1706 comma 5 kilograms on the scales 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.960
 strikingly the Namib and the ergonomics were placed great value 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.050
 after all, that should feel good 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.050
 all who clearly demand their functions 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.680
 with 193 hp, the machine is a true monster 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.370
 so they too 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.260
 remains wonderful 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.850
 are extra for 1000 220 euros 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.980
 Duel Sawiris and the traction control DTC highly recommended 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.960
 the driver can choose four different polls 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.330
 the power is at one hundred 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.149
 PS throttled 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.920
 a little more agile the sport mode 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920
 here are already the full 100 93 better 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.980
 Depending on the type of tires, the modes Uris and Slick increased for the racetrack 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.650
 for even more driving fun the optional assistant seems to do that 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.340
 Upshifting without the use of the clutch 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.360
 Uri's ADRs and the PC can also be made of Scots should the driver 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.720
 but know his own border area exactly 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.720
 then the host will get racing 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.290
 2iq 9 seconds accelerates the machine from the stand 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.429
 from 15 thousand 500 euros is the BMW s 1000 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:14.629
 to get in Germany
