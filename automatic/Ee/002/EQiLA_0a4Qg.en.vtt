I<00:00:03.790> don't<00:00:04.790> usually<00:00:05.029> begin<00:00:05.479> my<00:00:05.600> videos<00:00:05.930> with

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.140 
I don't usually begin my videos with

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.190 
I don't usually begin my videos with
this<00:00:06.319> a<00:00:06.560> but<00:00:07.059> stop<00:00:08.059> watching<00:00:08.480> this<00:00:08.660> if<00:00:08.929> you

haven't<00:00:09.410> already<00:00:09.650> seen<00:00:09.920> my<00:00:10.099> video<00:00:10.400> about

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:10.879 
haven't already seen my video about

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.419 
haven't already seen my video about
ambient<00:00:11.240> lights<00:00:11.570> versus<00:00:12.139> LED<00:00:12.620> notifications

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
ambient lights versus LED notifications

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.820 
ambient lights versus LED notifications
it's<00:00:14.389> over<00:00:14.780> on<00:00:14.929> the<00:00:15.049> left<00:00:15.259> side<00:00:15.379> of<00:00:15.530> the<00:00:15.589> screen

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
it's over on the left side of the screen

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.009 
it's over on the left side of the screen
right<00:00:16.040> now<00:00:16.190> so<00:00:16.730> give<00:00:17.029> it<00:00:17.060> a<00:00:17.240> click<00:00:17.420> and<00:00:17.600> give<00:00:17.930> it

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:18.019 
right now so give it a click and give it

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:19.990 
right now so give it a click and give it
to<00:00:18.050> watch<00:00:18.289> I'll<00:00:18.529> see<00:00:18.859> you<00:00:19.039> in<00:00:19.189> a<00:00:19.279> few<00:00:19.490> minutes

to watch I'll see you in a few minutes
welcome<00:00:20.960> back<00:00:21.199> now<00:00:21.529> as<00:00:22.279> well<00:00:22.609> as<00:00:22.789> LED

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
welcome back now as well as LED

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:24.609 
welcome back now as well as LED
notification<00:00:23.420> lights<00:00:24.170> being<00:00:24.410> more

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
notification lights being more

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.679 
notification lights being more
functionally<00:00:25.369> sensible<00:00:25.910> of<00:00:26.029> an<00:00:26.179> an<00:00:26.300> ambient

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
functionally sensible of an an ambient

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.560 
functionally sensible of an an ambient
sensor<00:00:26.869> in<00:00:27.289> my<00:00:27.980> opinion<00:00:28.460> of<00:00:28.550> course<00:00:28.730> there<00:00:29.390> is

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
sensor in my opinion of course there is

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.839 
sensor in my opinion of course there is
also<00:00:29.779> a<00:00:29.960> design<00:00:30.560> flaw<00:00:30.920> when<00:00:31.220> you<00:00:31.369> use<00:00:31.670> the

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
also a design flaw when you use the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.420 
also a design flaw when you use the
ambient<00:00:32.270> light<00:00:32.570> and<00:00:32.960> this<00:00:33.590> is<00:00:33.860> what<00:00:33.950> it<00:00:34.250> is

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
ambient light and this is what it is

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.760 
ambient light and this is what it is
when<00:00:35.180> you<00:00:35.329> pick<00:00:35.510> up<00:00:35.540> a<00:00:35.690> nexus<00:00:35.989> 6<00:00:36.200> V<00:00:36.350> and<00:00:36.590> beat

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
when you pick up a nexus 6 V and beat

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.799 
when you pick up a nexus 6 V and beat
notifications<00:00:37.520> that<00:00:37.640> will<00:00:37.790> display<00:00:38.000> but<00:00:38.690> as

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
notifications that will display but as

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.569 
notifications that will display but as
soon<00:00:39.050> as<00:00:39.170> you<00:00:39.320> touch<00:00:39.559> the<00:00:39.590> screen<00:00:39.890> that<00:00:40.309> makes

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
soon as you touch the screen that makes

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.569 
soon as you touch the screen that makes
the<00:00:40.760> Nexus<00:00:41.329> 6<00:00:41.840> active<00:00:42.410> because<00:00:43.100> it<00:00:43.219> assumes

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
the Nexus 6 active because it assumes

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.250 
the Nexus 6 active because it assumes
you<00:00:44.030> want<00:00:44.059> to<00:00:44.420> unlock<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.899> device

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
you want to unlock the device

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.369 
you want to unlock the device
so<00:00:45.890> it's<00:00:46.010> preparing<00:00:46.430> a<00:00:46.640> follow-up<00:00:46.969> action<00:00:47.510> but

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
so it's preparing a follow-up action but

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.290 
so it's preparing a follow-up action but
the<00:00:48.469> premise<00:00:48.710> behind<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.340> ambient<00:00:49.760> sensor<00:00:49.940> is

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
the premise behind the ambient sensor is

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.910 
the premise behind the ambient sensor is
to<00:00:50.510> encourage<00:00:50.809> you<00:00:51.079> to<00:00:51.260> look<00:00:51.410> at<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.649> device

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
to encourage you to look at the device

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.889 
to encourage you to look at the device
without<00:00:52.430> actually<00:00:53.030> having<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.300> touch<00:00:53.570> it<00:00:53.780> and

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
without actually having to touch it and

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.099 
without actually having to touch it and
unlock<00:00:54.559> it<00:00:54.770> so<00:00:55.520> we<00:00:55.699> have<00:00:55.969> a<00:00:56.270> catch-22

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
unlock it so we have a catch-22

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.860 
unlock it so we have a catch-22
situation<00:00:57.260> here<00:00:58.359> sometimes<00:00:59.359> you<00:00:59.539> just<00:00:59.570> want

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
situation here sometimes you just want

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.020 
situation here sometimes you just want
to<00:00:59.930> check<00:01:00.199> your<00:01:00.350> device<00:01:00.680> sometimes<00:01:01.550> you<00:01:01.730> want

to check your device sometimes you want

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.600 
to check your device sometimes you want
to<00:01:02.090> use<00:01:02.210> your<00:01:02.600> device<00:01:02.899> and<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.710> Nexus<00:01:04.100> 6<00:01:04.309> can't

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
to use your device and the Nexus 6 can't

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.790 
to use your device and the Nexus 6 can't
distinguish<00:01:05.060> between<00:01:05.120> the<00:01:05.540> two<00:01:05.750> if<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:06.590> do

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
distinguish between the two if you do

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.100 
distinguish between the two if you do
something<00:01:07.070> like<00:01:07.400> this<00:01:07.640> by<00:01:07.910> accident<00:01:08.120> let's

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
something like this by accident let's

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.510 
something like this by accident let's
say<00:01:09.320> you're<00:01:09.530> walking<00:01:09.680> down<00:01:09.980> the<00:01:10.040> street<00:01:10.400> and

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
say you're walking down the street and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.650 
say you're walking down the street and
you<00:01:10.700> quickly<00:01:10.910> want<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.330> check<00:01:11.510> your

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
you quickly want to check your

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.870 
you quickly want to check your
notifications<00:01:11.870> you<00:01:12.740> glance<00:01:13.070> at<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.340> Nexus<00:01:13.670> 6

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
notifications you glance at the Nexus 6

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.580 
notifications you glance at the Nexus 6
and<00:01:14.090> then<00:01:14.480> drop<00:01:14.750> it<00:01:14.900> back<00:01:14.930> into<00:01:15.260> your<00:01:15.380> coat

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
and then drop it back into your coat

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.940 
and then drop it back into your coat
pocket<00:01:15.820> but<00:01:16.820> it's<00:01:17.000> unlocked<00:01:17.510> itself<00:01:18.020> the

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
pocket but it's unlocked itself the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.530 
pocket but it's unlocked itself the
reason<00:01:19.310> for<00:01:19.430> this<00:01:19.550> is<00:01:19.760> because<00:01:19.850> when<00:01:20.360> I<00:01:20.390> was

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
reason for this is because when I was

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.540 
reason for this is because when I was
putting<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.020> phone<00:01:21.350> into<00:01:21.650> my<00:01:21.740> coat<00:01:21.950> pocket<00:01:22.160> my

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
putting the phone into my coat pocket my

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.610 
putting the phone into my coat pocket my
phone<00:01:22.850> caught<00:01:23.150> on<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.450> screen<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:23.960> when<00:01:24.470> you

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
phone caught on the screen and when you

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.350 
phone caught on the screen and when you
drop<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:24.950> screen<00:01:25.280> into<00:01:25.490> your<00:01:25.610> pocket<00:01:25.970> your

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
drop the screen into your pocket your

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.870 
drop the screen into your pocket your
phone<00:01:26.630> that<00:01:26.780> swipes<00:01:27.110> up<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:28.160> unlocking

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
phone that swipes up the unlocking

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.980 
process of a Nexus 6
here's<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.700> same<00:01:31.910> demonstration<00:01:32.540> a<00:01:32.690> little

here's the same demonstration a little

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.200 
here's the same demonstration a little
more<00:01:33.140> slowly<00:01:33.470> now<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.610> course<00:01:34.790> in<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.180> real

more slowly now of course in the real
world<00:01:35.660> this<00:01:35.990> is<00:01:36.050> a<00:01:36.290> fairly<00:01:36.710> rare<00:01:37.190> occurrence

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
world this is a fairly rare occurrence

dramatic effect but in my real world
experiences<00:01:43.760> there<00:01:44.060> have<00:01:44.270> been<00:01:44.420> two

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
experiences there have been two

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.660 
experiences there have been two
occasions<00:01:44.990> where<00:01:45.680> YouTube<00:01:46.190> videos<00:01:46.490> have

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
occasions where YouTube videos have

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.240 
occasions where YouTube videos have
randomly<00:01:47.150> started<00:01:47.480> playing<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:48.250> another

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250
