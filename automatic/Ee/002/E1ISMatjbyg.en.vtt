one or so centimeters apart it's not
important<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.009> measure<00:01:13.340> you<00:01:13.759> can<00:01:13.939> eyeball<00:01:14.090> it

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.899 

once<00:01:20.200> you<00:01:20.409> have<00:01:20.620> something<00:01:20.950> that<00:01:21.190> looks<00:01:21.400> like

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
once you have something that looks like

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.090 
once you have something that looks like
this<00:01:22.180> go<00:01:22.479> ahead<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:22.990> give<00:01:23.170> it<00:01:23.200> a<00:01:23.350> cone<00:01:23.620> shape

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
this go ahead and give it a cone shape

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.820 
this go ahead and give it a cone shape
put<00:01:24.820> some<00:01:25.090> glue<00:01:25.360> on<00:01:25.600> one<00:01:25.659> of<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.110> sides<00:01:26.440> and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
put some glue on one of the sides and

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:40.940 
put some glue on one of the sides and
create<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.460> cone<00:01:27.760> and<00:01:28.120> we're<00:01:28.570> halfway<00:01:28.780> there

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.040 

if<00:01:41.950> you<00:01:42.190> want<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:42.580> make<00:01:42.759> it<00:01:42.940> more<00:01:43.090> sturdy<00:01:43.450> do

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
if you want to make it more sturdy do

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.320 
if you want to make it more sturdy do
what<00:01:44.229> I<00:01:44.259> did<00:01:44.410> and<00:01:44.680> put<00:01:45.070> some<00:01:45.310> newspaper<00:01:45.490> inside

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
what I did and put some newspaper inside

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.210 
what I did and put some newspaper inside
so<00:01:46.840> that<00:01:47.110> it<00:01:47.229> will<00:01:47.320> keep<00:01:47.530> its<00:01:47.740> shape<00:01:47.800> and

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
so that it will keep its shape and

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.790 
so that it will keep its shape and
you'll<00:01:49.119> probably<00:01:49.479> be<00:01:49.930> able<00:01:50.050> to<00:01:50.410> use<00:01:50.530> it<00:01:50.710> again

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
you'll probably be able to use it again

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:59.850 
you'll probably be able to use it again
next<00:01:51.160> year<00:01:57.420> after<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:58.450> you'll<00:01:59.080> have<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.560> fold

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
next year after that you'll have to fold

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.060 
next year after that you'll have to fold
those<00:02:00.160> cutouts<00:02:00.550> towards<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.630> inside<00:02:02.170> put

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
those cutouts towards the inside put

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.950 
those cutouts towards the inside put
some<00:02:03.310> glue<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:03.759> lay<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.060> over<00:02:04.240> some<00:02:04.600> figured

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960

used the plain sight but it doesn't

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.510 
used the plain sight but it doesn't
really<00:02:23.780> matter<00:02:24.080> nobody's<00:02:24.680> gonna<00:02:24.830> be<00:02:25.040> able<00:02:25.160> to

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
that was created from the small part we

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.300 
that was created from the small part we
cut<00:02:44.840> from<00:02:45.110> before<00:02:47.470> let's<00:02:48.470> left<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:48.920> do<00:02:49.100> now<00:02:49.130> is

cut from before let's left to do now is
to<00:02:49.730> just<00:02:49.970> wrap<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.600> string<00:02:50.930> around<00:02:50.960> the<00:02:51.440> cone

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
to just wrap the string around the cone

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.950

bits of glue every now and again for a

bits of glue every now and again for a
more<00:02:56.600> secure<00:02:57.050> result<00:03:09.430> when<00:03:10.430> you<00:03:10.610> reach<00:03:10.820> to<00:03:11.150> the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
more secure result when you reach to the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.750 
more secure result when you reach to the
end<00:03:11.480> make<00:03:11.900> sure<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.650> end<00:03:12.800> of<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.130> string<00:03:13.460> it's

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
end make sure the end of the string it's

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.420 
end make sure the end of the string it's
hidden<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.450> also<00:03:15.350> that<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:15.680> won't<00:03:16.010> unwrap

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
hidden and also that it won't unwrap

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.800 
hidden and also that it won't unwrap
itself<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:19.190> I<00:03:19.400> thought<00:03:19.730> this<00:03:20.090> was<00:03:20.330> gonna<00:03:20.450> take

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
itself and I thought this was gonna take

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.110 
itself and I thought this was gonna take
me<00:03:21.020> all<00:03:21.050> night<00:03:21.170> but<00:03:21.860> it<00:03:22.190> didn't<00:03:22.460> take<00:03:22.670> as<00:03:22.880> long

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
me all night but it didn't take as long

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.240 
me all night but it didn't take as long
as<00:03:23.300> I<00:03:23.420> thought<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:23.900> would<00:03:24.110> and<00:03:24.350> why<00:03:24.980> do<00:03:25.040> I

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
as I thought it would and why do I

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.180 
as I thought it would and why do I
always<00:03:25.340> find<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.300> most<00:03:26.510> time-consuming
