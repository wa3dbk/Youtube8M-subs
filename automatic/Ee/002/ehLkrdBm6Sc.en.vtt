00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
so I really really like the hair as you

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.939 
so I really really like the hair as you
can<00:04:32.660> see<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:32.960> brush<00:04:33.139> is<00:04:33.320> going<00:04:33.500> through<00:04:33.830> it

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
can see the brush is going through it

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:40.510 
can see the brush is going through it
like<00:04:34.100> really<00:04:34.280> even<00:04:38.680> as<00:04:39.680> far<00:04:39.830> as<00:04:39.979> shedding<00:04:40.310> goes

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
like really even as far as shedding goes

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.939 
like really even as far as shedding goes
it's<00:04:41.240> not<00:04:41.449> enough<00:04:41.720> to<00:04:41.900> for<00:04:42.260> me<00:04:42.380> to<00:04:42.500> even<00:04:42.770> notice

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
it's not enough to for me to even notice

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.980 
it's not enough to for me to even notice
if<00:04:43.310> it<00:04:43.460> is<00:04:43.580> shedding<00:04:43.850> I<00:04:44.090> haven't<00:04:44.449> noticed<00:04:44.810> it

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
if it is shedding I haven't noticed it

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.409 
if it is shedding I haven't noticed it
so<00:04:45.889> if<00:04:46.010> it<00:04:46.130> has<00:04:46.310> been<00:04:46.520> shining<00:04:46.790> it's<00:04:47.030> been<00:04:47.180> very

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
so if it has been shining it's been very

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.810 
so if it has been shining it's been very
very<00:04:47.600> minimal<00:04:48.110> yeah<00:04:48.620> so<00:04:48.889> I<00:04:49.130> really<00:04:49.669> really

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
very minimal yeah so I really really

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.460 
very minimal yeah so I really really
like<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.120> hair<00:04:50.389> like<00:04:50.750> I<00:04:50.840> said<00:04:51.020> I've<00:04:51.139> had<00:04:51.320> it

next day I was good to go but I did know
what<00:05:26.900> is<00:05:26.990> that<00:05:27.020> about<00:05:27.169> the<00:05:27.440> hair<00:05:27.650> like<00:05:27.830> after<00:05:28.160> I

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
what is that about the hair like after I

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.250 
what is that about the hair like after I
washed<00:05:28.520> it<00:05:28.789> it<00:05:29.030> was<00:05:29.180> like<00:05:29.330> what<00:05:29.810> happened<00:05:30.169> to

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
washed it it was like what happened to

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.080 
washed it it was like what happened to
this<00:05:30.380> hair<00:05:30.590> and<00:05:30.950> I<00:05:31.280> didn't<00:05:31.490> realize<00:05:31.760> it<00:05:31.940> but<00:05:32.030> a

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
this hair and I didn't realize it but a

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.120
