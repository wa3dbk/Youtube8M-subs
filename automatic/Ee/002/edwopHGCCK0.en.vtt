00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.729
 Phi is the nose this time let's compared 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.530
 Have a collection with Shakin and Blue Star soldiers of the Chuggington Diecast Series 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:13.330
 In will deliver 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.820
 We will raise the Blue Star of the Chuggington Collection 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.720
 dee 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.199
 The left is the Chuggington Collection and the right is 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.810
 I will look in detail in the Ginton die cast series 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:33.330
 First of all it is an expression, but in the die cast series of the collection the opening of the mouth is slightly different 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.700
 The size of the window of the part of the day is different too. 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.720
 I have seen 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:44.000
 Collection see doing this I have a little look at the right and 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.900
 There is an impression that the Chuggington collection is slightly plump, and it is slightly softer 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.059
 It becomes 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:54.800
 Next, I'm looking at coloring first , but it's a pattern, but the shape of windows and doors around here 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.579
 There is a difference but 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:03.920
 It is almost the same About the employment It is almost the same 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:08.250
 Urawa form but different Which also to there mark of the product or the like 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:13.010
 I do not almost the position up after window Toka door 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:16.160
 The form and this kind of funny part are completely the same 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:20.060
 There is almost no change in the coloring system 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:24.350
 Here is the Chuggington Collection quite thin 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:28.250
 The outline of the yellow edge is also firmly out of the line and finished beautifully 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:33.030
 It is okay to see something in the latter half of Ueno 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:39.330
 I die cast in water, but this is also yellow as well 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.470
 But up of the edges have been introduced before Ne'm beautiful Hi is still county tee thing that so 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.659
 I think there is 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.350
 Although it is texture, this is totally different in position and die casting after all 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.020
 I will 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.020
 I There is a profound feeling and the beauty of the people of the still die-cast series in terms of the texture 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.079
 Well simply 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.619
 It is the difference in the material in it is a measurement 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:03.579
 Length 9.3 cm Papa 3.2 cm 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:07.960
 Height 3.7 cm and 12.2 cm 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:13.010
 It is a weight of 506.5 g and it is a measurement of the die cast series subsequently 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.650
 Length 9.3 cm Width 2.5 cm Height 3.8 cm 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.760
 Up 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.689
 12.4cm body weight is 70 4.5g and 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.909
 Chuggington I was comparing this to properly of die-cast series Blue Star 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:28.810
 After all the expression 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:32.260
 Soft and towards the tea gate collection Do not you feel close to the TV 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:36.370
 As for the line , it looks like neither will change 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.540
 There is a reality towards the still For the texture tea Gin tons of die-cast series 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.530
 I felt like 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:45.569
 Of us will tea Gin tons collections and tea Gin tons die-cast series, which compared more 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.569
