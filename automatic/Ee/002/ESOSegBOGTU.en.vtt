00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
the belief that switching to biology was

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.510 
the belief that switching to biology was
still<00:00:58.660> the<00:00:58.780> right<00:00:58.809> call<00:00:59.260> I<00:00:59.559> think<00:00:59.980> that<00:01:00.309> a<00:01:00.340> lot

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
still the right call I think that a lot

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.950 
still the right call I think that a lot
of<00:01:00.550> people<00:01:00.879> know<00:01:01.030> their<00:01:01.329> sign<00:01:01.629> well<00:01:01.809> I<00:01:01.840> think

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
of people know their sign well I think

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.240 
of people know their sign well I think
most<00:01:02.260> people<00:01:02.590> know<00:01:02.620> what<00:01:02.710> they're<00:01:02.890> signing<00:01:03.040> up

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
most people know what they're signing up

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.590 
most people know what they're signing up
for<00:01:03.399> when<00:01:03.550> they're<00:01:03.700> going<00:01:03.730> to<00:01:03.969> the<00:01:04.149> sciences

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
for when they're going to the sciences

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.779 
for when they're going to the sciences
so<00:01:04.839> he's<00:01:05.350> doing<00:01:05.679> well<00:01:05.829> in<00:01:05.979> school<00:01:06.009> that

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:06.789
