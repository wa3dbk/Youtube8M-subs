bit<00:01:12.850> up<00:01:12.940> just<00:01:13.270> because<00:01:13.450> of<00:01:13.660> them<00:01:13.810> it's<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.380> bit

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
bit up just because of them it's a bit

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.780 
bit up just because of them it's a bit
tricky<00:01:14.890> first<00:01:15.130> of<00:01:15.250> all<00:01:15.310> to<00:01:15.430> get<00:01:15.520> into<00:01:15.670> these

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
tricky first of all to get into these

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.790 
tricky first of all to get into these
boxes<00:01:16.570> when<00:01:16.720> they're<00:01:16.900> designed<00:01:17.500> like<00:01:17.650> this

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
boxes when they're designed like this

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.710 
boxes when they're designed like this
and<00:01:18.070> I<00:01:18.310> didn't<00:01:19.000> realize<00:01:19.210> you<00:01:19.300> can<00:01:19.420> just<00:01:19.540> put

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
and I didn't realize you can just put

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.840 
and I didn't realize you can just put
them<00:01:19.810> open<00:01:20.080> so<00:01:20.350> I'll<00:01:20.979> fast<00:01:21.250> forward<00:01:21.340> that<00:01:21.670> bits

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
them open so I'll fast forward that bits

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.850 
them open so I'll fast forward that bits
you'd<00:01:22.030> have<00:01:22.210> to<00:01:22.360> watch<00:01:22.479> it<00:01:22.690> but<00:01:22.960> I<00:01:23.200> have<00:01:23.680> a<00:01:23.740> way

here<00:02:52.390> from<00:02:52.569> cracking<00:02:53.020> when<00:02:53.319> you<00:02:53.440> put<00:02:53.620> it

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
here from cracking when you put it

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:54.750 
here from cracking when you put it
around<00:02:53.800> your<00:02:54.099> head<00:02:54.220> there's<00:02:54.520> a<00:02:54.550> bit<00:02:54.700> of

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
around your head there's a bit of

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.410 
around your head there's a bit of
flexibility<00:02:55.330> in<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.599> the<00:02:56.410> foam<00:02:56.739> pads<00:02:57.610> feel

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
flexibility in it the foam pads feel

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.050 
flexibility in it the foam pads feel
very<00:02:58.660> soft<00:02:59.020> at<00:02:59.770> the<00:02:59.860> moment<00:03:00.310> I'm<00:03:00.489> curious<00:03:00.849> as

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
very soft at the moment I'm curious as

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.030 
very soft at the moment I'm curious as
to<00:03:01.090> what<00:03:01.270> they'll<00:03:01.390> be<00:03:01.420> like<00:03:01.540> once<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:02.170> stick

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
to what they'll be like once you stick

them on of course your heads or your

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.710 
them on of course your heads or your
headset<00:03:05.620> your<00:03:05.770> headset<00:03:06.069> microphone<00:03:06.720> raises

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
headset your headset microphone raises

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
all the way up if you want to keep out

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.590 
all the way up if you want to keep out
of<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.160> way<00:03:09.280> that's<00:03:09.849> a<00:03:10.000> very<00:03:10.180> nice<00:03:10.300> action

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
of the way that's a very nice action

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.470 
of the way that's a very nice action
there

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
there

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.930 
there
the<00:03:12.110> microphone<00:03:12.920> apparently<00:03:13.340> is<00:03:13.489> a<00:03:13.520> noise

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
the microphone apparently is a noise

the microphone apparently is a noise
cancelling<00:03:14.900> headphones<00:03:15.170> enough<00:03:16.129> to<00:03:16.250> put<00:03:16.370> this

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.540 
cancelling headphones enough to put this
to<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.670> test<00:03:16.730> later<00:03:17.239> as<00:03:18.050> well<00:03:18.349> on<00:03:18.860> the

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
scroll it forward to one end or scroll

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.380 
scroll it forward to one end or scroll
it<00:03:32.690> backwards<00:03:33.080> to<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.319> other<00:03:33.730> as<00:03:34.730> in<00:03:35.030> regards

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
it backwards to the other as in regards

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.270 
it backwards to the other as in regards
to<00:03:35.450> your<00:03:35.599> connection<00:03:36.140> it's<00:03:36.739> a<00:03:36.890> three<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.250> a

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
to your connection it's a three and a

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.490 
to your connection it's a three and a
half<00:03:37.459> millimeter<00:03:38.330> headphone<00:03:38.720> jack<00:03:39.170> so<00:03:39.200> you've

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
half millimeter headphone jack so you've

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.000 
half millimeter headphone jack so you've
got<00:03:39.590> your<00:03:39.769> headphones<00:03:40.760> and<00:03:41.120> your<00:03:41.900> microphone

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
got your headphones and your microphone

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.759 
got your headphones and your microphone
as<00:03:43.010> well<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:44.330> cable<00:03:44.720> is<00:03:44.900> two<00:03:45.260> meters<00:03:45.739> in

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
as well and the cable is two meters in

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.289 
as well and the cable is two meters in
length<00:03:45.920> so<00:03:46.340> hopefully<00:03:46.730> it<00:03:46.819> should<00:03:47.000> just<00:03:47.180> be

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
length so hopefully it should just be

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.380 
length so hopefully it should just be
enough<00:03:47.630> for<00:03:47.870> me<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.549> sort<00:03:49.549> of<00:03:49.579> use<00:03:49.790> it<00:03:49.819> from<00:03:50.209> my

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
enough for me to sort of use it from my

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.640 
enough for me to sort of use it from my
gamer<00:03:50.630> so<00:03:50.840> maybe<00:03:51.049> they<00:03:51.200> should<00:03:51.319> have<00:03:51.410> done<00:03:51.560> it

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
gamer so maybe they should have done it

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.729 
gamer so maybe they should have done it
a<00:03:51.680> bit<00:03:51.950> longer<00:03:52.160> but<00:03:52.610> we'll<00:03:53.090> see<00:03:53.269> how<00:03:53.299> it<00:03:53.450> goes

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
a bit longer but we'll see how it goes

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.030 
a bit longer but we'll see how it goes

promising at the moment so in the next
clip<00:04:07.459> we<00:04:07.760> shall<00:04:08.360> test<00:04:08.599> out<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:09.140> microphone

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
clip we shall test out the microphone

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.090 
clip we shall test out the microphone
quality<00:04:14.440> okay<00:04:15.440> so<00:04:15.500> if<00:04:15.739> now<00:04:15.889> got<00:04:16.039> the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
quality okay so if now got the

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.560 
quality okay so if now got the
headphones<00:04:16.250> plugged<00:04:16.760> in<00:04:16.910> directly<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.479> the

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
headphones plugged in directly to the

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.650 
headphones plugged in directly to the
front<00:04:17.810> ports<00:04:18.289> of<00:04:18.470> my<00:04:18.889> PC<00:04:19.519> there<00:04:20.150> is<00:04:20.269> a<00:04:20.299> slight

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
front ports of my PC there is a slight

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.719 
front ports of my PC there is a slight
hiss<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:21.229> noise<00:04:21.410> that<00:04:21.650> you<00:04:21.769> get<00:04:22.100> and<00:04:22.340> this<00:04:22.430> can

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
hiss and noise that you get and this can

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.210 
hiss and noise that you get and this can
be<00:04:22.880> reduced<00:04:23.090> if<00:04:23.660> used<00:04:23.930> to<00:04:23.990> plug<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.560> inputs

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
be reduced if used to plug the inputs

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.310 
be reduced if used to plug the inputs
into<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:25.669> back<00:04:26.000> or<00:04:26.360> directly<00:04:27.020> into<00:04:27.200> the

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
into the back or directly into the

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.020 
into the back or directly into the
motherboard<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:27.889> does<00:04:28.100> reduce<00:04:28.639> this

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
motherboard that does reduce this

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.670 
motherboard that does reduce this
hissing<00:04:29.419> noise<00:04:29.690> slightly<00:04:30.370> otherwise<00:04:31.370> I

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
hissing noise slightly otherwise I

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.080 
hissing noise slightly otherwise I
hopefully<00:04:33.680> when<00:04:34.160> I<00:04:34.190> listen<00:04:34.700> back<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:34.880> this

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
hopefully when I listen back to this

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.450 
hopefully when I listen back to this
recording<00:04:35.570> it<00:04:35.630> should<00:04:35.840> be<00:04:35.990> clear<00:04:36.350> again<00:04:37.039> this

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
recording it should be clear again this

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.150 
recording it should be clear again this
is<00:04:37.610> only<00:04:37.700> a<00:04:37.820> 20<00:04:38.150> pound<00:04:38.300> headset<00:04:38.930> so<00:04:39.350> for<00:04:40.010> this

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
is only a 20 pound headset so for this

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.150 
is only a 20 pound headset so for this
quality<00:04:40.610> that<00:04:41.510> we're<00:04:41.690> getting<00:04:42.039> from<00:04:43.039> this

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
quality that we're getting from this

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.010 
quality that we're getting from this
device<00:04:43.490> is<00:04:43.850> still<00:04:44.090> quite<00:04:44.330> remarkable<00:04:44.810> it's

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020
