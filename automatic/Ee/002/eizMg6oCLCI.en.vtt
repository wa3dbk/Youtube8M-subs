00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
especially against protoss I mean it's a

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.310

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
maybe he can snipe off those supply

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.330 
maybe he can snipe off those supply

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
depots and really the Terran can't do an

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.340 
depots and really the Terran can't do an
awful<00:01:32.460> lot<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.880> respond<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.140> does

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
awful lot to respond to it but it does

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.560 
awful lot to respond to it but it does
work<00:01:34.590> against<00:01:35.009> early<00:01:35.369> zealot<00:01:36.000> pressure<00:01:36.240> the

work against early zealot pressure the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.520 
work against early zealot pressure the
question<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.900> are<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:36.990> going<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.200> see<00:01:37.320> any<00:01:37.470> of

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
question is are we going to see any of

more forces of stalkers which is really
what<00:05:07.099> he<00:05:07.219> needs<00:05:07.430> right<00:05:07.550> now<00:05:07.729> trying<00:05:08.539> to<00:05:08.599> charge

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
what he needs right now trying to charge

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.119 
what he needs right now trying to charge

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:10.129 
him with a single cell which actually

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.059 
him with a single cell which actually
almost<00:05:10.580> gets<00:05:10.879> killed<00:05:11.150> off<00:05:11.770> looks<00:05:12.770> like<00:05:12.860> it's

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:13.069 
almost gets killed off looks like it's

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:15.309 
almost gets killed off looks like it's
the<00:05:13.219> whole<00:05:13.460> game<00:05:13.789> you<00:05:14.240> gets<00:05:14.479> pissed<00:05:14.750> off<00:05:14.930> first

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:15.319 
the whole game you gets pissed off first

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.490 
the whole game you gets pissed off first
indeed<00:05:16.219> it's<00:05:16.460> a<00:05:16.550> risky<00:05:17.120> play<00:05:17.419> by<00:05:17.810> sock<00:05:18.229> right

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
indeed it's a risky play by sock right

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.680 
indeed it's a risky play by sock right
there<00:05:18.800> but<00:05:19.069> I<00:05:19.099> think<00:05:19.969> he'll<00:05:20.180> be<00:05:20.389> able<00:05:20.509> to

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.330 
there but I think he'll be able to
handle<00:05:20.840> it<00:05:21.050> he's<00:05:21.349> ironed<00:05:21.800> out<00:05:21.949> some<00:05:22.190> of<00:05:22.280> the

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340

problems in his play from the dreamhack
and<00:05:24.229> he's<00:05:24.590> looking<00:05:24.949> very<00:05:24.979> strong<00:05:25.340> indeed
