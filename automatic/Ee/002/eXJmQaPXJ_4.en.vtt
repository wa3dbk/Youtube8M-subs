they're having fun with their iPods well
really<00:03:20.350> they're<00:03:20.560> working<00:03:20.799> on<00:03:20.920> comprehension

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
really they're working on comprehension

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.099 
really they're working on comprehension
they're<00:03:21.730> working<00:03:22.000> on<00:03:22.060> their<00:03:22.209> fluency<00:03:22.720> and

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
they're working on their fluency and

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.610 
they're working on their fluency and
recording<00:03:23.790> with<00:03:24.790> our<00:03:24.910> very<00:03:25.209> initial<00:03:25.870> group<00:03:26.380> of

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
recording with our very initial group of

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.550 
recording with our very initial group of
pilot<00:03:27.010> teachers<00:03:27.340> we<00:03:27.819> saw<00:03:28.230> students<00:03:29.230> within<00:03:29.410> a

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
pilot teachers we saw students within a

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.039 
pilot teachers we saw students within a
six<00:03:29.829> week<00:03:29.980> period<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.400> time<00:03:30.639> making<00:03:31.299> anywhere

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
six week period of time making anywhere

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.120 
six week period of time making anywhere
between<00:03:32.170> four<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:32.680> six<00:03:33.220> times<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:35.500> fluency

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
between four and six times the fluency

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.520 
between four and six times the fluency
gains<00:03:36.400> that<00:03:36.849> they<00:03:37.000> should<00:03:37.450> have<00:03:38.079> in<00:03:38.380> that

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
gains that they should have in that

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.979 
gains that they should have in that
period<00:03:38.859> of<00:03:38.889> time<00:03:38.950> what's<00:03:39.250> considered<00:03:39.549> normal

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
period of time what's considered normal

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.650 
period of time what's considered normal
so<00:03:40.989> for<00:03:41.230> example<00:03:41.819> normal<00:03:42.819> fluency<00:03:43.389> gains<00:03:43.540> are

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
so for example normal fluency gains are

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.509 
so for example normal fluency gains are
between<00:03:43.930> five<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.230> ten<00:03:44.650> words<00:03:44.919> every<00:03:45.280> six

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
between five and ten words every six

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.789 
between five and ten words every six
weeks<00:03:45.609> we<00:03:46.540> had<00:03:46.690> kids<00:03:46.870> making<00:03:47.290> anywhere<00:03:47.739> from

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
weeks we had kids making anywhere from

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.300 
weeks we had kids making anywhere from
40<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.340> 60<00:03:48.459> words<00:03:49.500> gained<00:03:50.500> in<00:03:50.709> their<00:03:50.829> fluency

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
40 to 60 words gained in their fluency

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.909 
40 to 60 words gained in their fluency
in<00:03:51.519> just<00:03:51.790> a<00:03:51.880> six<00:03:52.090> week<00:03:52.239> period<00:03:52.359> of<00:03:52.569> time<00:03:52.919> that's

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
in just a six week period of time that's

00:03:53.919 --> 00:04:04.050 
in just a six week period of time that's
