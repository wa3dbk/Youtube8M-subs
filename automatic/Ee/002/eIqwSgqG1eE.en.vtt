00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.410
 hello and welcome to games 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.180
 and politics follow eleven i am me and 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.070
 I'm just pretty cold so if 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.570
 I am a little different than usual 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.850
 where then this video but I wanted 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.710
 from current cause necessarily anyway 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.359
 make a few days ago was one 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.869
 surprising message on games pages 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.750
 to read 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.580
 electronic arts no license agreement 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.110
 with weapons manufacturers more headlined about 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.150
 the gamestar on your website 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.560
 the great us video games manufacturer 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.109
 electronic arts have decided 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.609
 in the future on licensing with 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.120
 the weapon and defense industry too 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.559
 renounce it says in the article 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.319
 interesting and surprising 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.819
 but playing in electronic arts from the beginning 

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:41.499
 like the very popular battlefield 3 

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:43.089
 come countless firearms and 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:45.519
 military vehicles in front of the reality 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.199
 taken from here are the listing 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.940
 the weapons in the battlelog own 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.039
 social network of the game one 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.929
 huge bandwidth because you can then 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.129
 even more detailed statistics and 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:54.729
 more information about the weapons 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.499
 recall 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.479
 So far, I always assumed it 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:00.069
 that electronic arts easy weapons 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.479
 implemented in their game and the 

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:02.049
 Manufacturer of weapons for permission to 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.180
 ask 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:06.280
 this would explain why, for example 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.440
 the us company bell helicopters 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.390
 or its parent company textron 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.730
 current lawsuit with electronic 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.740
 There are some aircraft of the 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.330
 corporations occur in battlefield 3 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.940
 and of it was the armament manufacturer 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.070
 not exactly thrilled it seems so 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.930
 by electronic arts not at bell 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.760
 helicopter's incredible been asked 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.410
 to be whether it is okay that the 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.920
 Aircraft shown in the game 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.570
 become 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.430
 in june it should be in the legal dispute 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.440
 I also have to give judgment 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.030
 appearing of the game martin lohrberg 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.950
 the director of electronic arts 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.600
 Germany asked if at the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.120
 development of battlefield 3 with the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.470
 US Army former soldiers and or 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.320
 cooperation 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.550
 his answer would be a reference at that time 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.240
 on a press release of the 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.220
 company 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.500
 in it a novel becomes battlefield 3 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.330
 announced by annie mcnabb one 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.190
 former British elite soldiers with 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.930
 was written by a collaboration 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.610
 but with the armaments industry is too 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.260
 nothing to read in the press release 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.150
 martin wrote in another mail 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.950
 lorber me that the copyright of the 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.350
 always respected 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.030
 Well, I have it but sometimes vice versa 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.009
 tried and was at the German shot 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.659
 manufacturer heckler &amp; koch in demand 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.099
 as she is with the presentation of her 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.110
 holding weapons in video games 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.520
 in almost every modern military shooter 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.010
 comes the firearms of the manufacturer 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.470
 especially the gun g36 and the 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.480
 submachine gun mp5 and mp 7 before 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.520
 the telephone answer from heckler &amp; 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.280
 cook you have the weapon only in the 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.920
 true category 13 firearms and in 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.020
 the true category 28 toys 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.000
 trademarked for so long 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.350
 on the virtual weapons in the games 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.420
 not to see that heckler &amp; cook logo 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.140
 is since the presentation in the games 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.730
 no problem 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.560
 if heckler &amp; cook is already on 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.240
 video game production has involved 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.400
 I wanted the company from Oberndorf 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.360
 am neckar despite repeated request to 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.560
 Do not betray today 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.990
 however, the German is missing 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.670
 Weapons maker in the credits of 2012 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.380
 various electronic arts shooters 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.330
 medal of honor warfighter for one 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.940
 thanks for cooperation see here 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.920
 exactly how the cooperation could looked 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.780
 I do not find out yet 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.060
 for medal of honor warfighter has one 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.810
 Chronik doctor but with numerous 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.800
 weapons manufacturers and manufacturers of 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.780
 accessories for firearms 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.820
 worked together and this also in the 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.770
 pr for the video game involved 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.570
 a manufacturer of military bat 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.280
 and has random weapons even extra one 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.410
 medal of honor ax matching the game 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.320
 developed and this in a pr video 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.760
 I just presented here with 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.380
 Some defense companies seem 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.269
 electronic arts so cooperation 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.250
 to be received but just not with 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.739
 all weapons manufacturers whose weapons in 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.519
 to see their games 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.170
 Cooperations between video game 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.850
 manufacturer and defense contractor 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.260
 but it not only a chronicle doctor 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.170
 but also with other video game 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.910
 manufacturers about example hawx 2 that 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.950
 2010 from the French video 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.370
 game maker ubisoft released 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.510
 has been 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.190
 in the game you can with 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.000
 true to original fighter planes in the 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.410
 draw battles 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 but here are just a few 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.709
 aircraft licensed 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.360
 Funnily enough , only the 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.220
 Western manufacturer of the illustrated 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.670
 plane has been asked for licenses 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.410
 his 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.360
 this suggests at least one listing 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.610
 In the manual of the Russian fighter aircraft 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.860
 manufacturer micro jankovic whose with 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.060
 aircraft is also emerging in the game 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.920
 not listed there 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.720
 for that one finds in the manual for 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.700
 play a reference to eurofighter 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.200
 Typhoon is the company based in 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.000
 Hallbergmoos near Munich has the 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.530
 support of hawx 2 supported and 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.790
 even promotes the game in the company's own 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.229
 pr magazine 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.269
 how exactly the cooperation of 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.950
 eurofighter typhoon and ubisoft looked 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.950
 I did not answer though 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.340
 a last case that I pick up 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.050
 would like to affect the German tank 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.030
 manufacturer krauss maffei wegmann der 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.919
 just because of various panzer export to 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.819
 Qatar indonesia and saudi arabia in 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.620
 the criticism stands 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:41.110
 Vehicles from Krauss Maffei Wegmann 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.729
 come for example in 2011 appeared 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.069
 in real time strategy game elements of 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.830
 It was about here the game vehicle 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:49.629
 due and the battle tank leopard too 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.430
 in call of duty modern warfare 3 is coming 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:53.650
 the german armor at a place of 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.030
 singles campaign just before and in 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.610
 a pr video of the coming soon 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.539
 military game arma 3 is again one 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.430
 little to see 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.110
 and what's the point of mum maffei wegmann? 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.729
 you support the production of 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.259
 Computer games expressly not 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.879
 wrote me a company spokesman 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.250
 However, the tank manufacturer seems 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:11.139
 how many armaments companies do not 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.229
 to act against it if your weapons in 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.000
 Play a chaos 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.620
 A bigger company will be from 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.509
 video game manufacturers unbelievable 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.340
 asked if the weapons plays in the video 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.060
 others may be represented 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.219
 again not 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.840
 Some armament manufacturers do not want 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:28.060
 emerge in video games 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.919
 others support that even, well 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.419
 which conclusion can you draw now 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.130
 if video games manufacturer with 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.630
 The defense companies cooperate and the 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.340
 in the weapon shown in the games 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.659
 are licensed or not is not 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.909
 always clear to see through 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:41.860
 times the license seems to give times 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:44.169
 not that is all extremely intransparent 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.639
 and in that sense important as that some 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.139
 Buyer of the games maybe not the 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.150
 want to co-finance the arms industry 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.650
 that's pretty bad when I am 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.389
 me a video game of example 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.770
 a chronic doctor buy and that 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:55.029
 company with my money in turn 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.680
 Licenses from the real ones 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:58.090
 weapons manufacturers and acquires them 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.409
 financially supported 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.000
 I do not want that with my money 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.590
 heckler &amp; cook is financed by the 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 illegal weapons for the drug war after 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.159
 Mexico have sent 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.420
 virtual shooting okay but real 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:13.180
 finance producer no thanks 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.100
 and a solution of the problem in one 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.930
 very good article on the website sigma 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.610
 Video games becomes a hallmark of 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.740
 Play demanded with those of the buyer 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.120
 The defense industry supports one 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.160
 link to the article can be found in the 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.170
 video descriptions as well 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.910
 short note on gamespot ticks episode 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.650
 2 in it among other things to the 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.970
 Cooperation of the German video game 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.980
 manufacturer crytek with the
