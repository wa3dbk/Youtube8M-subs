thanks for watching my videos
and<00:00:42.199> now<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.500> cosmic<00:00:43.250> racer

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.820 

so<00:00:48.220> what<00:00:48.580> it<00:00:48.730> is<00:00:48.910> is<00:00:49.210> it's<00:00:49.660> a<00:00:49.840> little<00:00:50.200> bus<00:00:50.380> a<00:00:50.410> car

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
so what it is is it's a little bus a car

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:58.650 
so what it is is it's a little bus a car

do is blow the balloon up and then

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.250 
do is blow the balloon up and then
attach<00:01:00.640> it<00:01:00.790> to<00:01:00.940> this<00:01:01.060> piece<00:01:01.300> inside<00:01:01.690> there<00:01:01.930> and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260

is<00:01:04.720> we've<00:01:05.020> attached<00:01:05.410> the<00:01:05.530> balloon<00:01:05.800> to<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.010> car

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
is we've attached the balloon to the car

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.580 
is we've attached the balloon to the car
and<00:01:07.060> now<00:01:07.210> I'm<00:01:07.420> going<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.690> blow<00:01:07.870> it<00:01:07.990> up<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.290> see

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
and now I'm going to blow it up and see

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:44.010 
and now I'm going to blow it up and see
if<00:01:08.680> we<00:01:08.800> can<00:01:08.950> make<00:01:09.130> this<00:01:09.250> car<00:01:09.490> go

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.390 

once<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.229> air<00:01:45.380> is<00:01:45.409> pushed<00:01:45.890> out<00:01:46.100> into<00:01:46.340> the

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
once the air is pushed out into the

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.179 
once the air is pushed out into the
balloon<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:47.270> pushes<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.930> jet<00:01:48.470> racer<00:01:48.860> in<00:01:49.070> the

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
balloon it pushes the jet racer in the

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.820 
balloon it pushes the jet racer in the
opposite<00:01:49.549> direction<00:01:50.409> this<00:01:51.409> is<00:01:51.619> Isaac

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
opposite direction this is Isaac

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.179 
opposite direction this is Isaac
Newton's<00:01:52.399> third<00:01:52.939> law<00:01:52.970> of<00:01:53.240> motion<00:01:54.189> Isaac

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
Newton's third law of motion Isaac

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.039 
Newton's third law of motion Isaac
Newton<00:01:55.610> is<00:01:55.850> considered<00:01:56.420> one<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.780> greatest

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
Newton is considered one of the greatest

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.710 
Newton is considered one of the greatest
scientists<00:01:57.710> of<00:01:58.130> all<00:01:58.340> time<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:59.210> third<00:01:59.479> law<00:01:59.690> of

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
scientists of all time the third law of

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.630 
scientists of all time the third law of
motion<00:02:00.200> states<00:02:00.320> that<00:02:00.979> for<00:02:01.190> every<00:02:01.369> action

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
motion states that for every action

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.830 
motion states that for every action
there's<00:02:02.539> an<00:02:02.720> equal<00:02:02.899> and<00:02:03.289> opposite<00:02:03.770> reaction

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
there's an equal and opposite reaction

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.660 
there's an equal and opposite reaction
now<00:02:05.840> let's<00:02:06.229> shine<00:02:06.439> build<00:02:06.740> another<00:02:07.039> Lego

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.820 

I've<00:02:13.270> made<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.540> spot<00:02:13.870> for<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.170> balloon<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.410> go

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
I've made a spot for the balloon to go

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:32.570 
I've made a spot for the balloon to go
through<00:02:16.050> let's<00:02:17.050> go<00:02:17.290> test<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.710> out

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.190 

you<00:02:32.850> should<00:02:33.030> try<00:02:33.210> making<00:02:33.360> your<00:02:33.600> own<00:02:33.780> billion

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
you should try making your own billion

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.650 
you should try making your own billion
powered<00:02:34.500> car<00:02:34.740> let<00:02:35.730> me<00:02:35.850> know<00:02:35.970> how<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.210> did<00:02:36.510> in
