00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.230 

the<00:00:10.530> 94<00:00:10.950> World<00:00:10.980> Cup<00:00:11.370> was<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.519> great<00:00:11.759> experience

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
the 94 World Cup was a great experience

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.509 
the 94 World Cup was a great experience
I<00:00:12.509> think<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.990> was<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:13.889> was<00:00:14.040> very<00:00:14.309> new<00:00:14.490> to

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
I think that it was it was very new to

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.020 
I think that it was it was very new to
us

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
us

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.180 
us
you<00:00:15.480> know<00:00:15.630> Switzer<00:00:16.080> hadn't<00:00:16.350> qualified<00:00:16.859> for

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
you know Switzer hadn't qualified for

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.400 
you know Switzer hadn't qualified for
tournament<00:00:17.640> well<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.420> think<00:00:18.570> they<00:00:18.840> played<00:00:19.199> in

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
tournament well I think they played in

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.150 
tournament well I think they played in
62<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:20.160> Chile<00:00:21.080> but<00:00:22.080> basically<00:00:22.740> they<00:00:22.920> hadn't

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
62 in Chile but basically they hadn't

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.490 
62 in Chile but basically they hadn't
qualify<00:00:23.640> for<00:00:23.699> term<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.300> 20-30<00:00:24.869> years<00:00:24.990> and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
qualify for term for 20-30 years and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.070 
qualify for term for 20-30 years and
hadn't<00:00:26.220> expected<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.910> either<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:27.960> that

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
hadn't expected to either so in that

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.599 
hadn't expected to either so in that
respect<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.619> suppose<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:29.070> went<00:00:29.250> into<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
respect I suppose we went into the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.970 
respect I suppose we went into the
tournament<00:00:29.849> with<00:00:30.570> be<00:00:30.750> way<00:00:30.929> delighted<00:00:31.800> we've

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
tournament with be way delighted we've

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.950 
tournament with be way delighted we've
made<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.700> B<00:00:32.880> not<00:00:33.120> expecting<00:00:33.719> too<00:00:33.930> much

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
made it and B not expecting too much

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.530 
made it and B not expecting too much
from<00:00:34.170> us<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:34.800> when<00:00:35.010> we<00:00:35.160> didn't<00:00:35.489> do<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.640> badly

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
from us so when we didn't do that badly

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.520 
from us so when we didn't do that badly
you<00:00:37.320> know<00:00:37.469> we<00:00:37.649> achieved<00:00:38.070> hero<00:00:38.460> status<00:00:39.120> I

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
you know we achieved hero status I

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.660 
you know we achieved hero status I

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
remember the tournament very well it was

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.569 
remember the tournament very well it was
very<00:00:41.700> well<00:00:42.030> organized<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.660> course<00:00:42.840> very<00:00:43.170> hot

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
very well organized the course very hot

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.540 
very well organized the course very hot
our<00:00:44.579> first<00:00:44.969> two<00:00:45.899> games<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.770> actual<00:00:47.129> fact<00:00:47.309> were

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
our first two games in actual fact were

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.420 
our first two games in actual fact were
in<00:00:47.760> Detroit<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.989> silver<00:00:49.410> dome<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:50.280> was

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
in Detroit in the silver dome it was

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.819 
in Detroit in the silver dome it was
played<00:00:50.730> indoors<00:00:51.270> they<00:00:51.660> they<00:00:51.930> they<00:00:52.199> changed

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
played indoors they they they changed

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.130 
played indoors they they they changed
the<00:00:52.980> plastic<00:00:53.760> pitch<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> grass<00:00:54.780> pitch

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the plastic pitch for a grass pitch

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.590 
the plastic pitch for a grass pitch
which<00:00:55.350> they<00:00:55.530> wheeled<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.210> massive

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
which they wheeled in to this massive

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.439 
which they wheeled in to this massive
dome<00:00:58.230> where<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.670> Detroit<00:01:00.090> Red<00:01:00.420> Wings

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
dome where the Detroit Red Wings

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.420 
dome where the Detroit Red Wings
normally<00:01:01.140> played<00:01:01.379> their<00:01:01.620> matches<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.039> I

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
normally played their matches and I

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.899 
normally played their matches and I
think<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.270> was<00:01:03.390> something<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:04.250> they<00:01:05.250> work<00:01:05.700> in

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
think it was something like they work in

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.640 
think it was something like they work in
Fahrenheit<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.659> America<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.380> do

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
Fahrenheit in America you have to do

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.980 
Fahrenheit in America you have to do
these<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.070> translations<00:01:08.880> but<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.180> was<00:01:09.299> 95

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
these the translations but it was 95

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.039 
these the translations but it was 95
degrees<00:01:10.409> Fahrenheit<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.280> something<00:01:11.640> like<00:01:12.049> 85

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
degrees Fahrenheit and something like 85

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.070 
degrees Fahrenheit and something like 85

90 percent humidity playing in there not
to<00:01:16.229> mention<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.740> smells<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.250> popcorn<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the hamburgers and the hotdogs so it was

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.240 
the hamburgers and the hotdogs so it was
a<00:01:19.830> very<00:01:19.920> unusual<00:01:20.640> experience<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.979> then<00:01:23.130> of

course our next game was in Palo Alto
and<00:01:25.860> there<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.159> played<00:01:26.400> at<00:01:26.640> midday<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.420> there

the actual temperatures soared past a

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.910 
the actual temperatures soared past a
hundred<00:01:30.090> degree<00:01:30.540> thundered<00:01:30.990> occasionally<00:01:31.710> in

hundred degree thundered occasionally in

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.429 
hundred degree thundered occasionally in
the<00:01:31.979> bright<00:01:32.579> sunlight<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:34.200> know<00:01:34.320> we

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
the bright sunlight so you know we

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.929 
the bright sunlight so you know we
talked<00:01:34.650> about<00:01:34.799> Brazil<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.549> talked<00:01:35.790> about

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
talked about Brazil and we talked about

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.050 
talked about Brazil and we talked about
Manaus<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.780> how<00:01:36.869> hot<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:37.259> going<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.680> but

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
Manaus and how hot it's going to be but

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.210 
Manaus and how hot it's going to be but
certainly<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.180> remember<00:01:39.829> America<00:01:40.829> was<00:01:40.950> being

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
certainly I remember America was being

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.069 
certainly I remember America was being
unbelievably<00:01:41.610> hot<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> matches<00:01:42.960> we

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
unbelievably hot in the matches we

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.420 
unbelievably hot in the matches we
played<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.500> only<00:01:43.619> one<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.009> was<00:01:44.130> played<00:01:44.399> in

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
played the only one that was played in

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.130 
played the only one that was played in
more<00:01:44.759> reasonable<00:01:45.270> conditions<00:01:45.689> was<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> one

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
more reasonable conditions was the one

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.920 
more reasonable conditions was the one
in<00:01:46.259> Washington<00:01:46.549> where<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:48.329> was<00:01:48.479> more<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:48.899> a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
in Washington where it was more like a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.840 
in Washington where it was more like a
European<00:01:49.229> seller<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:50.369> always<00:01:50.640> very

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
European seller it's always very

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.880 
European seller it's always very
difficult<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.240> think<00:01:51.509> when<00:01:52.170> people<00:01:52.530> ask<00:01:52.710> you

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
difficult I think when people ask you

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.380 
difficult I think when people ask you
what<00:01:53.130> have<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.369> learned<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.850> your<00:01:54.000> career

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
what have you learned in your career

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.420 
what have you learned in your career
it's<00:01:55.020> very<00:01:55.290> hard<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> put<00:01:55.799> your<00:01:55.950> finger<00:01:56.009> on

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
it's very hard to put your finger on

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.060 
it's very hard to put your finger on
anything<00:01:56.930> but<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:57.960> think<00:01:58.259> what<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.530> do<00:01:58.740> find
