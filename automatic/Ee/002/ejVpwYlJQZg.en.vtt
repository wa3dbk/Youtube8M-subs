ahead and dump some more than our
product<00:01:41.479> into<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.750> pit<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.009> demonstrate<00:01:43.009> how

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
product into the pit and demonstrate how

00:01:43.189 --> 00:02:12.170 
product into the pit and demonstrate how
it<00:01:43.789> works<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.659> just<00:01:44.990> how<00:01:45.049> easy<00:01:45.289> it<00:01:45.439> is<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.679> use

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.290 

so<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:14.410> pit<00:02:14.650> does<00:02:14.980> have<00:02:15.280> about<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.700> two<00:02:16.269> inch

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
so this pit does have about a two inch

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.780 
so this pit does have about a two inch
crust<00:02:16.840> on<00:02:17.080> top<00:02:17.110> of<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.310> can<00:02:18.459> start<00:02:18.670> to

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
crust on top of it and you can start to

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.690 
crust on top of it and you can start to
see<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.120> foaming<00:02:19.920> foaming<00:02:20.920> in<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.100> reactions

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
see the foaming foaming in the reactions

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.360 
see the foaming foaming in the reactions
of<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.569> product<00:02:23.110> coming<00:02:23.830> up<00:02:24.010> out<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.220> the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
of the product coming up out of the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.750 
of the product coming up out of the
Minerva<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.269> one<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.410> things<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:26.769> may

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
Minerva and one of the things you may

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.640 
Minerva and one of the things you may
potentially<00:02:28.030> see<00:02:28.510> is<00:02:28.660> as<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:29.080> reaction

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
potentially see is as that reaction

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.120 
potentially see is as that reaction
occurs<00:02:29.950> with<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.430> manure<00:02:30.850> in<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.090> pit<00:02:32.130> that

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
occurs with the manure in the pit that

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.800 
occurs with the manure in the pit that
the<00:02:33.430> crust<00:02:33.670> on<00:02:33.850> top<00:02:33.880> is<00:02:34.239> going<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.450> begin<00:02:34.600> to

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
the crust on top is going to begin to

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.770 
the crust on top is going to begin to
deteriorate<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.700> break<00:02:36.700> itself<00:02:37.239> down<00:02:39.690> one<00:02:40.690> of

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
deteriorate and break itself down one of

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.120 
deteriorate and break itself down one of
the<00:02:40.840> reasons<00:02:41.140> that<00:02:41.200> you're<00:02:41.350> seeing<00:02:41.590> this<00:02:41.830> is

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
the reasons that you're seeing this is

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.880 
the reasons that you're seeing this is
because<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:43.450> polymer<00:02:44.350> products<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.799> we

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
because the polymer products that we

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.440 
because the polymer products that we
offer<00:02:46.110> have<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.140> minus<00:02:47.860> 1800<00:02:48.580> negative<00:02:49.180> charge
