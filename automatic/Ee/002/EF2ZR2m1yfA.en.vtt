00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.219 
put that one on as well I kind of like
the<00:01:48.299> way<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.450> looks<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.720> your<00:01:48.750> hand<00:01:49.020> though

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the way it looks in your hand though

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.630 
the way it looks in your hand though
because<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.770> can't<00:01:49.920> really<00:01:50.040> see<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.340> needle

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
because you can't really see the needle

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.910 
because you can't really see the needle
point<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.090> they're<00:01:51.630> all<00:01:51.750> really<00:01:52.140> long<00:01:52.409> swords

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
point and they're all really long swords

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.980 
point and they're all really long swords
as<00:01:53.070> well<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:54.030> see<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.840> is

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
as well like you can see that that is

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.749 
as well like you can see that that is
one<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> longest<00:01:56.040> swords<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.460> think<00:01:56.640> I've

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
one of the longest swords I think I've

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.330 
one of the longest swords I think I've
ever<00:01:56.909> seen<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.329> Skyrim<00:02:00.469> also<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.740> damage<00:02:02.070> like

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
ever seen in Skyrim also the damage like

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.359 
ever seen in Skyrim also the damage like
I<00:02:02.430> said<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.700> really<00:02:02.880> good<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.210> all<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.509> them

know where they incorporated the
Quicksilver<00:05:10.250> and<00:05:10.280> it's<00:05:10.820> probably<00:05:11.150> the<00:05:11.270> blade

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
Quicksilver and it's probably the blade

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.600 
Quicksilver and it's probably the blade
itself<00:05:12.490> not<00:05:13.490> too<00:05:13.640> sure<00:05:14.320> but<00:05:15.460> that<00:05:16.460> looks

itself not too sure but that looks

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.260 
itself not too sure but that looks
really<00:05:16.760> good<00:05:16.970> and<00:05:17.270> then<00:05:18.230> we<00:05:18.440> have<00:05:18.710> the<00:05:19.520> Azura's
