so as we're approaching the maneuver
we're<00:00:46.020> getting<00:00:46.350> set<00:00:47.100> up<00:00:48.079> anticipating<00:00:49.079> that

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
we're getting set up anticipating that

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.250 
we're getting set up anticipating that
rotation<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:51.300> I'm<00:00:51.510> gonna<00:00:51.629> do<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> frontside

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
rotation if I'm gonna do a frontside

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.410 
rotation if I'm gonna do a frontside
rotation<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.300> anticipate<00:00:54.300> towards<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> nose

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
rotation I anticipate towards the nose

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.479 
rotation I anticipate towards the nose
if<00:00:57.420> I'm<00:00:57.629> doing<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.989> backside<00:00:58.230> rotation<00:00:59.039> I'm

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
if I'm doing a backside rotation I'm

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.790 
if I'm doing a backside rotation I'm
anticipating<00:00:59.850> towards<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> tail<00:01:00.989> before

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
anticipating towards the tail before

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.229 
anticipating towards the tail before
we're<00:01:01.980> stepping<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.489> our<00:01:02.670> frontside<00:01:03.120> and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
we're stepping up our frontside and

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.929 
we're stepping up our frontside and
backside<00:01:03.300> 180s<00:01:04.199> into<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> park<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.070> first<00:01:05.700> want

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
backside 180s into the park I first want

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.210 
backside 180s into the park I first want
to<00:01:06.000> dial<00:01:06.240> down<00:01:06.479> those<00:01:06.720> movements<00:01:07.290> outside<00:01:07.740> of

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
to dial down those movements outside of

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.429

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
want to get both my frontside and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.840 
want to get both my frontside and
backside<00:01:15.450> 180s<00:01:16.549> comfortable<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.700> I'm

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
backside 180s comfortable as I'm

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.120 
backside 180s comfortable as I'm
traversing<00:01:18.509> across<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.080> hill<00:01:19.290> I'm<00:01:19.890> gonna

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
traversing across the hill I'm gonna

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.190 
traversing across the hill I'm gonna
start<00:01:20.430> bringing<00:01:20.640> more<00:01:21.030> pop<00:01:21.659> into<00:01:22.049> those

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
start bringing more pop into those

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.560 
start bringing more pop into those
rotations<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.640> pop<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.150> going<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.360> give<00:01:24.479> me

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
rotations that pop is going to give me

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.600 
rotations that pop is going to give me
that<00:01:24.689> little<00:01:24.900> bit<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.170> hang<00:01:25.350> time<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:26.340> that

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
that little bit of hang time so that

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.910 
that little bit of hang time so that
whole<00:01:26.909> rotation<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.990> actually<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> air

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
whole rotation is actually in the air

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.620 
whole rotation is actually in the air
eventually<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.850> take<00:01:30.119> them<00:01:30.240> into<00:01:30.390> those

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
eventually you take them into those

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.300 
eventually you take them into those
turns<00:01:30.900> you'll<00:01:31.650> actually<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:32.040> able<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
turns you'll actually be able to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.069 
turns you'll actually be able to
incorporate<00:01:32.640> these<00:01:33.150> movements<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.689> your<00:01:33.810> free

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
incorporate these movements in your free

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.530 
incorporate these movements in your free
riding<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.619> really<00:01:34.950> want<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.220> focus<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.850> that

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
riding we really want to focus on that

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.640 
riding we really want to focus on that
release<00:01:37.220> into<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
release into the

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.760 
release into the
first<00:01:40.520> I<00:01:40.700> set<00:01:40.970> up<00:01:41.000> on<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.420> approach<00:01:41.780> I<00:01:42.170> get

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
first I set up on the approach I get

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.980 
first I set up on the approach I get
into<00:01:42.920> flex<00:01:43.220> stance<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:44.510> then<00:01:44.660> I'm<00:01:44.810> getting

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
into flex stance and then I'm getting

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.010 
into flex stance and then I'm getting
that<00:01:45.200> vertical<00:01:45.830> movement<00:01:46.310> as<00:01:46.760> I<00:01:46.910> pop<00:01:47.240> my

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
that vertical movement as I pop my

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.500 
that vertical movement as I pop my
body's<00:01:48.380> alignment<00:01:48.980> in<00:01:49.070> comes<00:01:49.400> into<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.180> full

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
body's alignment in comes into that full

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.260 
body's alignment in comes into that full
180<00:01:50.750> rotation<00:01:51.610> stomping<00:01:52.610> it<00:01:52.700> nice<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:52.880> smooth

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
180 rotation stomping it nice and smooth

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.180 
180 rotation stomping it nice and smooth
as<00:01:53.510> we<00:01:53.930> get<00:01:54.080> more<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:54.380> more<00:01:54.620> comfortable<00:01:54.920> with

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
as we get more and more comfortable with

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.160 
as we get more and more comfortable with
just<00:01:55.520> approaching<00:01:56.300> these<00:01:56.540> frontside<00:01:57.020> and

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
just approaching these frontside and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.010 
just approaching these frontside and
backside<00:01:57.230> 180s<00:01:58.040> on<00:01:58.190> the<00:01:58.310> hill<00:01:58.900> keeping<00:01:59.900> the

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
backside 180s on the hill keeping the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.680 
backside 180s on the hill keeping the
upper<00:02:00.260> body<00:02:00.410> quiet<00:02:01.150> getting<00:02:02.150> a<00:02:02.210> little<00:02:02.390> bit<00:02:02.570> of

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
upper body quiet getting a little bit of

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.410 
upper body quiet getting a little bit of
setup<00:02:03.290> with<00:02:03.620> the<00:02:03.680> upper<00:02:03.950> body

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
setup with the upper body

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.960 
setup with the upper body
throwing<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.540> trick<00:02:05.810> from<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.110> lower<00:02:06.320> body

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
throwing the trick from the lower body

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.790 
throwing the trick from the lower body
we<00:02:07.970> can<00:02:08.149> really<00:02:08.690> start<00:02:08.960> to<00:02:09.050> style<00:02:09.440> them<00:02:09.649> out

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800
