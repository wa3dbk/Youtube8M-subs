there a little bit heavy just go round
it<00:01:40.820> got<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> couple<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.299> connectors<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:44.840> microSD

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
it got a couple of connectors a microSD

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.420 
it got a couple of connectors a microSD

card slot USB volume rocker power and

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.730 
card slot USB volume rocker power and
now<00:01:53.430> idea<00:01:53.850> when<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.090> does<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:55.110> another<00:01:55.439> power

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
now idea when that does is another power

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.749 
now idea when that does is another power
and<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.189> sim<00:01:56.880> card<00:01:58.130> don't<00:01:59.130> know<00:01:59.250> what<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.399> does

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
and a sim card don't know what that does

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.889 
and a sim card don't know what that does
wipe<00:02:00.030> our<00:02:00.390> scanner<00:02:00.840> suppose<00:02:01.729> hdmi<00:02:02.840> okay<00:02:03.840> see

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
wipe our scanner suppose hdmi okay see

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.620 
wipe our scanner suppose hdmi okay see
what<00:02:04.259> else<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.950> box

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.100 

okay<00:02:09.630> it's<00:02:09.840> pretty<00:02:10.050> sparse<00:02:11.150> we've<00:02:12.150> got<00:02:12.420> power

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
okay it's pretty sparse we've got power

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.190 
okay it's pretty sparse we've got power
cable<00:02:13.710> it's<00:02:14.580> on<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.760> European<00:02:15.330> power<00:02:15.600> system

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
cable it's on the European power system

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.580 
cable it's on the European power system
got<00:02:17.040> an<00:02:17.130> adapter<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:17.850> that<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:18.900> should<00:02:19.410> be

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
got an adapter for that so should be

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.870 
got an adapter for that so should be
okay<00:02:21.410> second<00:02:22.410> half<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.920> power<00:02:23.220> cable<00:02:23.820> and

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
okay second half of the power cable and

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.620 
okay second half of the power cable and
it's<00:02:26.880> an<00:02:27.000> output<00:02:27.390> 19<00:02:28.380> volts<00:02:28.830> 2.1<00:02:29.610> amp<00:02:29.760> ere's<00:02:30.060> so

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
it's an output 19 volts 2.1 amp ere's so

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.140 
it's an output 19 volts 2.1 amp ere's so
made<00:02:31.050> in<00:02:31.080> China<00:02:31.470> naturally<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:33.830> those<00:02:34.830> eight

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
made in China naturally and those eight

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.860 
made in China naturally and those eight
CD<00:02:38.420> in<00:02:39.420> Italian<00:02:40.130> okay<00:02:41.570> nothing<00:02:42.570> else<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.810> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
CD in Italian okay nothing else of the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.370 
CD in Italian okay nothing else of the
box<00:02:43.110> that's<00:02:43.860> all<00:02:44.070> there<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:45.260> there's<00:02:46.260> no

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
box that's all there is there's no

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.710 
box that's all there is there's no
instructions<00:02:47.130> which<00:02:47.820> is<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.060> bit<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.630> an

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
instructions which is a bit of an

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.530 
instructions which is a bit of an
omission<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.320> suppose<00:02:49.850> so<00:02:50.850> power<00:02:51.660> cable<00:02:52.260> CD<00:02:53.540> the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
omission I suppose so power cable CD the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.940 
omission I suppose so power cable CD the
units<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.980> keyboard<00:02:57.410> like<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.440> say<00:02:58.709> it's

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
units and the keyboard like I say it's

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.890 
units and the keyboard like I say it's
actually<00:02:59.340> very<00:02:59.490> similar<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.330> meiosis

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
actually very similar to meiosis

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.830 
actually very similar to meiosis
transformer<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:02.400> i<00:03:02.430> will<00:03:02.760> learn<00:03:02.940> i'll<00:03:03.660> do<00:03:03.810> a

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840
