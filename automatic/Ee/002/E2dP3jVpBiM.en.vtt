get into this hit left left right center
and<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:38.100> mean<00:00:38.660> dad<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> got<00:00:39.989> time<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.260> second<00:00:40.469> try

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
and I mean dad I got time I second try

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.990 
and I mean dad I got time I second try
it's<00:00:40.739> not<00:00:40.770> too<00:00:41.010> bad<00:00:42.649> it<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.680> takes<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.340> short

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
it's not too bad it just takes a short

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.690 
it's not too bad it just takes a short
bit<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.270> time<00:00:45.860> next<00:00:46.860> challenge<00:00:47.550> is

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
bit of time next challenge is

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.970 
bit of time next challenge is
color-coded<00:00:48.480> break<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> color<00:00:49.320> code<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.710> door

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
color-coded break the color code on door

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.209 
color-coded break the color code on door
X<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:51.750> right<00:00:52.289> at<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> beginning<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> map

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
X so right at the beginning of the map

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.900 
X so right at the beginning of the map
you<00:00:54.149> want<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:55.070> kind<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.160> take<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> pause

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
you want to just kind of take a pause

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.209 
you want to just kind of take a pause
and<00:00:57.239> look<00:00:57.629> at<00:00:57.840> these<00:00:57.989> colors<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:58.800> write<00:00:59.010> on

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
and look at these colors will write on

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.130 
and look at these colors will write on
here<00:00:59.489> little<00:01:00.270> bounce<00:01:00.539> around<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.870> little<00:01:00.960> bit

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
here little bounce around a little bit

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.869 
here little bounce around a little bit
but<00:01:01.440> then<00:01:01.559> it'll<00:01:01.649> come<00:01:01.800> up<00:01:01.920> as<00:01:02.070> green<00:01:02.399> red<00:01:02.640> red

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
but then it'll come up as green red red

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.600 
but then it'll come up as green red red
blue<00:01:03.180> red<00:01:03.300> red<00:01:03.680> so<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.710> get<00:01:04.920> further<00:01:05.189> onto<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
blue red red so you get further onto the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.429 
blue red red so you get further onto the
map<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:05.970> you're<00:01:06.869> gonna<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.080> these<00:01:07.170> weird

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
map and you're gonna see these weird

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.960 
map and you're gonna see these weird
platforms<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.189> every<00:01:08.369> time<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.610> hit<00:01:08.729> them

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
platforms that every time you hit them

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.810 
platforms that every time you hit them
they<00:01:09.540> change<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.900> color<00:01:10.400> so<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.729> to

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
they change the color so you have to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.640 
they change the color so you have to
make<00:01:11.970> sure<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.540> when<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.810> hit<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.439> get

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
make sure that when you hit it is get

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.719 
make sure that when you hit it is get
away<00:01:13.740> under<00:01:13.950> our<00:01:13.979> color<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.400> if<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.549> first

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
away under our color so if the first

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.700 
away under our color so if the first
ones<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.060> green<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.200> don't<00:01:16.560> hit<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
ones can be green so you don't hit the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.440 
ones can be green so you don't hit the
next<00:01:16.920> checkpoint<00:01:17.070> until<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.640> right<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.330> this

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
next checkpoint until it's right so this

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.090 
next checkpoint until it's right so this
one's<00:01:18.630> green<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.799> hit<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.040> again

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
one's green so we have to hit it again

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.130 
one's green so we have to hit it again
to<00:01:20.430> make<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.640> red<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.450> reset<00:01:21.900> and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
to make it red so you can reset and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.780 
to make it red so you can reset and
it'll<00:01:22.320> stay<00:01:22.470> green<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.490> you'll<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.759> a

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
it'll stay green and you'll have a

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.330 
it'll stay green and you'll have a
chance<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.060> change<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.420> red<00:01:25.009> now<00:01:26.009> for<00:01:26.220> these

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
chance to change the red now for these

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.640 
chance to change the red now for these
next<00:01:26.580> two<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.360> very<00:01:27.540> important<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.170> have

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
next two this is very important you have

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.160 
next two this is very important you have
to<00:01:28.799> hit<00:01:29.009> these<00:01:29.220> second<00:01:29.759> one<00:01:30.030> first<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.049> you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
to hit these second one first and you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.160 
to hit these second one first and you
can't<00:01:31.350> land<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.340> have<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.930> Balt<00:01:33.930> your

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
can't land on it you have to Balt your

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.800 
can't land on it you have to Balt your
body<00:01:34.350> onto<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.210> just<00:01:36.210> got<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.540> one<00:01:36.720> of

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
body onto it so just got to like one of

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.660 
body onto it so just got to like one of
those<00:01:36.930> they<00:01:37.740> had<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.009> change<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.430> that

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
those they had to change it so that

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.179 
those they had to change it so that
one's<00:01:38.850> blue<00:01:39.380> so<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.500> one<00:01:40.680> has<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.009> red

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
one's blue so this one has to be red

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.249 
one's blue so this one has to be red
like<00:01:42.790> so<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:44.369> then<00:01:45.369> this<00:01:45.789> one<00:01:46.000> have<00:01:46.180> like<00:01:47.110> so

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
like so and then this one have like so

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.560 
like so and then this one have like so
and<00:01:47.380> then<00:01:47.530> this<00:01:47.649> one<00:01:47.860> has<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.670> be<00:01:48.729> blue<00:01:48.939> and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
and then this one has to be blue and

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.969 
and then this one has to be blue and
once<00:01:49.719> you<00:01:49.810> got<00:01:49.899> that<00:01:50.079> you<00:01:50.140> hit<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.590> checkpoint

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
once you got that you hit the checkpoint

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.050 
once you got that you hit the checkpoint
you'll<00:01:51.100> be<00:01:51.189> safe<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.780> for<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.020> final<00:01:53.530> one

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
you'll be safe so for the final one

watch out right here you have to
actually<00:01:56.409> fall<00:01:57.009> through<00:01:57.219> body<00:01:58.470> and<00:02:00.899> you'll

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
actually fall through body and you'll

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.569 
actually fall through body and you'll
have<00:02:02.049> to<00:02:02.140> reset<00:02:02.470> that<00:02:02.530> one<00:02:02.770> beforehand<00:02:03.369> to

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
have to reset that one beforehand to

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.179 
have to reset that one beforehand to
make<00:02:03.700> sure<00:02:03.850> it's<00:02:04.030> red<00:02:04.270> so<00:02:04.899> don't<00:02:05.679> land<00:02:06.009> on<00:02:06.159> that

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
honest so much the third challenge but

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.400 
honest so much the third challenge but
pretty<00:02:46.720> simple<00:02:47.109> pretty<00:02:47.290> straightforward

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
pretty simple pretty straightforward

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.819 
pretty simple pretty straightforward
just<00:02:48.810> lie<00:02:49.810> this<00:02:49.870> entire<00:02:50.170> level<00:02:50.319> upside<00:02:50.680> down

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
just lie this entire level upside down

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.250 
just lie this entire level upside down
the<00:02:51.489> control<00:02:51.819> so<00:02:51.910> they<00:02:52.000> aren't<00:02:52.180> inverted<00:02:52.959> if

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
the control so they aren't inverted if

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.780 
the control so they aren't inverted if
you<00:02:53.410> look<00:02:53.560> at<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.799> upside<00:02:54.040> down<00:02:54.069> I<00:02:54.400> think<00:02:54.640> it

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
you look at it upside down I think it

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.150 
you look at it upside down I think it
was<00:02:54.880> just<00:02:55.000> turned<00:02:55.150> TT<00:02:55.329> upside<00:02:55.630> down<00:02:55.780> or<00:02:56.620> set

was just turned TT upside down or set
upside<00:02:57.430> down<00:02:59.160> so<00:03:00.160> yeah<00:03:00.959> again<00:03:01.959> I<00:03:01.989> hope<00:03:02.170> these

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
upside down so yeah again I hope these

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.180
