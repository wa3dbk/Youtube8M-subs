00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.520
 hello in this video I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.279
 all the components of an iphone 4s 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.400
 let's start with the most basic this 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.890
 from here is the home button 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.950
 these are the volume buttons 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.920
 the vibration activator the button 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:23.150
 I rest the hole for the hearing aids 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:27.040
 another another small microphone and down 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.840
 we have the speaker and the microphone 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.669
 Now let's open it to open a 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.320
 iphone 4s we need a tool 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.270
 special that is like in the form of 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.930
 star very very small and for 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.460
 remove them the cables we need these 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.920
 tools not to damage them 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.440
 I already remove the screws that go here 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.440
 down for a matter of time here the 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.840
 have for centuries we want to see is 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.670
 they slide nothing 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.620
 in the back up 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.179
 I also have to mention this 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.710
 obviously on the screen retina with a 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.810
 speaker up here and the screen in the 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.810
 front camera 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.530
 let's remove the back of the 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.530
 Iphone 4s 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.930
 and here we have 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.840
 Iphone 4s 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.560
 let's say its components to this 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.770
 part of here the biggest thing is the pile 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.540
 this is the battery connector and you have 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.720
 that remove these two screws to 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.880
 remove the connector is this small 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.750
 thing here that looks in black with 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.630
 golden is the antenna is making contact 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.030
 with this as aluminum part 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.160
 back to increase the signal is the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.470
 cellular antennas 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.750
 this is the speaker the microphone and the 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.520
 main part of the antenna this 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.040
 we see here is the 30-pin connector 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.310
 of the iphone 4s 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.730
 this part of you see all this here 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:05.190
 is the logic of the iphone here for this 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.890
 part we have the memory and over here 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.679
 we have the processors this little eyelash 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:15.660
 is to remove the battery is already stuck 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:18.360
 to the iphone with some sticker until this 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.710
 that is here is the flash 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.710
 the little yellow dot 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.150
 this is the camera 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.540
 this is the wifi antenna 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.540
 and the bluetooth 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.390
 this here below this part we have 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.750
 the control of the sensors what is the 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.240
 Light sensor and gyroscope sensor 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.280
 that detects where we have 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:55.340
 oriented the iphone 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.340
 in this part of here we have the 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.230
 the connector of the hearing aids 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.110
 I'm touching this piece of plastic 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.370
 team see the hole we can put 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.370
 a little bit this part 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.530
 in this part we have 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:19.209
 in the back of the camera is a 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:23.400
 small iron holding the camera in 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.400
 its place is a small stabilizer 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.489
 and below all this we have the screen 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.940
 retina to change it we need to remove 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:35.360
 all components unscrew 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.560
 these screws that we have here are 6 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.560
 from each side 3 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.340
 to be able to remove the retina screen and 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.970
 replace broken positions 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.720
 well I think we cover everything is is 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.720
 a protection 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.620
 this is a small protection for the 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.359
 connection of all the cables in this 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.739
 part is where almost all are connected 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:04.540
 the wires in this this is another connector 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:08.200
 this is a protection for the connector 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:12.689
 from the part of here of the speakers of 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.689
 the speakers and the microphone 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.660
 and that's all we see in the next 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.660
 video
