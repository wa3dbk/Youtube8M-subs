fundamental<00:00:42.059> theory<00:00:42.420> behind<00:00:42.600> my<00:00:42.960> program<00:00:43.530> is

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
fundamental theory behind my program is

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.180 
fundamental theory behind my program is
that<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.280> access<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:46.079> our<00:00:46.110> whole<00:00:46.710> brain

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
that we have access to our whole brain

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.790 
that we have access to our whole brain
we<00:00:47.910> don't<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.600> use<00:00:48.930> left<00:00:49.320> brain<00:00:49.590> right

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
we don't have to use left brain right

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.220 
we don't have to use left brain right
brain<00:00:49.980> thinking<00:00:50.340> we<00:00:51.120> can<00:00:51.390> access<00:00:51.629> both

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
brain thinking we can access both

brain thinking we can access both
hemispheres<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.949> our<00:00:53.250> brain<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.820> all<00:00:54.510> eight

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
hemispheres of our brain and all eight

of the brain my program is simple in
many<00:01:00.570> regards<00:01:00.750> but<00:01:01.320> has<00:01:01.500> some<00:01:01.680> serious

how to do whole brain power properly the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.789 
how to do whole brain power properly the
fundamental<00:01:18.000> theory<00:01:18.390> behind<00:01:18.750> my<00:01:19.020> program<00:01:19.500> is

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
fundamental theory behind my program is

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.730 
fundamental theory behind my program is
that<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.430> hands<00:01:20.939> literally<00:01:21.720> grow<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.470> brain

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
that the hands literally grow the brain

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.280 
that the hands literally grow the brain
that's<00:01:23.280> why<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.909> am<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> proponent<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:25.020> Amy

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
that's why I am a proponent of Amy

that's why I am a proponent of Amy
