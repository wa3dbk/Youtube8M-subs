00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.460
 a greeting to all friends 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.519
 androidworld.it welcome to the trial 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.500
 you have not understood no of juan m9 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.160
 also from the use of the feminine of the 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.650
 cover dott view for juan n 9 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.750
 here it is , I'll show you I'll do it 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.080
 see also what I do 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.510
 see also next to the doc view for 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.950
 m night to make you understand some 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.570
 very important differences the first one is 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.360
 which is now transparent so you can 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.610
 see the design of the smartphone and 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.260
 smartphone colors even with the 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.210
 cover with the disadvantage of course that 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.620
 it will go very clean every time 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.270
 carefully before inserting it 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.970
 smartphone in the cover because the dirt 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.040
 which can be accumulated here and then 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.690
 the cover would appear between the smartphone 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.820
 really ugly I saw it with mine 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.200
 eyes and it's really very very ugly 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.170
 I 'm not a big user of covers 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.910
 so I never kept it too long 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.950
 covers of any kind whatsoever 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.100
 transparent or not but you notice and it is not 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.510
 surely it is certainly not beautiful 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.550
 so this is a note of merit known 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.690
 of demerit it is also seen thus a 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.060
 naked eye 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.299
 the new cover is thicker than that 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.409
 previous both in the back and is also 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:22.330
 look at the part above you see it 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.610
 also the panel above is a little bit more 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.920
 often we go to insert the smartphone 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.600
 in the cover that is now put yes 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.600
 fits much more solidly because 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.490
 goes to use the design step 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.460
 of the smartphone to embed everything 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.610
 the smartphone while you are there first 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.320
 I show was only in the corners 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.000
 then possibly a fall 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.460
 he would surely have paraded it but it was 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.470
 however very robust very robust 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.510
 even before the operation is identical 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.250
 then a double tap to wake him up 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.210
 screen here we have different designs 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.330
 so obviously not 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.619
 it is impossible to perceive eventually 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.659
 the difference but I'll show you others 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.570
 differences meanwhile the first is also the 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:07.929
 how this cover opens 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:11.060
 look at the difference between this and 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.610
 this then creates a spec was created 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.040
 a lesser thickness first with lo 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.950
 disadvantage however of having more a 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.410
 spring effect or the cover that is 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.630
 it clicked shut required to 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.130
 click on the phone I go a moment in the 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.080
 customization of the dott view for 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.650
 show you what the new doc can do 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.150
 view 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.000
 actually the previous one does too 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.890
 so is the adoc view 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.019
 previous on the previous model but me 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.410
 I'll show you here there are gods 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.000
 different designs also compared to m8 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.040
 so I can apply a drawing 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.209
 I close and when I double tap you see 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.709
 the drawing appears appears on the poor 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.120
 holiday themes that are what they are 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.370
 appeared in the last year in some days 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.480
 precise once they have appeared 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.829
 now we can also use them 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.450
 always more live themes are nice 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.860
 unfortunately the preview does not show us in 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.880
 movement but once we close 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.180
 you see it turns out you find out what it wants 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.799
 to say the live theme I must say that it is 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.600
 really a beautiful extra effect 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.970
 then meanwhile if we go into my themes 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.290
 we have new possibilities we seperate on 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.390
 the more we can add to themes 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.430
 no sorry adds to themes means that 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.489
 I'm going to get them in the no ho themes 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.600
 wrong I wanted to do another thing I have to 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.870
 wait for 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.790
 forgive me add from gallery here 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:38.269
 here where we can go and get 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:41.450
 a photo we took and then 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.760
 use it and I advise you to do one 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.459
 photo centered particularly at the bottom 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.840
 because because otherwise it happens 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.160
 what you saw here comes 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.870
 out a little cut 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.430
 but if we go to the abse we can do 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.510
 in the meantime we can use the 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.150
 dot design 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.549
 starting from the sketches here already prepared 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.220
 so maybe I know how we can 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.620
 color the belly of this owl or 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.810
 or not 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.560
 or we can go freehand 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.470
 so we can choose maybe a nice one 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:18.410
 green puts not 2x2 put the preview 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:21.260
 or rather not without you first with dots and 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.639
 we made a kind of logo of 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.320
 androidworld by pressing here we have 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.730
 the preview of what appears 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.910
 we can cancel we can change 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.340
 colors or set as doc view 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.960
 and here is the cover of androidworld 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.180
 very very nice too 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.280
 let's go back 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.020
 I'll show you another one 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.490
 function is possible or that of 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:49.040
 dott message then we can put a 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:50.540
 alive androidworld if I can 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.400
 write 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.790
 we do it obviously green on background 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.229
 white no i would say that if we don't want to do 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.330
 something currently unwatchable 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.520
 let's leave it black maybe we put it more 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.229
 fast and since we are real tamarri 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.700
 we also do flashing then 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:10.550
 we press here we close this is another 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.860
 nice feature you can't set it 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.810
 as a fixed cover so you can't 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.520
 leaving it here as a cover for the block 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.470
 screen where to use it as an application 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.020
 to send messages to someone maybe 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.360
 in the dark they are truly spectacular a 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.270
 distance so these are the functions 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.479
 still the main features of the doc view 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.479
 possible 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:46.540
 sorry it was down I remembered 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:46.540
 bad and upwards to get it started again 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.169
 so much demand abandons 

00:05:56.429 --> 00:06:01.539
 ok we can answer the phone calls 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:03.789
 hang up from phone calls postpone a 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.110
 reminder so the functions are various 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:07.659
 what we can do more are the 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:11.589
 notifications so now I've received 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:13.029
 now I have not received a message on 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:17.939
 facebook I don't know why he doesn't 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:17.939
 really see why I've already opened it 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:23.019
 you will have to trust unfortunately here it appears 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:26.080
 the icon of the message we had 

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:27.999
 received and hopefully we can 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.610
 open it and what happens we have to then 

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:32.849
 open the cover and finish watching 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.939
 this is the effect that the back cover makes 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:39.279
 transparent on m9 this is the effect that 

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:41.800
 falsone 8 certainly more beautiful than this 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:43.869
 its m9 looks there's a bit of dust 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.550
 inside the pretty bad effect vi 

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:47.709
 always be very careful among others 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.300
 here also a hair centered 

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:50.919
 real crap always pay attention to 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.419
 clean phones as well as before 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:53.319
 then put them in then once 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:55.419
 included 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:56.860
 it wo n't be easy to get dirty because it is 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:59.229
 really very much of the institution indeed 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.879
 I would say that it is almost impossible though 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:03.669
 in short, be careful first 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:05.259
 other difference you see here the whole 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:08.800
 cover goes to protect the lower part 

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:11.019
 something that does not happen on m8 that in fact yes 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.869
 can still find it falling on the ground for 

00:07:11.019 --> 00:07:16.089
 errors for this test of drew on htc 

00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:19.800
 wanna m9 all a greeting from emanuele 

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:19.800
