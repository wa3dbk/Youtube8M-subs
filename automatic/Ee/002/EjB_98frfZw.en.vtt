00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.740
 now 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.110
 Hello everyone then we will 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.240
 show them the process easy to disarm 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.410
 a laser printer to be repeated 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.550
 maintenance as would be done in any 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:21.470
 type of house know the place to centrism 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.050
 printer in type 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.720
 this topic has a samsung e mail from 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.789
 2010 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.250
 to start with this we're going to need 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.900
 all that is the casing and finally 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.850
 take out the tone that would tip 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.200
 perform a change maintenance inside 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.890
 of the printers 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.900
 this teacher as we can see has 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.900
 four screws on the outside 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.040
 this and be 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.560
 we will proceed first to bring the 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.480
 screws here the sides for 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.720
 take out this stage that is in 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.720
 this place 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.940
 once the stage of finding 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:20.060
 here with a slight pressure 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.820
 You can leave part of circuitry 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.850
 not improve it much is one more to clean 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.970
 what is the dust we will do next 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.900
 therefore we separate all the 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.990
 housing cover 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.970
 now we take out the screws here and 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.540
 our union that I have here of which already 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.540
 I will show you 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.640
 who is here 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.869
 we do not have the screws to lift it 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.490
 the same 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.390
 and we will be here 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:23.950
 with a pressure in this support that here 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.950
 you can open the rises 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.200
 which is in the part here 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.560
 is 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.350
 and of course 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.350
 we have the 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.829
 of paper 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.490
 again with this spiral now 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.440
 we proceed to extract 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.780
 the powder that is a plate or in 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.550
 the inner part of the person can not 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.550
 access with accessibility 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.840
 once we have cleaned by a 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.840
 part of the house 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.700
 we proceed to place again all 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.380
 the pieces going through the toner as 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.370
 we did 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.370
 the moment to disarm 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.829
 because in the same way 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.510
 making it 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.040
 and we continue proposing the 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.040
 you can not 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.080
 this part of here we can 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.120
 close in the meantime for one of the 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.310
 screws or also start by putting the 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.440
 cap that goes on top of the 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.340
 back table 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.340
 but not this 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.150
 and proceed to place the back cover 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.150
 true 

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:20.389
 the next missing just to place 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:24.879
 the last screws 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.879
 as you can see there were six screws 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.490
 apart 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.490
 happen
