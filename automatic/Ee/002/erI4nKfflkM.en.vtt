00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
hello guys welcome to my tutorial and

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.490 
hello guys welcome to my tutorial and
today<00:00:12.330> we're<00:00:12.630> going<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.780> learn<00:00:12.929> on<00:00:13.170> how<00:00:13.440> to

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
today we're going to learn on how to

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:23.990 
today we're going to learn on how to
make<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:14.190> Enderman<00:00:14.670> trap<00:00:15.680> so<00:00:16.680> yeah<00:00:22.609> so<00:00:23.609> first

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
make a Enderman trap so yeah so first

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.450 
make a Enderman trap so yeah so first
step<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:30.410> survive<00:00:31.410> at<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.890> slums<00:00:32.219> is

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
step is to survive at the slums is

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.870 
step is to survive at the slums is
really<00:00:32.850> stupid<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:34.140> yeah<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.309> first<00:00:35.579> step<00:00:35.700> is

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
really stupid so yeah so first step is

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.510 
really stupid so yeah so first step is
to<00:00:35.910> dig<00:00:36.239> three<00:00:37.160> block<00:00:38.160> deep<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:39.800> skip<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:41.070> block

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
to dig three block deep and skip a block

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.459 
to dig three block deep and skip a block
in<00:00:41.760> there<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:43.940> there<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.000> go<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:46.079> place<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
in there and there you go so place the

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.389 
in there and there you go so place the
torch<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.920> there<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.050> there<00:00:49.399> and

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
torch in there and I just in there and

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.130 
torch in there and I just in there and
make<00:00:50.579> sure<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:50.789> not<00:00:50.910> obvious<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.690> there's

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
make sure it's not obvious that there's

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.689 
make sure it's not obvious that there's
there's<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.770> trap<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.129> there<00:00:54.379> so<00:00:55.379> yeah<00:00:55.699> now

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
there's a trap in there so yeah now

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.330 
there's a trap in there so yeah now
place<00:00:57.090> your<00:00:57.199> sticky<00:00:58.199> piston<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:59.510> and

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
place your sticky piston like that and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.130 
place your sticky piston like that and
whatever<00:01:02.340> your<00:01:02.640> trap<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.090> switch<00:01:03.420> mine<00:01:03.899> is

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
whatever your trap is switch mine is

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.789 
whatever your trap is switch mine is
angled<00:01:04.920> or<00:01:05.100> which<00:01:05.970> Endermen<00:01:06.960> one<00:01:07.200> pick<00:01:07.470> up<00:01:07.619> on

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
angled or which Endermen one pick up on

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.100 
angled or which Endermen one pick up on
this<00:01:08.369> bar<00:01:08.810> people<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.360> you're<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> most

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
this bar people so if you're in the most

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.750 
this bar people so if you're in the most
updated<00:01:13.260> server<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.220> want<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.520> kill

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
updated server and you want to kill

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.179 
updated server and you want to kill
someone<00:01:15.110> just<00:01:16.110> do<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:18.259> just<00:01:19.259> cover<00:01:19.890> it

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
someone just do this and just cover it

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.960 
someone just do this and just cover it
up

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.320 

so<00:01:25.660> yeah<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:28.630> how<00:01:28.870> you<00:01:28.930> do<00:01:29.140> that<00:01:29.350> and

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
so yeah that's how you do that and

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.220 
so yeah that's how you do that and
that's<00:01:31.330> pretty<00:01:31.600> much<00:01:31.690> it<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:34.360> that's<00:01:34.930> pretty

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
that's pretty much it so that's pretty

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.610 
that's pretty much it so that's pretty
much<00:01:35.320> part<00:01:35.650> of<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.830> design<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:41.470> can

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
much part of the design and and you can

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.900 
much part of the design and and you can
want<00:01:41.800> it<00:01:41.860> big<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:45.220> do<00:01:45.550> that<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:48.040> bigger<00:01:48.280> the

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
want it big just do that the bigger the

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.500 
want it big just do that the bigger the
better<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:50.350> yeah<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.850> make<00:01:52.000> sure<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:52.270> put

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
better so yeah and make sure you put

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.300 
better so yeah and make sure you put
like<00:01:53.140> that<00:01:53.350> because<00:01:53.710> if<00:01:54.250> they<00:01:54.610> reveal<00:01:55.360> this

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
like that because if they reveal this

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.370 
like that because if they reveal this
they<00:01:57.310> will<00:01:57.520> know<00:01:57.729> that<00:01:58.600> there's<00:01:58.869> a<00:01:58.990> trap<00:01:59.260> in

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
they will know that there's a trap in

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.109 
they will know that there's a trap in
there<00:01:59.729> TNT<00:02:00.729> so<00:02:01.330> yeah<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:03.460> let's<00:02:03.760> switch<00:02:04.090> to

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
there TNT so yeah so let's switch to

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:13.380 
there TNT so yeah so let's switch to
survival<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:06.250> let's<00:02:06.820> take<00:02:07.150> it<00:02:11.730> yeah<00:02:12.730> it's<00:02:13.090> too

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
survival and let's take it yeah it's too

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:23.090 
survival and let's take it yeah it's too
slow<00:02:14.790> let<00:02:15.790> me<00:02:15.970> get<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.180> diamond<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:18.459> go<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:21.300> and

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
slow let me get a diamond you go so and

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.340 
slow let me get a diamond you go so and
there<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.190> go<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:25.240> you<00:02:25.450> can<00:02:25.480> cut<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:26.050> by<00:02:26.290> the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
there you go and you can cut this by the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.600 
there you go and you can cut this by the
way<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.590> forgot<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.130> cut<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:30.580> should

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
way I forgot to cut it and it should

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.530 
way I forgot to cut it and it should
explode<00:02:34.890> very<00:02:35.890> well<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:36.640> this<00:02:36.970> pretty<00:02:37.180> much<00:02:37.269> it

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
explode very well so this pretty much it

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.259 
explode very well so this pretty much it
for<00:02:37.570> today's<00:02:38.110> tutorial<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.950> by<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.670> way<00:02:39.850> like

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
for today's tutorial and by the way like

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.900 
for today's tutorial and by the way like
I<00:02:40.300> said<00:02:40.600> this<00:02:40.840> is<00:02:40.900> not<00:02:41.230> mine<00:02:41.410> if<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:42.519> find<00:02:42.760> a
