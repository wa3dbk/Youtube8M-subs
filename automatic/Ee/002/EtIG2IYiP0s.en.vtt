00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.969 
objective scene so the question then
becomes<00:04:15.750> if<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.139> episode<00:04:16.500> is<00:04:16.620> all<00:04:16.739> along

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
becomes if the episode is all along

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.310 
becomes if the episode is all along
telling<00:04:17.370> us<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.579> he's<00:04:17.699> harmless

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
telling us that he's harmless

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.129 
telling us that he's harmless
what<00:04:19.320> is<00:04:19.500> this<00:04:19.739> scene<00:04:20.130> doing<00:04:20.720> one<00:04:21.720> possibility

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
what is this scene doing one possibility

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.420 
what is this scene doing one possibility
is<00:04:22.350> that<00:04:22.440> they<00:04:22.620> just<00:04:22.860> needed<00:04:23.039> a<00:04:23.190> minor

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
is that they just needed a minor

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.460 
is that they just needed a minor
cliffhanger<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.270> head<00:04:24.449> into<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.960> scene<00:04:25.199> break

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
cliffhanger to head into the scene break

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.529 
cliffhanger to head into the scene break
another<00:04:26.280> possibility<00:04:26.729> is<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.090> little<00:04:27.330> bit<00:04:27.449> of

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
another possibility is a little bit of

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:29.270 
another possibility is a little bit of
miscommunication<00:04:28.500> between<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.889> director

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
miscommunication between the director

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.670 
miscommunication between the director
and<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.490> writer<00:04:29.520> or<00:04:30.389> possibly<00:04:31.139> some<00:04:31.410> sort<00:04:31.650> of

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
and the writer or possibly some sort of

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.100 
and the writer or possibly some sort of
executive<00:04:31.919> meddling<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.729> third<00:04:33.630> possibility

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
executive meddling a third possibility

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.140 
executive meddling a third possibility
and<00:04:34.590> perhaps<00:04:34.889> most<00:04:35.250> interesting<00:04:35.610> is<00:04:36.120> that

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
and perhaps most interesting is that

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.750 
and perhaps most interesting is that
they<00:04:36.449> genuinely<00:04:36.810> wanted<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.770> depict<00:04:38.070> Aloysius

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
they genuinely wanted to depict Aloysius

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.580 
they genuinely wanted to depict Aloysius
as<00:04:38.880> being<00:04:39.150> in<00:04:39.300> some<00:04:39.510> way<00:04:39.660> a<00:04:39.690> menace<00:04:40.110> to<00:04:40.289> spike

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
as being in some way a menace to spike

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.820 
as being in some way a menace to spike
that<00:04:41.190> spike<00:04:41.490> is<00:04:41.699> not<00:04:41.910> quite<00:04:42.350> completely<00:04:43.350> wrong

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
that spike is not quite completely wrong

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.390 
that spike is not quite completely wrong
but<00:04:44.100> there<00:04:44.280> is<00:04:44.460> some<00:04:44.880> truth<00:04:45.240> to<00:04:45.419> his<00:04:45.539> position

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
but there is some truth to his position

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.920 
but there is some truth to his position
unfortunately<00:04:47.400> this<00:04:47.699> amounts<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.150> endorsing

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
unfortunately this amounts to endorsing

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.140 
unfortunately this amounts to endorsing
spikes<00:04:49.410> point<00:04:49.740> of<00:04:49.889> view<00:04:50.039> that<00:04:50.250> they<00:04:50.430> only<00:04:50.940> ways

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
spikes point of view that they only ways

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.760 
spikes point of view that they only ways
to<00:04:51.180> relate<00:04:51.690> to<00:04:51.750> someone<00:04:52.289> are<00:04:52.590> either

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
to relate to someone are either

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.279 
to relate to someone are either
subservience<00:04:53.310> or<00:04:53.880> being<00:04:54.150> a<00:04:54.270> jerk<00:04:54.660> which

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
subservience or being a jerk which

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.260 
subservience or being a jerk which
seeing<00:04:56.039> as<00:04:56.190> we're<00:04:56.400> dealing<00:04:56.820> with<00:04:56.849> a<00:04:57.000> male

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270

character who mostly deals with female

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.950 
character who mostly deals with female
characters<00:04:59.430> is<00:04:59.729> uncomfortably<00:05:00.660> close<00:05:00.840> to
