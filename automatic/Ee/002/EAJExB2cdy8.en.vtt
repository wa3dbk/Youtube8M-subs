00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
know about well two things there's a

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.810 
know about well two things there's a
common-sense<00:00:55.199> approach<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:56.340> says<00:00:56.579> this

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
common-sense approach that says this

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.430 
common-sense approach that says this
this<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.300> really<00:00:57.420> not<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.780> good<00:00:57.989> do<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.199> want

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
this is really not that good do I want

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.020 
this is really not that good do I want
this<00:00:58.590> influence<00:00:59.070> right<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.730> that's<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
this influence right and that's the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.459 
this influence right and that's the
approach<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.390> take<00:01:00.420> there's<00:01:00.989> also<00:01:01.170> some

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
approach I take there's also some

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.750 
approach I take there's also some
research<00:01:01.829> that's<00:01:02.129> pretty<00:01:02.370> good<00:01:02.550> these<00:01:02.699> days

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
research that's pretty good these days

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.700 
research that's pretty good these days
now<00:01:03.239> that's<00:01:03.780> showing<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.140> violent<00:01:04.559> games

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
now that's showing the violent games

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.350 
now that's showing the violent games
really<00:01:04.949> are<00:01:05.129> not<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.430> helpful<00:01:05.670> let's<00:01:06.210> make

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
really are not that helpful let's make

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
really are not that helpful let's make
it<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.600> simple<00:01:08.659> here's<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.750> game<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:09.960> shows

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
it that simple here's a game that shows

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.929 
it that simple here's a game that shows
you<00:01:10.590> know<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.040> car<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.369> slap<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> lady

what<00:01:12.299> what<00:01:13.049> are<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.200> teaching<00:01:13.439> here<00:01:13.830> so

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
what what are we teaching here so

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.219 
what what are we teaching here so
there's<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.850> common<00:01:15.180> sense<00:01:15.390> what<00:01:15.840> does<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.080> do

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
there's the common sense what does it do

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.660 
there's the common sense what does it do
there's<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> over<00:01:16.950> stimulation<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
there's the over stimulation of the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.940 
there's the over stimulation of the
brain<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:18.180> our<00:01:18.299> youth<00:01:18.540> research<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.770> real

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
brain for our youth research is real

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.649 
brain for our youth research is real
clear<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.220> we<00:01:20.790> over<00:01:21.060> stimulate<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> brain

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
clear that we over stimulate the brain

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.719 
clear that we over stimulate the brain
with<00:01:22.290> too<00:01:22.320> much<00:01:22.590> screen<00:01:22.979> time<00:01:23.009> whether<00:01:23.549> it's

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
with too much screen time whether it's

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.480 
with too much screen time whether it's
this<00:01:24.000> or<00:01:24.270> other<00:01:24.810> gaming<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
this or other gaming and this is a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.520 
this or other gaming and this is a
specific<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.600> why<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:27.900> know<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.290> later

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
specific this is why we know that later

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.590 
specific this is why we know that later
we<00:01:28.710> create<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> craving<00:01:29.460> brain<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.180> craves

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
we create a craving brain that craves

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.929 
we create a craving brain that craves
addiction<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.070> outcome<00:01:32.490> either<00:01:32.670> way<00:01:32.880> is

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
addiction so the outcome either way is

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.539 
addiction so the outcome either way is
not<00:01:33.150> good<00:01:33.450> KYNA<00:01:34.229> cause<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> kid<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.070> actually
