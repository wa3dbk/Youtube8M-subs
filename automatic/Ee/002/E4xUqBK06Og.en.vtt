anime but in that scene when you see the

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.940 
anime but in that scene when you see the
CGI<00:02:36.299> on<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.719> tears<00:02:36.989> when<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.290> see<00:02:37.439> Ruby<00:02:37.769> move

clip<00:02:40.290> inside<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:40.889> shoulder<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.519> it<00:02:41.579> looks

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
clip inside of the shoulder and it looks

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.750 
clip inside of the shoulder and it looks
really<00:02:42.030> really<00:02:42.239> wonky<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.290> weird<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.310> don't

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
really really wonky and weird so I don't

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.309 
really really wonky and weird so I don't
know<00:02:44.849> if<00:02:44.969> they<00:02:45.090> actually<00:02:45.299> purposely<00:02:45.870> intended

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
know if they actually purposely intended

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.420 
know if they actually purposely intended
that<00:02:46.439> but<00:02:46.680> that's<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:46.889> little<00:02:46.980> bit<00:02:47.129> weird

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
that but that's a little bit weird

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.309 
that but that's a little bit weird
especially<00:02:47.790> for<00:02:48.239> CG<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.569> get<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.930> see<00:02:49.079> something

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
especially for CG I get to see something

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.409 
especially for CG I get to see something
like<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:50.219> hopefully<00:02:50.849> we<00:02:50.969> don't<00:02:51.090> get<00:02:51.269> to

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:51.419 
like that so hopefully we don't get to

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.030 
like that so hopefully we don't get to
see<00:02:51.599> a<00:02:51.629> bunch<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:52.199> that<00:02:52.349> type<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.650> stuff

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
see a bunch of that type of stuff

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.470 
see a bunch of that type of stuff
but<00:02:53.489> that's<00:02:53.639> something<00:02:53.939> I<00:02:54.000> do<00:02:54.060> want<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.359> bring

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
but that's something I do want to bring

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.449 
but that's something I do want to bring
up<00:02:54.629> it's<00:02:54.840> not<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.989> big<00:02:55.079> issue<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.739> mean<00:02:56.099> it<00:02:56.340> could

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
up it's not a big issue I mean it could

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.129 
up it's not a big issue I mean it could
easily<00:02:56.760> be<00:02:57.120> overlooked<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.019> could

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
easily be overlooked and you could

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.309 
easily be overlooked and you could
overlook<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.919> it's<00:02:59.129> not<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.400> big<00:02:59.879> concern<00:03:00.359> but<00:03:01.049> I

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
overlook it it's not a big concern but I

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.509 
overlook it it's not a big concern but I
mean<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.530> wanted<00:03:01.829> to<00:03:01.919> mention<00:03:02.129> that<00:03:02.280> because

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
mean I wanted to mention that because

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.129 
mean I wanted to mention that because
that's<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.090> only<00:03:03.239> thing<00:03:03.389> I've<00:03:03.599> really<00:03:03.989> felt

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
that's the only thing I've really felt

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.199 
that's the only thing I've really felt
that<00:03:04.379> was<00:03:04.500> awkward<00:03:04.769> about<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.459> CGI<00:03:05.819> in<00:03:06.060> this

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
that was awkward about the CGI in this

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.670 
that was awkward about the CGI in this
episode<00:03:06.569> especially<00:03:07.079> with<00:03:07.169> the<00:03:07.260> tears<00:03:07.500> and

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
episode especially with the tears and

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.929 
episode especially with the tears and
the<00:03:07.739> way<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.040> saw<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.310> clip<00:03:08.669> through<00:03:08.819> the

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
the way I saw it clip through the

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.970 
the way I saw it clip through the
character<00:03:09.359> so<00:03:09.599> besides<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.469> for<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.829> most

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
character so besides that for the most

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.009 
character so besides that for the most
part<00:03:11.159> roosterteeth<00:03:11.879> held<00:03:12.120> out<00:03:12.299> with<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.629> CGI

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
part roosterteeth held out with the CGI

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.709 
part roosterteeth held out with the CGI
in<00:03:13.349> this<00:03:13.560> episode<00:03:14.069> now<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.969> want<00:03:15.299> to<00:03:15.359> talk<00:03:15.510> about

yu-gi-oh<00:05:49.880> and<00:05:50.300> I<00:05:50.840> was<00:05:51.650> laughing<00:05:51.949> I<00:05:52.220> was<00:05:52.340> really

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
yu-gi-oh and I was laughing I was really

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.620 
yu-gi-oh and I was laughing I was really
laughing<00:05:52.669> because<00:05:53.000> it<00:05:53.090> was<00:05:53.180> just<00:05:53.330> so<00:05:53.449> funny

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
laughing because it was just so funny

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.180 
laughing because it was just so funny
getting<00:05:53.870> to<00:05:53.930> see<00:05:54.080> like<00:05:54.289> an<00:05:54.409> element<00:05:54.740> like<00:05:54.949> that

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
getting to see like an element like that

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.620 
getting to see like an element like that
because<00:05:55.669> this<00:05:55.820> is<00:05:55.970> something<00:05:56.180> you<00:05:56.300> would<00:05:56.449> see

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
because this is something you would see

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.260 
because this is something you would see
in<00:05:56.750> a<00:05:56.840> parody<00:05:57.320> anime<00:05:57.830> and<00:05:58.099> that<00:05:58.729> was<00:05:58.940> really

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
in a parody anime and that was really

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.580 
in a parody anime and that was really
shocking<00:05:59.510> to<00:05:59.720> see<00:05:59.930> and<00:06:00.080> that<00:06:00.139> the<00:06:00.229> exact<00:06:00.440> same

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
shocking to see and that the exact same

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.230 
shocking to see and that the exact same
time<00:06:00.770> that<00:06:00.800> entire<00:06:01.130> board<00:06:01.460> game<00:06:01.729> with<00:06:01.880> cards

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
time that entire board game with cards

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.760 
time that entire board game with cards
reminded<00:06:02.930> me<00:06:02.990> something<00:06:03.289> of<00:06:03.409> the<00:06:03.470> Shadow

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
reminded me something of the Shadow

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.490 
reminded me something of the Shadow

now the big thing though is I will be

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.290 
now the big thing though is I will be
shocked<00:06:12.830> if<00:06:13.010> they<00:06:13.099> add<00:06:13.280> in<00:06:13.610> some<00:06:13.909> non

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
shocked if they add in some non

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.899 
shocked if they add in some non

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:16.909 
mainstream anime references like I mean

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.939 
mainstream anime references like I mean
they<00:06:17.030> love<00:06:17.510> referencing<00:06:18.169> their<00:06:18.440> series

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949 
they love referencing their series

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:19.839 
they love referencing their series
they're<00:06:19.159> different<00:06:19.340> things<00:06:19.490> which<00:06:19.729> I

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
they're different things which I

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:21.580 
they're different things which I
understand<00:06:20.330> why<00:06:20.449> they<00:06:20.570> do<00:06:20.630> that<00:06:20.870> but<00:06:21.409> they

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
understand why they do that but they

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.170 
understand why they do that but they
really<00:06:22.010> want<00:06:22.159> to<00:06:22.220> expand<00:06:22.699> to<00:06:22.820> broader
