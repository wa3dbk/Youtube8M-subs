usable space on it and it's a dual sim
dual<00:01:38.500> standby<00:01:38.670> device<00:01:39.670> is<00:01:40.630> micro<00:01:41.110> sim<00:01:41.289> cards

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
dual standby device is micro sim cards

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.029 
dual standby device is micro sim cards
for<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.009> dual<00:01:42.700> sim<00:01:42.909> functionality<00:01:43.479> and<00:01:44.039> let's

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
for the dual sim functionality and let's

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.649 
for the dual sim functionality and let's
quickly<00:01:45.219> take<00:01:45.819> a<00:01:45.880> look<00:01:46.060> at<00:01:46.149> the<00:01:46.210> hardware<00:01:46.420> so

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
quickly take a look at the hardware so

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.230 
quickly take a look at the hardware so
the<00:01:47.259> side<00:01:47.469> you<00:01:47.649> have<00:01:47.770> two<00:01:47.860> slot<00:01:48.399> for<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.700> sim

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
the side you have two slot for the sim

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.889 
the side you have two slot for the sim
to<00:01:49.509> hear<00:01:49.780> this<00:01:50.439> is<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:50.740> volume<00:01:51.069> rocker<00:01:51.100> here

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
to hear this is the volume rocker here

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.199 
to hear this is the volume rocker here
and<00:01:52.899> on<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.020> top<00:01:53.319> you<00:01:53.350> have<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:54.069> power<00:01:54.909> locks

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
and on the top you have the power locks

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:59.130 
and on the top you have the power locks
which<00:01:55.420> audio<00:01:56.350> jack<00:01:57.219> mm<00:01:58.030> also<00:01:58.600> have<00:01:58.780> a<00:01:58.840> slot<00:01:59.079> for

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
which audio jack mm also have a slot for

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.550 
which audio jack mm also have a slot for
the<00:01:59.319> sim<00:01:59.560> one<00:01:59.860> here<00:02:00.100> in<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.849> left<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.439> let's

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
the sim one here in the left so let's

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.880 
the sim one here in the left so let's
see<00:02:02.770> if<00:02:02.890> you<00:02:02.979> can<00:02:03.009> turn<00:02:03.819> it<00:02:03.939> open<00:02:04.569> it<00:02:04.659> off

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.130 

so<00:02:09.280> yeah<00:02:09.429> so<00:02:09.610> yeah<00:02:09.670> are<00:02:10.030> we<00:02:10.060> open<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.660> sim<00:02:10.899> card

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
so yeah so yeah are we open the sim card

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.470 
so yeah so yeah are we open the sim card
slot<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.970> below<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.870> display<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.380> have<00:02:14.500> the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
slot and below the display you have the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.830 
slot and below the display you have the
