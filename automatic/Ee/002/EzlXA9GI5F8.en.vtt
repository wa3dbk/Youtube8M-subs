distribution of each of the
possibilities<00:00:55.159> however<00:00:56.159> let's<00:00:56.760> look<00:00:56.940> at

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
possibilities however let's look at

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.210 
possibilities however let's look at
these<00:00:57.180> hands<00:00:57.540> by<00:00:57.989> comparing<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.739> total

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
these hands by comparing the total

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.609 
these hands by comparing the total
combinations<00:01:02.089> asus<00:01:03.089> is<00:01:03.239> six<00:01:03.540> combos<00:01:03.930> Kings

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
combinations asus is six combos Kings

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.370 
combinations asus is six combos Kings
obviously<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.250> same<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.700> ace<00:01:06.240> king<00:01:06.690> accounts

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
obviously the same and ace king accounts

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.670 
obviously the same and ace king accounts
for<00:01:07.500> 16<00:01:08.100> combos<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.880> said<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.530> see

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
for 16 combos we said so we can see

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.500 
for 16 combos we said so we can see
there<00:01:10.830> are<00:01:10.860> plenty<00:01:11.190> more<00:01:11.310> ace<00:01:11.580> king<00:01:12.000> hands<00:01:12.270> in

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
there are plenty more ace king hands in

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.420 
there are plenty more ace king hands in
this<00:01:12.690> players<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.170> range<00:01:13.380> than<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.890> big<00:01:14.130> pairs

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
this players of range than the big pairs

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.539 
this players of range than the big pairs
so<00:01:15.390> out<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.960> 28<00:01:16.409> possible<00:01:16.920> combinations

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
so out of the 28 possible combinations

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.080 
so out of the 28 possible combinations
made<00:01:17.790> up<00:01:17.939> other<00:01:18.119> aces<00:01:18.420> kings<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.290> ace<00:01:19.409> Kings

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
made up other aces kings and ace Kings

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.750 
made up other aces kings and ace Kings
16<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.270> them<00:01:21.390> come<00:01:21.660> from<00:01:21.690> Ace<00:01:22.050> King<00:01:22.520> this<00:01:23.520> means

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
16 of them come from Ace King this means

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.700 
16 of them come from Ace King this means
that<00:01:23.880> when<00:01:24.090> our<00:01:24.120> opponent<00:01:24.600> for<00:01:24.780> bets<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
that when our opponent for bets the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.220 
that when our opponent for bets the
majority<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> time<00:01:26.700> he<00:01:27.300> is<00:01:27.360> holding<00:01:27.660> a<00:01:27.870> K

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
majority of the time he is holding a K

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.610 
majority of the time he is holding a K
and<00:01:28.260> not<00:01:29.160> the<00:01:29.310> other<00:01:29.460> big<00:01:29.670> pocket<00:01:30.000> pairs

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
and not the other big pocket pairs

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.290 
and not the other big pocket pairs
here's<00:01:31.620> another<00:01:31.950> look<00:01:32.250> at<00:01:32.520> how<00:01:32.730> we<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:33.030> use

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
here's another look at how we can use

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.860 
here's another look at how we can use

speculative 89 suited the flop comes 489
all<00:01:44.490> spades<00:01:45.620> obviously<00:01:46.620> quite<00:01:46.800> a<00:01:46.860> good<00:01:47.070> flop

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
all spades obviously quite a good flop

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.880 
all spades obviously quite a good flop
but<00:01:47.730> our<00:01:47.880> tight<00:01:48.150> opponent<00:01:48.720> see<00:01:49.260> bets<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.650> to<00:01:49.740> us

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
but our tight opponent see bets in to us

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.580 
but our tight opponent see bets in to us
how<00:01:50.730> likely<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.330> he<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> flush<00:01:52.320> here

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
how likely is he to have a flush here

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.820 
how likely is he to have a flush here
how<00:01:53.310> worried<00:01:53.640> should<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:53.850> be<00:01:53.970> exactly<00:01:54.830> well

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
how worried should we be exactly well

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.040 
how worried should we be exactly well
since<00:01:56.100> our<00:01:56.280> opponent<00:01:56.730> is<00:01:56.820> tied<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.480> is<00:01:57.900> open

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
since our opponent is tied and is open

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.480 
since our opponent is tied and is open
utg<00:01:58.770> let's<00:01:59.700> say<00:01:59.940> he<00:02:00.090> opens<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.690> checkup<00:02:01.490> king

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
utg let's say he opens a checkup king

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.320 
utg let's say he opens a checkup king
queen<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.090> pocket<00:02:03.990> aids<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.409> up<00:02:05.090> most<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
queen and pocket aids and up most of the

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.460 
queen and pocket aids and up most of the
time<00:02:06.510> when<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.750> solve<00:02:06.930> for<00:02:07.110> problems<00:02:07.409> like

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
time when you solve for problems like

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.469 
time when you solve for problems like
this<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:08.190> want<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> group<00:02:08.729> villains<00:02:09.090> holdings

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
this you want a group villains holdings

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.949 
this you want a group villains holdings
so<00:02:10.200> let's<00:02:10.709> work<00:02:10.920> with<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.220> pair's<00:02:11.459> first

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
so let's work with the pair's first

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.479 
so let's work with the pair's first
we're<00:02:12.959> beating<00:02:13.319> through<00:02:13.590> tens<00:02:13.920> through<00:02:14.370> to

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
we're beating through tens through to

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.910 
we're beating through tens through to
the<00:02:14.580> Aces<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.390> over<00:02:15.810> their<00:02:15.989> heads<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.739> that's

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
the Aces the over their heads so that's

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.309 
the Aces the over their heads so that's
six<00:02:17.190> combinations<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.909> pairs<00:02:18.150> remember<00:02:18.569> so

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
six combinations of pairs remember so

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.430 
six combinations of pairs remember so
that's<00:02:19.470> tens<00:02:19.799> jacks<00:02:20.519> Queens<00:02:21.239> Kings<00:02:21.690> aces<00:02:22.290> all

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
that's tens jacks Queens Kings aces all

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.420 
that's tens jacks Queens Kings aces all
x<00:02:23.190> 6<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:24.330> five<00:02:24.870> pairs<00:02:25.200> times<00:02:25.770> six<00:02:26.190> combinations

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
x 6 so five pairs times six combinations

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.980 
x 6 so five pairs times six combinations
is<00:02:27.000> 30<00:02:27.720> combinations<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.620> pairs<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.190> have

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
is 30 combinations of pairs you can have

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.500 
is 30 combinations of pairs you can have
over<00:02:30.990> cards<00:02:31.350> include<00:02:31.800> ace<00:02:31.980> jack<00:02:32.490> ace<00:02:33.060> Queen

ace king and queen Kings so remember we

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.900 
ace king and queen Kings so remember we
said<00:02:37.230> when<00:02:37.470> two<00:02:37.800> cards<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.370> different<00:02:38.700> rank

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
said when two cards of different rank

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.730 
said when two cards of different rank
come<00:02:39.270> together<00:02:39.569> there's<00:02:40.080> 16<00:02:40.530> possible

come together there's 16 possible

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.170 
come together there's 16 possible
combinations<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:42.680> that's<00:02:43.680> four<00:02:44.520> times<00:02:45.140> 16<00:02:46.140> is

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
combinations so that's four times 16 is

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.660 
combinations so that's four times 16 is
64<00:02:48.180> combinations<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:48.990> over<00:02:49.260> cards<00:02:49.670> but

so<00:04:25.440> there's<00:04:25.620> 50<00:04:26.040> cards<00:04:26.250> left<00:04:26.520> that<00:04:27.090> can<00:04:27.240> be

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
so there's 50 cards left that can be

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.870 
so there's 50 cards left that can be
dealt<00:04:27.540> on<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.870> flop<00:04:28.080> of<00:04:28.350> course<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.670> flop

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
dealt on the flop of course the flop

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.270 
dealt on the flop of course the flop
contains<00:04:30.210> three<00:04:30.540> cards<00:04:30.960> so<00:04:31.970> 50<00:04:32.970> x<00:04:33.240> 49<00:04:33.690> x<00:04:33.930> 48<00:04:34.440> /

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
contains three cards so 50 x 49 x 48 /

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.450 
contains three cards so 50 x 49 x 48 /
remember<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.330> same<00:04:36.540> card<00:04:36.870> can't<00:04:37.380> appear<00:04:37.950> more

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
remember the same card can't appear more

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.160 
remember the same card can't appear more
than<00:04:38.520> once<00:04:38.670> so<00:04:39.150> we're<00:04:39.270> using<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.690> reduction

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
than once so we're using the reduction

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.780 
than once so we're using the reduction
formula<00:04:40.590> 3<00:04:41.250> times<00:04:41.520> 2<00:04:41.730> times<00:04:41.910> 1<00:04:43.040> so<00:04:44.040> as<00:04:44.220> the

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
formula 3 times 2 times 1 so as the

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.790 
formula 3 times 2 times 1 so as the
denominator<00:04:44.940> think<00:04:45.660> of<00:04:45.750> it<00:04:45.840> as<00:04:45.960> 3<00:04:46.170> cards<00:04:46.650> are

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
denominator think of it as 3 cards are

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.310 
denominator think of it as 3 cards are
being<00:04:46.980> dealt<00:04:47.310> then<00:04:47.940> two<00:04:48.150> more<00:04:48.360> than<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.170> last

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
being dealt then two more than the last

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.540 
being dealt then two more than the last
one<00:04:49.700> so<00:04:50.700> there's<00:04:51.350> 19<00:04:52.350> thousand<00:04:52.830> six<00:04:53.460> hundred

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
one so there's 19 thousand six hundred

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.330 
one so there's 19 thousand six hundred
possible<00:04:54.480> flops<00:04:54.780> how<00:04:55.440> many<00:04:55.620> contains<00:04:56.040> three

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
possible flops how many contains three

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.120 
possible flops how many contains three
suited<00:04:56.670> cards<00:04:57.000> allowing<00:04:57.600> a<00:04:57.660> flop<00:04:57.900> flush<00:04:58.200> well

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
suited cards allowing a flop flush well

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.430 
suited cards allowing a flop flush well
using<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.700> same<00:04:59.910> method<00:05:00.330> let's<00:05:00.900> calculate<00:05:01.110> it

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
using the same method let's calculate it

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.820 
using the same method let's calculate it
so<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.850> player<00:05:03.180> needs<00:05:03.390> to<00:05:04.080> sudah<00:05:04.410> cards<00:05:04.710> to

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
so the player needs to sudah cards to

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.400 
so the player needs to sudah cards to
flop<00:05:05.040> a<00:05:05.100> flush<00:05:05.130> so<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.240> would<00:05:06.390> leave<00:05:06.540> 11<00:05:07.200> left

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
flop a flush so that would leave 11 left

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.480 
flop a flush so that would leave 11 left
in<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.650> deck<00:05:08.300> 11<00:05:09.300> x<00:05:09.510> 10<00:05:09.780> x<00:05:09.930> 9<00:05:10.260> over<00:05:10.740> three<00:05:11.220> times

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.200 
in the deck 11 x 10 x 9 over three times
two<00:05:11.700> times<00:05:11.940> one<00:05:12.030> equals<00:05:13.700> 165<00:05:14.700> flop

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
two times one equals 165 flop
