well<00:00:39.790> now<00:00:40.420> Sampson<00:00:41.079> has<00:00:41.320> a<00:00:41.350> solution<00:00:41.800> for<00:00:41.949> that

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
well now Sampson has a solution for that

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.270 
well now Sampson has a solution for that
because<00:00:43.000> they've<00:00:43.270> got<00:00:43.510> a<00:00:43.539> TV<00:00:43.809> behind<00:00:44.140> us<00:00:44.559> that

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
because they've got a TV behind us that

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.430 
because they've got a TV behind us that
you<00:00:45.820> can<00:00:46.000> actually<00:00:46.449> sit<00:00:46.719> down<00:00:46.930> on<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.260> couch

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
you can actually sit down on the couch

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.650 
you can actually sit down on the couch
with<00:00:47.770> glasses<00:00:48.070> on<00:00:48.460> them<00:00:48.789> look<00:00:49.090> much<00:00:49.329> like<00:00:49.510> the

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
with glasses on them look much like the

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.270 
with glasses on them look much like the
3d<00:00:49.899> glasses<00:00:50.109> we're<00:00:50.530> used<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:50.800> seeing<00:00:51.039> around

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
3d glasses we're used to seeing around

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.430 
3d glasses we're used to seeing around
CES<00:00:51.850> but<00:00:52.390> you<00:00:52.480> can<00:00:52.660> sit<00:00:52.870> down<00:00:52.899> in<00:00:53.199> front<00:00:53.320> of

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
CES but you can sit down in front of

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.529 
CES but you can sit down in front of
this<00:00:53.530> TV<00:00:53.829> and<00:00:54.219> actually<00:00:54.850> watch<00:00:55.000> two<00:00:55.359> different

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
this TV and actually watch two different

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.040 
this TV and actually watch two different
shows<00:00:56.109> the<00:00:56.829> way<00:00:56.980> it<00:00:57.129> works<00:00:57.489> much<00:00:58.120> like<00:00:58.149> 3d<00:00:58.780> is

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
shows the way it works much like 3d is

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.090 
shows the way it works much like 3d is
that<00:00:59.710> it<00:01:00.160> is<00:01:00.340> showing<00:01:00.579> you<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.840> whole<00:01:02.530> left

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
that it is showing you the whole left

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.310 
that it is showing you the whole left
eye<00:01:03.370> right<00:01:03.429> I<00:01:03.670> think<00:01:04.089> but<00:01:04.330> it's<00:01:04.509> blocking<00:01:04.929> off

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
eye right I think but it's blocking off

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.580 
eye right I think but it's blocking off
the<00:01:05.740> one<00:01:05.950> eye<00:01:06.100> for<00:01:06.550> each<00:01:07.179> person<00:01:07.869> so<00:01:08.110> one

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
the one eye for each person so one

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.410 
the one eye for each person so one
person<00:01:08.920> won't<00:01:09.009> be<00:01:09.190> seeing<00:01:09.520> one<00:01:09.729> program<00:01:10.179> while

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
person won't be seeing one program while

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.580 
person won't be seeing one program while
the<00:01:10.539> other<00:01:10.690> one<00:01:10.810> will<00:01:10.929> be<00:01:11.020> watching<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.410> other

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
the other one will be watching the other

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.010 
the other one will be watching the other
one<00:01:11.830> on<00:01:12.039> the<00:01:12.340> same<00:01:12.580> screen<00:01:13.000> you've<00:01:13.660> also<00:01:13.780> got
