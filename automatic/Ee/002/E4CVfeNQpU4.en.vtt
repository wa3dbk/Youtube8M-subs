00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.430
 good to all and welcome to the new 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.809
 questions and answers good as 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.430
 you always have a gameplay of these 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.560
 the cos 2 that I have recorded since 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.689
 centuries and this time it's a game of 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.060
 team duel on the root map 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:24.020
 I think it was called playing with the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.940
 pistolita cac-40 and in the end is a 22 1 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.039
 If I'm not mistaken, I think it's a 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.779
 quite acceptable departure to go with 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.130
 this weapon but good I do not want 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.689
 roll up a lot more because we have 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.040
 interesting questions and the video 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.800
 neither is it too long so 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.380
 let's go with the first one in which slim ox 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.329
 995 tells me inc and what do you think that the 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.750
 people break things like playstation 3 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.340
 xbox games of 60-70 euros etcetera so 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.739
 just to get attention on youtube 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.450
 Well, I'm honest and it's going to be a video 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.770
 and talking about this topic since I 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.450
 it seems a bit strong what is 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.399
 happening lately with the anger of the 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.680
 week but I take this question from 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.420
 this user to talk about the subject as 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.340
 you all know lately the anger of 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.320
 the week of josemi for more than anger 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.530
 clips of people are being sent 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.490
 breaking everything but plan phones 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.280
 consoles games printers mice 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.020
 keyboards and I stay a little 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.869
 Defar what the hell the people are doing 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.310
 you know or is that I 'm going to be honest 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.290
 maybe I'm not the best person to 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.090
 talk about this topic since I have given 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.009
 to meet in the anger of the week but 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.130
 is that these people seem to me sincerely 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.470
 delayed I give you my point of view more 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.210
 honest because later if maybe the 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.680
 people say in a comment on a video 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.720
 It is not that these things we are 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.670
 breaking up did not work but it's that 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.470
 see male a playstation 3 that does not 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.590
 It works, you go to sell it by ebay 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.509
 and they give you 50 euros or I know if a 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.310
 game you do not like because it takes you out a lot 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.649
 piss off or you do not like the 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.080
 game or choose what you take to the game you get 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.300
 nine euros and to take it in the ass uncle not 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.070
 it is necessary to break it I do not know to me 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.950
 it seems a bit asshole what is 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.200
 doing a lot of people in sending eclipse 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.259
 to the anger of the week that are breaking 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.929
 things and honestly I do not know the people that 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.600
 he called me retarded or crazy about 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.459
 get angry at a video game these people 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.989
 that breaks things I do not know what they are I already 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.180
 I say to me they seem delayed 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.980
 mental is that they have no other word and 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.480
 is that in addition to more inri then the 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.519
 most are children 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.099
 that I believe that parents do not even 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.659
 they know what they have done, that is, 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.220
 It seems impressive because many of 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.500
 the clips appear children breaking 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.120
 consoles and I believe that parents neither 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.519
 they do not even have a fucking idea of ​​what 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.739
 they are doing their children but well there 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.750
 is the thing we pass to the next 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.519
 question in which iván martín tells me 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.250
 if you had to eliminate a youtuber 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.110
 who would be without any doubt without 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.090
 no doubt one of these damn 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.190
 channels that are of beauty that you 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.530
 teach tutorials on how to make up 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.829
 certainly attentive to the triple feed with 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.209
 the cab 40 was definitely going to be one of those 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.849
 channels of those who teach you to 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.970
 Make-up of how to paint your lips 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.920
 Put on rouge I know is that seriously 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.049
 kids I can not stand those channels 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.750
 I hold them and for me they could close them 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.010
 all tomorrow same good we passed to the 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.140
 next question in which nicolás 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.870
 remedy more and tell me you have thought 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.849
 catch a pc 4 in the future because I am 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.769
 sincere and I thought about buying a 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.870
 playstation 4 to play with those who 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.299
 be playstation but after I've 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.050
 put to think to see the playstation 4 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:27.920
 they are 399 euros, good 400 euros 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.020
 then the playstation network that 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.150
 you have to buy you are about thirty 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.730
 forty euros and then separately each time 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.410
 that a multiplatform game came out 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.240
 I would have to buy it for two consoles 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.210
 for the xbox one and for the playstation 4 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.370
 and that is that I get into a fucking big buck 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.840
 and believe me I thought about catching a 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.430
 playstation 4 to play with those who 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.230
 you are from playstation that I know that many 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.510
 you are from playstation but it's going 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.190
 I ended up throwing it back because it's 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.200
 that is a lot of money and apart I have 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.510
 to pay me the xbox live gold and then 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.800
 If I start to add up, it's very much like 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.390
 you know I am a person who 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.420
 it's just not that I have much 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.670
 money what little I earn with my work 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.730
 I give it to my parents and the rest 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.440
 Well, it does not give me anything that goes so 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.560
 If I thought about buying a 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.300
 playstation 4 but it's impossible kids 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.880
 and well let's go with the last question in 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.160
 the one that opens cadabra 69 tells me inc and 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.590
 How many megabytes do you have because of incredible 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.740
 I think I have a connection of 12 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.100
 megas of which I get 89 and I have 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.260
 a rise speed of 0.9 or be a 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.950
 trash whore to give you an idea 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.470
 every time 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.060
 and upload a video of approximately 15 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.850
 minutes since my computer has to 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.620
 be uploading video me 5 or 6 hours 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.750
 it takes a lot of time to upload the videos and 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.070
 many times he even got to despair 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.650
 because while the 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.030
 video I can not use anything because 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.580
 it practically takes me to open the 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.440
 I mail an eternity and it's all very slow 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.910
 so well this has been all I hope 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.040
 that you have served the answers that 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.540
 I have given and see you in a next 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.540
 video kids until next time 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.320
 two 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.580
 if you go 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.580
 or not
