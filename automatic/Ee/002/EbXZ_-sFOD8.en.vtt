00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
then you're using it lmv so you can

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.920 
then you're using it lmv so you can
carry<00:04:58.129> on<00:04:58.309> hold<00:04:58.639> it<00:04:58.759> down<00:04:58.909> that<00:04:59.089> trigger<00:04:59.360> but

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
carry on hold it down that trigger but

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.420 
carry on hold it down that trigger but
then<00:05:00.050> you<00:05:00.139> see<00:05:00.289> someone<00:05:00.319> at<00:05:00.710> a<00:05:00.770> long<00:05:00.949> range<00:05:01.189> in

then you see someone at a long range in
your<00:05:01.550> aim<00:05:01.699> down<00:05:01.879> sights<00:05:02.240> now<00:05:02.479> your<00:05:02.960> reticule

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:03.649 
your aim down sights now your reticule

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:05.619 
your aim down sights now your reticule

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
this is the game is built so by when you

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:13.869 
this is the game is built so by when you
do<00:05:12.379> aim<00:05:12.589> down<00:05:12.770> sights<00:05:13.069> whilst<00:05:13.490> your<00:05:13.729> hip
