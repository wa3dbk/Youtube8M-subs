the iPad is the most advanced piece of
technology<00:05:16.360> that<00:05:16.509> I've<00:05:16.749> ever<00:05:16.930> worked<00:05:17.139> on<00:05:17.409> an

00:05:17.549 --> 00:05:17.559 
technology that I've ever worked on an

custom silicon that we designed for this
product<00:06:27.510> that<00:06:28.110> silicon<00:06:28.620> is<00:06:28.710> called<00:06:29.040> a<00:06:29.340> food

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
product that silicon is called a food

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.200 
product that silicon is called a food
and<00:06:30.350> it's<00:06:30.830> really<00:06:31.220> built<00:06:31.460> by<00:06:31.550> our<00:06:31.700> Hardware

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
and it's really built by our Hardware

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.060 
and it's really built by our Hardware
team<00:06:32.450> in<00:06:32.690> concert<00:06:33.110> with<00:06:33.260> our<00:06:33.350> software<00:06:33.800> team

and what that gives you is a level of

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.870 
and what that gives you is a level of
performance<00:06:36.770> that<00:06:36.830> you<00:06:37.070> can't<00:06:37.340> achieve<00:06:37.460> any

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
performance that you can't achieve any
