the things the galaxy s6 is kind of
known<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.630> at<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.110> point<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.680> camera

known for at this point is the camera

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.580 
known for at this point is the camera
protrudes<00:01:35.490> out<00:01:35.700> quite<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> bit<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:37.110> makes

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
protrudes out quite a bit and this makes

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.380 
protrudes out quite a bit and this makes
it<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.040> you've<00:01:38.369> got<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.549> little<00:01:38.939> extra

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
it so that you've got a little extra

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.600 
it so that you've got a little extra
room<00:01:39.600> there<00:01:39.740> above<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.799> camera<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.460> when<00:01:41.579> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
room there above the camera so when you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.670 
room there above the camera so when you
lay<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.000> down<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:42.960> not<00:01:43.200> going<00:01:43.560> to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
lay it down like this it's not going to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.260 
lay it down like this it's not going to
touch<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.070> table<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> lot<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.939> people<00:01:45.180> will

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
touch the table so a lot of people will

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.969 
touch the table so a lot of people will
like<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.350> easily<00:01:46.619> check<00:01:46.799> your

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.230 
like that you can easily check your
heart<00:01:47.159> rate<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.430> can<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.729> put<00:01:47.880> your<00:01:47.970> finger

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
heart rate you can just put your finger

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.670 
heart rate you can just put your finger
in<00:01:48.329> here<00:01:48.450> they've<00:01:48.630> cut<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.960> out<00:01:49.079> nicely<00:01:49.350> and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
in here they've cut it out nicely and

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.700 
in here they've cut it out nicely and
that<00:01:49.770> works<00:01:50.549> well<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.259> that's<00:01:52.259> pretty<00:01:52.590> much

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
that works well and that's pretty much

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.109 
that works well and that's pretty much
it<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.009> doesn't<00:01:53.189> add<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> whole<00:01:53.700> lot<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.909> bulk

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
it it doesn't add a whole lot of bulk

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.609 
it it doesn't add a whole lot of bulk
but<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.420> doesn't<00:01:54.689> add<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> whole<00:01:55.079> lot<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.320> lay<00:01:55.500> on

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
but it doesn't add a whole lot of lay on

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.350 
but it doesn't add a whole lot of lay on
the<00:01:55.770> table<00:01:55.950> protection<00:01:56.610> either<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.180> see

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
the table protection either you can see

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.200 
the table protection either you can see
there's<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.570> slight<00:01:57.780> lip<00:01:58.170> not<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.950> ton<00:01:59.310> but<00:01:59.549> you

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
there's a slight lip not a ton but you

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.940 
there's a slight lip not a ton but you
can<00:02:00.360> lay<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.630> down<00:02:00.659> like<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.020> now<00:02:01.770> they<00:02:01.890> do

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
can lay it down like that now they do

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.830 
can lay it down like that now they do
make<00:02:02.070> some<00:02:02.219> cases<00:02:02.729> for<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> edge<00:02:03.210> version<00:02:03.540> as

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
make some cases for the edge version as

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.560 
make some cases for the edge version as
well<00:02:04.020> if<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.229> have<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.439> s6<00:02:04.890> edge<00:02:05.270> but<00:02:06.270> they

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
well if you have the s6 edge but they

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.600 
well if you have the s6 edge but they
actually<00:02:07.290> didn't<00:02:07.710> send<00:02:07.890> me<00:02:08.009> any<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.190> those<00:02:08.340> but

actually didn't send me any of those but

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.070 
actually didn't send me any of those but
I<00:02:08.640> just<00:02:08.849> thought<00:02:08.940> I'd<00:02:09.119> send<00:02:09.390> these<00:02:09.539> or<00:02:09.690> show

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
pop this out not real

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.670 
pop this out not real
easy<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.100> get<00:02:14.250> your<00:02:14.430> case<00:02:15.060> off<00:02:15.390> there<00:02:16.200> we<00:02:16.320> go

poly bumper rather and this is a little
bit<00:02:40.440> different<00:02:40.920> than<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.250> other<00:02:41.370> one<00:02:41.580> you've

depending on the case that you want to

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.620 
depending on the case that you want to
use<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.480> can<00:02:45.630> use<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:46.140> gold<00:02:46.380> silver<00:02:47.160> or

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
use you can use the gold silver or

use you can use the gold silver or
sapphire<00:02:48.630> black<00:02:49.020> here<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:51.020> let's<00:02:52.020> take<00:02:52.290> this

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
sapphire black here and let's take this

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.320 
sapphire black here and let's take this
off<00:02:52.770> so<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:53.040> can<00:02:53.190> show<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.580> inside<00:02:54.060> which

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
off so I can show you the inside which

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.780 
off so I can show you the inside which
is<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.750> rubberized<00:02:55.380> case<00:02:55.710> now<00:02:56.490> what<00:02:56.610> they've

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
is a rubberized case now what they've

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.640 
is a rubberized case now what they've
said<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.060> it's<00:02:57.390> got<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:57.720> kind<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.230> diamond

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
said is it's got this kind of diamond

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.020 
said is it's got this kind of diamond
pattern<00:02:58.860> in<00:02:59.130> here<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.430> this<00:02:59.520> is<00:02:59.640> supposed<00:02:59.970> to

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
pattern in here and this is supposed to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.660 
pattern in here and this is supposed to
reduce<00:03:00.210> scratches<00:03:01.020> on<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.500> back<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.220> keeps

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
reduce scratches on the back so it keeps

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.940 
reduce scratches on the back so it keeps
the<00:03:02.880> dust<00:03:03.030> away<00:03:03.270> from<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.690> phone<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.170> then

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
the dust away from the phone and then

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.470 
the dust away from the phone and then
around<00:03:05.190> here<00:03:05.430> we<00:03:05.520> have<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.790> ring<00:03:06.000> where<00:03:06.300> that

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
around here we have the ring where that

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.360 
around here we have the ring where that
bumper<00:03:07.140> goes<00:03:07.290> around<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.860> then<00:03:07.980> on<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.190> back

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
bumper goes around and then on the back

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.790 
bumper goes around and then on the back
it's<00:03:08.640> just<00:03:08.700> really<00:03:09.240> flexible<00:03:09.800> rubberized

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
it's just really flexible rubberized

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.250 
it's just really flexible rubberized
material<00:03:11.510> so<00:03:12.510> let's<00:03:12.630> go<00:03:12.780> ahead<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:12.960> put<00:03:13.170> our

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
material so let's go ahead and put our

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.160 
material so let's go ahead and put our
phone<00:03:13.530> in<00:03:13.740> this<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.220> this<00:03:15.150> has<00:03:15.420> better<00:03:15.780> drop

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
phone in this and this has better drop

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.500 
phone in this and this has better drop
protection<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:17.010> would<00:03:17.610> say<00:03:17.820> than<00:03:18.060> this<00:03:18.209> case

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
protection I would say than this case

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.180 
protection I would say than this case
because<00:03:18.959> you've<00:03:19.110> got<00:03:19.260> this<00:03:19.440> plastic<00:03:19.950> ring

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
because you've got this plastic ring

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.430 
because you've got this plastic ring
around<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.550> outside<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:21.660> here's<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.230> ring

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
around the outside so here's the ring

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.260 
around the outside so here's the ring
now<00:03:22.860> depending<00:03:23.280> on<00:03:23.340> which<00:03:23.520> one<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:23.880> want<00:03:24.090> if

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
now depending on which one you want if

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.750 
now depending on which one you want if
you<00:03:24.420> prefer<00:03:24.780> gold<00:03:25.050> or<00:03:25.320> or<00:03:25.950> whichever<00:03:26.459> one<00:03:26.640> you

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
you prefer gold or or whichever one you

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.940 
you prefer gold or or whichever one you
like<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.630> is<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.780> little<00:03:27.989> bit<00:03:28.140> tricky<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.590> put<00:03:28.800> on

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
like it is a little bit tricky to put on

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.330 
like it is a little bit tricky to put on
and<00:03:29.550> it's<00:03:30.510> really<00:03:30.780> actually<00:03:31.709> easier<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.100> put

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
and it's really actually easier to put

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.180 
and it's really actually easier to put
on<00:03:32.370> with<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.970> ring<00:03:33.180> on<00:03:33.360> first<00:03:33.390> so<00:03:34.230> if<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.410> take

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
on with the ring on first so if you take

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.410 
on with the ring on first so if you take
this<00:03:35.430> off<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:37.280> kind<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.400> snap<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.940> ring<00:03:39.150> into

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
this off and kind of snap the ring into

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.470 
this off and kind of snap the ring into
place<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:41.160> can<00:03:41.310> see<00:03:41.520> it<00:03:41.670> fits<00:03:41.940> right<00:03:42.239> into

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
place you can see it fits right into

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:54.330 
place you can see it fits right into
these<00:03:42.720> slots<00:03:42.989> here

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.780 

there<00:03:55.340> we<00:03:55.430> go

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
there we go

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.650 
there we go
and<00:03:56.360> then<00:03:56.480> we<00:03:56.980> slide<00:03:57.980> our<00:03:58.160> case<00:03:58.430> onto<00:03:58.819> the

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
and then we slide our case onto the

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.530 
and then we slide our case onto the
phone<00:03:59.900> now<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:01.370> gold<00:04:01.640> with<00:04:01.910> this<00:04:02.030> color<00:04:02.330> may

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.180 
phone now the gold with this color may
not<00:04:02.690> look<00:04:02.870> as<00:04:03.050> nice<00:04:03.200> but<00:04:03.920> they've<00:04:04.069> really

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
not look as nice but they've really

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.100 
not look as nice but they've really
covered<00:04:04.670> up<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.910> buttons<00:04:05.209> on<00:04:05.360> the<00:04:05.390> side<00:04:05.750> here

top we have access to our IR blaster at
microphone<00:04:52.190> as<00:04:52.340> well<00:04:52.520> so<00:04:53.120> it<00:04:53.450> does<00:04:53.600> have<00:04:53.840> a

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
microphone as well so it does have a

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
these cases or this case it protects

these cases or this case it protects
that<00:04:59.330> camera<00:04:59.900> and<00:05:00.470> you<00:05:00.800> can<00:05:00.950> get<00:05:01.070> your<00:05:01.190> finger

in<00:05:01.610> there<00:05:01.729> for<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.180> heart<00:05:02.630> rate<00:05:02.810> sensor<00:05:03.200> but

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
in there for the heart rate sensor but

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.590 
in there for the heart rate sensor but
other<00:05:04.040> than<00:05:04.220> that<00:05:04.310> I<00:05:04.669> have<00:05:05.030> to<00:05:05.180> say<00:05:05.330> out<00:05:05.450> of
