 Assassin's Creed iii We will introduce the other side of the production 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.350
 This is good 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.220
 It is the reverse side of Assassin's Creed 3 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.220
 ame 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:35.650
 European countries will arrive in North America and the shipping industry of Atlantic ship 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.580
 Actively done 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:44.470
 Among them, the United Kingdom aim to establish the economic system of 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:47.470
 Several cities on the east coast for the purpose of managing imports to colonies 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:51.810
 We went as a base for trade 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.810
 Boston Tea Party is Come on famous 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:03.000
 We included such historical events in the game 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:03.000
 So you have to be able to experience in the game events that are known as knowledge 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:20.990
 Get a map of colonial Boston and New York with the help of historians and get a realistic city 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.540
 Reproduced the elements of 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:31.870
 If anyone who knows the city at that time sees this landscape 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:35.410
 I tried to reproduce a realistic movement that felt the sense of life of the people living there 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:39.310
 It also animals to walk the road in Wagamonogao a mix to power 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:45.450
 Those who buy 2 at that time let the lid fall in the street 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.450
 I had to grasp edible when the opportunity arises to eat the leftovers 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.060
 There are a lot of tricks for new experiences in the town 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.550
 It was prepared the hiding place where you can keep track of the target hiding this time 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:07.260
 Hmm 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.260
 Hiding in various places, you should be able to approach the target and assassinate without being noticed 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:21.800
 Not only the change of time which newly introduced the all height system but also the environment by the season such as summer and winter 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.800
 Realistically reproduce the change of 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:33.640
 The densely populated area of ​​the city requires more cautious action 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:36.970
 As meek as in want of the horse-drawn carriage ran the roof of the building when the horse-drawn carriages to escape placed 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.989
 You can jump in and jump out there further 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.440
 You can rush into an open object and hit the winker and get out on the other side 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.810
 Hiko in the kitchen during 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.810
 I'm surprised that 10 people because I'm born 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:03:00.370
 It is hard to live in an unexplored land, not only in freezing winter, but also in summer heat, which is damped with moisture 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:07.170
 Also have to bear 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:13.080
 Survival in this harsh land can be said to be just a battle of death 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:15.599
 The decisive difference from the previous series is in the magnificent nature in the element of this wilderness 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:20.630
 Moving around is a new experience 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:25.820
 An open land lined with Sakai trees is the first field to appear 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:28.700
 You can go through deep snow, but it's because you 're going through the snow 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.780
 The move will slow down in the corner too 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:38.330
 I tried to make this unexplored land a place where life can live 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:41.620
 The important thing is that there are animals, and here more than 20 animals 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.620
 I was also able to hunt 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.830
 Image with both convincing and realistic look Upon to appear a wild animal in the game 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:54.819
 We paid attention to reproduction of 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:04:01.709
 One of the great attraction is not free but tree learning here 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:01.709
 Connor jumps freely from tree to tree and makes this place the best playground 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.070
 The rounds depicted here involve not only Britain but also France and Spain and the Netherlands 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.539
 It was a scale thing 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:31.600
 The fortune of improvement at that time depends on approaching 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:37.639
 It is the final battle after getting into an enemy ship 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:43.569
 On the side of the enemy ship and steal Asked ship moved jump on the deck of the ship, but the number of many at that time 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:43.569
 It is better not to damage the ship as much as possible in order to take loot 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:55.279
 The circuit influenced the independence war Sea is also a commercial route 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:05:00.829
 It's a very important to win the sea Ne was made also at the root of the aggression 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:05:01.329
 The circuit was the key, and the United States decided victory by the blockade of Yorktown . 

00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:04.710
 is 

00:05:01.329 --> 00:05:07.770
 An important battle that is a turning point in history 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:13.100
 So I wanted to include it by all means 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.100
 We have created a special team to make it perfect 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:23.320
 Drawing the circuit was very difficult especially for the expression of digging the realistic movement of wind and water etc. 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:27.700
 There was also doubted completed in large-scale video 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:31.810
 In the full simulation image that reproduces the circuit in the open sea 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.289
 Connor issues command to ship crew as captain commander 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.000
 It is an overwhelming reality 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:38.340
 Hey you 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.340
 I feel like I was united with the sea on the ship 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:46.630
 This is what I wanted to reproduce in the game It was not very room but it was enough for the finish 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.630
 I am satisfied that 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:01.580
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:05.440
 Assassin's Creed This is a great opportunity to see for people who have never experienced it 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:10.660
 Both the story and the character are completely new 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:14.050
 This time the production team got together so many people who liked Assassin's Creed 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:16.360
 It should be an interesting game with a fan's eye 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:20.660
 Run out to the creators favor 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:27.220
 One word is great I'll be overwhelmed by the result 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:27.220
 It is the best Assassin's Creed that everyone who plays will be satisfied
