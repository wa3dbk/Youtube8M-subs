00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
to I guess made work the computer a

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.500 
to I guess made work the computer a
little<00:00:16.230> bit<00:00:16.350> more<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.740> we'll<00:00:17.640> run<00:00:17.910> some<00:00:17.940> games

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
little bit more and we'll run some games

little bit more and we'll run some games
from<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.740> B<00:00:19.830> drive<00:00:20.070> what<00:00:20.310> we'll<00:00:20.460> do<00:00:20.580> is

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
from the the B drive what we'll do is

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.529 
from the the B drive what we'll do is
we'll<00:00:20.850> load<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.090> US<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.260> drive<00:00:22.650> and

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
we'll load the US on to the a drive and

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.060 
we'll load the US on to the a drive and
run<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> simple<00:00:24.930> pac-man<00:00:25.439> program<00:00:25.830> from<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
run a simple pac-man program from the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.849 
run a simple pac-man program from the
from<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.730> p<00:00:27.330> drive<00:00:27.410> alright<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.619> let's<00:00:28.769> get

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
from the p drive alright so let's get

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.890 
from the p drive alright so let's get
started<00:00:28.980> alright<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:29.910> let's<00:00:30.090> first<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.660> all<00:00:30.750> I

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
have doss 2.1 and this drive here which

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.660 
have doss 2.1 and this drive here which
will<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.390> dry<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.230> then<00:00:38.010> I've<00:00:38.129> got<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.340> floppy

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
will be a dry and then I've got a floppy

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.030 
will be a dry and then I've got a floppy
here<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.270> bunch<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.600> games<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.140> just<00:00:40.170> picked

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.260 
here with a bunch of games I just picked
this<00:00:41.160> disk<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.730> from<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:44.000> computers<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.030> earn

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
this disk up from the computers to earn

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.990 
this disk up from the computers to earn
a<00:00:45.390> computer<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.320> surplus<00:00:46.710> store<00:00:46.920> there<00:00:47.910> were

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
a computer the surplus store there were

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.520 
a computer the surplus store there were
some<00:00:48.149> bunch<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.450> disks<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.930> there<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> say<00:00:49.410> this

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
some bunch of disks and there I say this

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.100 
some bunch of disks and there I say this
once<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.890> gains<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.309> instead<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.579> figure<00:00:50.850> about

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
once it gains so instead of figure about

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.510 
once it gains so instead of figure about
so<00:00:52.110> we'll<00:00:52.289> put<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.739> B<00:00:52.890> drive<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.340> won't

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
so we'll put that in B drive but I won't

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.330 
so we'll put that in B drive but I won't
close<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.059> door<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.870> see<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.050> let's<00:00:55.770> first<00:00:56.039> load

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
close the door to see I let's first load

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.240 
close the door to see I let's first load
up<00:00:56.489> daus<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:57.420> we'll<00:00:57.539> run<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.809> from<00:00:57.899> there

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
up daus and then we'll run it from there

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:06.100 
up daus and then we'll run it from there
alright<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.960> turn<00:01:00.960> power<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:05.309> daus<00:01:05.790> is

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
alright so turn power on and daus is

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.980 
alright so turn power on and daus is
slowly<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.310> boot<00:01:08.490> up<00:01:10.010> a<00:01:11.900> little<00:01:12.900> bit

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
slowly going to boot up a little bit

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.330 
slowly going to boot up a little bit
back<00:01:13.170> here<00:01:16.729> it's<00:01:17.729> kind<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.939> difficult<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:19.340> work

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
back here it's kind of difficult to work

70 ack em a and you don't have to put
the<00:03:04.110> dot<00:03:04.290> exe<00:03:04.440> at<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.980> end<00:03:05.130> everybody<00:03:05.430> knows

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
the dot exe at the end everybody knows

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.240 
the dot exe at the end everybody knows
that's<00:03:07.380> also<00:03:07.650> good<00:03:07.799> about<00:03:07.920> these<00:03:08.070> old

that's also good about these old

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.810 
that's also good about these old
computers<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.850> just<00:03:09.060> seems<00:03:10.519> you<00:03:11.519> know<00:03:11.640> what's

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
fun it's gonna press any key arm there

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.800 
fun it's gonna press any key arm there
we<00:03:23.170> go<00:03:23.970> so<00:03:24.970> it's<00:03:25.180> gonna<00:03:25.300> be<00:03:25.420> kind<00:03:25.570> of<00:03:25.600> hard<00:03:25.750> to

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
really wanted to demonstrate on this

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.610 
really wanted to demonstrate on this
particular<00:04:21.340> video<00:04:21.640> is<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.030> fact<00:04:22.240> that<00:04:22.620> when

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
particular video is the fact that when

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.500 
particular video is the fact that when
we<00:04:23.740> load<00:04:23.890> Dawson<00:04:24.430> the<00:04:24.520> one<00:04:24.700> floppy<00:04:25.030> we<00:04:25.360> can

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
we load Dawson the one floppy we can

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.000 
we load Dawson the one floppy we can
actually<00:04:25.660> play<00:04:26.020> games<00:04:26.260> on<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.590> other<00:04:26.740> and

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
actually play games on the other and

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.860 
actually play games on the other and
like<00:04:27.550> I've<00:04:27.700> said<00:04:27.730> millions<00:04:28.210> of<00:04:28.330> times<00:04:28.540> these

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
like I've said millions of times these

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.290 
like I've said millions of times these
computers<00:04:29.410> 5150<00:04:30.100> did<00:04:30.280> not<00:04:30.550> come<00:04:30.970> with<00:04:31.120> hard

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
computers 5150 did not come with hard

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.210 
computers 5150 did not come with hard
drives<00:04:31.570> that<00:04:31.900> was<00:04:33.030> not<00:04:34.030> an<00:04:34.300> option<00:04:34.540> so<00:04:35.230> anyway

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
drives that was not an option so anyway

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.370 
drives that was not an option so anyway
that's<00:04:36.370> it<00:04:36.580> for<00:04:36.640> this<00:04:36.910> video<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.270> I<00:04:38.020> don't

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
that's it for this video and I don't

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.510 
that's it for this video and I don't
know<00:04:38.440> what<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.680> next<00:04:38.770> one<00:04:38.980> will<00:04:39.070> be<00:04:39.100> but<00:04:39.370> we'll

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
know what the next one will be but we'll

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.470 
know what the next one will be but we'll
figure<00:04:39.730> that<00:04:39.940> out<00:04:40.470> bye
