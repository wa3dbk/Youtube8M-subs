everything I have no idea
the<00:03:03.760> only<00:03:03.880> thing<00:03:04.120> inside<00:03:04.480> is<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.959> stove

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
peace of mind that the future people who

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.750

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
ceilings so yeah I also quite find it

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.129

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
funny that the cupboards are opening

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.770 
funny that the cupboards are opening
like<00:04:54.169> this<00:04:54.620> way<00:04:54.889> rather<00:04:55.160> than<00:04:55.340> this<00:04:55.610> way<00:04:55.849> so

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
like this way rather than this way so

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.770 
like this way rather than this way so
for<00:04:56.930> example<00:04:57.199> this<00:04:57.320> one<00:04:57.560> like<00:04:57.770> just<00:04:58.690> zip<00:04:59.690> it

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780

for example this one like just zip it
all<00:04:59.960> I<00:04:59.990> think<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:01.910> then<00:05:02.150> you<00:05:02.240> have<00:05:02.360> some

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180
