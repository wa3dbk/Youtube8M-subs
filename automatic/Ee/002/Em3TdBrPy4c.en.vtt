00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.629
 autumn is the big time when he 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.610
 we still have a lot of hours brad have 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.770
 also unscrewed at the very beginning where we 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.660
 starts to carve Toulouse brno arbus 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.190
 we're going to mix all that stuff for 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.190
 make a good compost 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.260
 from spring until autumn 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.720
 we are simply with the tones 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.369
 and when composting these herbs 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.989
 there are always bad smells and 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.760
 it's not always good these smells 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.130
 who are nauseating aboard it displeases 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.140
 to the fake vaset and to yourself it is necessary 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.940
 well the re for airing clippings of 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.489
 grass it must be associated with 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.470
 crushed branches the interest of owning 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.330
 a crusher that can reduce to nothing 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.350
 all these plants that are very 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.350
 bulky in the garden 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.980
 a little golden rule then what you 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.840
 believe plants what you can 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.570
 cut with to its ordinary creators 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.280
 is valid for for a grinder a 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.100
 ordinary grinder of course a 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.930
 grinder for amateurs so here's the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.760
 intro diameter that needs to be who can 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.770
 to be scrambled beyond that when 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.479
 even be wary so now the purpose 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.880
 it is to mix that we spent 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.430
 grinder on the grass to give 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.180
 the air in principle to others 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.369
 acknowledgments all cover 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.610
 well distributed throughout the whole of 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.860
 surface to what will happen to garlic 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.430
 fit to next time you go 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.229
 mowing them back to grass because 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.180
 that now we are over and 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.890
 make successive layers like that 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.479
 and here we will have a component that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.020
 wants well managed and that goes well 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.509
 include 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.420
 then to finish we will spend our 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.490
 compost for which decomposes faster 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.070
 and once we've packed them well if 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.630
 you are in a dry period we go the rose 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.660
 and it takes at least 10 liters of water 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.490
 per square meter to be sure to have 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.590
 a compound that will decompose well 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.149
 by grinding the plants, how are you? 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.920
 save money 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.810
 are going to make your compost pile bigger 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.640
 a pile of compost that will be better 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.370
 quality and next year you 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.600
 can enrich your garden with a 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.600
 compost of very good quality
