00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.270
 hi people his ears and 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.920
 today I presented you a video 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.180
 a little bit particular since I 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.590
 play 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.120
 to share my tips and tricks we 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.370
 survives but I want everything to have 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.780
 started with the series of eliminations 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.890
 that 's the series that allow you to 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.690
 make money because there is 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.369
 a lot of players who asked for that 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.930
 beginners players so I think 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.080
 that it could help you 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.240
 so I will introduce each series 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.640
 one by one starting to talk series 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.170
 of eliminations then it's simple to do 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.330
 the elimination rounds just kill 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.410
 four enemies without taking damage 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.360
 so there you will see that I have 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.600
 chained four enemies time to do 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.460
 touch and so that the series goes down to 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.899
 0.1 of course if you are touched no 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.420
 for each series whatever the type 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.059
 of the series here it will be his cage he 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.079
 just kill enemies without the 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.670
 bar go down 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.100
 finally in fact java you kill a 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.510
 enemy the bar goes up and the beard 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.760
 go down alone any matter if 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.930
 you do not touch or so actually 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.700
 you the first time you do 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.950
 a series b birth in the second 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.810
 times you win milla and his experts 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.930
 so if pulls maybe simple it takes 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.500
 eliminate enemies by shooting them in 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.660
 the head 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.200
 there is a mean wind a little simpler 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.490
 matter if you kill enemies by not 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.040
 not withdrawing in the head it will not do 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:24.020
 go back down the series just enough 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.420
 to kill four or five years so shoot 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.049
 then series knife so there the series 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.369
 hokuto just chain the enemies 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.630
 by shooting at them so you could 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.310
 see that if you kill enemies at 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.200
 knife it makes you go up but 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.119
 that if you shoot at an enemy do not 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.340
 pass a little ball well this 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.630
 goes down to 0 so here I believe that the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.280
 dead is just to let you know 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.990
 a little trick more 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.670
 that with the dead key you are more 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.549
 powerful when you use your 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.939
 knife so what's the blow then you 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.350
 ask a little c four and you wait 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.579
 so there I made a small flash fail 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.200
 years which means that I have less quickly 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.409
 besides you can see including 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.470
 a flash your health were going strongly 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.549
 diminished so there you ask a little ckt 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.049
 when you see all the enemies are 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.929
 above you make farting by pressing 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.880
 twice on carey so now I 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.860
 introduce you to my little things and my 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.680
 hints then it can be small 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.180
 simple stuff 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.319
 most konÃ© players I think that 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.969
 I'm a very good player I'm going 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.950
 not teach you much but 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.780
 it's also a little more tips 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.780
 strategic or little things are 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.189
 not necessarily coni so there the 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.109
 first thing I'm going to show you 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.030
 has stuck a helicopter bombing 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.099
 so in fact it allows you to eliminate 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.299
 helicos much faster 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.799
 especially in the others so eat there 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.540
 I'm not asking you for a very 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.889
 low it is necessary that the helicopter is not 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.269
 too far away that you were launching a 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:42.549
 bombing on it you'll see that 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.049
 the bombing is stuck to the helicopter is 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.609
 what suddenly the miss they go on 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.329
 it's very fast for the eliminated 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:51.189
 So this is a little trick 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.659
 is rather strategic in fact only for 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.150
 avoid using plenty of bomba 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.530
 when there remains that early masses for 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.700
 recommend calling units so that 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.169
 especially if you're up tomorrow 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.120
 because if you are all alone and that 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:03.159
 you call a unit a single unit 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.620
 his typing on the farm and 2 you call 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.689
 two units of boubous and when the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.730
 Mass rates are stuck in your units 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:13.030
 as it is going to be the case there eh ben you 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.030
 do you want to strafe them and they will 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.159
 fall fast enough since your tastes or 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.780
 still puts them blows of 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.489
 shield make them fall to the ground you 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.769
 can their aim calmly head 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.180
 it's going fast enough to kill them 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.329
 especially that generally you have 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.010
 used small hottie on at 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.769
 during the round so they will fall 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.449
 pretty fast then actually it's for 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.379
 avoid the bursts of helicopter so that's it 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.879
 can help players who are 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.079
 do not know too much to actually avoid 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.000
 a burst of crime that just 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.739
 when the helicopter took its position and 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.720
 you started aiming at you you 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:48.069
 drop then be you complete 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.569
 either put you in a position to crawl 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.790
 under it simply allows you to avoid 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.090
 the helicopters or if it's a technique 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.030
 which is very useful in maps like 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.129
 black box you have three helicopters and that 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.870
 you are not wrong, uncovered 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.989
 your turn was called units for 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.579
 to diversion actually the the 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.159
 orders yesterday the helicopters are going to get 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.629
 focus more for your units 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.000
 so here I advise you to call 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.280
 deltas only on you and so in there 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.370
 you will see that 10 to two helicos 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.780
 who will go on the deltas and who have 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.549
 left alone if you allow 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.549
 turn much more easily 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:30.530
 this has a little trick that I show you 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.730
 there really is nobody but when 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.320
 you have a bombing in your hands 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.880
 you are about to launch you can when 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.660
 even launched flashes so this allows 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.250
 to flash opponents and and 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.810
 protect your buddy if jamie happen 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.700
 a little trick when you have a good 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.460
 well before that a little something too 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.050
 that many people do not know and 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.850
 breastfeeding crates 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.100
 which piece any of 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.600
 three crates you can send 500 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.760
 dollars so many times you 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.040
 want one of course have to 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.990
 the money you have to your friend and 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.190
 he can of course make good us 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.640
 saw that I sent from nicolas is 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.170
 immolated rank there I move on to a trick that 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.630
 is rather a technique 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.730
 in fact it is actually change 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.620
 manipulate the spawn of enemies using 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.510
 of your helicopter so actually in function 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.270
 from where you start you have some 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.890
 spawned helicopter that are predefined and this 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.870
 are these enough spawn the key masto are going 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.820
 appear of course and when you 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.710
 launch a unit at this point and ben 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.790
 the helicopter and mas early it will appear 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.080
 further and if you call two units 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.570
 at first and but there will only be two 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.520
 toki masses will appear last 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.050
 masters will appear when any of the four 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.210
 helicopters will be gone that you have a 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.450
 limit actually of four helicos on the 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.980
 map 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.320
 so there you see the third nico who 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.540
 so comes 6th strata that I have 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.270
 used on several maps curly alain 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.010
 ath guys and commissions i'm going 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.960
 power during my video grammar so 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.750
 it's one for me it's the best 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.880
 strategy on just about every map 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.470
 that one did not do it on a lot of 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.270
 matches but I really think it's 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.040
 the best possible strategy at the beginning 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.630
 early masses two units of boubous 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.210
 only tomorrow storage you can 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:09.050
 hold and eliminate already quite a lot of enemies 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:11.200
 from the beginning of the round you will 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.610
 for that it is expensive but what like that 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.110
 they heal and the bug of life so 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.730
 know that today you have a bug of 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.980
 life that appears when you are 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.570
 flashed twice we do not really know 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.110
 for its part and to cure it is enough 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:27.230
 just to throw a flash and 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.210
 blow up a c4 on your box 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.680
 done and you can the saunier there I 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.540
 just show you how to cure it 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.450
 impose such a case such flash sign 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:40.260
 and then so here I show you and 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.880
 to finish a little trick to know in 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.200
 done is that both players in mode 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.570
 survival can not die 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.890
 at the same time in fact so there you 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:51.120
 go see make up each of 10-4 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.490
 each indicates the dead I will launch 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.140
 a bombardment agree that we 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.310
 should die of course every 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.280
 two since only one of his four 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.900
 is enough to kill you but that my 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.480
 teammate leave the ten dies all 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:06.890
 right away and not me here I hope that 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.890
 you liked it at ciao
