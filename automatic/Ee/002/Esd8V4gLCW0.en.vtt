 Justin Dogan: Hey guys, Justin is here checking the copies with the progress in the Bama Terminator. 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.690
 Now this is our '03 Cobra position that we build with the Pama Performance Team for the sole 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.019
 The purposes of being just a thorough monster track. If you guys capture the first video, you 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.470
 Know our little plans. We ride out of the stock blower as long as we can with 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.009
 The bolt is snap-in, and after it's max is something out, we're going to rip it out, put it on completely 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.890
 Various snake power is capable of some dangerous numbers. You guys will have to stay 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.340
 Tuned, because later we are going to throw this thing on Dyno for the first time 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.910
 And then we're going to take it down to tracking and figure out what kind of numbers it's capable of 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.879
 to. In the meantime, if you want to see these videos, first of all you have to subscribe

 You are catching this on Facebook, more of our YouTube channel president, AmericanMuscle Video 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:49.280
 And subscribe while you're there. 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.440
 In the first video, we checked out some of the basics of Blower. Add to the top and bottom 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.359
 Reel from the Miko sport cars to increase the boost, while the amount of cold air C &amp; L 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.059
 Making the power input and body combo choke sure our Eaton blower factory will be a good feed 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.800
 With plenty of air. Fueling wisdom, we have kept things simple at the moment with pump pump 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.440
 Of MSD, which should be able to handle our added fueling needs. 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.710
 Now along with the Pama Performance Team, we're going to round out some of that performance 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.520
 The basics in addition to showing you some of the men parts we've been to promote up this factory 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.250
 Independent rear suspension before you hit the track for the first time with our partners 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.410
 New Car Projects. What do you say we check out some of those parts? 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.270
 Pulleys and eating all sorted out with this car, it was really time for us to start thinking 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.640
 About exhaust. Now, of course, we want something that happens to help us get out right 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.560
 Away, but we also want something to happen to work for us later on the road 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.100
 When we do get a bit more radical. So along with the Pama performance team, 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.160
 We decided on one quarter and three crazy heads long tube inches, in collaboration with 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.640
 Crazy 3-inch off-road X-pipe. Now the crazies are definitely one of the biggest names in 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.530
 The game, this setup should help really give us a lot of power pretty much everywhere around 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.130
 Curve, that would really help us out without higher gains to the end, and that, of course, is 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.740
 What we want here with our automotive sector. 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.240
 When it came time to pick the actual exhaust of the car, it's really just boiled down to 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.320
 We have a personal preference. Again, with the Pama Performance Team, we put our heads together. 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.910
 We wanted something that would give the car a nice little rumble, so we decided to build on 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.410
 American Flowmaster Thunder Cat - Back Series. You really can not beat this exhaust. I mean, 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.480
 Full stainless steel construction around, polished 3 inch tips look awesome coming 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.910
 From the back, frankly, guys, you can never go wrong with the Flowmaster-Mustang combo. 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.080
 While we still have the car in the air why, you do not show some guys the things you've done 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.980
 Do to make the rear a bit more brave, just as now. I'm sure a lot of you 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.120
 The men had hit us for a solid rear axle immediately, especially given the 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.780
 This is something that goes mainly to seeing the tape as a duty. Truth be told, I was probably one of the 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.260
 these people. But we wanted to ride the IRS stock out for as long as possible, just to see 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.690
 What can be done. Frankly, there are 9S guys going on IRS, just giving a little help, so 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.620
 We know it has been done. 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.530
 For starters, we snatched one of the carbon fiber pieces from our overdrive from our friends 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.160
 Shop Dreifshavt. Now, frankly, I can not say enough good things about this product. 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.870
 We used many cars on our project builds in the past, and the thing is just 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.790
 Pretty much a damn near bulletproof. After that, we fully built and updated our 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.370
 Rear end using the bearing bearing Ford Racing and gear kit While we were there, 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.590
 We actually punched up those 3.55 stock gears for a range of 3.73s. Now, the gears 3.73, side by side 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.200
 With 28-inch tall tires it seems that magic setting here with this cobra, should be put 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.110
 Us through traps at the top [inaudible 00:03:20], and that's exactly what we were looking for 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.040
 to. As for our teams, we went with tried and the real Detroit wardrobe from Eaton. Little 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.790
 Tough to drive on the street, but when it comes to putting power down the track, 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.270
 You can accept any alternatives. The only thing is rock. Again, guys, just like our setup cars, 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.150
 This is just the tip of the iceberg, and we certainly dive a little deeper 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.390
 IRS, make it a bit more lead. Now, with the power levels we see, 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.160
 This thing must find us just getting down the road. 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.780
 Which wraps us up to date, men. I'll come out of under the car, I am 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.950
 You will show a couple of things under the hood, and then you will get this thing over and over again 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.030
 For Daino. 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.550
 All right, men, we know now, when we start really put these roots informants to 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.610
 Work, as we are now, increasing the impulse, the heat quickly becomes the enemy. So, with 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.630
 A page from some of our past builds a bolt-up on the GT500s, we went with a double AFCO 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.709
 Pass the heat exchanger out there, which should really help keep things cool in our current location 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.890
 Strengthen levels and levels of power, especially later on down the road. 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.620
 Under the hood, as you can see, we have a couple of beautiful parts of Canton. we've got 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.819
 Aluminum heat exchanger tank, which is nice, replaces factory cheap piece 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:27.110
 Often that cracks. We also have them supercharger battery box radiator tank. right Now, 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.009
 I love this one. This is actually the latest and the street version. It does not have vent on it, 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.349
 Of course, it has a nice big top, so when we get to the track we can ice 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.669
 Something down, hopefully, keep that nice blower and cool for a few passes. 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.150
 All right, Paul, it looks like you're working hard here, brother. You just got around 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.789
 The melody in his request? 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:46.210
 Paul Maister: Just about issued in just cleaning. Some fuel pump voltage tables, some 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.479
 Fueling some timing, we are ready to make our final withdrawal. 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.960
 Justin Dogan: Well, this sounds like you're ready to do a pull, so let me get on 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.960
 Out of the way then. All right, Paul, we certainly heard that Eaton overtime, his brother, 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.419
 458, 469 in the rear wheels. You've got to be very happy with that. 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.620
 Paul Maister: Yes, completely raised with the power of the car provided, right in the neighborhood 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.740
 What we wanted. I can not wait to see what this thing is going to do. 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.120
 Justin Dogan: Must be quite a bunch with about 450 pounds of torque right off idle? 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.729
 Paul Maister: Oh, yes. 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.180
 Justin Dogan: Nice, man. Well, I think there's only one way to find out guys. We are on our way 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.139
 To get this thing so packed, head to the track and see how it did. 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:25.039
 Justin Dogan: All right, guys, so we're down here on the road with Pama Terminator. 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.319
 My companion and friend, Paul, from the performance of the Bama here with me hanging and we are on our way to shake 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.249
 This thing is down. Paul, what do you think she intends to do, man? 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:34.180
 Paul Meister: Based on Dyno figures, that she put down, and perhaps to mid-high (11). 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.800
 Justin Dogan: Too cool. I know traction should be the issue here with this thing. we 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.719
 Just sticking with the cutters right now, hopefully, those half shafts stay together, 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:41.069
 Also. is not it? 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:43.210
 Paul Maister: Yes, hopefully, nothing breaks, but you never know the track. 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.479
 Justin Dogan: You never know the track, but on the plus side, guys, we have a beautiful 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.439
 Today's weather conditions are low, low humidity, so we have to work for us. I guess it is 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:57.439
 Just time to get this thing on line and see how it does. 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:05.120
 All right, Paul, so the first blackmail pass, 12.0, is not too bad, followed immediately 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.729
 And 11.8. This thing is definitely where we want it. 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.430
 Paul Maister: Exactly. It is true where we want it, and we know what make it power on 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.949
 Dyno, we saw it lead in the track, put some ice into the internal chiller tank to 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:23.949
 Take advantage of this canton tank, that AFCO heat exchanger, we are ready to start. It's for 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:39.039
 On. that's what I am talking about. 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:48.580
 Justin Dogan: Well, Paul. Well, this is settling down. I mean, it was a great night, 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:57.529
 A successful night everywhere. The car just went 11.4 in the last pass. We demand 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:59.830
 It's night there. We could not ask for much more. 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.589
 Paul Maister: No, not at all. We got to the perfect weather and allowed the car to cool down and make 

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:04.939
 Adjust the couple melody, then let it rip down the road. 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:10.860
 Justin Dogan: Yes, until 11.4, I think the 121 was the best pass of the night, with 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.409
 1660 boot time. This is not so bad, considering that it was radial. is not it? 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:14.449
 Paul Maister: No, not bad at all. 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:17.460
 Justin Dogan: Yeah, we actually ran the spots for a few passes, but we ran into an issue. 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.990
 We actually have been grinding on some brake components here in IRS, so we actually have 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.779
 I took that retreat and the car went a bit faster. Go figure. 

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:23.319
 Paul Maister: Yes, that's great. 

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:26.969
 Justin Dogan: Man. Well, now we're going to get crazy, we're going to give up on that Eaton 

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:29.180
 Completely, you've got something crazy about your help. is not it? 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.589
 Paul Maister: Yes, something completely crazy, quite different. 

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:32.830
 Justin Dogan: Did you make great powers? 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:33.599
 Paul Maister: Oh, yes. 

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:35.669
 Justin Dogan: That's the goal. is not it? So, guys, you're going to have to stay tuned
