00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.100
 it was necessary that the technician should be 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.200
 answered by boys and girls by 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.810

 times the boys have no products

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.920

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.809

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.280
 that can be recorded with 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.960
 was recorded with anyone 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.460
 You feel free to record your 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.770
 channel on youtube I 'll leave the link 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.450
 here below with blog source 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.120
 if you want to pick up the questions 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.490
 personally with the paulo channel as well 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.410
 on your violin down because I 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.640
 I'm going to netbook questions and not 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.409
 trust in god 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.420
 a child without revealing the video was to 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.060
 down but it's yummy 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.210
 the first question what your product 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.020
 Joker for the skin hair I think 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.440
 one of the joker's for the skin and hair is the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.259
 Bepantol tenth best solution 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.850
 vitamin B5 that can be used in the leg 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.310
 I also think you remembered the affection that 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.810
 it keeps the skin 's hair moisturizing 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.369
 very dry skin you put a 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.470
 some cotton and comes to depend on 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.170
 each citizen receives with hair 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.810
 and add the cream and your 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.450
 hair 30 - dried 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.610
 I think it would be a wildcard product 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.509
 so I think it 's a wild product skin 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.220
 hair 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.550
 the second asks your piece of clothing 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.830
 favorite was not combined with the answer I 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.080
 I was going to say a white shirt but she did not 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:15.239
 Do you want white do not go in doha with 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:17.730
 jeans jeans she was a 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.730
 Play as a joker because she's going to serve 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.690
 america talk doing this and white 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.500
 not with the house can always count 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.570
 We ate a lot of things, we did not leave . 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.400
 So I do not leave home without 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.690
 money and cell phone 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.460
 I think some things 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.950
 indispensable if I had in mind 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.380
 street communication went crazy 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.480
 I do not like to use the pay phone things 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.480
 payphone think I have to have 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.870
 borrowed money which product there 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.940
 your state's analyst is at the top of 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.990
 your brazilian list take my free 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.340
 desires is where all fiction and mac in 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:59.540
 a net basis is also what I think 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:04.850
 which is the moment the desire to buy 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.680
 what comes easy example the blog which the 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.990
 that currently does not go out of your head 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.220
 the music that does not currently come out of my 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.030
 head 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.490
 It is a criminal of the music that I think 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.270
 that if the name of the song I swear is not in 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:23.660
 name of this girl who is very typical stays there 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.420
 There is no one on the video but I 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.770
 I do not know, I'll let the song be a 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.770
 little we hear in 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:49.360
 the next question is is a company 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.720
 that the course of the next questions 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:56.020
 question is who is what inspires 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.810
 I think it inspires are great singers. 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.690
 great musicians of the bloggers tending 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.060
 to influence the community the population 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.870
 Something I think everyone else 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.860
 who tries to do his part to help 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.390
 someone to help others with whom you 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.209
 know how to do I think people 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.100
 breathe like Lady Gaga with our quanta 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.940
 people convey something good to the 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.930
 people 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:26.490
 we can achieve a success 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.919
 I think these people inspire me. 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.000
 if he had set fire to his house and 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.620
 you grow saved the volume make 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.460
 cosmetic clothing or accessory that you 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.520
 would save 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.280
 I do not think I would do any 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.259
 Let's electronic 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.740
 What would you do on your cell phone? 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:48.630
 primarily on a liquid basis only 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:53.580
 I think I could survive for some 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:56.069
 minutes with the belly and control is 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.240
 the best clothes in your opinion do not 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:58.740
 I will answer that question because I do not 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.370
 I know many brands 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.289
 I think there are some brands that 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.970
 You're with not going to comment. 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.380
 I do not know there are no searches on 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.380
 miracle to tell you 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.550
 What's the coolest place you've ever been? 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:18.659
 which traveled coolest place I 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:21.240
 There was São Paulo way I think it was 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:24.960
 when I resolved my own state 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:27.599
 nor the one in São paulo was when I 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.000
 I always went to the state I think it was a day. 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:33.150
 different in everything different 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.699
 it was really fun what's the first thing 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.220
 What are you going to do when you come in? 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:40.440
 at the mall when you 're a movie in the 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.509
 cinema, the place of man is this 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.560
 When I did not watch a movie, I guess. 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.270
 What I'm going to do is showcase and I'm going 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.849
 look for something to buy vice is 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.699
 one thing interests me which party 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:54.800
 How do you like it the most and what would you change? 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:58.080
 I think I really like my body. 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.569
 I'm very thin but I do not like this magician. 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.009
 so I do not think I would change anything in 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.349
 I think it 's part of my body but 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:06.509
 stock currently has the hair I'm 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:08.250
 getting it from him the way I 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:10.139
 I think that part of the 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:15.060
 dissatisfied in my belly of my 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:16.770
 Mom I do not show my belly stayed 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.259
 How would I think I would have the courage? 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.789
 to have a plastic surgery 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.110
 I think it's a very good analysis, I think. 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:25.349
 that if I could have a thinner nose 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.620
 I think it would change but I do not have 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:29.610
 courage to do this 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.900
 Where in the world do you feel the urge? 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.720
 to know 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.470
 I want to know the states 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.069
 United 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:40.520
 rafael is a place where what would do it 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:43.289
 many purchases is the game I really wanted 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.629
 because you never won in london and met 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:47.550
 for us to see snow do not have to do 

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:49.770
 shopping even then I think the book 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.719
 United States still investments and 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.250
