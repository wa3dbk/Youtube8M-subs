00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
years ago I would have thought that it

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.170 
years ago I would have thought that it
was<00:04:00.310> a<00:04:00.520> kind<00:04:00.790> of<00:04:00.940> retro<00:04:01.420> picture<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.290> hats<00:04:02.620> are

there<00:04:11.740> cracks<00:04:12.070> in<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.490> sidewalk<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:13.120> that's

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
there cracks in the sidewalk and that's

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.680 
there cracks in the sidewalk and that's
how<00:04:13.780> would<00:04:13.990> have<00:04:14.080> interpreted<00:04:14.760> but<00:04:15.760> having

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
how would have interpreted but having

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.520 
how would have interpreted but having
had<00:04:17.280> by<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.340> time<00:04:18.609> I<00:04:18.640> took<00:04:18.790> it<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.530> experience

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
had by the time I took it and experience

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.470 
had by the time I took it and experience
living<00:04:21.460> in<00:04:21.940> Jerusalem<00:04:22.660> I<00:04:23.760> understood<00:04:24.760> that

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
living in Jerusalem I understood that

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.310 
living in Jerusalem I understood that
these<00:04:25.840> were<00:04:26.110> particular<00:04:26.710> hats<00:04:27.010> worn<00:04:27.760> by<00:04:28.320> one

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
these were particular hats worn by one

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.840 
these were particular hats worn by one
group<00:04:30.280> of<00:04:30.580> ultra-orthodox<00:04:31.150> women<00:04:31.990> and<00:04:32.850> so

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
group of ultra-orthodox women and so

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.630 
group of ultra-orthodox women and so
what<00:04:34.150> I<00:04:34.180> took<00:04:34.360> from<00:04:34.630> that<00:04:34.870> was<00:04:35.350> that<00:04:35.680> the

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
what I took from that was that the

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.360 
what I took from that was that the
picture<00:04:37.150> had<00:04:37.390> a<00:04:37.420> subtext<00:04:38.290> and<00:04:38.410> a<00:04:38.710> meaning<00:04:39.190> that

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
picture had a subtext and a meaning that

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.320 
picture had a subtext and a meaning that
was<00:04:39.820> not<00:04:40.720> readily<00:04:41.050> apparent<00:04:41.560> I<00:04:42.000> realized<00:04:43.000> that

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
was not readily apparent I realized that

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.870 
was not readily apparent I realized that
a<00:04:43.570> lot<00:04:44.140> of<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.410> pictures<00:04:44.830> if<00:04:45.040> not<00:04:45.340> all<00:04:45.610> of<00:04:45.640> them

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
a lot of the pictures if not all of them

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.500 
a lot of the pictures if not all of them
had<00:04:46.570> a<00:04:47.310> subtext<00:04:48.310> what<00:04:48.730> is<00:04:48.820> the<00:04:48.940> role<00:04:49.150> of<00:04:49.210> the

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
had a subtext what is the role of the

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.390 
had a subtext what is the role of the
