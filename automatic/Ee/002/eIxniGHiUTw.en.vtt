00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.460
 now windows phone 8 is on the market 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:09.900
 interesting to deal with 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.759
 see how it actually now 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.110
 relates to its predecessor you 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.140
 taken a veteran out of the closet 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.100
 the samsung omnia 7 are one of the 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.690
 first windows phones 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.600
 rub it in such 7 point winders 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.730
 five and we who you nokia lumia 920 who 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.800
 on windows from backwards and this review 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.200
 will try to make the big differences 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.840
 between the two platforms just below the 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.359
 duty to bring what is the first thing you notice 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.550
 is of course the homescreen 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.649
 that we we windows phone 8 is it 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.230
 possible to three different languages 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.660
 formats actually are tile 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.059
 hold it down then you can hold it for a moment 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.370
 make larger smaller or medium 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.659
 and with windows phone 7 point 5 those are 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.670
 only two formats 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.960
 that also ensures that the homescreen 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.999
 from windows phone 8 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.920
 so maybe you can see at least a lot 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:57.269
 is more dynamic than he might like 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.679
 windows phone 7 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.449
 there is such a windows phone 7 with the 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.550
 inventors of 7 point 8 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.380
 that will get the same functionality 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.480
 do not come to all devices and which 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.140
 we do not know exactly which spirit we know 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.850
 not yet 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.990
 sir van you have to wait until 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.700
 2013 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.590
 and now that's just a big difference 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.480
 between the two platforms but windows 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.790
 phone 7 is the homescreen in itself 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.890
 just fine it really is a lot 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.060
 static then it is a homescreen 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.770
 windows phone 8 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.420
 and that is a big advantage of 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.860
 windows phone 8 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.720
 well something else is the windows said 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.720
 8 phone runs on a different kernel 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.640
 that is to say that you'd better 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.200
 work and I have with windows phone 8 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.930
 and he knew him every year lumia 800 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.950
 also runs on a qualcomm snapdragon s4 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.050
 plus chip 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.940
 it is a very steep chip and that is possible 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.030
 just not with windows phone 7 what about 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.650
 they do notice the differences 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.180
 in daily use between one 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.290
 good chip and not a good chip 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.650
 with windows phone 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.290
 actually very small on this to yes 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.440
 7 is a chip that comes the 2008 was then 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.770
 very good tip but it is just 4 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.690
 years old and this lumia 900 is now 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.700
 just very good tip and if you are 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.080
 just in daily use 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.649
 then you actually see the differences 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.440
 between the two 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.700
 very fast in terms of speed 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.680
 is that if you have a heavy applications 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.580
 when you start, you will of course notice 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.980
 that there is a difference 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.870
 and then to is so fast a chip with 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.100
 windows phone 8 it really quickly but 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.480
 simply runs device then scrolls 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.200
 windows phone 8 don't recognize that much 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.060
 faster 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.350
 despite the much better hardware that is 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.350
 well done by winters of 7 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.610
 actually you say windows phone 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.069
 8 you can also just benefit with 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.410
 that hardware and windows phone 8s further 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.880
 also a number of new applications and 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.610
 so there is a wallet that you go with 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.120
 NFC can pay can go happen in the 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.310
 future 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.830
 nowadays it's not really there yet 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.569
 stores that support it and nothing 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.720
 otherwise the playing corner 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:51.680
 toys of funny when you love it 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.239
 lockscreen momentarily and swiped right then you can 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.590
 you go to that playing corner and from four you can 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.019
 really only the applications that 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.579
 set to display you can 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.530
 in that play corner 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.760
 and if, for example, you have an idea of ​​a 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.430
 child gives a do not want you to go 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.410
 messing around with all your personal information 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.120
 or take out in a friend then you can 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.590
 you send him to that play corner and then 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.440
 you just have a number of applications 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.060
 and that's it then you can with a passport 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.470
 just manage that he can't go back 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.510
 to the ordinary 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.370
 home screen we have not done you 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.390
 can also choose but that is nice 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.459
 addition 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.780
 and if your phone briefly explains it is possible 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.359
 just be nice to know that 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.120
 someone not at all you give I can there 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:31.190
 is therefore not possible with windows of 7 and something 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.019
 otherwise all applications are of course the 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.340
 applications of minders of 7 that can 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.410
 all windows phone 8 are running 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.970
 why is that not the case and all 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.260
 applications that will now be developed 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.370
 will be for windows phone 8 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.660
 be developed 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.280
 that is, windows phone 8 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.510
 just the full restore on the 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.609
 that may be a few at the moment 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.780
 thousands of tens of thousands of applications 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.060
 but that would insure the difference 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.069
 grow and that's why windows phone 8 is with 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.690
 you much better than the old version 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.390
 that of course makes sense that that 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.730
 old version gets a little outdated 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.170
 but ultimately the differences 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.750
 just not quite between the two platform 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.550
 big so there are some extras 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.720
 added to windows phone 8 it extra 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.070
 applications 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.630
 the functionality here and there is one 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.730
 a bit extensive but then you notice 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.250
 actually very few of my windows 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.720
 phone 8 really matters is the kernel that 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.280
 is therefore updated also ensures that 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.690
 applications easier from windows 8 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.250
 can be ported 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.390
 And yes it mainly just takes care of that 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.520
 the better hardware to be a stone 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.750
 become for example 720 p screens 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.300
 that is a very big difference 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.150
 of course but that is mainly in him 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.590
 the hardware and those faster processors 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.600
 but even in everyday use 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.370
 you don't have that much there 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.930
 yes actually benefits only with 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.030
 you really have heavier applications there 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.680
 he wanted to be one of 18 again 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.720
 improvement but we still had it 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.520
 rather a bit bigger because yes 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.380
 actually the sea seemed like operating systems 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.480
 now just very much alike 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.310
 and well windows phone 8 is better though 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.570
 the progress is not huge 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.170
 windows phone come to come with 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.850
 android ios but definitely not demolish yet 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.830
 for those two platforms 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.960
 so we prefer that a little bigger 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.220
 seen but is again tonight 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.220
 just a great platform
