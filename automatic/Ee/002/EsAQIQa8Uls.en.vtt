00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.220 
review we are looking at the Marvel

Legends Captain America series platinum

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.650 
Legends Captain America series platinum
series<00:00:21.500> infinite<00:00:21.920> series<00:00:22.279> I<00:00:22.939> don't<00:00:23.600> know

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
series infinite series I don't know

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.910 
series infinite series I don't know
which<00:00:23.840> one<00:00:24.020> it<00:00:24.110> is<00:00:24.140> anymore

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
which one it is anymore

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.650 
which one it is anymore
it<00:00:25.160> said<00:00:25.340> platinum<00:00:25.730> series<00:00:25.970> on<00:00:26.060> the<00:00:26.150> box<00:00:26.390> so<00:00:26.630> I

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
it said platinum series on the box so I

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.880 
it said platinum series on the box so I
guess<00:00:26.930> that's<00:00:27.110> what<00:00:27.260> it<00:00:27.350> is<00:00:27.470> even<00:00:27.770> though<00:00:27.860> I

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
guess that's what it is even though I

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.040 
guess that's what it is even though I
thought<00:00:28.130> it<00:00:28.310> was<00:00:28.400> infinite<00:00:28.789> prior<00:00:29.300> to<00:00:29.630> seeing

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
thought it was infinite prior to seeing

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.979 
thought it was infinite prior to seeing
that<00:00:30.200> box<00:00:30.470> but<00:00:30.800> whatever<00:00:31.789> it's<00:00:32.180> the<00:00:32.629> Captain

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
that box but whatever it's the Captain

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.140 
that box but whatever it's the Captain
America<00:00:33.080> Marvel<00:00:33.739> Legends<00:00:34.070> mandroid<00:00:34.640> build<00:00:35.030> a

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
America Marvel Legends mandroid build a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.229 
America Marvel Legends mandroid build a
figure<00:00:35.330> which<00:00:36.110> I<00:00:36.320> thought<00:00:36.559> initially<00:00:37.239> was

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
figure which I thought initially was

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.170 
figure which I thought initially was
going<00:00:38.330> to<00:00:38.780> be<00:00:39.110> just<00:00:40.010> a<00:00:40.129> repaint<00:00:40.640> for<00:00:40.910> the<00:00:41.000> most

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
going to be just a repaint for the most

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.630 
going to be just a repaint for the most
part<00:00:41.480> of<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:42.260> Iron<00:00:42.500> Monger<00:00:42.800> but<00:00:43.310> it<00:00:43.520> only

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
part of the Iron Monger but it only

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.460 
part of the Iron Monger but it only
shares<00:00:44.060> some<00:00:44.420> parts<00:00:44.780> with<00:00:44.930> it<00:00:45.079> actually<00:00:45.410> it

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
shares some parts with it actually it

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.680 
shares some parts with it actually it
has<00:00:45.620> quite<00:00:45.890> a<00:00:45.920> few<00:00:46.160> new<00:00:46.399> parts<00:00:46.820> so<00:00:47.360> that's<00:00:47.540> a

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
has quite a few new parts so that's a

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.690 
has quite a few new parts so that's a
very<00:00:48.050> nice<00:00:48.380> thing<00:00:48.440> I'm<00:00:49.070> very<00:00:49.280> happy<00:00:49.610> about

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
very nice thing I'm very happy about

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.110 
very nice thing I'm very happy about
that

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
that

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.150 
that
that<00:00:50.989> being<00:00:51.140> said<00:00:51.410> there<00:00:51.620> are<00:00:51.649> definitely<00:00:52.070> a

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
that being said there are definitely a

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.310 
that being said there are definitely a
few<00:00:52.220> complaints<00:00:52.790> I<00:00:52.880> have<00:00:53.059> but<00:00:53.450> overall<00:00:53.899> I<00:00:54.050> do

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
few complaints I have but overall I do

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.110 
few complaints I have but overall I do
like<00:00:54.470> this<00:00:54.829> figure<00:00:55.040> I<00:00:55.190> think<00:00:55.579> it's<00:00:55.730> a<00:00:55.910> nice

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
like this figure I think it's a nice

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.060 
like this figure I think it's a nice
addition<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.750> collection<00:00:57.070> especially

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
addition to the collection especially

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.860 
addition to the collection especially
since<00:00:58.280> it's<00:00:58.430> a<00:00:58.520> BAFF<00:00:58.730> it's<00:00:59.030> got<00:00:59.180> some<00:00:59.360> size<00:00:59.570> to

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
since it's a BAFF it's got some size to

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.530 
since it's a BAFF it's got some size to
it<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:00.230> I'm<00:01:00.350> okay<00:01:00.620> with<00:01:00.649> that<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:02.120> it<00:01:02.270> just<00:01:02.420> has

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
it so I'm okay with that and it just has

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.180 
it so I'm okay with that and it just has
some<00:01:02.719> nice<00:01:02.870> shelf<00:01:03.230> presence<00:01:03.770> even<00:01:04.070> though

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
some nice shelf presence even though

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.520 
some nice shelf presence even though
it's<00:01:04.790> quite<00:01:05.000> lacking<00:01:05.509> in<00:01:05.630> a<00:01:05.690> few<00:01:05.899> areas<00:01:06.080> let's

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
it's quite lacking in a few areas let's

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.310 
it's quite lacking in a few areas let's
look<00:01:06.680> at<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:06.920> height<00:01:07.100> first<00:01:07.430> it<00:01:08.300> stands<00:01:08.840> about

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
look at the height first it stands about

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.469 
look at the height first it stands about
7<00:01:09.680> and<00:01:09.830> 3/4<00:01:10.369> inches<00:01:10.399> tall<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:10.850> it's<00:01:11.119> certainly

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
7 and 3/4 inches tall so it's certainly

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.749 
7 and 3/4 inches tall so it's certainly
not<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:11.720> tallest<00:01:12.200> build<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.649> figure<00:01:12.830> ever<00:01:13.130> but

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
not the tallest build a figure ever but

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.160 
not the tallest build a figure ever but
like<00:01:13.970> I<00:01:14.060> said<00:01:14.119> he<00:01:14.360> has<00:01:14.450> some<00:01:14.630> weight<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:14.840> him

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
like I said he has some weight to him

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.899 
like I said he has some weight to him
even<00:01:15.409> though<00:01:15.440> it's<00:01:16.100> a<00:01:16.130> little<00:01:16.369> Hollow<00:01:16.580> in<00:01:16.820> the

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
even though it's a little Hollow in the

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.670 
even though it's a little Hollow in the
chest<00:01:17.180> area<00:01:17.360> but<00:01:17.690> that's<00:01:17.840> okay<00:01:18.170> he<00:01:18.409> still

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
chest area but that's okay he still

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.580 
chest area but that's okay he still
probably<00:01:18.860> weighs<00:01:19.310> about<00:01:19.340> 3/4<00:01:20.330> of<00:01:20.360> a<00:01:20.540> pound<00:01:20.590> and

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
probably weighs about 3/4 of a pound and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.550 
probably weighs about 3/4 of a pound and
he<00:01:21.860> just<00:01:22.010> like<00:01:22.250> I<00:01:22.369> said<00:01:22.520> he<00:01:22.580> looks<00:01:22.729> pretty<00:01:22.970> cool

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
he just like I said he looks pretty cool

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.039 
he just like I said he looks pretty cool
definitely<00:01:24.560> could<00:01:25.070> use<00:01:25.100> a<00:01:25.250> black<00:01:25.549> wash<00:01:25.820> on<00:01:26.240> on

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
definitely could use a black wash on on

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.550 
definitely could use a black wash on on
the<00:01:27.590> on<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.640> whole<00:01:28.760> body<00:01:28.939> and<00:01:29.360> just<00:01:30.350> to<00:01:30.409> give

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
the on the whole body and just to give

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.960 
the on the whole body and just to give
it<00:01:30.650> some<00:01:30.799> detail<00:01:31.159> and<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.400> little<00:01:31.580> bit<00:01:31.670> of<00:01:31.760> paint

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
it some detail and a little bit of paint

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.399 
it some detail and a little bit of paint
detail<00:01:32.330> throughout<00:01:32.630> would<00:01:32.900> have<00:01:32.990> been<00:01:33.140> nice

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
detail throughout would have been nice

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.710 
detail throughout would have been nice
like<00:01:33.740> for<00:01:33.979> this<00:01:34.100> part<00:01:34.430> here<00:01:34.880> or<00:01:35.030> any<00:01:35.450> of<00:01:35.630> these

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
like for this part here or any of these

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.320 
like for this part here or any of these
little<00:01:36.080> pieces<00:01:36.320> that<00:01:36.770> are<00:01:37.640> just<00:01:37.670> plain<00:01:38.119> old

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
little pieces that are just plain old

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.570 
little pieces that are just plain old
solid<00:01:38.780> gray<00:01:38.960> plastic<00:01:39.229> it's<00:01:40.220> a<00:01:40.340> little

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
solid gray plastic it's a little

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.910 
solid gray plastic it's a little
disappointing<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.570> shield<00:01:41.869> logo<00:01:42.140> is<00:01:42.530> painted

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
disappointing the shield logo is painted

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.890 
disappointing the shield logo is painted
really<00:01:43.220> well<00:01:43.400> and<00:01:43.759> we<00:01:44.030> do<00:01:44.210> see<00:01:44.420> some<00:01:44.659> yellow

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
really well and we do see some yellow

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.760 
really well and we do see some yellow
throughout<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:45.830> a<00:01:45.920> few<00:01:46.220> bits<00:01:46.430> of<00:01:46.549> silver<00:01:46.790> but

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
throughout and a few bits of silver but

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.950 
throughout and a few bits of silver but
it's<00:01:48.770> just<00:01:48.950> really<00:01:49.159> not<00:01:49.430> enough<00:01:49.790> to<00:01:50.600> make<00:01:50.810> him

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
it's just really not enough to make him

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.219 
it's just really not enough to make him
look<00:01:51.170> good<00:01:51.619> it<00:01:52.280> looks<00:01:52.580> okay<00:01:53.210> good<00:01:53.509> enough<00:01:53.540> but

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
look good it looks okay good enough but

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.980 
look good it looks okay good enough but
not<00:01:54.380> good<00:01:54.939> so<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.030> head<00:01:56.180> is<00:01:56.299> technically<00:01:56.750> on<00:01:56.960> a

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
not good so the head is technically on a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.440 
not good so the head is technically on a
ball<00:01:57.290> peg<00:01:57.590> but<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.670> can't<00:01:58.909> really<00:01:59.030> do<00:01:59.299> much

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
ball peg but you can't really do much

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.390 
ball peg but you can't really do much
with<00:01:59.509> it<00:01:59.720> at<00:01:59.990> least<00:02:00.140> not<00:02:00.380> with<00:02:00.979> mine<00:02:01.189> it's

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
with it at least not with mine it's

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.160 
with it at least not with mine it's
really<00:02:01.759> stiff<00:02:02.119> and<00:02:02.390> since<00:02:02.659> it's<00:02:02.810> in<00:02:02.930> there<00:02:03.140> I

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
really stiff and since it's in there I

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.289 
really stiff and since it's in there I
can't<00:02:03.470> grab<00:02:03.680> it<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:04.009> do<00:02:04.130> anything<00:02:04.369> so<00:02:05.240> I'm

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
can't grab it to do anything so I'm

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.990 
can't grab it to do anything so I'm
lucky<00:02:05.479> I<00:02:05.630> put<00:02:05.930> it<00:02:06.020> on<00:02:06.110> pretty<00:02:06.530> much<00:02:06.650> square<00:02:07.250> but

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
lucky I put it on pretty much square but

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.630 
lucky I put it on pretty much square but
putting<00:02:08.179> it<00:02:08.360> on<00:02:08.509> even<00:02:08.989> was<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.860> pain<00:02:10.489> in<00:02:10.519> the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
putting it on even was a pain in the

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.069 
putting it on even was a pain in the
butt<00:02:10.880> for<00:02:10.910> me<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.239> don't<00:02:11.420> know<00:02:11.480> if<00:02:11.570> you<00:02:11.660> guys<00:02:11.780> had

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
butt for me I don't know if you guys had

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.810 
butt for me I don't know if you guys had
trouble<00:02:12.410> with<00:02:12.470> yours<00:02:12.709> but<00:02:12.980> mine<00:02:13.220> was<00:02:13.400> really

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
trouble with yours but mine was really

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.819 
trouble with yours but mine was really
difficult<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.299> get<00:02:14.420> on<00:02:14.600> in<00:02:14.780> there<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.650> now<00:02:15.799> I

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:15.829 
difficult to get on in there and now I

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.160 
difficult to get on in there and now I
can't<00:02:16.130> really<00:02:16.250> move<00:02:16.519> it<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:16.940> be<00:02:17.780> aware<00:02:17.870> of<00:02:18.049> that

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
can't really move it so be aware of that

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.349 
can't really move it so be aware of that
this<00:02:18.799> is<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.010> separate<00:02:19.459> piece<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:20.090> if<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.239> want

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359 
this is a separate piece so if you want

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.420 
this is a separate piece so if you want
to<00:02:20.450> take<00:02:20.540> that<00:02:20.660> off<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.930> can<00:02:21.040> it's<00:02:22.040> really

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
to take that off you can it's really

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.280 
to take that off you can it's really
cheaply<00:02:22.760> made<00:02:23.090> everything<00:02:23.810> else<00:02:23.870> on<00:02:24.049> this<00:02:24.139> guy

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
cheaply made everything else on this guy

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.940 
cheaply made everything else on this guy
is<00:02:24.350> pretty

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
is pretty

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.550 
is pretty
but<00:02:25.340> this<00:02:25.520> is<00:02:25.700> super<00:02:26.060> hollow<00:02:26.720> dollar<00:02:27.170> store

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
but this is super hollow dollar store

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.510 
but this is super hollow dollar store
style<00:02:27.920> cheap

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
style cheap

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.600 
style cheap
so<00:02:29.150> even<00:02:29.510> when<00:02:29.720> sit<00:02:29.900> when<00:02:30.110> it's<00:02:30.260> on<00:02:30.489> you<00:02:31.489> know

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
so even when sit when it's on you know

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.220 
so even when sit when it's on you know
you<00:02:31.700> can<00:02:31.910> still<00:02:32.090> see<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.450> big<00:02:32.660> gaps<00:02:32.930> in<00:02:33.110> the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
you can still see the big gaps in the

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.380 
you can still see the big gaps in the
plastic<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:33.890> that's<00:02:34.069> pretty<00:02:34.430> crappy<00:02:34.910> I<00:02:35.060> don't

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
plastic so that's pretty crappy I don't

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.420 
plastic so that's pretty crappy I don't
care<00:02:35.750> for<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:36.019> too<00:02:36.200> much<00:02:36.230> they<00:02:36.890> did<00:02:37.069> paint<00:02:37.310> a

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
care for that too much they did paint a

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.089 
care for that too much they did paint a
yellow<00:02:37.640> on<00:02:37.849> there<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.330> helps<00:02:38.950> but<00:02:39.950> it's

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
yellow on there so that helps but it's

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.759 
yellow on there so that helps but it's
not<00:02:40.250> made<00:02:40.459> very<00:02:40.489> well<00:02:40.790> at<00:02:41.060> all

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
not made very well at all

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.960 
not made very well at all
shoulders<00:02:42.769> are<00:02:42.800> basically<00:02:43.370> standard<00:02:43.760> ball

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
shoulders are basically standard ball

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.509 
shoulders are basically standard ball
hinge<00:02:44.239> shoulders<00:02:44.720> put<00:02:45.620> them<00:02:45.739> out<00:02:45.860> completely

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
hinge shoulders put them out completely

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.370 
hinge shoulders put them out completely
straight<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.390> side<00:02:47.569> no<00:02:47.810> higher<00:02:48.019> than<00:02:48.050> that

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
straight to the side no higher than that

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.160 
straight to the side no higher than that
it<00:02:48.620> does<00:02:48.739> have<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.120> stop<00:02:50.120> basically<00:02:51.019> right

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
it does have a stop basically right

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.130 
it does have a stop basically right
there<00:02:51.489> ratcheting<00:02:52.489> swivel<00:02:52.940> there<00:02:53.750> is<00:02:53.959> no

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
there ratcheting swivel there is no

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.979 
there ratcheting swivel there is no
bicep<00:02:54.410> swivel<00:02:55.129> we<00:02:55.790> do<00:02:55.970> have<00:02:56.150> an<00:02:56.330> elbow<00:02:56.720> hinge

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
bicep swivel we do have an elbow hinge

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.259 
bicep swivel we do have an elbow hinge
but<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.260> only<00:02:57.380> get<00:02:57.620> about<00:02:57.950> 40<00:02:58.730> degrees<00:02:59.060> out<00:02:59.239> of

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
but you only get about 40 degrees out of

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.990 
but you only get about 40 degrees out of
it<00:02:59.480> maybe<00:02:59.690> maybe<00:03:00.200> 45<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.610> does<00:03:01.760> have<00:03:01.970> a

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
it maybe maybe 45 and it does have a

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.300 
it maybe maybe 45 and it does have a
swivel<00:03:02.360> but<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:02.900> can't<00:03:03.079> do<00:03:03.260> much<00:03:03.470> with<00:03:03.739> it<00:03:03.769> so

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
swivel but you can't do much with it so

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.729 
swivel but you can't do much with it so
just<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.090> little<00:03:05.360> bit<00:03:05.510> probably<00:03:05.750> just<00:03:06.349> enough

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
just a little bit probably just enough

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.160 
just a little bit probably just enough
to<00:03:07.069> get<00:03:07.250> this<00:03:07.459> turn<00:03:08.000> enough<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.660> this<00:03:08.810> turned

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
to get this turn enough and this turned

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.190 
to get this turn enough and this turned
enough<00:03:09.489> but<00:03:10.489> it's<00:03:10.670> still<00:03:10.910> fairly<00:03:11.360> limited<00:03:11.780> the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
enough but it's still fairly limited the

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.990 
enough but it's still fairly limited the
arms<00:03:12.500> don't<00:03:12.769> have<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.099> greatest<00:03:13.640> range<00:03:13.849> of

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
arms don't have the greatest range of

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.750 
arms don't have the greatest range of
motion<00:03:15.069> especially<00:03:16.069> when<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.280> comes<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.549> the

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
motion especially when it comes to the

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.100 
motion especially when it comes to the
hinge<00:03:17.030> so<00:03:17.510> it's<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.720> little<00:03:17.840> disappointing

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
hinge so it's a little disappointing

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.650 
hinge so it's a little disappointing
that<00:03:18.739> they<00:03:18.950> couldn't<00:03:19.220> have<00:03:19.430> worked<00:03:19.760> away<00:03:20.000> to

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
that they couldn't have worked away to

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.830 
that they couldn't have worked away to
make<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:20.989> a<00:03:21.019> little<00:03:21.260> bit<00:03:21.500> better<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:23.630> ab

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
make that a little bit better the ab

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.289 
make that a little bit better the ab
crunch<00:03:23.870> or<00:03:24.500> torso<00:03:24.799> or<00:03:25.250> diaphragm<00:03:25.640> joint<00:03:26.120> which

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
crunch or torso or diaphragm joint which

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.569 
crunch or torso or diaphragm joint which
i<00:03:26.390> guess<00:03:26.569> it<00:03:26.720> really<00:03:26.840> is<00:03:26.989> feels<00:03:27.980> like<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.190> single

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
i guess it really is feels like a single

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.640 
i guess it really is feels like a single
ball<00:03:28.910> peg<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:29.359> could<00:03:29.540> be<00:03:29.690> double<00:03:30.079> it<00:03:30.290> might<00:03:30.530> be

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
ball peg it could be double it might be

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.650 
ball peg it could be double it might be
double<00:03:31.010> I'm<00:03:31.160> not<00:03:31.340> sure<00:03:31.549> it<00:03:31.730> came<00:03:31.940> as<00:03:32.090> one<00:03:32.269> solid

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
double I'm not sure it came as one solid

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.449 
double I'm not sure it came as one solid
piece<00:03:32.690> so<00:03:33.019> I<00:03:33.049> didn't<00:03:33.440> pull<00:03:33.769> it<00:03:33.799> apart<00:03:33.920> to<00:03:34.220> check

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
piece so I didn't pull it apart to check

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.250 
piece so I didn't pull it apart to check
but<00:03:34.940> it<00:03:35.000> actually<00:03:35.120> has<00:03:35.420> pretty<00:03:35.690> good<00:03:35.780> range<00:03:35.930> of

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
but it actually has pretty good range of

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.370 
but it actually has pretty good range of
motion<00:03:36.440> side<00:03:37.160> to<00:03:37.340> side<00:03:37.549> front<00:03:37.910> to<00:03:38.060> back

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
motion side to side front to back

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.410 
motion side to side front to back
rotation<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:39.560> that's<00:03:39.739> pretty<00:03:39.980> nice<00:03:40.299> do<00:03:41.299> the

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
rotation so that's pretty nice do the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.849 
rotation so that's pretty nice do the
wrists<00:03:41.750> move<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:42.170> didn't<00:03:42.380> even<00:03:42.500> look<00:03:42.620> at<00:03:42.709> the

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
wrists move I didn't even look at the

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.509 
wrists move I didn't even look at the
wrists<00:03:43.160> yet<00:03:43.370> I<00:03:43.579> don't<00:03:43.880> know<00:03:45.069> yeah<00:03:46.069> they<00:03:46.220> do<00:03:46.340> the

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
wrists yet I don't know yeah they do the

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.160 
wrists yet I don't know yeah they do the
wrists<00:03:46.819> still<00:03:47.239> swivel<00:03:47.660> so<00:03:47.810> that's<00:03:47.989> pretty

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
wrists still swivel so that's pretty

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.240 
wrists still swivel so that's pretty
cool<00:03:50.079> it's<00:03:51.079> kind<00:03:51.380> of<00:03:51.440> tough<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.739> get<00:03:51.889> in<00:03:52.040> there

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
cool it's kind of tough to get in there

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.460 
cool it's kind of tough to get in there
this<00:03:52.819> one's<00:03:53.030> not<00:03:53.180> wanting<00:03:53.569> to<00:03:53.600> go<00:03:53.870> maybe<00:03:54.230> it

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
this one's not wanting to go maybe it

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.370 
this one's not wanting to go maybe it
doesn't<00:03:54.859> and<00:03:55.040> this<00:03:55.130> one<00:03:55.310> does<00:03:55.549> and<00:03:56.170> it<00:03:57.170> should

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
doesn't and this one does and it should

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.970 
doesn't and this one does and it should
they<00:03:57.560> should<00:03:57.620> both<00:03:57.920> I<00:03:58.310> don't<00:03:59.120> know<00:03:59.799> that<00:04:00.799> one's

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
they should both I don't know that one's

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.129 
they should both I don't know that one's
not<00:04:01.130> moving<00:04:01.519> so<00:04:02.269> maybe<00:04:02.569> they<00:04:02.720> do<00:04:02.780> maybe<00:04:03.019> they

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
not moving so maybe they do maybe they

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:03.520 
not moving so maybe they do maybe they
don't

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
don't

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.349 
don't
this<00:04:03.829> one<00:04:04.010> certainly<00:04:04.220> did<00:04:04.609> though<00:04:04.819> unless<00:04:05.209> I'm

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
this one certainly did though unless I'm

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.259 
this one certainly did though unless I'm
losing<00:04:05.630> my<00:04:05.750> mind<00:04:06.040> no<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.220> does<00:04:07.430> so<00:04:08.000> I<00:04:08.030> don't

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
losing my mind no it does so I don't

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.120 
losing my mind no it does so I don't
know<00:04:08.329> what<00:04:08.569> the<00:04:08.720> deal<00:04:08.870> is<00:04:08.930> with<00:04:09.079> that<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.920> hips

that's
actually<00:04:38.180> pretty<00:04:38.450> nice<00:04:38.630> I<00:04:38.900> don't<00:04:38.960> know<00:04:39.140> if<00:04:39.230> you

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
actually pretty nice I don't know if you

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
would probably do that pose but you can

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
would probably do that pose but you can
if<00:04:42.740> you<00:04:42.860> want<00:04:43.040> to<00:04:43.510> for<00:04:44.510> being<00:04:44.720> as<00:04:45.280> static<00:04:46.280> as<00:04:46.460> it

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
if you want to for being as static as it

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.760 
if you want to for being as static as it
is<00:04:46.730> as<00:04:47.030> limited<00:04:47.420> as<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:47.720> is<00:04:47.870> you<00:04:48.410> can<00:04:48.560> get<00:04:48.680> him

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
is as limited as it is you can get him

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.710 
is as limited as it is you can get him
some<00:04:48.920> pretty<00:04:49.070> nice<00:04:49.280> poses<00:04:49.760> fairly<00:04:50.120> easily<00:04:50.330> so

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
some pretty nice poses fairly easily so

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.960 
some pretty nice poses fairly easily so
I<00:04:50.750> do<00:04:50.900> appreciate<00:04:51.200> that<00:04:51.560> so<00:04:52.400> like<00:04:52.550> I<00:04:52.640> said<00:04:52.820> it's

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
I do appreciate that so like I said it's

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.700 
I do appreciate that so like I said it's
not<00:04:53.090> like<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.570> best<00:04:53.900> builder<00:04:54.230> figure<00:04:54.500> ever

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
not like the best builder figure ever

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.880 
not like the best builder figure ever
and<00:04:55.190> it<00:04:55.610> certainly<00:04:55.910> has<00:04:56.120> some<00:04:56.300> flaws<00:04:56.570> but<00:04:56.990> it's

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
and it certainly has some flaws but it's

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.620 
and it certainly has some flaws but it's
still<00:04:58.100> pretty<00:04:58.280> good<00:04:58.580> and<00:04:58.910> I<00:04:59.000> still<00:04:59.240> like<00:04:59.450> it

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
still pretty good and I still like it

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.820 
still pretty good and I still like it
and<00:04:59.780> I'm<00:04:59.840> still<00:04:59.960> probably<00:05:00.170> gonna<00:05:00.380> build<00:05:00.620> two

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
and I'm still probably gonna build two

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.320 
and I'm still probably gonna build two
of<00:05:00.980> them<00:05:01.130> I<00:05:01.310> don't<00:05:01.490> know<00:05:01.610> why<00:05:01.790> I<00:05:01.820> want<00:05:02.120> to<00:05:02.150> build

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
of them I don't know why I want to build

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.540 
of them I don't know why I want to build
two<00:05:02.540> but<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:02.750> do<00:05:02.890> I'm<00:05:03.890> pretty<00:05:04.100> sure<00:05:04.250> they<00:05:04.370> come

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
two but I do I'm pretty sure they come

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.390 
two but I do I'm pretty sure they come
in<00:05:04.670> threes<00:05:04.970> I<00:05:05.260> haven't<00:05:06.260> seen<00:05:06.410> much<00:05:06.620> in<00:05:06.890> the<00:05:07.250> way

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
in threes I haven't seen much in the way

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.790 
in threes I haven't seen much in the way
of<00:05:07.760> comics<00:05:08.510> about<00:05:08.960> these<00:05:09.140> guys<00:05:09.350> since<00:05:09.620> I<00:05:09.740> don't
