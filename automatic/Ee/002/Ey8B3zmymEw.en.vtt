00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.450
 hello and welcome to my new tutorial 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.580
 as long as I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.360
 to actually trap an entry 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.889
 alain pelletier 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.639
 it will be done I live its explosives when we scrutinize tutorial tutorials 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.639
 to teach you how to recruit 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.340
 they first did hoist to hear explosives finally physical wire a 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.489
 explosive 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.640
 so you unstick romance everything is in an explosion 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.020
 purepeople ticked every year to help under do that + more or 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.949
 less damage 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.720
 I feel good so after you have in the water always in the kingdom 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.310
 laughter detection later in force 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.580
 owning photos and coaching you photos 0 show brive 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.920
 that he was there to disappear I was then on tour 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.100
 we see our contracts in bar 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.910
 can we be made more urgent 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.030
 gamba 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.720
 about that which more is detected 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.990
 finally not to act without passing under 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.250
 and upstairs so we can not stubborn 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.710
 the peoples I pass like in the legs 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.330
 after you go to this weir group 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.840
 flexibility control and comparison 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.100
 so this will be the esm in this school 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100
 so the meaning advocated 2 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.410
 expected choose in the country is that the peak 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.740
 take out tunis 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.620
 but next 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.080
 then 6 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.680
 you go in 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.350
 for sandrine 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.430
 constant of lyon 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.650
 so it's in wired a head whore 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.710
 take a value submit the distance 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.060
 so there its 127 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.060
 you have to see it so I'm waiting for you now 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.270
 and after reading all that we can feed all the chosen men this is the 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.690
 voyeur 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.690
 so the park the distance 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.490
 what are the guides to 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.630
 didier cuche 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.230
 we harvest is smaller 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.290
 gentlemen 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.800
 127 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.880
 so you see then that 127 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.100
 after 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.830
 the haut-rhin and nor does it serve as a foul ilic one of two torrents 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.739
 hard that detect by a little bitterness 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.279
 you take the aaa you put on three years 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.489
 to put away and the country is on a way to put away 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.629
 after detonating 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.129
 it must be solved 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.590
 on a flow of water of course I mean the cannon of detonating that are 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.809
 cans to help the organic guitar 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.449
 and now 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:29.199
 I spent like that would be good 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:31.209
 when I'm not walking 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.209
 things have an end 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:39.419
 janka did the trick because if our minister m 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.239
 the only problem is the job 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.509
 so I take sometimes it's beyond 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.539
 but hey it's not there 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:51.909
 its symbolic 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.319
 so now we're going to have to go to have to turn it on or off 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.869
 so you go in is not worthy that the enter a key you want 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.869
 I commit you all want 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:05.219
 fauzy is evaluating punk in Wolof 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.229
 so the mythical course here 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:09.089
 his only offer 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:10.109
 after 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.539
 you chose it's an indicator 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:16.069
 so on the value you put up the colors actually wanted 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.369
 the extra 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:19.189
 project 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:20.040
 that's it 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.309
 to develop 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:22.160
 right here 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
 randy who is so proud active jacky foods 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:27.449
 after 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.699
 choose a tick bite 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.019
 Africa counts 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.519
 so the newsletter 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.299
 so here it is a little near five which four days in bed she held 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.889
 gates 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.139
 thanks to what 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.459
 so you can not it 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.069
 the and not bind it all together 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.629
 ebay 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.099
 he is not a whore 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.229
 after you relay for your indicator 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.209
 coulibaly 7 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.270
 and the detail is from the can 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.759
 we want to help him 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:59.159
 and you their politics 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.159
 anais and the tourist 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:07.889
 so it only serves if she's not activating more meggitt or exposing herself 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.299
 but I'm going there 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.659
 this winter and at all 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.449
 in the heart 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.999
 you can see the light that alert 

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:20.599
 after as soon as I passed 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:23.599
 sam petonnet 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:26.650
 so it's a pretty simple trap 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.650
 that works pretty well 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.779
 so I want to do a second tutorial to explain to you 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:38.370
 how will it be a little more complicated 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.469
 Africa our other thing that an explosion
