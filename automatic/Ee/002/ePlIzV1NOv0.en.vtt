00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
you've gone ahead and put all your beads

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.149 
you've gone ahead and put all your beads
on<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.530> memory<00:02:59.680> wire<00:02:59.950> I<00:03:01.470> now<00:03:02.470> it's<00:03:02.709> time<00:03:02.950> to

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
on the memory wire I now it's time to

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:08.819 
on the memory wire I now it's time to
close<00:03:03.340> it<00:03:03.519> off<00:03:05.849> you<00:03:06.849> go<00:03:07.000> ahead<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.329> you<00:03:07.829> again

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
close it off you go ahead and you again

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:17.970 
close it off you go ahead and you again
take<00:03:09.159> your<00:03:09.870> pliers<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:16.139> get<00:03:17.139> it<00:03:17.230> from<00:03:17.440> Griffin

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
take your pliers and get it from Griffin

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.400 
take your pliers and get it from Griffin
yeah<00:03:18.849> sometimes<00:03:19.419> it<00:03:19.569> bounces<00:03:19.930> around<00:03:20.049> when

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
yeah sometimes it bounces around when

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.379 
yeah sometimes it bounces around when
you're<00:03:20.500> doing<00:03:20.709> this<00:03:20.829> because<00:03:21.030> this<00:03:22.030> memory

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
you're doing this because this memory

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.280 
you're doing this because this memory
wire<00:03:22.569> is<00:03:22.780> actually<00:03:23.109> fairly<00:03:23.290> stiff<00:03:25.019> again<00:03:26.019> it

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
wire is actually fairly stiff again it

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.390 
wire is actually fairly stiff again it
doesn't<00:03:26.470> matter<00:03:28.169> go<00:03:29.169> ahead<00:03:29.349> like<00:03:29.530> this<00:03:29.769> make

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
doesn't matter go ahead like this make

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.909 
doesn't matter go ahead like this make
sure<00:03:30.430> it's<00:03:30.819> closed<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:32.370> then<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.519> grab<00:03:33.790> your

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
sure it's closed and then you grab your

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.039 
sure it's closed and then you grab your
memory<00:03:35.919> wire<00:03:36.129> cutters<00:03:36.579> and<00:03:36.879> we<00:03:37.599> score<00:03:37.959> off

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
memory wire cutters and we score off

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.680 
memory wire cutters and we score off
them<00:03:38.079> the<00:03:38.379> XS<00:03:38.799> SS<00:03:40.139> finish<00:03:41.139> playing<00:03:41.470> with<00:03:41.709> it<00:03:42.690> to

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
them the XS SS finish playing with it to

00:03:43.690 --> 00:04:17.900 
them the XS SS finish playing with it to
exactly<00:03:44.019> where<00:03:44.379> you<00:03:44.470> want<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.739> play<00:03:44.889> with<00:03:45.069> it

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.080 

and<00:04:18.600> if<00:04:18.750> you<00:04:18.840> close<00:04:19.080> it<00:04:19.110> off<00:04:19.370> now<00:04:20.370> you<00:04:20.430> can<00:04:20.790> get

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
and if you close it off now you can get

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.290 
and if you close it off now you can get
beat<00:04:21.570> kept<00:04:21.930> from<00:04:22.800> beetle<00:04:23.160> on<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.850> you'll<00:04:24.120> have

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
beat kept from beetle on and you'll have

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.900 
beat kept from beetle on and you'll have
much<00:04:24.540> easier<00:04:24.840> time<00:04:25.080> with<00:04:25.110> those<00:04:25.550> but<00:04:26.550> this<00:04:26.760> is

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
much easier time with those but this is

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.230 
much easier time with those but this is
the<00:04:27.090> easiest<00:04:27.660> way<00:04:27.900> for<00:04:27.930> beginners<00:04:29.030> who<00:04:30.030> don't

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
the easiest way for beginners who don't

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.670 
the easiest way for beginners who don't
want<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.420> spend<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:30.720> whole<00:04:30.810> lot<00:04:31.140> of<00:04:31.260> money<00:04:31.500> and

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
want to spend a whole lot of money and

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.800 
want to spend a whole lot of money and
don't<00:04:32.370> really<00:04:32.520> want<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:32.940> do<00:04:33.030> much<00:04:33.180> just<00:04:33.240> keep

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
don't really want to do much just keep

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:47.620 
don't really want to do much just keep
on<00:04:33.930> playing<00:04:34.200> with<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.440> until<00:04:34.530> it<00:04:34.740> works

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.490 

and<00:04:47.720> that's<00:04:48.440> all<00:04:48.590> it<00:04:48.620> need<00:04:49.460> to<00:04:49.700> make<00:04:50.500> memory

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
and that's all it need to make memory

00:04:51.500 --> 00:05:03.670 
and that's all it need to make memory
wire<00:04:51.650> bracelet

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.740
