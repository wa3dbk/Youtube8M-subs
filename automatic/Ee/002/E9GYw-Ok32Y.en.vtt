board-certified dermatologist and today
we're<00:00:09.510> talking<00:00:09.660> about<00:00:10.020> how<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.290> get<00:00:10.620> rid<00:00:10.800> of

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
we're talking about how to get rid of

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.690 
we're talking about how to get rid of
mottled<00:00:11.370> skin

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
mottled skin

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.200 
mottled skin
what<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.750> mottled<00:00:13.110> skin<00:00:13.250> model<00:00:14.250> skin<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.730> skin

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
what is mottled skin model skin is skin

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.900 
what is mottled skin model skin is skin
that<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.690> got<00:00:16.410> multiple<00:00:17.100> different<00:00:17.369> colors<00:00:17.730> on

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
that is got multiple different colors on

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.939 
that is got multiple different colors on
it<00:00:18.030> usually<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.690> got<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> lot<00:00:19.200> of<00:00:19.230> vascularity

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
it usually it's got a lot of vascularity

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.330 
it usually it's got a lot of vascularity
it's<00:00:20.250> really<00:00:20.490> red<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.180> flushed<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.980> also

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
it's really red and flushed and it also

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.130 
it's really red and flushed and it also
has<00:00:23.520> got<00:00:23.610> a<00:00:23.670> bunch<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:24.060> brown<00:00:24.240> spots<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.020> so

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
has got a bunch of brown spots on it so

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.410 
has got a bunch of brown spots on it so
it's<00:00:25.260> no<00:00:25.350> longer<00:00:25.380> an<00:00:25.740> even<00:00:26.220> tone<00:00:26.520> when<00:00:27.270> we're

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
it's no longer an even tone when we're

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.929 
it's no longer an even tone when we're
children<00:00:27.660> our<00:00:28.080> skin<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.500> one<00:00:28.830> color<00:00:29.100> and<00:00:29.460> as<00:00:29.820> we

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
children our skin is one color and as we

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.999 
children our skin is one color and as we
get<00:00:30.060> older<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.630> looks<00:00:31.020> modeled<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.650> has<00:00:31.800> a

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
get older it looks modeled it has a

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.950 
get older it looks modeled it has a
series<00:00:32.519> of<00:00:32.550> different<00:00:32.819> color<00:00:33.179> splattered<00:00:33.809> in

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
series of different color splattered in

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.040 
series of different color splattered in
there<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.920> key<00:00:35.249> to<00:00:35.309> fixing<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.839> be<00:00:36.960> able

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
there the key to fixing it is to be able

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.610 
there the key to fixing it is to be able
to<00:00:37.199> treat<00:00:37.649> each<00:00:37.920> ingredient<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:39.289> once<00:00:40.289> we<00:00:40.440> fix

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
to treat each ingredient and once we fix

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.069 
to treat each ingredient and once we fix
each<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:41.010> them<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.609> you<00:00:41.639> have<00:00:42.079> unmodeled

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
each of them then you have unmodeled

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.649 
each of them then you have unmodeled
skin<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.219> first<00:00:44.550> step<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.299> look<00:00:45.449> for

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:45.659 
skin so the first step is to look for

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.020 
skin so the first step is to look for
the<00:00:45.749> bread<00:00:46.109> all<00:00:46.499> the<00:00:46.889> areas<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.309> are<00:00:47.519> red<00:00:47.549> is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the bread all the areas that are red is

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.829 
the bread all the areas that are red is
where<00:00:48.449> you<00:00:48.539> have<00:00:48.690> tiny<00:00:49.159> broken<00:00:50.449> blood<00:00:51.449> vessels

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
where you have tiny broken blood vessels

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:53.989 
where you have tiny broken blood vessels
underneath<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.319> skin<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.769> these<00:00:53.159> tiny<00:00:53.489> blood

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
underneath the skin and these tiny blood

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:56.149 
underneath the skin and these tiny blood
vessels<00:00:54.420> flush<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.199> make<00:00:55.379> your<00:00:55.530> look<00:00:55.709> model

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
vessels flush and make your look model

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:58.969 
vessels flush and make your look model
than<00:00:56.309> red<00:00:56.579> there<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.359> a<00:00:57.510> laser<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.350> actually

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
than red there is a laser that actually

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.340 
than red there is a laser that actually
selectively<00:00:59.819> targets<00:01:00.539> everything<00:01:01.079> red

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
selectively targets everything red

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.060 
selectively targets everything red
because<00:01:01.679> it<00:01:01.920> puts<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.760> lot<00:01:02.909> of<00:01:03.030> energy<00:01:03.389> into<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
because it puts a lot of energy into the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.620 
because it puts a lot of energy into the
oxyhemoglobin<00:01:05.070> which<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.940> part<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.480> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
oxyhemoglobin which is the part of the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.890 
oxyhemoglobin which is the part of the
blood<00:01:06.780> vessel<00:01:07.230> that<00:01:08.300> absorbs<00:01:09.300> this<00:01:09.480> so<00:01:09.840> it

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
blood vessel that absorbs this so it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.420 
blood vessel that absorbs this so it
doesn't<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.290> any<00:01:10.440> damage<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.800> any<00:01:11.010> other<00:01:11.220> part

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
doesn't do any damage to any other part

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.770 
doesn't do any damage to any other part
of<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.520> skin<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:11.910> it<00:01:12.000> does<00:01:12.210> get<00:01:12.450> rid<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.660> those

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
of the skin but it does get rid of those

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.780 
of the skin but it does get rid of those
broken<00:01:13.080> blood<00:01:13.350> vessels<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.160> was<00:01:14.310> designed<00:01:14.700> for

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
broken blood vessels it was designed for

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.520 
broken blood vessels it was designed for
children<00:01:15.300> so<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.540> actually<00:01:15.750> quite<00:01:16.110> safe<00:01:16.500> to

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
children so it's actually quite safe to

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.150 
children so it's actually quite safe to
use<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.670> show<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.880> how<00:01:18.120> to<00:01:18.180> do<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:19.160> so

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
use and I can show you how to do that so

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.920 
use and I can show you how to do that so
this<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.550> an<00:01:20.730> example<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.300> that<00:01:21.360> class<00:01:21.720> of

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
this is an example of that class of

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.900 
this is an example of that class of
laser<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.980> can<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.610> I'm<00:01:23.700> going<00:01:23.820> to

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
laser that you can do and I'm going to

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.090 
laser that you can do and I'm going to
show<00:01:24.120> you<00:01:24.150> how<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> typical<00:01:24.900> hand<00:01:25.440> handle<00:01:25.890> would

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
show you how a typical hand handle would

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.040 
show you how a typical hand handle would
fit<00:01:26.310> onto<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.700> skin<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.450> applied<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
fit onto the skin it can be applied to

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.650 
fit onto the skin it can be applied to
the<00:01:28.200> face<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:29.070> neck<00:01:29.340> or<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.820> chest<00:01:30.210> or

the face the neck or the chest or

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.000 
the face the neck or the chest or
anywhere<00:01:31.050> on<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.230> body<00:01:31.440> that<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:31.890> these

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
anywhere on the body that you have these

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.410 
anywhere on the body that you have these
tiny<00:01:32.280> broken<00:01:32.490> blood<00:01:32.820> vessels<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.330> are

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
tiny broken blood vessels that are

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.060 
tiny broken blood vessels that are
causing<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.900> redness<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.410> the<00:01:34.500> flushing<00:01:34.830> to

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
causing the redness and the flushing to

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.090 
causing the redness and the flushing to
the<00:01:35.190> skin<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:36.150> next<00:01:36.420> step<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.930> hot<00:01:37.410> to<00:01:37.680> handle

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the skin the next step is hot to handle

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.220 
the skin the next step is hot to handle
the<00:01:38.430> brown<00:01:38.700> spots<00:01:39.120> on<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.450> skin<00:01:39.690> there<00:01:40.200> are

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
the brown spots on the skin there are

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.780 
the brown spots on the skin there are
different<00:01:40.650> lasers<00:01:41.010> for<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.550> I'm<00:01:41.640> gonna

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
different lasers for that and I'm gonna

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.750 
different lasers for that and I'm gonna
also<00:01:42.000> show<00:01:42.300> you<00:01:42.360> what<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.600> looks<00:01:42.870> like<00:01:43.760> this

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
also show you what that looks like this

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.670 
also show you what that looks like this
is<00:01:44.940> a<00:01:44.970> typical<00:01:45.600> example<00:01:45.690> of<00:01:46.140> an<00:01:46.290> laser<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
is a typical example of an laser that

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.350 
is a typical example of an laser that
you<00:01:46.800> can<00:01:46.980> use<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.280> brown<00:01:47.460> spots<00:01:47.820> again<00:01:48.120> it<00:01:48.240> can

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
you can use on brown spots again it can

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.690 
you can use on brown spots again it can
be<00:01:48.480> used<00:01:48.690> on<00:01:48.870> the<00:01:49.050> arms<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.890> face<00:01:50.159> neck<00:01:50.190> and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
be used on the arms on the face neck and

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.810 
be used on the arms on the face neck and
chest<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.830> helps<00:01:53.220> get<00:01:53.400> rid<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.580> brown

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
chest and it helps get rid of brown

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.240 
chest and it helps get rid of brown
spots<00:01:54.180> brown<00:01:54.630> spots<00:01:54.659> can<00:01:55.170> also<00:01:55.350> respond<00:01:56.159> to

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
spots brown spots can also respond to

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.610 
spots brown spots can also respond to
chemical<00:01:56.729> treatments<00:01:57.240> such<00:01:58.050> as<00:01:58.200> chemical

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
chemical treatments such as chemical

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.260 
chemical treatments such as chemical
peels<00:01:58.800> that<00:01:59.010> can<00:01:59.100> be<00:01:59.159> applied<00:01:59.400> onto<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.970> skin

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
peels that can be applied onto the skin

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.450 
peels that can be applied onto the skin
to<00:02:00.479> help<00:02:00.630> exfoliate<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.740> dead<00:02:01.770> layer<00:02:02.159> that

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
to help exfoliate the dead layer that

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.969 
to help exfoliate the dead layer that
contains<00:02:02.820> all<00:02:03.330> that<00:02:03.479> modeled<00:02:03.979> pigmentation

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
contains all that modeled pigmentation

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.190 
contains all that modeled pigmentation
and<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.640> able<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.940> clear<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.300> bright<00:02:06.960> new

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and to be able to clear a bright new

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.379 
and to be able to clear a bright new
skin<00:02:07.530> underneath<00:02:07.830> it<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.969> there<00:02:09.119> are<00:02:09.149> many

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:09.389 
skin underneath it so there are many

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.330 
skin underneath it so there are many
reasons<00:02:09.899> why<00:02:09.959> we<00:02:10.049> get<00:02:10.289> modeled<00:02:10.619> pigmentation

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
reasons why we get modeled pigmentation

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.400 
reasons why we get modeled pigmentation
such<00:02:11.549> as<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.849> Sun<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.389> hormones<00:02:12.870> some<00:02:13.230> of

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
such as the Sun and hormones some of

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.800 
such as the Sun and hormones some of
genetic<00:02:13.950> factors<00:02:14.400> but<00:02:15.120> there<00:02:15.330> are<00:02:15.450> things<00:02:15.660> we

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
genetic factors but there are things we

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.570 
genetic factors but there are things we
can<00:02:15.960> control<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.590> one<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.070> them<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.310> how<00:02:17.430> much

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
can control and one of them is how much

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.850 
can control and one of them is how much
UV<00:02:17.880> radiation<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.510> get<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:18.900> using<00:02:19.530> sun

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
UV radiation you get so using sun

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.970 
UV radiation you get so using sun
protection<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.580> good<00:02:21.450> sun<00:02:21.810> habits<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.440> very

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
protection and good sun habits is very

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.740 
protection and good sun habits is very
important<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:23.940> course<00:02:24.150> we<00:02:24.300> have<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.480> lot<00:02:24.630> of
