00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:14.409
 the typical folder of the ivy stamp the first in the world to win a match against 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:14.900
 the carpi 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.150
 125 cubic centimeters 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.470
 It's a top car frame 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.320
 equipped with two packs of lithium polymer batteries 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.079
 from 40 amps now 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.089
 for a voltage of each of the 48 volt parks 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.089
 overall extension b96 you 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.520
 the motor is a magnets marelli to direct current 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.560
 and separate excitation 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.050
 the nominal power of 30 kilowatts but capable of delivering a peak power of 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.730
 34 kilowatts 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.900
 which translated into simple words 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.900
 are about 45 horses 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.670
 the tires he uses are the white vegas 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.550
 and the total weight of the cards of 120 kilos obviously without the pilot 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.730
 skill card 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.190
 it is recharged with two battery chargers 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.160
 one for each pack of batteries and a complete recharge takes about 2 hours 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.840
 thanks to the innovative type of accumulators used 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.510
 those with lithium polymers 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.400
 that according to the manufacturer 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.020
 offer a duration of one thousand charge and discharge cycles 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:25.970
 the pilot 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.270
 is able to manage the kart from the passenger compartment through trailers 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.570
 and when the energy of the batteries is turned on and at the end e 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.880
 I'm 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.340
 security so that the pension does not fall below a certain threshold 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.560
 and in this way preserve the health of the accumulators 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.250
 while the dashboard there are two analogue ammeters 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.810
 the one on the right which indicates the field current of the motor in question 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.750
 separate 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.640
 and the one on the left which indicates the current absorbed by the engine 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.670
 a real jewel that surprises for its simplicity and that has marked 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.560
 a milestone in the history of world football competitions and in 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.179
 future projection 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:16.219
 in automotive world competitions 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.039
 a success 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:19.459
 all Italian 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.510
 with two names 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.319
 that will remain in history 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.319
 marco file c the pilot who put a lot of his 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.119
 to win and obviously true 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:34.249
 ie the ping he gave the chance to print his name in the 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:37.089
 books on the history of world motoring
