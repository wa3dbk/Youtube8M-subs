used the pickups in the intro and split

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.629 
used the pickups in the intro and split
mode<00:03:01.419> so<00:03:01.810> I<00:03:01.840> want<00:03:02.079> to<00:03:02.169> show<00:03:02.889> them<00:03:03.069> now<00:03:03.280> in

humbucker<00:03:04.090> mode<00:03:04.440> here's<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.650> bridge<00:03:05.950> without

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
humbucker mode here's the bridge without

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.190 
humbucker mode here's the bridge without
the<00:03:06.519> preamp

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.390 

Oh

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:21.680 

and<00:03:14.030> here's<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:14.569> with<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.170> preamp

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.780 

you'll<00:03:22.470> notice<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.830> it<00:03:23.100> adds<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.580> bit<00:03:23.610> of

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
you'll notice that it adds a bit of

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.090 
you'll notice that it adds a bit of
volume<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.420> bit<00:03:24.450> of<00:03:24.720> saturation<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:25.560> here's<00:03:26.010> a

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
volume a bit of saturation so here's a

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.670 
volume a bit of saturation so here's a
bit<00:03:26.280> louder<00:03:26.670> played<00:03:27.150> on<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.140> G<00:03:28.380> chord<00:03:30.680> that's

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
bit louder played on a G chord that's

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.410 
bit louder played on a G chord that's
without<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.010> preamp<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.550> this<00:03:32.880> is<00:03:33.000> with<00:03:33.210> the

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:41.110 
without the preamp and this is with the
preamp

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.330
