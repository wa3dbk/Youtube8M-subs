like<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> little<00:00:36.840> flecks<00:00:37.380> everywhere<00:00:38.540> all<00:00:39.540> over

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
like a little flecks everywhere all over

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.740 
like a little flecks everywhere all over
basically<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.680> head<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.160> front<00:00:41.460> section

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
basically the head in the front section

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.180 
basically the head in the front section
the<00:00:42.750> back<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.170> pretty<00:00:43.410> clear<00:00:43.770> there's<00:00:43.980> no

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
paint on the back area but I'm really

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.520 
paint on the back area but I'm really
glad<00:00:48.390> they<00:00:48.600> did<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.809> cuz<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.020> think<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
glad they did this cuz I think this is a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.830 
glad they did this cuz I think this is a
really<00:00:49.770> kind<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.070> fun<00:00:50.399> variant<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.660> it

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
really kind of fun variant to have it

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.529 
really kind of fun variant to have it
out<00:00:51.930> there<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.350> let's<00:00:52.620> go<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> closer<00:00:53.129> look

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
out there so let's go for a closer look

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.970 
out there so let's go for a closer look
can't<00:00:54.539> really<00:00:54.870> comment<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.559> pink<00:00:55.800> too

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
can't really comment on the pink too

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.279 
can't really comment on the pink too
much<00:00:56.129> but<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.610> discuss<00:00:57.059> just<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> general

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
much but I can discuss just the general

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.229 
much but I can discuss just the general
sculpt<00:00:58.800> which<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.489> same<00:00:59.699> as<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> regular

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
sculpt which is the same as the regular

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.900 
sculpt which is the same as the regular
predator<00:01:00.840> as<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:02.430> fricking

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
predator as you can see it's fricking

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.460 
predator as you can see it's fricking
clear<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.449> there's<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.660> real<00:01:03.840> detail<00:01:04.170> aside

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
clear so there's a real detail aside

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.100 
clear so there's a real detail aside
from<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.830> green<00:01:05.100> paint<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.630> haven't<00:01:06.930> seen

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
from the green paint if you haven't seen

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.750 
from the green paint if you haven't seen
predator<00:01:07.530> then<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.920> maybe<00:01:08.070> don't<00:01:08.340> know<00:01:08.490> that

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
predator then you maybe don't know that

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.690 
predator then you maybe don't know that
predators<00:01:09.659> bleed<00:01:09.900> green<00:01:10.520> but<00:01:11.520> if<00:01:11.580> you're

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
predators bleed green but if you're

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.830 
predators bleed green but if you're
watching<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.119> would<00:01:12.210> hope<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.420> god<00:01:12.689> you've

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
watching this I would hope to god you've

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
watching this I would hope to god you've
seen<00:01:13.049> predator<00:01:13.350> because<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.650> one<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.799> the

for a closer look so you can see it some

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.330

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.800 

saw<00:01:32.340> another<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.119> stores<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.630> had

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
saw another one at the stores that had

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.179 
saw another one at the stores that had
maybe<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.200> little<00:01:34.320> bit<00:01:34.470> more<00:01:34.710> paint<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.100> my

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
maybe a little bit more paint and my

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.609 
maybe a little bit more paint and my
opinion<00:01:35.490> had<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> little<00:01:35.790> too<00:01:35.939> much<00:01:36.119> paint<00:01:36.619> this

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
opinion had a little too much paint this

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.679 
opinion had a little too much paint this
one<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.860> think<00:01:38.040> has<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> nice<00:01:38.520> amount<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:39.090> flaking

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
one I think has a nice amount of flaking

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.359 
one I think has a nice amount of flaking
where<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.049> see<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> green<00:01:40.680> paint<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.189> you

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
where you see the green paint but you

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.109 
where you see the green paint but you
get<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> sense<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.030> invisibility<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.850> I<00:01:44.850> do

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
get the sense of invisibility to it I do

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.969 
get the sense of invisibility to it I do
kind<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.630> prefer<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.170> San<00:01:46.439> Diego<00:01:46.619> comic-con

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
kind of prefer that San Diego comic-con

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.190 
kind of prefer that San Diego comic-con
version<00:01:47.460> though<00:01:47.610> where<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.990> green

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
version though where the the the green

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.800 
version though where the the the green
paint<00:01:49.740> was<00:01:49.890> more<00:01:50.100> globby<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.600> me<00:01:51.689> it

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
paint was more globby because to me it

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.130 
paint was more globby because to me it
read<00:01:52.020> more<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:53.329> blood<00:01:54.329> coming<00:01:54.689> from<00:01:54.780> him<00:01:54.960> and

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
read more like blood coming from him and

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.039 
read more like blood coming from him and
not<00:01:55.290> just<00:01:55.729> him<00:01:56.729> being<00:01:56.969> sneezed<00:01:57.420> on<00:01:57.600> by<00:01:57.810> green

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
not just him being sneezed on by green

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.899 
not just him being sneezed on by green
paint<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.740> still<00:01:58.920> think<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.490> cool

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
paint but I still think this is cool

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.910 
paint but I still think this is cool
now<00:02:00.479> just<00:02:00.810> for<00:02:00.899> comparison<00:02:01.170> here<00:02:01.560> he<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.710> next

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
now just for comparison here he is next

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.310 
now just for comparison here he is next
to<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:03.030> regular<00:02:03.360> predator<00:02:03.750> pop<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.259> you

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
to the regular predator pop and you

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.210 
to the regular predator pop and you
can't<00:02:04.560> see<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.520> know<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.670> same<00:02:05.850> kind

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.010 

I'd<00:02:09.790> also<00:02:09.940> like<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.180> point<00:02:10.330> out<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:10.540> this<00:02:10.869> is

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
I'd also like to point out that this is

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.770 
I'd also like to point out that this is
not<00:02:11.140> really<00:02:11.470> like<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.650> screen<00:02:12.070> accurate<00:02:12.780> pop

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
not really like a screen accurate pop

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.360 
not really like a screen accurate pop
but<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.170> doesn't<00:02:14.440> really<00:02:14.500> matter<00:02:14.800> but<00:02:15.280> you

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
but that doesn't really matter but you

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.310 
but that doesn't really matter but you
know<00:02:15.490> in<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.820> film<00:02:16.090> he<00:02:16.300> never<00:02:16.570> gets<00:02:16.840> cloaked

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
know in the film he never gets cloaked

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.760 
know in the film he never gets cloaked
while<00:02:18.250> he's<00:02:18.490> unmasked<00:02:19.300> he's<00:02:20.170> always<00:02:20.320> going<00:02:20.560> on

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
while he's unmasked he's always going on

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.230 
while he's unmasked he's always going on
invisible<00:02:21.040> mode<00:02:21.430> when<00:02:21.580> he's<00:02:21.730> at<00:02:21.850> least<00:02:21.940> masked

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
invisible mode when he's at least masked

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.370 
invisible mode when he's at least masked
you<00:02:22.390> don't<00:02:22.510> really<00:02:22.600> see<00:02:22.750> my<00:02:22.870> mass<00:02:23.050> until<00:02:23.290> the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
you don't really see my mass until the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.560 
you don't really see my mass until the
very<00:02:23.500> very<00:02:23.590> end<00:02:23.770> also<00:02:24.580> he<00:02:24.880> never<00:02:25.030> gets<00:02:25.180> covered

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
very very end also he never gets covered

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.990 
very very end also he never gets covered
in<00:02:25.630> blood<00:02:25.870> like<00:02:25.900> this<00:02:26.230> while<00:02:26.560> he's<00:02:26.740> invisible

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
in blood like this while he's invisible

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.580 
in blood like this while he's invisible
but<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.480> don't<00:02:28.900> think<00:02:29.140> they're<00:02:29.260> going<00:02:29.410> for<00:02:29.530> like

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
but I don't think they're going for like

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.080 
but I don't think they're going for like
any<00:02:29.770> kind<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.010> screen<00:02:30.220> accuracy<00:02:30.610> variant<00:02:30.970> here

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
any kind of screen accuracy variant here

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.760 
any kind of screen accuracy variant here
I<00:02:31.120> think<00:02:31.360> they're<00:02:31.480> just<00:02:31.630> taking<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.140> pop<00:02:32.440> and

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
I think they're just taking this pop and

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.580 
I think they're just taking this pop and
make<00:02:33.520> making<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.210> fun<00:02:34.510> like<00:02:34.960> alternative<00:02:35.440> with

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
make making a fun like alternative with

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.960 
make making a fun like alternative with
it<00:02:35.710> I<00:02:35.740> think<00:02:36.040> in<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:36.250> case<00:02:36.460> this<00:02:36.610> is<00:02:36.670> really

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
it I think in that case this is really

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.730 
it I think in that case this is really
cool<00:02:37.150> in<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.870> grand<00:02:38.050> scheme<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.410> my<00:02:38.500> pop

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
cool in the grand scheme of my pop

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.590 
cool in the grand scheme of my pop
collecting<00:02:39.220> I<00:02:39.400> don't<00:02:39.910> collect<00:02:40.060> that<00:02:40.240> many

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
collecting I don't collect that many

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.180 
collecting I don't collect that many
bloody<00:02:40.960> variants<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.470> things<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:41.950> think

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
bloody variants of things I think

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.290 
bloody variants of things I think
they're<00:02:42.370> kind<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.640> cool<00:02:42.790> but<00:02:42.940> unless<00:02:43.120> it's

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
they're kind of cool but unless it's

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.270 
they're kind of cool but unless it's
really<00:02:43.540> relevant<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.110> pop<00:02:44.320> I<00:02:44.590> think<00:02:45.160> it's

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
really relevant to the pop I think it's

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.680 
really relevant to the pop I think it's
just<00:02:45.490> some<00:02:45.730> red<00:02:45.880> paint<00:02:46.060> thrown<00:02:46.360> on<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.510> pop

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
just some red paint thrown on the pop

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.420 
just some red paint thrown on the pop
also<00:02:47.380> I<00:02:47.709> don't<00:02:47.980> really<00:02:48.100> collect<00:02:48.280> the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
also I don't really collect the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.040 
also I don't really collect the
invisible<00:02:48.850> versions<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.270> stuff<00:02:49.480> like<00:02:49.750> you

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
invisible versions of stuff like you

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.780 
invisible versions of stuff like you
know<00:02:50.080> Bilbo<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.530> stuff<00:02:50.860> because<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.370> me<00:02:51.490> just

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
know Bilbo and stuff because to me just

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.820 
know Bilbo and stuff because to me just
a<00:02:51.970> clear<00:02:52.240> pop<00:02:52.450> isn't<00:02:52.600> that<00:02:52.750> exciting<00:02:53.140> but

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
a clear pop isn't that exciting but

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.380 
a clear pop isn't that exciting but
predators<00:02:54.370> when<00:02:54.520> my<00:02:54.610> favorite<00:02:54.880> monsters<00:02:55.209> ever

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
predators when my favorite monsters ever

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.170 
predators when my favorite monsters ever
and<00:02:55.690> if<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.020> take<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.500> clear<00:02:57.280> version<00:02:57.490> and<00:02:57.850> a

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
and if you take a clear version and a

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.210 
and if you take a clear version and a
bloody<00:02:58.450> version<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:58.930> combine<00:02:59.320> it<00:02:59.350> now<00:03:00.040> you've

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
bloody version you combine it now you've

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.560 
bloody version you combine it now you've
kind<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:00.430> got<00:03:00.580> my<00:03:00.700> interest<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.180> in<00:03:01.270> that<00:03:01.420> case

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
kind of got my interest and in that case

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.840 
kind of got my interest and in that case
I<00:03:01.810> dig<00:03:02.170> this<00:03:02.350> pop<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.800> lot<00:03:03.010> it's<00:03:03.580> one<00:03:03.700> of<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.790> few

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
I dig this pop a lot it's one of a few

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.520 
I dig this pop a lot it's one of a few
exceptions<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:04.360> my<00:03:04.450> little<00:03:04.720> standards<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.500> I

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
exceptions to my little standards and I

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.990 
exceptions to my little standards and I
think<00:03:05.770> this<00:03:05.860> one<00:03:06.010> is<00:03:06.160> really<00:03:06.250> really<00:03:06.610> cool

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
think this one is really really cool

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.290 
think this one is really really cool
thanks<00:03:07.900> for<00:03:08.020> watching
