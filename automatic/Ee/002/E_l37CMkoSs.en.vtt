00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
so that the car rotates around it now

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.850 
so that the car rotates around it now
this<00:01:03.090> engine<00:01:03.300> actually<00:01:03.650> different<00:01:04.650> from<00:01:04.769> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
this engine actually different from a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.219 
this engine actually different from a
turbo<00:01:05.280> where<00:01:05.610> there's<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.850> mechanical<00:01:06.229> drawn

turbo where there's a mechanical drawn

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.899 
turbo where there's a mechanical drawn
to<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> engine<00:01:07.830> which<00:01:07.950> actually<00:01:08.430> gives<00:01:08.790> it

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
to the engine which actually gives it

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.870 
to the engine which actually gives it
that<00:01:08.970> extra<00:01:09.090> power<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:10.590> has<00:01:10.860> some<00:01:11.070> incredible

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
that extra power it has some incredible

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.490 
that extra power it has some incredible
characteristics<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.840> though<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> Toyota

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
you think about the horsepower you say

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.780 
you think about the horsepower you say
well<00:01:51.810> 218<00:01:52.590> horsepower<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.220> may<00:01:53.399> not<00:01:53.579> sound

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
well 218 horsepower that may not sound

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.889 
well 218 horsepower that may not sound
like<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.060> lot<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.540> when<00:01:54.689> you're<00:01:54.810> only

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
like a lot but when you're only

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.200 
like a lot but when you're only
propelling<00:01:55.500> 2,000<00:01:56.070> pounds<00:01:56.520> either<00:01:56.759> straight

panels<00:02:49.330> but<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:50.050> whole<00:02:50.380> car<00:02:50.830> is<00:02:51.000> constructed

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
panels but the whole car is constructed

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.270 
panels but the whole car is constructed
very<00:02:52.630> differently<00:02:53.350> than<00:02:53.470> we<00:02:53.770> would<00:02:53.800> see<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.190> car

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
very differently than we would see a car

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.010 
very differently than we would see a car
in<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.760> modern<00:02:55.090> production<00:02:55.540> line<00:02:55.690> isn't<00:02:55.870> it

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
in a modern production line isn't it

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.800 
in a modern production line isn't it
definitely<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.770> lot<00:02:57.070> differently<00:02:57.700> because<00:02:58.209> not

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
definitely a lot differently because not

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.570 
definitely a lot differently because not
only<00:02:58.840> is<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.290> lightweight<00:02:59.620> but<00:03:00.160> also<00:03:00.190> to

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
only is it lightweight but also to

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.490 
only is it lightweight but also to
improve<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.270> road<00:03:01.450> going<00:03:01.690> characteristics

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
improve the road going characteristics

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.410 
improve the road going characteristics
of<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.680> car<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.070> handling<00:03:03.459> of<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.670> car<00:03:03.850> you

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
of the car the handling of the car you

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.690 
of the car the handling of the car you
want<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:04.660> very<00:03:04.840> rigid<00:03:05.170> structure<00:03:05.860> even<00:03:06.520> without

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
want a very rigid structure even without

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.240 
want a very rigid structure even without
a<00:03:06.820> top<00:03:07.150> this<00:03:07.450> car<00:03:07.660> is<00:03:07.780> extremely<00:03:08.050> rigid<00:03:08.680> more

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
a top this car is extremely rigid more

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.280 
a top this car is extremely rigid more
so<00:03:09.430> than<00:03:09.640> just<00:03:10.000> about<00:03:10.209> any<00:03:10.450> car<00:03:10.780> in<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.110> world

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
so than just about any car in the world

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.680 
so than just about any car in the world
that<00:03:11.980> has<00:03:12.190> an<00:03:12.340> open<00:03:12.640> top<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.120> reason<00:03:13.450> for<00:03:13.570> that

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
that has an open top the reason for that

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.800 
that has an open top the reason for that
is<00:03:13.870> it's<00:03:14.050> built<00:03:14.290> with<00:03:14.560> extruded<00:03:15.220> aluminum

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
is it's built with extruded aluminum

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.840 
is it's built with extruded aluminum

for a very very solid chassis notice

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.340 
for a very very solid chassis notice
I've<00:03:25.209> got<00:03:25.360> it<00:03:25.510> right<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:25.989> they've<00:03:26.080> really

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
I've got it right and they've really
