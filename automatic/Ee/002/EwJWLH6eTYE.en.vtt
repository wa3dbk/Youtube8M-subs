playing cards just go on Bob Bob Bob
bump<00:01:15.910> right<00:01:16.090> up<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.680> we<00:01:17.950> paid<00:01:18.130> on<00:01:18.280> one<00:01:18.490> we<00:01:19.150> in<00:01:19.240> PA

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
bump right up so we paid on one we in PA

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.360 
bump right up so we paid on one we in PA
and<00:01:19.420> all<00:01:19.600> them<00:01:19.800> know<00:01:20.800> what<00:01:20.920> I'm<00:01:21.010> going<00:01:21.190> to<00:01:21.220> do

and all them know what I'm going to do
is<00:01:21.550> just<00:01:21.660> quickly<00:01:22.660> subdivide<00:01:23.560> it<00:01:23.710> a<00:01:23.770> couple<00:01:23.950> of

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
is just quickly subdivide it a couple of

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.520 
is just quickly subdivide it a couple of
times<00:01:24.250> just<00:01:24.610> because<00:01:24.940> it<00:01:25.120> helps<00:01:25.450> things<00:01:26.320> out

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
times just because it helps things out

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.330 
times just because it helps things out
and<00:01:26.920> i'm<00:01:27.700> going<00:01:27.910> to<00:01:28.060> create<00:01:28.800> just<00:01:29.800> a<00:01:29.890> two-key

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
and i'm going to create just a two-key

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.980 
and i'm going to create just a two-key
refuse<00:01:30.790> okay<00:01:31.650> right<00:01:32.650> got<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:34.540> wireframe

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
refuse okay right got the wireframe

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.640 
refuse okay right got the wireframe
leave<00:01:35.710> it<00:01:35.830> on<00:01:35.950> for<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.250> moment<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:37.500> i'll<00:01:38.500> just

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
leave it on for the moment and i'll just

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.770 
leave it on for the moment and i'll just
pick<00:01:38.830> an<00:01:38.980> image<00:01:39.070> let's<00:01:39.940> find<00:01:40.120> something<00:01:40.450> from

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
pick an image let's find something from

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.170 
pick an image let's find something from
this<00:01:41.530> my<00:01:41.770> corrected<00:01:42.250> one<00:01:42.370> will<00:01:42.550> travel<00:01:42.909> up<00:01:43.000> and

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
this my corrected one will travel up and

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.910 
this my corrected one will travel up and
see<00:01:43.300> what<00:01:43.480> we<00:01:43.600> have<00:01:43.720> something<00:01:44.650> that's<00:01:44.770> going

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
see what we have something that's going

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.190 
see what we have something that's going
to<00:01:45.010> be<00:01:45.070> interesting<00:01:48.570> fly<00:01:49.570> smell<00:01:49.840> on<00:01:49.960> skin

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
to be interesting fly smell on skin

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.040 
to be interesting fly smell on skin
right<00:01:51.070> drill<00:01:51.790> out<00:01:51.909> on<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.240> it's<00:01:52.510> been<00:01:52.750> there

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
right drill out on that it's been there

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.020 
right drill out on that it's been there
corrected<00:01:53.500> in<00:01:53.710> photoshop<00:01:54.370> i<00:01:54.520> took<00:01:54.760> care<00:01:54.970> the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
corrected in photoshop i took care the

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.700 
corrected in photoshop i took care the
shadows<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:55.450> highlights<00:01:55.540> of<00:01:55.960> it<00:01:56.110> so<00:01:56.590> if<00:01:56.650> it

shadows and highlights of it so if it
looks<00:01:56.830> a<00:01:56.890> bit<00:01:56.979> flat<00:01:57.250> that's<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.490> reason<00:01:57.700> why<00:01:57.729> i

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
looks a bit flat that's the reason why i

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.430 
looks a bit flat that's the reason why i
make<00:01:58.690> a<00:01:58.720> stencil<00:01:59.020> okay<00:01:59.770> hold<00:02:00.640> on<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:00.880> s<00:02:00.970> key

channel all right but I'm going to make
32-bit<00:03:34.709> floating<00:03:35.340> point<00:03:35.930> TIFF<00:03:37.640> so<00:03:38.640> what<00:03:38.790> we'll

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
32-bit floating point TIFF so what we'll

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.940 
32-bit floating point TIFF so what we'll
be<00:03:38.970> painting<00:03:39.209> now<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:40.410> all<00:03:40.560> intents<00:03:40.590> and

be painting now is to all intents and
purposes<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:42.360> displacement<00:03:42.930> map<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:44.340> we<00:03:44.700> can

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
purposes the displacement map so we can

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
purposes the displacement map so we can
use<00:03:45.239> our<00:03:45.360> white<00:03:46.070> and<00:03:47.070> just<00:03:47.850> quickly<00:03:48.080> paint

middle ass and like that right now the
best<00:04:30.360> thing<00:04:30.510> about<00:04:30.840> that<00:04:31.260> is<00:04:32.210> this<00:04:33.210> bump<00:04:33.479> map

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
best thing about that is this bump map

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.470 
best thing about that is this bump map
as<00:04:33.960> its

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
as its

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.740 
as its
32<00:04:35.020> bits<00:04:35.550> I'm<00:04:36.550> going<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:36.850> export<00:04:37.180> it<00:04:37.390> right

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
32 bits I'm going to export it right

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.780 
32 bits I'm going to export it right
like<00:04:38.440> sport<00:04:38.800> this<00:04:38.950> I<00:04:39.190> just<00:04:39.400> put<00:04:39.550> it<00:04:39.640> in<00:04:39.700> the

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
like sport this I just put it in the

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.310 
like sport this I just put it in the
default<00:04:40.180> textures<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:40.660> i'll<00:04:40.720> call<00:04:40.870> it<00:04:41.050> test

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
default textures and i'll call it test

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.900 
default textures and i'll call it test
and<00:04:42.960> up<00:04:45.240> i'll<00:04:46.240> turn<00:04:46.450> it<00:04:46.600> off<00:04:46.740> now<00:04:47.760> we<00:04:48.760> won't

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
and up i'll turn it off now we won't

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.440 
and up i'll turn it off now we won't
need<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.150> add<00:04:49.210> a<00:04:49.330> bit<00:04:49.540> more<00:04:50.820> in<00:04:51.820> this<00:04:52.270> or

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
need to add a bit more in this or

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.480 
need to add a bit more in this or
division<00:04:52.810> or<00:04:53.260> levels<00:04:53.620> alarmed<00:04:54.040> because<00:04:54.250> we

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
division or levels alarmed because we

remember<00:05:00.040> each<00:05:00.160> time<00:05:00.370> you<00:05:00.460> supervise<00:05:00.880> you

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
remember each time you supervise you

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.630 
remember each time you supervise you
fierce<00:05:01.330> count<00:05:01.630> multiplies<00:05:02.440> by<00:05:02.470> four<00:05:02.950> so<00:05:03.130> 2.3

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
fierce count multiplies by four so 2.3

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.880 
fierce count multiplies by four so 2.3
million<00:05:03.850> so<00:05:04.810> that's<00:05:04.930> quite<00:05:05.050> a<00:05:05.140> map<00:05:05.410> scope

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
million so that's quite a map scope

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.990 
million so that's quite a map scope
