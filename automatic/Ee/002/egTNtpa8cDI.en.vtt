those lines but anyways uh I can see in
grief<00:02:48.420> oh<00:02:48.570> just<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.440> easily<00:02:49.710> that<00:02:49.980> they<00:02:50.250> could

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
grief oh just so easily that they could

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.980 
grief oh just so easily that they could
do<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:50.550> grief<00:02:50.880> mode<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.360> whatever<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.780> final

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
do a grief mode and whatever the final

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.930 
do a grief mode and whatever the final
map<00:02:52.350> is<00:02:52.530> probably<00:02:52.980> hopefully<00:02:53.220> Paris<00:02:53.790> of

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
map is probably hopefully Paris of

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.410 
map is probably hopefully Paris of
having<00:02:54.930> for<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:56.100> original<00:02:56.520> for<00:02:56.700> us<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.090> do<00:02:57.240> for

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
having for the original for us to do for

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.620 
having for the original for us to do for
I<00:02:57.450> mean<00:02:57.600> how<00:02:57.750> awesome<00:02:58.020> would<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.500> be<00:02:58.740> like

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
I mean how awesome would that be like

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.750 
I mean how awesome would that be like
that<00:03:00.630> would<00:03:00.780> be<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.080> ultimate<00:03:01.460> grief<00:03:02.460> mode

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
that would be the ultimate grief mode

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.840 
that would be the ultimate grief mode
that<00:03:03.300> would<00:03:03.450> be<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:04.050> amazing<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.370> just<00:03:05.730> I

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
that would be so amazing that I just I

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.700 
that would be so amazing that I just I
just<00:03:05.880> cannot<00:03:06.240> even<00:03:06.450> comprehend<00:03:06.990> comprehend

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
just cannot even comprehend comprehend

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.110 
just cannot even comprehend comprehend
try<00:03:07.920> are<00:03:07.980> actually<00:03:08.310> doing<00:03:08.460> that<00:03:08.670> if<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:08.940> does

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
try are actually doing that if it does

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.680 
try are actually doing that if it does
happen<00:03:09.350> but<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:11.670> main<00:03:11.880> point<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.300> that<00:03:12.360> these

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
happen but the main point is that these

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.290 
happen but the main point is that these
four<00:03:12.930> are<00:03:12.960> returning<00:03:13.860> in<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.700> lot<00:03:15.180> of

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
four are returning in that a lot of

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.480 
four are returning in that a lot of
shenanigans<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.960> going<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.200> go<00:03:16.260> down<00:03:16.290> guys<00:03:17.070> and

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
shenanigans is going to go down guys and

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.550 
shenanigans is going to go down guys and
I'm<00:03:18.240> really<00:03:18.960> really<00:03:19.260> hoping<00:03:20.360> that<00:03:21.360> these<00:03:21.900> four

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
I'm really really hoping that these four

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.230 
I'm really really hoping that these four
characters<00:03:23.040> then<00:03:23.250> when<00:03:23.490> they<00:03:23.610> knew<00:03:24.000> for

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
characters then when they knew for

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.360 
characters then when they knew for
return<00:03:24.600> is<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.470> will<00:03:25.710> probably<00:03:25.950> be<00:03:26.100> via

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
return is that it will probably be via

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.880 
return is that it will probably be via
close<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.820> zombies<00:03:27.210> because<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.720> don't<00:03:28.530> think

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
close to zombies because I don't think

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.590 
close to zombies because I don't think
that<00:03:29.130> they<00:03:29.310> can<00:03:29.490> continue<00:03:29.640> well<00:03:30.300> obviously

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
that they can continue well obviously

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.600 
that they can continue well obviously
that<00:03:30.780> could<00:03:31.110> continue<00:03:31.530> this<00:03:31.650> story<00:03:31.800> further<00:03:32.250> I

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
that could continue this story further I

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.930 
that could continue this story further I
think<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.210> would<00:03:33.300> be<00:03:33.330> time<00:03:34.280> for<00:03:35.280> treyarch<00:03:35.790> to

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
think it would be time for treyarch to

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.420 
think it would be time for treyarch to
close<00:03:36.210> this<00:03:36.480> Tommy<00:03:36.810> story<00:03:37.320> and<00:03:37.620> probably<00:03:38.070> open

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
close this Tommy story and probably open

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.150 
close this Tommy story and probably open
up<00:03:38.520> another<00:03:38.790> zombie<00:03:39.090> story<00:03:39.570> or<00:03:40.110> continue<00:03:40.980> on

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
up another zombie story or continue on

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.830 
up another zombie story or continue on
