00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
just like a pin I'm not sure how Auto

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.060 
just like a pin I'm not sure how Auto
bit<00:03:01.540> over<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.170> then<00:03:02.320> it<00:03:02.410> still<00:03:02.680> has<00:03:02.860> the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
bit over and then it still has the

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:10.220 
bit over and then it still has the
normal<00:03:03.250> stylus<00:03:03.940> in<00:03:04.120> here<00:03:04.360> too<00:03:07.110> soon<00:03:08.670> anyway

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
normal stylus in here too soon anyway

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.500 
normal stylus in here too soon anyway
and<00:03:11.230> of<00:03:11.350> course<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.739> has<00:03:11.860> instructions<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:13.299> a

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
and of course it has instructions and a

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.150 
and of course it has instructions and a
charger<00:03:13.989> but<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:14.350> think<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.650> charger<00:03:15.010> is<00:03:15.070> the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
charger but I think the charger is the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.590 
charger but I think the charger is the
same<00:03:15.370> as<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.700> other<00:03:15.850> one<00:03:16.030> so<00:03:16.239> I<00:03:16.269> may<00:03:16.450> leave

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
same as the other one so I may leave

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.750 
same as the other one so I may leave
that<00:03:16.780> in<00:03:16.930> there<00:03:17.079> until<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.650> other<00:03:18.340> one<00:03:18.519> gets

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
that in there until the other one gets

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.539 
that in there until the other one gets
lost<00:03:19.030> then<00:03:19.209> we'll<00:03:19.420> have<00:03:19.510> an<00:03:19.630> extra<00:03:20.489> thanks<00:03:21.489> a

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549
