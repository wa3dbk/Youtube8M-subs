00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.060
 moin moin people and continue with it 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.770
 databases before we plug in now 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.750
 draufladen what a database needs 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.780
 we have to first have a database 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.839
 stop set for the plug-in allowed 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.920
 every plugin is a mysql database 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.300
 Needs also own 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.340
 database we can not do anything in 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.320
 one is stuck there otherwise 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.960
 Plugins then interfere with each other 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.490
 and yes then there are leaks and crashes 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.199
 plugins is not working properly 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.970
 That's why we now stop 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.009
 User because we only have the courage user 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.920
 we have in the php admin 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.200
 and the rest we have in the last video 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.610
 you can create everything here you can 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.809
 you can press down the video 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.629
 Watch again in peace 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.930
 We lure us into the first now 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.010
 database 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:52.320
 before we will do that here only 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.440
 Login times with good and 123 around here 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.989
 now come to the mysql database 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.250
 I will open putty what 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.140
 of course her awesome here 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.390
 I'm here with the vmware 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.820
 and he can not get in anything 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.700
 copy minecraft so we want that 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.640
 123 so to get in the database 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.140
 let's do a skeleton sign 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.640
 blank rest that means we 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.250
 sign us up as blood and the p for 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.619
 password right now say ours 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.210
 password also took 123 and 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.090
 we are already in the database 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.450
 Now we can look with the command 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.549
 database and the column are very important there 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.810
 we no longer in the linux 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.770
 area are now directly one 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.299
 are database and semicolon means that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.579
 the command we wrote in front 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.720
 who else has finished with it 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.880
 leave nothing then slip 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.850
 my down or you do not want anything 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.530
 to begin with it 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.900
 so now we see we have the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.229
 databases information schema sql 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.640
 performance theme and ppm admin so there 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.920
 Of course, now we want where we can do that 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.590
 nothing plugin what plans lure blog is 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.200
 Now we want a database 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.860
 create the lok blog is called and that is 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.709
 very easily 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:19.410
 create blank database blank 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:22.200
 new database name that us for example 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.540
 been blank then he sees 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.550
 but also up here 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.230
 So if you are now luring for example 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.340
 then you make a line under blog 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.810
 but we write that together and 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.760
 already we have created the database 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.380
 but there was not the database with 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.260
 want to connect them resting so we 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.300
 do not want in our yes and ours 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.110
 conflict parties and so Ruth and 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.630
 Enter password 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.220
 if it is hacked that the 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.110
 hackers have complete access to the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.380
 database has been created now 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.650
 just a new user and that works 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.079
 with the command create user and new 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.950
 user at local horst luc loos das 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:05.640
 automatically then the ip has good on that 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.519
 For example, we would 192 168 2 and the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.829
 106 it would be what you then vom 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.720
 have received host or something with you 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.299
 because now it can be up here 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.700
 be only domain but if you in 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.950
 The data was then there the bass drum 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.540
 then it is always local horst because you 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.700
 yes in there and me from the outside on it 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.310
 so accesses and users always 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.959
 Just mc minecraft and press 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.260
 Enter here again semicolon always 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.230
 very important otherwise it also closes like 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.180
 a lot just upgrade everything 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.430
 great ok no mistakes 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.470
 Now we still set the password 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.000
 we'll do that with a bit longer 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.519
 I also command that now 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.180
 once here will show sap password 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.799
 in front 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.600
 and now we give one 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.130
 users like that want to give that 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.540
 of course the new users of the hot 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.930
 minecraft here 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.230
 and the password is the same and the new one 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.790
 password so we all here now 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.299
 I also do it locally again 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.299
 23 because I fear nothing here because 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.609
 you have no access from outside 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:12.030
 and now we just have to do that 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:13.349
 database better said the user 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.650
 database to point 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:20.430
 So we want the user all right 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:24.300
 for the new database that in that case 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:29.729
 our lures blog database we want 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.740
 to assign the users in the c and that 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.530
 it works out we get here 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.919
 with just with exit and we are already 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.270
 again in the debian area now this time 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.030
 whole course sometimes I test hol 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.530
 you php you over and want me 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.680
 now with that has used a toe and 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.000
 123 did work and we did 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.430
 also have automatic as you here 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.740
 sees directly the database for the nothing 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.030
 plugin lures blog and that 's it 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.150
 already bizarre 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.159
 You really always have to take these steps 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.630
 again do then so we have to 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:03.380
 him user created as they would have 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.940
 now only create database and 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.250
 then i can do that too many times 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.970
 the orders show now I am 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:16.020
 back out before I explain that give 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:19.740
 Let's go to the database with ruth 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.900
 So here in it all is me again 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.840
 can now look again here that it 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.440
 now for the hat 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.000
 there is the lure needed see there 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.410
 we just that everything worked 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.229
 seen since you have just seen synonymous 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.990
 the pirate so you just have to 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:38.960
 make cross database and then the 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.630
 last command brent oil and then the 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.610
 new data, the database so the yes of 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.930
 name of the data from the plugin or 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.290
 whatever you write about it 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.729
 would like to 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.560
 and then it just has to be that 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.080
 user the user to point it 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.030
 there is always only one new one to worry about 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.100
 database will be created otherwise 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.960
 already said it will be a giant 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.740
 cuddly and then works 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.169
 someday not really like that any more 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.400
 so I say goodbye to the 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.229
 database video I will the video 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.830
 Thumbs down helped 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:11.540
 above if it does not stop then underneath 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.820
 otherwise you also like abo here with it
