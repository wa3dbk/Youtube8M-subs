think<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.799> using<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.280> before<00:01:20.610> cheap

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
think that using this before cheap

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.210 
think that using this before cheap
anyway<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.290> should<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.500> good<00:01:22.710> record<00:01:23.159> a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
anyway so it should be good record a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.550 
anyway so it should be good record a
pretty<00:01:23.460> decent<00:01:23.880> gameplay<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:25.110> hopefully

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.100 
again okay so this is another look at
the<00:06:48.699> setup<00:06:49.149> no<00:06:49.419> I<00:06:49.449> personally<00:06:49.810> think<00:06:49.990> that

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110 
the setup no I personally think that

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.320 
the setup no I personally think that
they<00:06:50.289> setup<00:06:50.589> is<00:06:50.830> just<00:06:50.860> fine<00:06:51.370> you<00:06:52.029> don't<00:06:52.149> have

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
they setup is just fine you don't have

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.209 
they setup is just fine you don't have
to<00:06:52.509> change<00:06:52.870> anything<00:06:53.199> about<00:06:53.379> it<00:06:53.680> the<00:06:53.800> mtar<00:06:54.190> is

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:54.219 
to change anything about it the mtar is

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:56.639 
to change anything about it the mtar is
a<00:06:54.370> great<00:06:54.580> weapon<00:06:54.789> very<00:06:55.270> first<00:06:55.539> tile<00:06:55.899> very

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:56.649 
a great weapon very first tile very

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:59.189 
a great weapon very first tile very
powerful<00:06:57.279> but<00:06:58.120> I<00:06:58.360> personally<00:06:58.690> didn't<00:06:58.959> use<00:06:59.080> the

00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 
powerful but I personally didn't use the

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:00.809 
powerful but I personally didn't use the
b-24<00:06:59.709> Yaga<00:06:59.889> whole<00:07:00.069> lot<00:07:00.310> so<00:07:00.459> when<00:07:00.580> I<00:07:00.610> use<00:07:00.789> a

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:00.819 
b-24 Yaga whole lot so when I use a

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:03.240 
b-24 Yaga whole lot so when I use a
fully<00:07:01.180> automatic<00:07:01.539> gun<00:07:01.870> I<00:07:02.110> normally<00:07:02.919> don't<00:07:03.069> use

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.250 
fully automatic gun I normally don't use

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.800 
fully automatic gun I normally don't use
the<00:07:03.639> secondary<00:07:04.029> just<00:07:04.240> because<00:07:04.419> I<00:07:04.449> don't<00:07:04.659> think

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 
the secondary just because I don't think

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.809 
the secondary just because I don't think
it's<00:07:04.899> very<00:07:04.930> necessary<00:07:05.289> so<00:07:06.250> you<00:07:06.279> could<00:07:06.520> get<00:07:06.610> rid

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:06.819 
it's very necessary so you could get rid

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:08.459 
it's very necessary so you could get rid
of<00:07:06.879> that<00:07:07.029> one<00:07:07.270> and<00:07:07.419> then<00:07:07.509> C<00:07:07.629> 4<00:07:07.930> and<00:07:08.139> then<00:07:08.289> maybe

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:08.469 
of that one and then C 4 and then maybe

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:10.019 
of that one and then C 4 and then maybe
swap<00:07:08.770> that<00:07:09.069> but<00:07:09.370> let's<00:07:09.550> say<00:07:09.669> the<00:07:09.729> quick-draw

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:10.029 
swap that but let's say the quick-draw

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:12.749 
swap that but let's say the quick-draw
handle<00:07:10.289> because<00:07:11.289> as<00:07:11.740> I<00:07:11.860> said<00:07:11.919> I<00:07:12.250> do<00:07:12.310> use<00:07:12.639> the

00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:12.759 
handle because as I said I do use the

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:14.339 
handle because as I said I do use the
quick-draw<00:07:13.120> handle<00:07:13.149> a<00:07:13.719> heck<00:07:13.899> of<00:07:13.930> a<00:07:14.080> lot<00:07:14.169> I've

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:14.349 
quick-draw handle a heck of a lot I've

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:16.110 
quick-draw handle a heck of a lot I've
gotten<00:07:14.589> used<00:07:14.740> to<00:07:14.860> it<00:07:14.919> I<00:07:15.219> think<00:07:15.669> that<00:07:15.789> it's<00:07:15.909> very

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 
gotten used to it I think that it's very

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.360 
gotten used to it I think that it's very
helpful<00:07:16.360> in<00:07:16.690> so<00:07:16.750> you<00:07:16.839> could<00:07:17.019> do<00:07:17.199> that<00:07:17.409> and<00:07:17.860> you

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.370 
helpful in so you could do that and you

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.399 
helpful in so you could do that and you
could<00:07:18.490> also<00:07:18.639> get<00:07:18.879> rid<00:07:19.209> of<00:07:19.269> the<00:07:19.569> sizer<00:07:19.839> and<00:07:20.050> swap

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:20.409 
could also get rid of the sizer and swap

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:22.800 
could also get rid of the sizer and swap
that<00:07:20.589> for<00:07:20.800> fast<00:07:21.039> Mac<00:07:21.399> or<00:07:22.000> get<00:07:22.389> rid<00:07:22.479> of<00:07:22.539> hardline

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:22.810 
that for fast Mac or get rid of hardline

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.110 
that for fast Mac or get rid of hardline
I<00:07:22.990> swapped<00:07:23.319> out<00:07:23.500> for<00:07:23.529> light<00:07:23.949> weights<00:07:24.250> and<00:07:24.639> then

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 
I swapped out for light weights and then

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.369 
I swapped out for light weights and then
like<00:07:25.360> this<00:07:25.539> you've<00:07:25.690> got<00:07:25.870> yourself<00:07:26.199> like<00:07:26.319> a

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:26.379 
like this you've got yourself like a

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:28.889 
like this you've got yourself like a
perfect<00:07:26.769> production<00:07:27.159> setup<00:07:27.490> but<00:07:27.819> exercise<00:07:28.659> is

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:28.899 
perfect production setup but exercise is

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:31.740 
perfect production setup but exercise is
not<00:07:29.199> necessary<00:07:30.009> the<00:07:30.639> class<00:07:30.819> Jesse<00:07:31.389> gave<00:07:31.599> me

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:31.750 
not necessary the class Jesse gave me

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.329 
not necessary the class Jesse gave me
was<00:07:31.899> also<00:07:32.050> pretty<00:07:32.379> solid<00:07:32.800> so<00:07:32.919> give<00:07:33.099> it<00:07:33.129> a<00:07:33.219> go

00:07:33.329 --> 00:07:33.339 
was also pretty solid so give it a go

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:35.269 
was also pretty solid so give it a go
but<00:07:34.120> apart<00:07:34.479> from<00:07:34.539> that<00:07:34.659> that's<00:07:34.959> it's

00:07:35.269 --> 00:07:35.279 
but apart from that that's it's

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:37.379
