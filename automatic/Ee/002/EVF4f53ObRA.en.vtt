00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.880 
pencil is also slanted and even though
this<00:02:33.459> is<00:02:33.670> in<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.880> shade<00:02:34.060> number<00:02:34.269> three<00:02:34.890> this

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
this is in the shade number three this

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.650 
this is in the shade number three this
is<00:02:36.160> actually<00:02:36.549> a<00:02:36.580> bit<00:02:36.819> darker<00:02:37.180> than<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.480> wood

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
is actually a bit darker than the wood

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.479 
is actually a bit darker than the wood
eyebrow<00:02:38.019> so<00:02:38.230> I'm<00:02:38.319> going<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.590> show<00:02:38.769> you<00:02:38.830> the

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
eyebrow so I'm going to show you the

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:57.930 
eyebrow so I'm going to show you the
difference

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.940 

so<00:02:58.940> that<00:02:59.240> is<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.540> pretty<00:02:59.840> three<00:03:00.200> other<00:03:00.500> eyebrow

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
so that is a pretty three other eyebrow

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.410 
so that is a pretty three other eyebrow
from<00:03:01.100> nature<00:03:01.460> republic<00:03:01.940> in<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.210> street

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
from nature republic in the street

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.690 
from nature republic in the street
number<00:03:02.570> three<00:03:03.050> I<00:03:03.320> don't<00:03:04.130> know<00:03:04.190> if<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:04.460> can

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
number three I don't know if you can

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.390 
number three I don't know if you can
notice<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:05.210> but<00:03:05.660> this<00:03:06.350> is<00:03:06.620> actually<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.070> bit

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
notice it but this is actually a bit

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.940 
notice it but this is actually a bit
darker<00:03:07.850> than<00:03:08.030> this<00:03:08.330> that<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.320> wood<00:03:09.500> eyebrow

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
darker than this that the wood eyebrow

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.980 
darker than this that the wood eyebrow
but<00:03:10.640> they're<00:03:10.880> both<00:03:11.150> in<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.420> street<00:03:11.600> number

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
but they're both in the street number

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.620 
but they're both in the street number
three<00:03:12.580> so<00:03:13.580> if<00:03:13.670> I'm<00:03:13.760> going<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.150> compare<00:03:14.480> these

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
three so if I'm going to compare these

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.840 
three so if I'm going to compare these
two<00:03:14.690> eyebrow<00:03:15.140> pencils<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:15.920> guess<00:03:16.490> the<00:03:16.700> only

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
two eyebrow pencils I guess the only

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.760 
two eyebrow pencils I guess the only
difference<00:03:17.390> aside<00:03:17.690> from<00:03:17.900> their<00:03:18.080> packaging's

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
difference aside from their packaging's

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.670 
difference aside from their packaging's
are<00:03:18.890> their<00:03:19.520> consistency<00:03:20.120> because<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:21.440> other

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
are their consistency because the other

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.040 
are their consistency because the other
eyebrow<00:03:21.890> pencil<00:03:22.520> is<00:03:22.730> actually<00:03:23.300> a<00:03:23.540> bit

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
eyebrow pencil is actually a bit

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.990 
eyebrow pencil is actually a bit
creamier<00:03:24.560> than<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:25.010> wood<00:03:25.220> eyebrow<00:03:25.550> pencil

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
creamier than the wood eyebrow pencil

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.780 
creamier than the wood eyebrow pencil
but<00:03:26.630> they<00:03:26.780> both<00:03:27.020> give<00:03:27.350> natural<00:03:27.890> finish<00:03:28.610> as<00:03:28.760> you

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
but they both give natural finish as you

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.760 
but they both give natural finish as you
can<00:03:29.030> see<00:03:29.240> and<00:03:29.510> they're<00:03:29.660> both<00:03:29.840> very<00:03:29.900> light<00:03:30.470> so

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
can see and they're both very light so

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.400 
can see and they're both very light so
that's<00:03:30.920> really<00:03:31.190> good<00:03:31.490> and<00:03:31.820> I'm<00:03:32.810> going<00:03:33.020> to<00:03:33.110> show

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
that's really good and I'm going to show

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.980 
that's really good and I'm going to show
you<00:03:33.470> a<00:03:33.620> quick<00:03:33.980> swatch<00:03:34.460> so<00:03:34.880> these<00:03:35.630> are<00:03:35.840> the

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
you a quick swatch so these are the

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.950 
you a quick swatch so these are the
swatch<00:03:36.230> this<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:37.160> darker<00:03:37.550> one<00:03:37.790> is<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.750> other

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
swatch this the darker one is the other

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.780 
swatch this the darker one is the other
eyebrow<00:03:39.110> pencil<00:03:39.710> and<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.040> lighter<00:03:40.250> one<00:03:40.550> is

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
eyebrow pencil and the lighter one is

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.980 
eyebrow pencil and the lighter one is
the<00:03:41.150> wood<00:03:41.330> eyebrow<00:03:42.880> so<00:03:43.880> overall<00:03:44.240> I<00:03:44.390> think<00:03:44.630> that

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
the wood eyebrow so overall I think that

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.200 
the wood eyebrow so overall I think that
these<00:03:45.350> two<00:03:45.650> eyebrow<00:03:45.920> pencils<00:03:46.430> are<00:03:46.640> really

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
these two eyebrow pencils are really

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.750 
these two eyebrow pencils are really
great<00:03:47.600> because<00:03:48.320> like<00:03:49.220> what<00:03:49.460> I've<00:03:49.580> said

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
great because like what I've said

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.140 
great because like what I've said
earlier<00:03:50.230> they<00:03:51.230> both<00:03:51.470> give<00:03:51.890> natural<00:03:52.700> finish

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
earlier they both give natural finish

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.000 
earlier they both give natural finish
and<00:03:53.420> they're<00:03:53.540> very<00:03:53.780> light<00:03:54.140> and<00:03:54.410> they're<00:03:54.800> very

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
and they're very light and they're very

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.860 
and they're very light and they're very
convenient<00:03:55.460> to<00:03:55.670> use<00:03:55.790> because<00:03:56.000> they<00:03:56.330> both<00:03:56.510> come

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
convenient to use because they both come

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.430 
convenient to use because they both come
with<00:03:56.900> its<00:03:57.740> pulley<00:03:58.220> so<00:03:58.910> yeah<00:03:59.120> again<00:03:59.720> this<00:03:59.960> cost

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
with its pulley so yeah again this cost

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.550 
with its pulley so yeah again this cost
