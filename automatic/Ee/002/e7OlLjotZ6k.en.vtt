00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.180
 we prepare a salad of who is not 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.040
 then the quinoa I'll show you in 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.690
 this case of three different colors but 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.780
 you can even find it just white they are 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.459
 of seeds rich in proteins 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.919
 absolutely gluten-free then 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.740
 also perfect for coeliacs they are not 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.780
 cereals are therefore false cereals but 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.880
 they are cooked used in cooking in the 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.580
 same identical way 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:33.050
 hi thought 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:37.590
 same the city recovers itself little is known 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.330
 hello but a jump from less 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.640
 then we have a tri- colored china 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.790
 red white and black with zucchini 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.410
 lamela and raisins slightly sweet and sour 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.300
 with a hint of curling 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.700
 so now we are going to toast them 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.530
 lightly in a pan with a wire 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.120
 of oil then we add the water or the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.280
 vegetable broth as you prefer neither 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.030
 let it cook for at least 10 minutes 10 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.910
 12 minutes 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.750
 then white onion oil 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.309
 extra virgin olive oil and zucchini 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.080
 I 'm giving a complaining pot 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.200
 non-stick in this case red sphere 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:20.640
 I add a bit of raisins and a pinch of 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:22.950
 carrie then curry then remains a 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.050
 water drop and cook for 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:33.299
 a dozen minds a drop of oil 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:37.140
 really a little pot in the la 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:40.200
 I warm up and I start to post the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.930
 quinoa and for 200 g of keane on the way 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:48.270
 cook with about 700 of water 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:51.719
 add the water now leave it 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.149
 cook for a quarter of an hour 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.460
 then he is peeling the apple 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.310
 because china is almost ready apple 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.289
 I must not straquoto re I recommend indeed 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.810
 must give some freshness so not 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.509
 too sweet, so put it on 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.090
 then a quarter has passed 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.880
 from now 12 minutes a quarter of an hour the chin 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.320
 I still have some broth water 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.360
 which you prefer I go to add 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.950
 I finish cooking inside ok 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.320
 considered and that we have said before 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.820
 allen a salad of who does not know why 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.320
 because you can also eat it cold 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.330
 obviously then keep it in 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.349
 refrigerator that for two days with 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:33.810
 the zucchini and lamela that is still cold 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:35.400
 the curry here we are ready the salad in 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.220
 this case obviously still hot 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.890
 because we just did it with the 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.400

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.400
