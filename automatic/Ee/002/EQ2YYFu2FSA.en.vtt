00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
greens salad without the salad dressing

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.190 
greens salad without the salad dressing
not<00:05:17.490> all<00:05:17.670> nothing<00:05:18.090> just<00:05:18.300> growing<00:05:18.810> chicken

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
not all nothing just growing chicken

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.660 
not all nothing just growing chicken
breast<00:05:19.440> so<00:05:19.590> does<00:05:19.740> she<00:05:19.860> -<00:05:20.010> chicken<00:05:20.370> breast<00:05:20.550> in
