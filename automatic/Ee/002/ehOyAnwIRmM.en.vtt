have<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.530> three<00:01:15.830> different<00:01:15.909> bugs<00:01:16.909> in<00:01:17.180> the

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
have the three different bugs in the

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.050 
have the three different bugs in the
center<00:01:17.720> we<00:01:18.229> have<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:18.650> differentials<00:01:19.640> front

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
center we have the differentials front

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.630 
center we have the differentials front
and<00:01:20.330> rear<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:20.930> it's<00:01:21.080> a<00:01:21.200> four<00:01:21.530> wheel<00:01:21.740> drive<00:01:21.770> we

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
and rear so it's a four wheel drive we

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.219 
and rear so it's a four wheel drive we
are<00:01:22.670> using<00:01:22.880> ATM<00:01:23.450> hobby<00:01:24.200> wing<00:01:24.499> ESC<00:01:25.159> and<00:01:25.929> 1500<00:01:26.929> kV

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
are using ATM hobby wing ESC and 1500 kV

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.099 
are using ATM hobby wing ESC and 1500 kV
brushless<00:01:27.679> motor<00:01:28.280> with<00:01:29.179> the<00:01:29.390> fan<00:01:29.749> on<00:01:29.990> the

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
brushless motor with the fan on the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:33.010 
brushless motor with the fan on the
heatsink<00:01:30.829> so<00:01:31.009> yeah<00:01:31.280> it<00:01:31.729> keeps<00:01:32.030> really<00:01:32.659> really

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
heatsink so yeah it keeps really really

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.649 
heatsink so yeah it keeps really really
helps<00:01:33.289> to<00:01:33.499> keep<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.979> vehicles<00:01:34.789> or<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.479> motor

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
helps to keep the vehicles or the motor

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.690 
helps to keep the vehicles or the motor
very<00:01:36.049> very<00:01:36.259> cool<00:01:36.469> when<00:01:36.679> it's<00:01:36.859> running<00:01:37.130> so

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
very very cool when it's running so

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.910 
very very cool when it's running so
nothing<00:01:38.509> much<00:01:38.659> to<00:01:38.719> see<00:01:39.109> basically<00:01:39.380> the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
nothing much to see basically the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.669 
nothing much to see basically the
suspension<00:01:40.759> has<00:01:40.969> sway<00:01:41.299> bars<00:01:41.630> as<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:42.229> can<00:01:42.380> see

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
suspension has sway bars as you can see

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.379 
suspension has sway bars as you can see
both<00:01:42.950> sides<00:01:42.979> here<00:01:44.619> okay<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:45.859> back<00:01:46.759> side<00:01:47.030> here

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:47.389 
both sides here okay and back side here

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:50.200 
both sides here okay and back side here
the<00:01:47.960> suspension<00:01:48.469> has<00:01:48.619> sway<00:01:48.889> bar<00:01:49.159> so<00:01:49.520> they

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
the suspension has sway bar so they

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.910 
the suspension has sway bar so they
really<00:01:50.539> really<00:01:50.810> help<00:01:51.049> with<00:01:51.259> traction<00:01:51.590> and

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
really really help with traction and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.789 
really really help with traction and
running<00:01:52.609> driving<00:01:53.090> very<00:01:53.840> good<00:01:54.139> handling<00:01:54.619> of

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
running driving very good handling of

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.879 
running driving very good handling of
course<00:01:55.069> and<00:01:55.280> we<00:01:55.969> have<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.479> big<00:01:56.780> milling<00:01:57.259> big

course and we have a big milling big

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:59.679 
course and we have a big milling big
hexes<00:01:58.369> here<00:01:58.520> I<00:01:58.549> believe<00:01:58.999> there<00:01:59.179> are<00:01:59.240> 17

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
hexes here I believe there are 17

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.240 
hexes here I believe there are 17
millimeter<00:02:00.049> hex<00:02:00.289> is<00:02:00.499> there

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
millimeter hex is there

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.970 
millimeter hex is there
I<00:02:01.280> have<00:02:01.790> to<00:02:01.940> check<00:02:02.180> these<00:02:02.420> specs<00:02:02.780> again<00:02:03.050> so<00:02:03.500> we

shredder<00:02:17.660> series<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.380> here<00:02:18.710> we<00:02:18.830> go<00:02:33.790> ok<00:02:34.790> but

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
shredder series and here we go ok but

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
shredder series and here we go ok but
that<00:02:35.210> was<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.600> really<00:02:36.050> long<00:02:36.200> card<00:02:36.560> really<00:02:38.020> that

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
that was a really long card really that

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.420 
that was a really long card really that
they're<00:02:39.170> really<00:02:39.350> good<00:02:39.620> for<00:02:39.800> backing<00:02:40.160> on<00:02:40.280> the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
they're really good for backing on the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:03:03.350 
they're really good for backing on the
grass<00:02:40.670> as<00:02:40.910> well

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.149 

well<00:03:04.360> not<00:03:04.569> everybody<00:03:05.080> has<00:03:05.260> access<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.769> dirt

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
well not everybody has access to dirt

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:14.740 
well not everybody has access to dirt
racing<00:03:06.489> or<00:03:06.939> does<00:03:07.150> grounds<00:03:07.599> right

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:39.880 

yeah<00:03:15.750> thank<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.530> very<00:03:16.710> much

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.410 

you<00:03:40.890> might<00:03:41.040> want<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.340> remember<00:03:41.610> one<00:03:41.940> thing<00:03:41.970> on

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
you might want to remember one thing on

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.540 
you might want to remember one thing on
the<00:03:42.810> grass<00:03:43.080> you<00:03:43.380> will<00:03:43.590> have<00:03:43.800> more<00:03:44.130> motor

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
the grass you will have more motor

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.300 
the grass you will have more motor
heating<00:03:45.120> up<00:03:45.269> or<00:03:45.510> ESC<00:03:45.900> heating<00:03:46.349> up<00:03:46.470> because<00:03:46.800> the

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
heating up or ESC heating up because the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.670 
heating up or ESC heating up because the
tires<00:03:47.580> do<00:03:47.880> not<00:03:48.030> have<00:03:48.239> full<00:03:48.540> traction<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.560> you

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
tires do not have full traction so you

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.490 
tires do not have full traction so you
can<00:03:49.980> see<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.940> if<00:03:51.360> I'm<00:03:51.569> here<00:03:51.870> on<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.230> grass

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
can see that if I'm here on the grass

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.550 
can see that if I'm here on the grass
okay<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.730> I<00:03:54.360> go<00:03:54.420> full<00:03:54.780> throttle<00:03:57.230> okay<00:03:58.230> you<00:03:58.290> can

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
okay and I go full throttle okay you can

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.380 
okay and I go full throttle okay you can
see<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.860> tiles<00:03:59.130> are<00:03:59.400> actually<00:03:59.760> splitting<00:04:00.239> all

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
see the tiles are actually splitting all

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.870 
see the tiles are actually splitting all
the<00:04:00.540> time<00:04:00.720> though<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.709> buggy<00:04:01.920> truggy<00:04:02.610> has

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
the time though the buggy truggy has

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.140 
the time though the buggy truggy has
fractions<00:04:03.450> but<00:04:03.989> here<00:04:04.410> if<00:04:04.620> we<00:04:04.890> come<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.700> let's

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
fractions but here if we come to let's

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.440 
fractions but here if we come to let's
say<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.870> dirt<00:04:07.140> area<00:04:07.470> you<00:04:07.860> can<00:04:08.069> see<00:04:10.819> whoa

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
say the dirt area you can see whoa

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.600 
say the dirt area you can see whoa
that<00:04:12.690> speed<00:04:13.019> was<00:04:13.200> really<00:04:13.650> nice<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:14.130> traction

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
that speed was really nice the traction

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.340 
that speed was really nice the traction
the<00:04:15.200> acceleration<00:04:16.200> was<00:04:16.500> really<00:04:16.829> nice<00:04:18.350> you're

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
the acceleration was really nice you're

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.680 
the acceleration was really nice you're
not<00:04:19.530> worried<00:04:19.859> about<00:04:20.100> breaking<00:04:21.030> them<00:04:21.389> because

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
not worried about breaking them because

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:30.410 
not worried about breaking them because
they're<00:04:21.870> really<00:04:21.900> really<00:04:22.530> durable

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:39.530 

was<00:04:30.990> it<00:04:37.280> when<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.460> truggy<00:04:38.760> hits<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.300> dirt

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
was it when the truggy hits the dirt

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.880 
was it when the truggy hits the dirt
area<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.500> acceleration<00:04:41.400> is<00:04:41.550> just<00:04:41.820> awesome

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.750 

and<00:04:46.890> you<00:04:47.010> go<00:04:47.190> into<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.640> big<00:04:47.850> drop

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
and you go into the big drop

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:57.290 
and you go into the big drop
wow<00:04:53.570> what<00:04:54.570> is<00:04:54.630> that<00:04:54.750> pit<00:04:55.200> is<00:04:56.190> it<00:04:56.340> very<00:04:56.490> very

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
wow what is that pit is it very very

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:23.629 
wow what is that pit is it very very
deep<00:04:58.550> sea

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.699
