00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
in all focal points and allows the user

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.790 
in all focal points and allows the user
to<00:00:50.059> dynamically<00:00:50.629> change<00:00:51.229> the<00:00:51.469> focal<00:00:51.769> point

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800

exactly how it works I'm going to hold a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.600 
exactly how it works I'm going to hold a
stormtrooper<00:01:01.399> up<00:01:01.699> close<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:03.220> it's<00:01:04.220> taking<00:01:04.549> a

series of shots and the resulting image

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.260 
series of shots and the resulting image
looks<00:01:09.530> like<00:01:09.710> this<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.490> right<00:01:10.670> now<00:01:10.700> you<00:01:10.880> can<00:01:11.119> see
