a<00:01:22.050> lot<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.590> what's<00:01:22.800> really<00:01:22.980> impressive<00:01:23.250> about

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
a lot of what's really impressive about

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.460 
a lot of what's really impressive about
the<00:01:23.730> manufacturing<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.660> the<00:01:24.870> form<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.230> Plus

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the manufacturing of the form on Plus

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.470 
the manufacturing of the form on Plus
isn't<00:01:26.340> really<00:01:26.580> visible<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> machine

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
isn't really visible in the machine

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.560 
isn't really visible in the machine
itself<00:01:27.990> because<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.610> consists<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.270> tools

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
itself because it it consists of tools

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.870 
itself because it it consists of tools
and<00:01:30.810> processes<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.500> software<00:01:32.010> that<00:01:32.490> are<00:01:32.670> used

to calibrate and test the machine at the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.900 
to calibrate and test the machine at the
factory<00:01:36.500> we<00:01:37.500> put<00:01:37.830> a<00:01:38.130> huge<00:01:38.490> amount<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.760> effort

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
factory we put a huge amount of effort

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.040 
factory we put a huge amount of effort
into<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.540> fit<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.990> finish<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:40.920> machine

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
into the fit and finish of the machine

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.690 
into the fit and finish of the machine
there<00:01:43.050> really<00:01:43.200> made<00:01:43.470> by<00:01:43.680> hand<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.400> large

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
there really made by hand to a large

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.440 
there really made by hand to a large
degree<00:01:46.430> it's<00:01:47.430> been<00:01:47.580> really<00:01:47.850> amazing<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.330> get

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
degree it's been really amazing to get

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.890 
degree it's been really amazing to get
to<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.720> point<00:01:48.930> where<00:01:49.440> we<00:01:50.010> can<00:01:50.160> make<00:01:50.340> these

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
to the point where we can make these

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.810 
to the point where we can make these
highly<00:01:51.900> tested<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.619> calibrated<00:01:52.820> precision

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
another the most exciting thing for me

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.160 
another the most exciting thing for me
is<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.970> take<00:02:00.149> what<00:02:00.330> we've<00:02:00.509> learned<00:02:00.540> building

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
is to take what we've learned building

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.260 
is to take what we've learned building
the<00:02:01.259> form<00:02:01.500> one<00:02:01.649> plus<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.280> use<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.940> to<00:02:03.090> push

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
the form one plus and use that to push

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.560 
the form one plus and use that to push
the<00:02:03.300> future<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.840> 3d<00:02:03.960> printing
