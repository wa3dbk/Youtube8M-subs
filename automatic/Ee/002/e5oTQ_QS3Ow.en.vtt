00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.330
 good 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.330
 to 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.330
 to 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.150
 no no 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.619
 hello everyone today we are going to prepare some 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.880
 chocolate cookies with lacasitos those 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.919
 fillings are special to do in 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.230
 company of the children and they serve us to 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.300
 any children's party 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.360
 We can use lacasitos that are common 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.489
 in Spain also imagine the 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.960
 ingredients for this recipe are 100 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:45.260
 grams of sugar an egg 140 grams of 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.269
 flour that I already have sifted 250 grams 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.199
 of chocolate cream type 1 fabric or 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:53.330
 nocilla one teaspoon salt 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.570
 teaspoon baking yeast 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.299
 what you have and lacasitos to decorate 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.280
 or in ways like I said before we're going to 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.280
 start beating the sugar 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.610
 Web 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.990
 ah 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.500
 already integrated then we open the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.320
 mixer 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.270
 and we add all the flour and we're going to 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.200
 beat slowly so it does not come out too much 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.200
 a powder from above 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.719
 ah 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.390
 this is the texture is a bit lumpy 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.120
 but there is no problem because 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.460
 with the nocilla we will find it 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.460
 then we add all the nocilla 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.519
 and we mix again 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.120
 we can look at it with some pages for 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.120
 that the kneading with its grapes 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.770
 and we can now change the hooks of 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.770
 blender 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.670
 we already have the geese added from the 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.770
 mixer to knead now the 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.150
 we learn at maximum speed and 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.150
 add salt and baking 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.840
 ah 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.290
 well we have already removed the mass from the 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.200
 blender we give it a little bit of shape 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.209
 with his hands this mass at this moment 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.010
 It has a good texture because at home 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.290
 It is not too hot but if the 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.209
 it was very liquid to put in the 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.180
 fridge minimum 30 minutes to be 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.160
 let mold 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.500
 we go 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:50.890
 to make lots of cookies 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:53.940
 that is already false we have the masses 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:58.240
 divided roughly in the same size 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:03.870
 we make a circle without ever squeezing the 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:07.720
 mass we accept it a little and we take 4 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.210
 lacasitos or magnets hopefully colors 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.069
 different so that the diet looks 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.160
 prettier 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.970
 we press 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.970
 Y 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.080
 and we put it in the well separated tray 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.380
 of the others what I'm going to put three 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.380
 rows 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.560
 because they are going to grow a lot 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:08.930
 we already have the cookies armed here 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:11.320
 we're going to bake them at 175 degrees 7 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.320
 8 minutes 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.480
 well we have already finished over behind 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.100
 look how pretty they are and you know 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.750
