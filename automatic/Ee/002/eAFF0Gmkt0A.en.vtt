00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
i'm going to talk to you about piano

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.020 
i'm going to talk to you about piano
tuning<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.470> measurements<00:00:07.919> now<00:00:08.820> we're

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
tuning and measurements now we're

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.330 
tuning and measurements now we're
actually<00:00:09.120> going<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.599> pull<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.050> action<00:00:10.469> the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
actually going to pull the action the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.089 
actually going to pull the action the
keys<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:12.090> all<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.170> action<00:00:13.559> parts<00:00:13.920> are

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
keys and all the action parts are

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.950 
keys and all the action parts are
sitting<00:00:14.429> how<00:00:14.519> much<00:00:14.700> fully<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.120> keyframe<00:00:15.599> and

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
sitting how much fully a keyframe and

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.890 
sitting how much fully a keyframe and
it's<00:00:16.560> also<00:00:17.100> screwed<00:00:17.460> into<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.910> key<00:00:18.330> bed<00:00:18.600> I

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
it's also screwed into the key bed I

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.500 
it's also screwed into the key bed I
didn't<00:00:19.650> know<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.890> before<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:21.090> I'll<00:00:21.240> need<00:00:21.390> to

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
didn't know this before so I'll need to

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.840 
didn't know this before so I'll need to
grab<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> screwdriver<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.740> we'll<00:00:23.369> pull<00:00:23.640> that

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
grab a screwdriver and we'll pull that

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.970 
grab a screwdriver and we'll pull that
out<00:00:25.070> this<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.279> all<00:00:26.460> kept<00:00:26.820> together<00:00:27.410> in<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.769> way

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
out this is all kept together in a way

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.990 
out this is all kept together in a way
so<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.090> size<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.349> geometry<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:32.219> what's

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
so that the size and geometry of what's

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.459 
so that the size and geometry of what's
happening<00:00:33.450> down<00:00:33.600> here<00:00:33.660> for<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.200> player

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
happening down here for the player

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.799 
happening down here for the player
matches<00:00:35.250> what's<00:00:35.670> happening<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.210> he<00:00:36.510> gets<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
matches what's happening and he gets the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.819 
matches what's happening and he gets the
right<00:00:36.960> string<00:00:38.270> if<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.540> gets<00:00:39.719> out<00:00:39.989> even<00:00:40.739> a

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
right string if that gets out even a

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.979 
right string if that gets out even a
little<00:00:41.040> bit<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:42.090> can<00:00:42.329> be<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> real<00:00:42.750> problem

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
little bit that can be a real problem

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.360 
little bit that can be a real problem
you<00:00:43.350> get<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:49.289> hold<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.739> out<00:00:50.039> keep

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
you get the so as I hold this out keep

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.720 
you get the so as I hold this out keep
in<00:00:50.550> mind<00:00:50.579> there's<00:00:51.059> about<00:00:51.260> 77<00:00:52.260> parts<00:00:52.649> for<00:00:53.520> key

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
in mind there's about 77 parts for key

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.810 
in mind there's about 77 parts for key
and<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.539> 88<00:00:54.809> keys<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.579> do<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
and we have 88 keys so you can do the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.250 
and we have 88 keys so you can do the
math<00:00:56.969> let's<00:00:57.149> see<00:00:57.360> there's<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.660> lot<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.960> parts

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
math let's see there's a lot of parts

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.049 
math let's see there's a lot of parts
sitting<00:00:58.530> here<00:00:58.739> there's<00:00:59.489> also<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.820> lot<00:01:00.030> of

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
sitting here there's also a lot of

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.700 
sitting here there's also a lot of
things<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.539> here<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.780> aren't<00:01:01.170> supposed<00:01:01.530> to

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
things in here that aren't supposed to

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.719 
things in here that aren't supposed to
be<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:01.920> here<00:01:02.359> now<00:01:03.359> as<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.660> pull<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.080> out<00:01:04.729> there

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
be in here now as I pull it out there

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.740 
be in here now as I pull it out there
are<00:01:06.409> number<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.470> things<00:01:08.150> not<00:01:09.150> traditionally

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
are number of things not traditionally

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.719 
are number of things not traditionally
in<00:01:10.290> piano<00:01:10.619> school<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.950> didn't<00:01:11.369> learn<00:01:11.460> anything

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
in piano school I didn't learn anything

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.120 
in piano school I didn't learn anything
about<00:01:11.970> how<00:01:12.390> many<00:01:12.570> straws<00:01:12.900> or<00:01:13.260> spoons<00:01:13.890> need<00:01:14.040> to

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
about how many straws or spoons need to

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.590 
about how many straws or spoons need to
be<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> piano

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
be the piano

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.330 
be the piano
I<00:01:15.630> think<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> approximate<00:01:16.830> number<00:01:16.860> though<00:01:17.159> is

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
I think the approximate number though is

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.210 
I think the approximate number though is
zero<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.409> oh<00:01:19.409> here's<00:01:19.740> some<00:01:19.920> hands<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:23.070> as

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
zero and oh here's some hands and so as

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.420 
zero and oh here's some hands and so as
careful<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.790> can<00:01:23.909> because

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.380 

now<00:01:30.430> as<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:32.259> get<00:01:32.409> closer<00:01:32.770> because<00:01:33.759> you<00:01:34.119> see<00:01:34.270> the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
now as we get closer because you see the

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.930 
now as we get closer because you see the
keys<00:01:34.630> extend<00:01:35.200> into<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.130> back<00:01:36.369> under<00:01:36.820> the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
keys extend into the back under the

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.340 
keys extend into the back under the
action<00:01:37.270> part<00:01:37.479> so<00:01:37.630> we'll<00:01:37.750> talk<00:01:37.869> about<00:01:37.930> those<00:01:38.290> in

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
action part so we'll talk about those in

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.969 
action part so we'll talk about those in
a<00:01:38.590> moment

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
a moment

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.030 
a moment
this<00:01:39.729> is<00:01:39.909> called<00:01:40.119> a<00:01:40.270> key<00:01:40.479> stop<00:01:40.750> it's<00:01:41.049> only<00:01:41.530> job

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
this is called a key stop it's only job

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.899 
this is called a key stop it's only job
in<00:01:42.340> life<00:01:42.610> is<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.060> keep<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.659> keys<00:01:43.899> from<00:01:44.909> wedging

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
in life is to keep the keys from wedging

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.880 
in life is to keep the keys from wedging
out<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.390> becoming<00:01:46.690> stuck<00:01:47.140> when<00:01:47.500> this<00:01:47.649> piano

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
out and becoming stuck when this piano

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.080 
out and becoming stuck when this piano
is<00:01:48.070> turned<00:01:48.520> on<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.840> spine<00:01:50.140> side<00:01:50.530> for<00:01:50.860> moving

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
is turned on the spine side for moving

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.300 
is turned on the spine side for moving
which<00:01:52.090> is<00:01:52.240> helping<00:01:52.539> as<00:01:52.780> a<00:01:52.810> move<00:01:53.110> so<00:01:53.860> while<00:01:54.130> it's

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
which is helping as a move so while it's

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.130 
which is helping as a move so while it's
in<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.549> piano<00:01:54.850> doesn't<00:01:55.539> really<00:01:55.690> do<00:01:55.840> think

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
in the piano doesn't really do think

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.620 
in the piano doesn't really do think
it's<00:01:56.229> very<00:01:56.289> important<00:01:57.159> before<00:01:57.280> piano<00:01:57.970> I<00:01:58.240> get

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
it's very important before piano I get

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.149 
it's very important before piano I get
lots<00:01:58.869> of<00:01:59.020> calls<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.500> straighten<00:01:59.799> out<00:01:59.890> keys

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
lots of calls to straighten out keys

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:09.960 
lots of calls to straighten out keys
because<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.899> wasn't<00:02:02.319> in<00:02:02.440> place<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:08.850> we<00:02:09.850> have

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
because that wasn't in place so we have

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.490 
because that wasn't in place so we have
to<00:02:10.060> make<00:02:10.149> sure<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.450> Hammers<00:02:10.840> are<00:02:10.989> catching

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
to make sure the Hammers are catching

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:22.350 
to make sure the Hammers are catching
under<00:02:11.800> what<00:02:11.950> we<00:02:12.040> call<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.370> stretcher<00:02:21.360> okay

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
under what we call the stretcher okay
