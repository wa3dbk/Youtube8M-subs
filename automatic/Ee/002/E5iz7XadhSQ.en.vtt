00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
the modern warfare 3 terminal plane so

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.089 
the modern warfare 3 terminal plane so
yeah<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.309> see<00:00:11.460> it<00:00:11.490> there<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:12.320> this<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.620> the

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
yeah you see it there and this is the

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.330 
yeah you see it there and this is the
easiest<00:00:14.670> way<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.360> get<00:00:15.990> onto<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.350> plane<00:00:16.800> solo

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
easiest way to get onto the plane solo

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.460 
easiest way to get onto the plane solo
so<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.390> don't<00:00:18.539> need<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.690> buddy<00:00:18.930> standing<00:00:19.320> right

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
so you don't need a buddy standing right

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.920 
so you don't need a buddy standing right
there<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.680> knife<00:00:20.340> lunge<00:00:20.550> up<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> moon<00:00:21.420> and

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
there and knife lunge up to the moon and

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.290 
there and knife lunge up to the moon and
land<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> plane<00:00:22.970> all<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.090> need<00:00:24.269> is

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
land on the plane all you need is

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.750 
land on the plane all you need is
yourself<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.109> yourself<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.340> it's<00:00:26.640> really

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
yourself and yourself so it's really

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.330 
yourself and yourself so it's really
easy<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:27.500> actually<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.680> not<00:00:28.769> really<00:00:29.310> easy

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
easy to do actually it's not really easy

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.370 
easy to do actually it's not really easy
to<00:00:29.609> do<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.910> does<00:00:30.060> take<00:00:30.210> some<00:00:30.570> practice<00:00:30.630> but

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
to do it does take some practice but

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.530 
to do it does take some practice but
after<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> while<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.850> really<00:00:33.149> get<00:00:33.270> used<00:00:33.420> to

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
after a while you can really get used to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
ledge here and run against it and then

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.940 
ledge here and run against it and then
