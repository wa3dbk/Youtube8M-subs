this<00:01:07.250> isn't<00:01:07.549> an<00:01:07.610> especially<00:01:08.149> large<00:01:08.360> blender

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
this isn't an especially large blender

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.510 
this isn't an especially large blender
in<00:01:09.020> terms<00:01:09.289> of<00:01:09.469> the<00:01:09.590> width<00:01:09.829> that<00:01:10.070> it<00:01:10.280> will<00:01:10.369> take

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
in terms of the width that it will take

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.130 
in terms of the width that it will take
up<00:01:10.700> on<00:01:10.820> your<00:01:10.939> countertop<00:01:11.420> but<00:01:11.570> it<00:01:11.689> is<00:01:11.810> taller

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
up on your countertop but it is taller

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.959 
up on your countertop but it is taller
and<00:01:12.590> this<00:01:12.799> has<00:01:12.979> a<00:01:13.009> lot<00:01:13.219> to<00:01:13.250> do<00:01:13.490> with<00:01:13.579> the<00:01:13.759> shape

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
and this has a lot to do with the shape

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:15.399 
and this has a lot to do with the shape
of<00:01:14.149> the<00:01:14.299> pitcher<00:01:14.659> we<00:01:14.990> were<00:01:15.140> originally

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
of the pitcher we were originally

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.980 
of the pitcher we were originally
skeptical<00:01:16.280> about<00:01:17.060> this<00:01:17.270> shape<00:01:17.539> because<00:01:17.840> it's

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
skeptical about this shape because it's

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.209 
skeptical about this shape because it's
kind<00:01:18.170> of<00:01:18.289> old-fashioned<00:01:18.920> E<00:01:19.009> and<00:01:19.159> that's

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
kind of old-fashioned E and that's

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.160 
kind of old-fashioned E and that's

have but the way the shape of this
blender<00:01:27.409> works<00:01:27.710> is<00:01:27.979> that<00:01:28.100> it's<00:01:28.219> very<00:01:28.280> narrow

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
blender works is that it's very narrow
