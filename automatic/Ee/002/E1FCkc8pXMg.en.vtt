pretty good high drop chance this is a

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.530 
pretty good high drop chance this is a

one<00:03:02.660> does<00:03:02.840> this<00:03:03.019> anymore<00:03:03.410> so<00:03:03.620> fires<00:03:03.890> really

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
one does this anymore so fires really

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.970 
one does this anymore so fires really
high<00:03:04.519> on<00:03:04.790> my<00:03:04.970> server<00:03:05.380> for<00:03:06.380> most<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.769> time
