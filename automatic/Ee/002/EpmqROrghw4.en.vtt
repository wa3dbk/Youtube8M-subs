 dear friends glad to welcome you 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:13.070
 sports nutrition store is a sport 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.469
 located at two addresses shopping 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.460
 complex festival subsided number 313 and 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.989
 shopping complex 3 ways number 202 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.150
 come we will be glad because you 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:26.310
 help you do it right 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.170
 and today we will talk about this sports 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.820
 nutrition as a new import component and how 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.740
 use it for what it is and what 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.100
 these are what basically you and gibson 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.079
 let's start with syntrax 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.629
 Here is such a wonderful soft 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.879
 the package is called this drug 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.430
 trophix trophix is â€‹â€‹a lot of component to 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.489
 in which there are certain types 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.449
 protein such as waterproofing concentrate 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.400
 egg vodka and kozin for what 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.769
 need several types of protein in principle in 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.720
 your sports cocktails to 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.180
 get as many amino acids as possible 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.269
 for a certain period well, for example 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.430
 as it basically works 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.760
 naturally you throw the usual 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.430
 serum before you start to write you 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.159
 on running exactly well minutes 2015 stomach 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.619
 in principle, then on the splits muscles 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.990
 caretakers with amino acids and more 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.390
 In principle, nothing happens as 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.509
 here in addition to serum there Kozin 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.520
 which is split 8 hours and personal 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.940
 spending year split too enough 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.550
 305 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.250
 cheese I roll the fastest waterproofing 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.640
 other other types of protein 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.440
 accordingly your body 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.020
 fueled throughout the day 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.930
 amino acids it is saturated with them 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.360
 time each protein there is his 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.980
 degrees of exemption for example kozin he 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.900
 hours 8 are released respectively 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.330
 about 8 hours feed your body 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.070
 protein 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.520
 constant saturation with this in this and 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.580
 good many component when in it to her 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.500
 joke means the differences between 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.680
 Components in that and in what there his 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.180
 components exist fuck 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.070
 in addition to some components 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.170
 slightly more carbohydrates than the rest 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.890
 Well, actually further we are all 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.300
 Consider the following such 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.030
 wonderful beautiful blue butterfly 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.960
 rest of nutrition pro romix means 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:24.910
 besides the fact that he exists here 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.830
 concentrate isolate yes and kozin I mean three 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.240
 squirrel species yes here listed with you 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.709
 four types of protein 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.540
 here we have 3, respectively , and then 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.340
 as far as carbohydrates is concerned 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.410
 sugars are about the traffic itself 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.190
 it seems that there are 4 grams of carbohydrate 4 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.770
 grams of sugar rush too 43 mean 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.890
 these things are more or less similar 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.150
 again here a little more 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.880
 types of protein it will accordingly 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.140
 a little more split too i don't 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.910
 saying that this is a bad drug 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.040
 games just about what and they 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.880
 leg there is a difference therefore and 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.360
 next contempt next but not 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.360
 by value 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.780
 multicomponent protein and this mass 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.720
 Ufa Navsky kombat means that he has 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.930
 included in the composition and leaves 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.960
 concentrate isolate waterproofing target 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.380
 apple casein and egg protein also 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.330
 exists here in glutamine and hoods 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.370
 dishes need amino acid which 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.610
 responsible for the regeneration of muscle tissue 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.470
 for recovery e d grab need for 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.510
 so that your muscles are not destroyed not 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.450
 helps to make oskol quality he 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.850
 helps build muscle mass here 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.160
 The advantages of the battalion commander are that he has 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.609
 There is even before Sasha besides traffic 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.870
 connecting 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.959
 promise yes that is in each bank 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.079
 significant advantages 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:53.219
 own says 5 grams of carbohydrates 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:55.560
 2 grams of sugar 25 grams of protein but 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:59.489
 principle, the composition is more or less the same 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.829
 yes they have the last bank for today but 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:06.930
 again did not mark it Dima then 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:11.700
 Yezovsky fusion 7 than he is good means 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:14.189
 he has 11 grams of carbohydrates 23 grams 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.269
 squirrel also exists to be sashky and all 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:22.340
 seven types of protein namely namely 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:27.960
 concentrate isolate milk protein kozin 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:31.320
 egg hydra isolate well various peptides 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.590
 yes, too, for the assimilation of us that muscle is a rape 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.680
 good than this drug 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.599
 good because he has 11 grams of voice 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.050
 ate more carbohydrates in order than here 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.870
 in these here 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:47.159
 products again who is good to whom 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.720
 bad it all depends on your given 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.740
 preparing your being and rudely 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.080
 speaking gaining weight 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.199
 there are and they are going to fit a lot more 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.729
 than the same traffic disputes xiii battalion commander 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.539
 because their less carbohydrates 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.500
 if you do not need weight gain when 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.129
 can look at 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.020
 he was hot 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.459
 for mass set in this case requests 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.419
 for me yes now I told you 

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:12.539
 yes here are the masses set 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:15.029
 we have oil higher for the period so I would all 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.709
 I see myself 7 these are my recommendations to find 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:18.589
 We who want to pick up themselves but not 

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:21.779
 on practical again here is sahara 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:23.929
 sahara is all about money 11 grams 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:25.919
 carbohydrate and 23 grams of protein 

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:28.830
 come to our sports store
