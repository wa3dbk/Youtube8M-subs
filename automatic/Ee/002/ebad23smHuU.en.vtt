do obviously you want them facing

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.240 
do obviously you want them facing
outwards<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:28.390> far<00:00:28.689> end<00:00:28.900> of<00:00:29.050> the<00:00:29.199> chains<00:00:29.470> just

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
outwards the far end of the chains just

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.130 
outwards the far end of the chains just
has<00:00:30.430> normal<00:00:30.820> chain<00:00:31.060> link<00:00:31.330> ends<00:00:31.750> nothing

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
has normal chain link ends nothing

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.920 
has normal chain link ends nothing
special<00:00:32.699> this<00:00:33.699> end<00:00:34.090> has<00:00:34.360> this<00:00:34.930> cam<00:00:35.260> hook<00:00:35.590> as

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
special this end has this cam hook as

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.310 
special this end has this cam hook as
well<00:00:37.930> as<00:00:38.200> a<00:00:38.230> regular<00:00:38.770> hook<00:00:38.950> I<00:00:40.050> typically<00:00:41.050> put

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
well as a regular hook I typically put

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.540 
well as a regular hook I typically put
the<00:00:41.469> cam<00:00:41.710> hook<00:00:42.040> on<00:00:42.219> the<00:00:42.309> inside<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:45.070> I've<00:00:45.370> got

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
the cam hook on the inside so I've got

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.170 
the cam hook on the inside so I've got
the<00:00:45.730> chains<00:00:46.000> laid<00:00:46.300> out<00:00:46.510> make<00:00:47.290> sure<00:00:47.559> there's<00:00:47.800> no

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the chains laid out make sure there's no

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.420 
the chains laid out make sure there's no
twists<00:00:49.180> or<00:00:49.329> snags<00:00:49.719> or<00:00:49.930> tangles<00:00:50.410> so<00:00:50.649> what<00:00:51.340> I'm

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
twists or snags or tangles so what I'm

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.209 
twists or snags or tangles so what I'm
going<00:00:51.640> to<00:00:51.670> do<00:00:51.879> is<00:00:52.180> carefully<00:00:52.570> pick<00:00:52.989> them<00:00:53.200> up

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.020 

lay<00:00:57.219> them<00:00:57.399> over<00:00:57.520> the<00:00:57.730> tire<00:00:59.370> they<00:01:00.370> typically<00:01:00.789> go

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
lay them over the tire they typically go

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.439 
lay them over the tire they typically go
on<00:01:01.180> really<00:01:01.510> nicely<00:01:02.340> again<00:01:03.340> I<00:01:03.489> have<00:01:03.609> the<00:01:03.820> rebar

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
on really nicely again I have the rebar

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.130 
on really nicely again I have the rebar
cleats<00:01:04.809> facing<00:01:05.320> outward<00:01:06.899> making<00:01:07.899> sure

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
cleats facing outward making sure

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:19.100 
cleats facing outward making sure
everything<00:01:08.680> is<00:01:09.299> looking<00:01:10.299> good

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:28.920 

okay<00:01:22.050> now<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:26.320> hook<00:01:26.560> on<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.860> front<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:28.750> going

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
okay now this hook on the front is going

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.210 
okay now this hook on the front is going
to<00:01:28.990> hook<00:01:29.170> over<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.620> this<00:01:29.770> side<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:31.840> that<00:01:32.220> now

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
to hook over to this side like that now

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.430 
to hook over to this side like that now
you<00:01:33.940> see<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.510> can<00:01:34.690> put<00:01:34.840> it<00:01:34.960> in<00:01:35.110> different

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
you see you can put it in different

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.770 
you see you can put it in different
positions

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
positions

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.000 
positions
obviously<00:01:37.780> that's<00:01:37.960> way<00:01:38.230> too<00:01:38.260> loose<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.950> I'm

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
obviously that's way too loose so I'm

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.390 
obviously that's way too loose so I'm
going<00:01:42.160> to<00:01:42.220> hook<00:01:42.310> it<00:01:42.430> up<00:01:42.550> here<00:01:42.820> that's<00:01:43.060> better

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
going to hook it up here that's better

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.130 
going to hook it up here that's better
now<00:01:45.400> remember<00:01:45.940> when<00:01:46.150> I<00:01:46.180> tighten<00:01:46.900> up<00:01:46.960> the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
now remember when I tighten up the

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.350 
now remember when I tighten up the
backside<00:01:47.620> it's<00:01:48.520> going<00:01:48.730> to<00:01:48.790> tighten<00:01:49.150> this<00:01:49.180> up

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
backside it's going to tighten this up

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.900 
backside it's going to tighten this up
more<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.920> let's<00:01:51.160> go<00:01:51.310> ahead<00:01:51.370> and<00:01:51.550> take<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.700> look

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
more so let's go ahead and take a look

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.860 
more so let's go ahead and take a look
at<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.150> backside<00:01:52.830> so<00:01:53.830> I've<00:01:53.950> got<00:01:54.100> my<00:01:54.250> cam<00:01:54.520> Huck

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
at the backside so I've got my cam Huck

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.110 
at the backside so I've got my cam Huck
and<00:01:55.870> my<00:01:56.080> regular<00:01:56.260> end<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:57.430> I<00:01:57.520> need<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.850> choose

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
and my regular end and I need to choose

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.060 
and my regular end and I need to choose
where<00:01:58.720> I'm<00:01:58.840> going<00:01:59.050> to<00:01:59.110> position<00:01:59.260> it<00:02:01.860> which<00:02:02.860> can

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
where I'm going to position it which can

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.719 
where I'm going to position it which can
be<00:02:03.190> tricky<00:02:03.990> but<00:02:05.010> I'm<00:02:06.010> going<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.280> try<00:02:06.460> four

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
be tricky but I'm going to try four

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:18.750 
be tricky but I'm going to try four
right<00:02:06.850> here<00:02:17.010> yeah<00:02:18.010> that's<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.370> little<00:02:18.490> too

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
right here yeah that's a little too

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.290 
right here yeah that's a little too
tight<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:19.240> I'll<00:02:19.330> go<00:02:19.540> back<00:02:19.750> one<00:02:20.020> link<00:02:21.120> see<00:02:22.120> if<00:02:22.209> I

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
tight so I'll go back one link see if I

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.970 
tight so I'll go back one link see if I
can<00:02:22.480> get<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:22.720> through<00:02:22.750> there<00:02:23.140> okay<00:02:23.320> goes

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
can get it through there okay goes

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:32.420 
can get it through there okay goes
through<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:26.200> now<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:27.670> fold<00:02:27.940> your<00:02:28.090> cam<00:02:28.450> back

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.130 

like<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:33.970> then<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.300> slide<00:02:34.630> this<00:02:34.930> little

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
like that and then you slide this little

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.060 
like that and then you slide this little
collar<00:02:35.530> over<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:37.170> like<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.680> holds<00:02:38.980> it

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
collar over it like that and it holds it

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.300 
collar over it like that and it holds it
in<00:02:39.190> place<00:02:40.110> now<00:02:41.110> see<00:02:41.650> these<00:02:41.890> are<00:02:42.040> kind<00:02:42.220> of

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
in place now see these are kind of

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.470 
in place now see these are kind of
hanging<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.670> little<00:02:42.790> loose<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:45.120> might<00:02:46.120> decide

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
hanging a little loose so I might decide

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.170 
hanging a little loose so I might decide
to<00:02:46.780> go<00:02:46.989> around<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:47.590> adjust<00:02:48.070> them<00:02:48.280> typically

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
to go around and adjust them typically

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.940 
to go around and adjust them typically
after<00:02:49.450> you<00:02:49.720> drive<00:02:50.019> on<00:02:50.230> them<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:50.560> spin<00:02:50.800> them<00:02:50.920> a

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
after you drive on them and spin them a

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.550 
after you drive on them and spin them a
little<00:02:51.310> bit<00:02:51.489> they'll<00:02:52.209> loosen<00:02:52.660> up<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.200> tension

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
little bit they'll loosen up the tension

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.860 
little bit they'll loosen up the tension
will<00:02:53.680> work<00:02:53.890> out<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.400> then<00:02:55.030> it'll<00:02:55.420> be<00:02:55.480> loose

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
will work out and then it'll be loose

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.630 
will work out and then it'll be loose
and<00:02:56.230> then<00:02:56.350> you<00:02:56.440> can<00:02:56.650> go<00:02:56.800> in<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.220> you<00:02:57.280> can<00:02:57.459> move

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
and then you can go in and you can move

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.050 
and then you can go in and you can move
this<00:02:57.820> cam<00:02:58.090> up<00:02:58.360> one<00:02:58.570> more<00:02:58.810> notch<00:02:59.250> but<00:03:00.250> there's

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
this cam up one more notch but there's

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.550 
this cam up one more notch but there's
another<00:03:01.360> way<00:03:01.600> that<00:03:01.630> we're<00:03:01.900> going<00:03:02.019> to<00:03:02.080> tension

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
another way that we're going to tension

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.540 
another way that we're going to tension
these<00:03:02.709> which<00:03:02.920> I'll<00:03:03.100> show<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.310> right<00:03:03.489> now<00:03:05.550> back

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
these which I'll show you right now back

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.280 
these which I'll show you right now back
around<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.239> front<00:03:07.269> side<00:03:07.780> here<00:03:08.080> we're

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
around to the front side here we're

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.750 
around to the front side here we're
going<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.470> go<00:03:08.650> ahead<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:08.920> tension<00:03:09.310> these<00:03:09.430> up<00:03:09.640> a

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
going to go ahead and tension these up a

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.240 
going to go ahead and tension these up a
little<00:03:09.940> bit<00:03:10.650> these<00:03:11.650> are<00:03:11.709> just<00:03:12.070> ordinary

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
little bit these are just ordinary

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.930 
little bit these are just ordinary
rubber<00:03:13.410> cords<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:17.070> this<00:03:18.070> is<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.550> excess

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
rubber cords and this is the excess

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.259 
rubber cords and this is the excess
chain<00:03:19.269> for<00:03:19.630> when<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:20.310> chose<00:03:21.310> where<00:03:21.640> what<00:03:22.030> length

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
chain for when I chose where what length

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.570 
chain for when I chose where what length
to<00:03:22.510> make<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:23.470> I'm<00:03:23.830> just<00:03:23.890> going<00:03:24.250> to<00:03:24.370> go<00:03:24.519> ahead

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
to make it so I'm just going to go ahead

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.410 
to make it so I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:03:25.829> go<00:03:26.829> through<00:03:26.859> there<00:03:27.310> so<00:03:28.209> it's<00:03:28.359> not

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
and go through there so it's not

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.580 
and go through there so it's not
flopping<00:03:28.989> around

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
flopping around

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.770 
flopping around
and<00:03:30.800> then<00:03:30.920> come<00:03:31.160> up<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:31.790> opposite<00:03:32.360> side

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
and then come up to the opposite side

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.230 
and then come up to the opposite side
like<00:03:33.430> that<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:36.550> I'll<00:03:37.550> put<00:03:37.760> another<00:03:37.880> one<00:03:38.209> over

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
like that and I'll put another one over

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:47.110 
like that and I'll put another one over
here<00:03:43.420> like<00:03:44.420> that<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.890> that's<00:03:46.310> going<00:03:46.520> to<00:03:46.610> help

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
here like that and that's going to help

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.930 
here like that and that's going to help
keep<00:03:47.270> our<00:03:47.630> chains<00:03:47.989> tight<00:03:48.430> it's<00:03:49.430> going<00:03:49.640> to<00:03:49.700> pull

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
keep our chains tight it's going to pull

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.449 
keep our chains tight it's going to pull
the<00:03:50.360> backside<00:03:50.840> tight<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.500> once<00:03:51.890> things<00:03:52.190> start

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
the backside tight to once things start

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.479 
the backside tight to once things start
moving<00:03:52.760> around<00:03:53.290> and<00:03:54.290> I<00:03:55.010> don't<00:03:55.069> have<00:03:55.370> them

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
moving around and I don't have them

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:56.949 
moving around and I don't have them
right<00:03:55.520> now<00:03:55.850> I<00:03:55.910> need<00:03:56.120> to<00:03:56.239> go<00:03:56.360> to<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.600> store<00:03:56.840> and

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
right now I need to go to the store and

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.900 
right now I need to go to the store and
grab<00:03:57.110> them<00:03:57.410> but<00:03:57.620> typically<00:03:58.010> I<00:03:58.130> put<00:03:58.459> two<00:03:58.700> more

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
grab them but typically I put two more

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.970 
grab them but typically I put two more
that<00:03:59.600> way<00:03:59.750> I've<00:03:59.870> got<00:04:00.020> plenty<00:04:00.230> of<00:04:00.380> tension<00:04:00.860> on

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
that way I've got plenty of tension on

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.330 
that way I've got plenty of tension on
here<00:04:01.280> these<00:04:02.120> rubber<00:04:03.110> bungees<00:04:03.650> tend<00:04:04.010> to<00:04:04.130> rot

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
here these rubber bungees tend to rot

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.150 
here these rubber bungees tend to rot
out<00:04:04.370> after<00:04:05.000> one<00:04:05.180> winter's<00:04:05.600> worth<00:04:05.810> of<00:04:06.050> use<00:04:06.290> when

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
out after one winter's worth of use when

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.979 
out after one winter's worth of use when
I<00:04:07.190> took<00:04:07.310> them<00:04:07.580> off<00:04:07.790> last<00:04:08.090> year<00:04:08.360> they<00:04:08.540> were<00:04:08.600> just

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
I took them off last year they were just

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.560 
I took them off last year they were just
totally<00:04:09.980> cracked<00:04:10.340> they<00:04:10.580> hadn't<00:04:10.880> broken<00:04:11.150> but

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
totally cracked they hadn't broken but

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.840 
totally cracked they hadn't broken but
they<00:04:11.810> were<00:04:11.870> not<00:04:12.140> reusable<00:04:12.709> these<00:04:13.519> are<00:04:13.700> pretty

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
they were not reusable these are pretty

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.940 
they were not reusable these are pretty
cheap<00:04:14.150> they're<00:04:14.450> about<00:04:14.660> a<00:04:14.690> buck<00:04:14.959> 25<00:04:15.530> each

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
cheap they're about a buck 25 each

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.650 
cheap they're about a buck 25 each
so<00:04:16.070> definitely<00:04:16.640> an<00:04:16.910> expense<00:04:17.329> that's

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
so definitely an expense that's

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.600 
so definitely an expense that's
worthwhile<00:04:18.609> help<00:04:19.609> your<00:04:19.820> chain<00:04:20.030> stay<00:04:20.359> on<00:04:20.570> good

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
worthwhile help your chain stay on good

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.640 
worthwhile help your chain stay on good
make<00:04:22.610> sure<00:04:22.790> you<00:04:22.910> don't<00:04:23.030> get<00:04:23.240> stuck<00:04:23.650> wind

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
make sure you don't get stuck wind

this<00:04:27.200> video<00:04:27.560> on<00:04:27.919> installing<00:04:28.310> tire<00:04:28.700> chains<00:04:29.060> was

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
this video on installing tire chains was

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.870 
this video on installing tire chains was
useful<00:04:29.720> as<00:04:29.930> you<00:04:30.560> can<00:04:30.740> see<00:04:30.950> I<00:04:30.979> did<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.460> with<00:04:31.639> the

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
useful as you can see I did it with the

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.719 
useful as you can see I did it with the
truck<00:04:32.120> jacked<00:04:32.570> up<00:04:32.810> you<00:04:33.740> can<00:04:34.010> do<00:04:34.250> it<00:04:34.400> with<00:04:34.580> the

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
truck jacked up you can do it with the

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.570 
truck jacked up you can do it with the
truck<00:04:34.910> arm<00:04:35.300> on<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:36.260> ground<00:04:36.530> you<00:04:37.160> lay<00:04:37.400> the

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
truck arm on the ground you lay the

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.300 
truck arm on the ground you lay the
chains<00:04:37.880> out<00:04:38.120> you<00:04:38.690> back<00:04:38.930> the<00:04:39.169> truck<00:04:39.410> over<00:04:39.830> and

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
chains out you back the truck over and

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.390 
chains out you back the truck over and
then<00:04:40.790> you<00:04:40.910> pull<00:04:41.120> them<00:04:41.270> up<00:04:41.390> over<00:04:41.600> and<00:04:42.310> put<00:04:43.310> them

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
then you pull them up over and put them

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.029 
then you pull them up over and put them
on<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.640> same<00:04:43.820> way<00:04:44.000> that<00:04:44.150> I<00:04:44.300> did<00:04:44.710> thank<00:04:45.710> you<00:04:45.800> for
