00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
highlights you can do exactly the same

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.250 
highlights you can do exactly the same
usually<00:00:53.460> selecting<00:00:54.059> two<00:00:54.390> different<00:00:54.899> colors

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
usually selecting two different colors

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.950 
usually selecting two different colors
very<00:00:56.010> simple<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.000> let's<00:00:57.180> jump<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:57.930> a

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
very simple so let's jump in and have a

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.709 
very simple so let's jump in and have a
look<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.289> see<00:00:58.469> how<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.739> actually<00:00:59.129> works

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
look and see how that actually works

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.450 
look and see how that actually works
looking<00:01:00.719> at<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.960> image<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.340> was

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
looking at this image just here if I was

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.979 
looking at this image just here if I was
to<00:01:02.550> take<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.879> highlight<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.570> I'm<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:03.930> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
to take the highlight and I'm going to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.740 
to take the highlight and I'm going to
choose<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.189> middle<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.820> green<00:01:06.540> I

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
choose in the middle here the green I

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.630 
choose in the middle here the green I
think<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.260> turquoise<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:08.580> I

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
think that is the turquoise and then I

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.609 
think that is the turquoise and then I
move<00:01:08.850> their<00:01:09.090> saturation<00:01:09.869> bar<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.229> what<00:01:10.500> you're

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619

blue<00:01:49.799> color<00:01:50.840> okay<00:01:51.840> now<00:01:52.290> I'm<00:01:52.380> going<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.590> drop

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
blue color okay now I'm going to drop

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.980 
blue color okay now I'm going to drop
the<00:01:52.890> saturation<00:01:53.310> down<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.820> these<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the saturation down on these and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.590 
the saturation down on these and
basically<00:01:55.549> now<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.180> fantastic

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
basically now we have this fantastic

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.679 
basically now we have this fantastic
image<00:01:58.530> which<00:01:59.490> has<00:01:59.520> been<00:01:59.700> completely<00:01:59.850> changed

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
image which has been completely changed

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.010 
image which has been completely changed
using<00:02:01.020> split<00:02:01.259> toning<00:02:01.820> so<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.060> saturation<00:02:03.270> is

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
using split toning so the saturation is

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.980 
using split toning so the saturation is
how<00:02:04.380> strong<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.790> color<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.840> you've

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
how strong the color that you've

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.770 
how strong the color that you've
selected<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:08.160> those<00:02:08.280> areas<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.599> is

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
selected is in those areas so this is

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.290 
selected is in those areas so this is
the<00:02:09.899> highlights<00:02:10.289> how<00:02:10.470> strong<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.459> yellow<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.180> in

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
the highlights how strong a yellow is in

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.240 
the highlights how strong a yellow is in
the<00:02:12.390> highlights<00:02:12.810> same<00:02:13.530> for<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:13.980> show

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
the highlights same for the show

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.940 
the highlights same for the show
the<00:02:14.880> saturation<00:02:15.360> how<00:02:15.630> strong<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.680> blue

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
the saturation how strong is is blue

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.460 
the saturation how strong is is blue
going<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.610> be<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.940> shadows<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.510> if<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.260> put

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
going to be in the shadows so if I put

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.070 
going to be in the shadows so if I put
them<00:02:19.590> both<00:02:19.710> 100%<00:02:20.520> yet<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:20.910> very<00:02:20.940> harsh<00:02:21.750> and

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
them both 100% yet is very harsh and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.290 
them both 100% yet is very harsh and
dramatic<00:02:22.650> look<00:02:22.920> but<00:02:23.490> not<00:02:23.700> something<00:02:24.000> I'm

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
dramatic look but not something I'm

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.030 
dramatic look but not something I'm
looking<00:02:24.480> for<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.530> I'm<00:02:25.620> going<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.800> bring<00:02:25.920> those

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
looking for so I'm going to bring those

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.070 
looking for so I'm going to bring those
back<00:02:26.280> down<00:02:26.490> now<00:02:27.150> there's<00:02:27.330> one<00:02:27.480> slider<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:28.020> we

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
back down now there's one slider that we

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.810 
back down now there's one slider that we
haven't<00:02:28.500> looked<00:02:28.710> at<00:02:28.860> yet<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.250> that's<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.580> one

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
haven't looked at yet and that's the one

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.070 
haven't looked at yet and that's the one
in<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.030> middle<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:30.660> called<00:02:30.930> the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
in the middle and this is called the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.100 
in the middle and this is called the
balance<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:32.490> by<00:02:32.610> moving<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:33.060> slider<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.630> can

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
balance so by moving this slider I can

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.250 
balance so by moving this slider I can
basically<00:02:34.850> manipulate<00:02:35.850> where<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.780> center

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
basically manipulate where that center

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260 
basically manipulate where that center
point<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.740> so<00:02:38.340> if<00:02:38.460> I<00:02:38.580> go<00:02:38.730> all<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.970> way<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
point is so if I go all the way to the

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.570 
point is so if I go all the way to the
left<00:02:39.570> then<00:02:40.140> most<00:02:40.500> of<00:02:40.740> my<00:02:40.860> image<00:02:41.130> is<00:02:41.280> going<00:02:41.490> to

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
left then most of my image is going to

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.580 
left then most of my image is going to
fit<00:02:41.760> into<00:02:41.940> my<00:02:42.150> shadows<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:43.050> move<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.470> the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
fit into my shadows and move it to the

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.890 
fit into my shadows and move it to the
right<00:02:43.860> then<00:02:44.430> most<00:02:44.820> of<00:02:45.030> my<00:02:45.180> image<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.630> going<00:02:45.810> to

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
right then most of my image is going to

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.170 
right then most of my image is going to
fit<00:02:46.050> into<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.380> highlights<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.490> anywhere<00:02:48.090> in

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
fit into the highlights and anywhere in

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.120 
fit into the highlights and anywhere in
the<00:02:48.240> scale<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.840> between<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.010> is

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
the scale in between so that is

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.440 
the scale in between so that is
different<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.850> saturation<00:02:52.550> sliders<00:02:53.550> okay

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
different to the saturation sliders okay

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.230 
different to the saturation sliders okay
so<00:02:55.290> I'm<00:02:55.740> going<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.040> do<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> quick<00:02:56.610> edit<00:02:56.790> here<00:02:57.120> and

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
so I'm going to do a quick edit here and

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.000 
so I'm going to do a quick edit here and
we're<00:02:57.360> going<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.600> see<00:02:57.810> exactly<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.380> mean<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.680> kind

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
we're going to see exactly I mean I kind

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.980 
we're going to see exactly I mean I kind
of<00:02:59.130> like<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.550> how<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.850> then<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.480> boost<00:03:00.780> this

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
of like it how it is then a boost this

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.070 
of like it how it is then a boost this
saturation<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.940> both<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.150> those<00:03:03.300> sliders<00:03:03.630> and

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
saturation of both of those sliders and

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.900 
saturation of both of those sliders and
I<00:03:04.260> usually<00:03:04.680> slide<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.100> slightly<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.880> the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
I usually slide it slightly to the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.730 
I usually slide it slightly to the
highlights<00:03:06.540> because<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:07.020> like<00:03:07.200> my<00:03:07.380> highlights

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
highlights because I like my highlights

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.100 
highlights because I like my highlights
to<00:03:07.860> be<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:07.980> little<00:03:08.340> bit<00:03:08.490> brighter<00:03:09.270> and<00:03:09.660> fresher

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
to be a little bit brighter and fresher

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.010 
to be a little bit brighter and fresher
with<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.100> kind<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.490> it<00:03:11.610> feel<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.090> in<00:03:12.690> just

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
with this kind of it feel and in just

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.530 
with this kind of it feel and in just
moments<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.620> think<00:03:13.890> we've<00:03:14.010> created<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:15.240> kind

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
moments I think we've created this kind

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.460 
moments I think we've created this kind
of<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:16.820> high-fashion<00:03:17.820> look<00:03:18.300> using<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.260> split
