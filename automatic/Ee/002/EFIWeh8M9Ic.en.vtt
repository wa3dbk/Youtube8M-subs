00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.730
 Despair and helplessness 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.650
 They take over gray one who denounces that their 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.300
 daughter of only 10 years tried 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.970
 take their own lives as a result of 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.640
 bullying that suffers in your school and this 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.099
 resorted to my bad teachers and the 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.619
 they have not paid attention to me but 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.960
 he argued that I hit his daughter and 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.450
 that's a lie that threatened my daughter 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.220
 because if she entered the campus no longer 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.410
 I was going to go out again my daughter has 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.720
 tried to commit suicide because of 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.280
 bullying today the parties come to the forum 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.960
 looking for a solution to this 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.400
 problematic that has affected your 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.040
 community they discriminate me by their color 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.500
 even this color for its color for its 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.810
 skin color discriminated me because it is 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.850
 to die in this arena just like me 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.560
 they are summer and in the art you have to see 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.020
 I say we have all blood indicates in the 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.720
 exile in that color not here I am 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.520
 supporting the Grisel friend because it is not 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.460
 just that they discriminate by their color of 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.339
 skin at school the ones who move there is 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.260
 Mrs. Nelly and Mrs. Gloria and they 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.840
 supports the director to make his life 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.960
 impossible to my friend Grisel and her son 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.080
 this is what Grisel wrote and that 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.760
 We also shared the director of the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.500
 school who did an analysis 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.030
 psychological of the girl right now footprint 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.760
 let's go with Juan Carlos who already 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.280
 You met your baby 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.160
 and he me and already practiced with her saw 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.400
 also this this messenger notice nothing 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.670
 is that my story is blurred 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.070
 It's very sad because my dad is going to leave 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.610
 of the house for some problems of my mom 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:46.420
 and from my dad and as always the house there 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.009
 I really wanted a lot of trouble 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.000
 maybe to end my life I'm not going to 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.820
 go into detail for the same reason 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.710
 problems but my mom says I 'm going 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.409
 to veracruz as with my grandma so that 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.600
 Do not be sad, that's why I tell my mom 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.149
 that does not run to my dad from the house and my 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.670
 family be like before 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.789
 With much sadness I have to comment 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.929
 how good jamie is a girl who was raped 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.630
 in several aspects 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.310
 obviously the family environment lady 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.019
 gray I'm sorry to say yes it's something 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.970
 that is affecting your 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.250
 daughter tell me about the episode in the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.160
 who tries to take his own life tells me 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.010
 the way in which she is present in the 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.720
 discussions among you he finds out about 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.150
 this other third person in the relationship 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.680
 of you and I say this kind of thing a 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.840
 10 year old child should not be 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.420
 living a 10-year-old child should be 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.760
 happy must be playing is entitled to 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.430
 a nice family environment that what 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.799
 make it grow and make it love in place 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.489
 of underestimating it now something good 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.769
 important I commented this jamie 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.870
 also forgiveness is the bullying that she 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.450
 is suffering in school is 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.090
 awesome I can not even tell 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.030
 the words with which they refer to 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.250
 because they are very high in volume 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.920
 forgiveness tone and it hurts me that a person 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.900
 as nice as her and so nice 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.659
 that he told me with tears in his 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.400
 eyes and open crying as we say in the 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.400
 I'm living north
