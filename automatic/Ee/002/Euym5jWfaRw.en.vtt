00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 and then they will not be okay and stay here 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.690
 It will be to warn you that you will not have 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.509
 video neither today nor tomorrow 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.920
 at least not videos and games when I 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.839
 I'll enjoy this video here too. 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.470
 to show you a place very 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.590
 cool 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.510
 I need to share this with you. 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.340
 I'm on top of one of the buildings 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.930
 new york highs the name of the building 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.789
 rockfeller center 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.160
 I think many of you already know the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.969
 that already came here and the name of the place 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.890
 it's specifically top of the rock 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:42.270
 lets go to what matters 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:46.980
 there was only for you this city â€‹â€‹if 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.910
 calls new york but for me until recently 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.680
 long time ago her name was liberty siri 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.379
 It's very funny because man 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.980
 This city is very big and very 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.719
 very big big you have no idea 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.320
 This is where I authored this part only. 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.500
 manhattan right manhattan is one of five 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.030
 of districts of new york 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.030
 the others are the Chilean bronks points 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.030
 brooklin 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.030
 I think this and left brooklin know 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.049
 some three times higher than in 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.320
 Manhattan 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.150
 You have no idea, it's too big. 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.729
 very large 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.880
 knows one thing by seeing the author of this 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.000
 building here seeing all these others 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.530
 I keep thinking, I have to have lots of 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.110
 courage to be a mere and now 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.630
 surely there has to be a lot for this 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.280
 Take courage, my god from heaven, just be 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.720
 very scary and I confess that I have 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.100
 a little afraid of height 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.820
 This is incredible here you can see 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.030
 The chrysler building back there is fine 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.280
 illuminated there in front of the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:05.189
 metlife up to 4 is called war on Haiti 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.840
 you can see why the image is 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.190
 it was very dark it 's obviously me 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.830
 I chose to come here at night because 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.900
 image is much more the vision is much more 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.910
 important of the night, right? 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.459
 although in the daytime you can see a lot 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.130
 It's better, and as you can see there 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.920
 back there on the orange background is the empire 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.819
 state building is that it is one of the symbols 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.280
 maxima of new york however that sees everything 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.500
 You can always go up there if you want backhand 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.610
 from the top hawks 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.130
 only here you will not see your own 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.319
 empire state being in seems to have 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.100
 can not live in peace 10 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.810
 That's why I think it's more interesting. 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.040
 come here on top of the rocks and pop rock 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.100

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.600
 event right 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.489

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.940

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.959

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.959

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.310
