one measure long which is of course four
beats<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.310> 4/4<00:01:32.760> time<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:34.320> we're<00:01:34.470> gonna<00:01:34.530> do

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
beats in 4/4 time so what we're gonna do

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.320 
beats in 4/4 time so what we're gonna do
is<00:01:34.980> to<00:01:35.130> make<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.400> easy<00:01:35.640> we're<00:01:35.940> going<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.180> look

is to make this easy we're going to look
at<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> first<00:01:36.870> two<00:01:37.230> groupings<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.950> sixteenth

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
at the first two groupings of sixteenth

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.120 
at the first two groupings of sixteenth
notes<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> measure<00:01:40.080> right<00:01:40.320> now<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.740> 1e<00:01:40.980> and

a<00:01:41.430> 2e<00:01:41.460> Enda<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.270> we're<00:01:42.690> just<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.020> break

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
a 2e Enda and we're just going to break

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.580 
a 2e Enda and we're just going to break
down<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.800> part<00:01:44.130> first<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:46.350> you're

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
down that part first so if you're

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
playing this measure

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.730 
playing this measure
we're<00:01:48.180> playing<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.600> first<00:01:48.780> two<00:01:49.080> groupings<00:01:49.470> of

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
we're playing the first two groupings of

00:01:49.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
we're playing the first two groupings of
sixteenth<00:01:50.729> notes<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.360> would<00:01:51.510> be<00:01:56.570> play<00:01:57.570> again

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.530 

one<00:02:02.760> more<00:02:02.910> time

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:17.360 

one<00:02:09.540> final<00:02:09.810> time<00:02:15.320> so<00:02:16.320> now<00:02:16.530> let's<00:02:16.860> look<00:02:16.950> at<00:02:17.190> the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
one final time so now let's look at the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.740 
one final time so now let's look at the
third<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.760> fourth<00:02:17.970> grouping<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.390> sixteenth

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
third and fourth grouping of sixteenth

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.780 
third and fourth grouping of sixteenth
notes<00:02:18.959> in<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.170> measure<00:02:19.290> three<00:02:19.920> E<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.100> four<00:02:20.520> E

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
notes in the measure three E and four E

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:42.560 
notes in the measure three E and four E
end<00:02:21.180> up<00:02:21.360> okay<00:02:21.959> so<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.380> would<00:02:22.500> be<00:02:35.269> again<00:02:41.570> one

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
end up okay so it would be again one

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:53.330 
end up okay so it would be again one
more<00:02:42.780> time<00:02:49.940> okay<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.720> now<00:02:52.070> put<00:02:53.070> them<00:02:53.220> together

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
more time okay so now put them together

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.160 
more time okay so now put them together
after<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.269> work<00:02:54.450> on<00:02:54.630> each<00:02:54.750> one<00:02:54.930> individually

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
after you work on each one individually

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:13.530 
after you work on each one individually
and<00:02:55.500> get<00:02:55.650> them<00:02:55.769> tight<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:57.150> have

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.910 

so<00:03:14.540> now<00:03:14.720> what<00:03:15.020> we're<00:03:15.110> gonna<00:03:15.200> do<00:03:15.410> is<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:15.890> just

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
take the two sections that we just

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.960 
take the two sections that we just
worked<00:03:18.020> on<00:03:18.200> combine<00:03:18.920> them<00:03:19.100> together<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.790> you

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
worked on combine them together and you

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:54.040

let me just demonstrate how the groove
goes<00:04:07.610> and<00:04:07.910> then<00:04:08.150> we'll<00:04:08.300> get<00:04:08.390> into<00:04:08.570> breaking<00:04:08.930> it

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
goes and then we'll get into breaking it

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:45.900 
goes and then we'll get into breaking it
down

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.120

that means
that<00:04:51.320> means<00:04:51.620> that<00:04:51.860> the<00:04:52.310> phrase<00:04:52.730> repeats<00:04:53.240> every

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
that means that the phrase repeats every

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.390 
that means that the phrase repeats every
two<00:04:53.840> measures<00:04:54.230> okay<00:04:54.620> it<00:04:54.740> takes<00:04:54.890> two<00:04:54.980> measures

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
two measures okay it takes two measures

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.460 
two measures okay it takes two measures
for<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.700> actual<00:04:56.300> phrase<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.410> be<00:04:57.530> completed<00:04:58.180> so

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
for the actual phrase to be completed so

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.270 
what we're going to do is we're going to
break<00:05:02.180> it<00:05:02.360> down<00:05:02.390> this<00:05:02.900> time<00:05:03.140> by<00:05:03.500> measure

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
break it down this time by measure

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
so first we'll do the first measure and

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.360 
so first we'll do the first measure and
the<00:05:06.290> second<00:05:06.620> measure<00:05:06.770> okay
