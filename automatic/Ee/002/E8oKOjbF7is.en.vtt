00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
one where you can like cast explosions

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.510 
one where you can like cast explosions
and<00:01:13.470> stuff<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.950> would<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.280> really

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
and stuff like that that would be really

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.630 
and stuff like that that would be really
cool<00:01:15.020> but<00:01:16.020> yeah<00:01:16.350> hopefully<00:01:16.920> he<00:01:17.460> does

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
cool but yeah hopefully he does

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.700 
cool but yeah hopefully he does
something<00:01:17.939> like<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.259> anyways<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.439> was<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
something like that anyways that was the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.330 
something like that anyways that was the
wind<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.540> fire<00:01:21.920> which<00:01:22.920> makes<00:01:23.159> sense

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
wind this is the fire which makes sense

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.310 
wind this is the fire which makes sense
or<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.820> would<00:01:23.909> be<00:01:23.939> buckets<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.509> lava<00:01:24.720> which<00:01:25.020> are

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
or it would be buckets of lava which are

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.609 
or it would be buckets of lava which are
harder<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:25.979> get<00:01:26.220> though<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:28.200> then<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.409> got<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
harder to get though and then we got the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.190 
harder to get though and then we got the
earth<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:30.000> we<00:01:30.299> got<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> water<00:01:30.780> which

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
earth and then we got the water which

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.700 
earth and then we got the water which
this<00:01:31.350> one<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.560> should<00:01:31.680> make<00:01:31.890> sense<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:33.710> yeah

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
this one I should make sense and yeah

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.399 
this one I should make sense and yeah
you<00:01:35.310> create<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.140> gives<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.320> your

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
you create the and it gives you your

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.789 
you create the and it gives you your
buckets<00:01:37.740> back<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.869> create<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
buckets back to and you create the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.600 
buckets back to and you create the
staffs<00:01:41.579> by<00:01:42.030> doing<00:01:42.509> something<00:01:42.869> like<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.610> you

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610

fire<00:02:13.390> staff<00:02:13.720> as<00:02:13.960> you<00:02:14.200> guys<00:02:14.380> might<00:02:14.800> know<00:02:15.010> it's

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
fire staff as you guys might know it's

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.970 
fire staff as you guys might know it's
either<00:02:15.490> going<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.700> add<00:02:15.820> either<00:02:16.060> fire<00:02:16.750> or

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
either going to add either fire or

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.320 
either going to add either fire or
shooting<00:02:17.980> fireball<00:02:18.580> which<00:02:18.880> it<00:02:19.030> adds<00:02:19.180> a

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
shooting fireball which it adds a

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.150 
shooting fireball which it adds a
shooting<00:02:19.630> fireball<00:02:20.020> so<00:02:20.260> that's<00:02:20.410> how<00:02:20.470> map<00:02:21.040> you

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
shooting fireball so that's how map you

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.820 
shooting fireball so that's how map you
about<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.490> adds<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.180> custom<00:02:22.690> picture<00:02:23.380> for<00:02:23.800> the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
about that adds a custom picture for the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.510 
about that adds a custom picture for the
fireball<00:02:24.370> which<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:24.910> definitely<00:02:25.390> needed<00:02:26.520> or

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
fireball which is definitely needed or

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.920 
fireball which is definitely needed or
else<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.760> wouldn't<00:02:27.970> really<00:02:28.090> see<00:02:28.330> anything<00:02:28.570> or

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
else you wouldn't really see anything or

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.480 
else you wouldn't really see anything or
would<00:02:29.080> be<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.230> ghast<00:02:29.530> fall<00:02:29.860> which<00:02:30.100> is<00:02:30.130> way<00:02:30.430> too

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
would be a ghast fall which is way too

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.250 
would be a ghast fall which is way too
overused<00:02:30.850> I'm<00:02:31.510> glad<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:31.959> he<00:02:32.050> did<00:02:32.200> something

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
overused I'm glad that he did something

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.980 
overused I'm glad that he did something
like<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:33.400> shoots<00:02:33.730> it's<00:02:34.209> not<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.690> don't

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
like that it shoots it's not I don't

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.210 
like that it shoots it's not I don't
know<00:02:35.050> if<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:35.200> is<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.380> bug<00:02:35.560> or<00:02:35.709> not<00:02:35.890> but<00:02:36.130> it

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
know if this is a bug or not but it

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.430 
know if this is a bug or not but it
doesn't<00:02:36.490> always<00:02:36.700> work<00:02:37.000> maybe<00:02:37.300> it's<00:02:37.510> just<00:02:37.570> just

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
doesn't always work maybe it's just just

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.710 
doesn't always work maybe it's just just
something<00:02:39.220> more<00:02:39.640> realistic<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.390> don't<00:02:40.600> know

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
something more realistic I don't know

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.710 
something more realistic I don't know
that<00:02:41.110> just<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:41.560> was<00:02:41.980> weird<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:43.209> burns<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:45.720> dirt

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
that just I was weird it burns a dirt

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.810 
that just I was weird it burns a dirt
apparently<00:02:47.230> I<00:02:47.410> honestly<00:02:48.250> didn't<00:02:48.489> know<00:02:48.610> that<00:02:48.790> I

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
apparently I honestly didn't know that I

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.010 
apparently I honestly didn't know that I
kind<00:02:49.120> of<00:02:49.209> sworn<00:02:49.390> i<00:02:49.510> was<00:02:49.600> doing<00:02:49.750> this<00:02:49.840> before

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
kind of sworn i was doing this before

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.630 
kind of sworn i was doing this before
and<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.590> was<00:02:50.650> not<00:02:50.890> doing<00:02:51.100> it<00:02:51.900> burns<00:02:52.900> everything

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
and it was not doing it burns everything

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.580 
and it was not doing it burns everything
cool<00:02:55.770> let's<00:02:56.770> see<00:02:56.830> if<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.040> burns<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.340> video<00:02:57.580> i

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
cool let's see if it burns a video i

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.449 
cool let's see if it burns a video i
just<00:02:59.590> want<00:02:59.739> to<00:02:59.770> see<00:03:00.010> because<00:03:00.160> i<00:03:00.310> actually

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
just want to see because i actually

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.890 
just want to see because i actually
didn't<00:03:00.790> even<00:03:00.910> know<00:03:00.970> what<00:03:01.090> did<00:03:01.209> this<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:01.600> i<00:03:01.750> was

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
didn't even know what did this and i was

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.960 
didn't even know what did this and i was
using<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.380> for<00:03:02.560> quite<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.739> while<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:02.970> shred

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
using it for quite a while to shred

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.900 
using it for quite a while to shred
minium<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.690> bedroll

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.220 

yeah<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:12.020> doesn't<00:03:12.170> burn<00:03:12.440> those<00:03:14.020> wait<00:03:15.020> maybe

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
yeah it doesn't burn those wait maybe

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.720 
yeah it doesn't burn those wait maybe
you<00:03:15.410> have<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.650> shoot<00:03:15.860> it<00:03:16.040> at<00:03:16.160> a<00:03:16.190> certain<00:03:16.430> way

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
you have to shoot it at a certain way

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.250 
you have to shoot it at a certain way
yeah<00:03:17.390> I<00:03:17.420> think<00:03:17.570> you<00:03:17.690> have<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.840> shoot<00:03:18.050> at<00:03:18.230> a

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
yeah I think you have to shoot at a

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.310 
yeah I think you have to shoot at a
certain<00:03:18.530> way<00:03:18.770> maybe<00:03:19.070> from<00:03:19.400> an<00:03:19.970> upper<00:03:20.360> angle<00:03:20.810> no

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
certain way maybe from an upper angle no

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.660 
certain way maybe from an upper angle no
it<00:03:21.530> doesn't<00:03:21.800> shoot<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:22.160> doesn't<00:03:22.430> burn<00:03:22.490> these

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
it doesn't shoot it doesn't burn these

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.270 
it doesn't shoot it doesn't burn these
that's<00:03:22.880> pretty<00:03:23.090> cool<00:03:23.240> I<00:03:23.330> guess<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:25.040> it's<00:03:25.190> only

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
that's pretty cool I guess so it's only

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.130 
that's pretty cool I guess so it's only
go<00:03:25.490> by<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:25.940> way<00:03:26.150> if<00:03:26.270> I<00:03:26.360> didn't<00:03:26.630> say<00:03:26.960> this

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
go by the way if I didn't say this

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.200 
go by the way if I didn't say this
already<00:03:27.350> I<00:03:27.590> probably<00:03:28.160> did<00:03:28.400> but<00:03:28.550> you<00:03:29.030> need

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
already I probably did but you need

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.140 
already I probably did but you need
magic<00:03:29.360> powder<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:30.560> yep<00:03:31.160> so<00:03:31.700> you're<00:03:32.030> gonna

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
magic powder and yep so you're gonna

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.940 
magic powder and yep so you're gonna
have<00:03:32.330> to<00:03:32.420> spawn<00:03:32.720> that<00:03:32.930> if<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.410> drops<00:03:33.770> are

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
have to spawn that if the drops are

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.740 
have to spawn that if the drops are
truly<00:03:34.310> not<00:03:34.490> working<00:03:34.850> unless<00:03:35.240> it's<00:03:35.480> my

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
truly not working unless it's my

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.080 
truly not working unless it's my
minecraft<00:03:36.200> only<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.890> water<00:03:37.160> one<00:03:37.430> I<00:03:37.580> kind<00:03:37.970> of

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
minecraft only the water one I kind of

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.060 
minecraft only the water one I kind of
I'm<00:03:38.570> kind<00:03:38.900> of<00:03:39.020> not<00:03:39.140> understanding<00:03:39.320> it<00:03:39.920> too

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
I'm kind of not understanding it too

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.700 
I'm kind of not understanding it too
well<00:03:40.720> maybe<00:03:41.720> I'm<00:03:41.930> missing<00:03:42.200> something<00:03:42.350> and

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
well maybe I'm missing something and

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.890 
well maybe I'm missing something and
maybe<00:03:43.370> it's<00:03:43.580> just<00:03:43.640> not<00:03:43.940> working<00:03:44.210> properly<00:03:44.600> or

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
maybe it's just not working properly or

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.180 
maybe it's just not working properly or
something<00:03:45.260> but<00:03:45.950> we<00:03:46.940> go<00:03:47.440> what<00:03:48.440> I<00:03:48.470> find<00:03:48.830> what<00:03:49.100> it

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.770 
you use it that's the only thing i can
figure<00:04:08.420> out<00:04:08.660> it<00:04:08.840> it<00:04:09.200> does<00:04:09.530> it<00:04:10.100> doesn't<00:04:10.370> like

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
figure out it it does it doesn't like

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.210 
figure out it it does it doesn't like
you<00:04:11.780> all<00:04:11.900> you'll<00:04:12.080> see<00:04:12.290> what<00:04:12.560> other<00:04:12.800> thing<00:04:13.100> i

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
you all you'll see what other thing i

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.310 
you all you'll see what other thing i
thought<00:04:13.460> it<00:04:13.610> might<00:04:13.730> do<00:04:13.910> but<00:04:14.210> it<00:04:14.330> doesn't<00:04:14.360> but

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
thought it might do but it doesn't but

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.650 
thought it might do but it doesn't but
ok<00:04:15.590> so<00:04:15.650> next<00:04:15.920> one<00:04:16.130> is<00:04:16.250> air<00:04:16.520> mod<00:04:16.670> this<00:04:17.209> one<00:04:17.390> is

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
ok so next one is air mod this one is

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.020 
ok so next one is air mod this one is
kind<00:04:18.020> of<00:04:18.109> just<00:04:18.140> allows<00:04:18.980> you<00:04:19.160> to<00:04:19.280> jump<00:04:19.760> up<00:04:19.910> in

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
kind of just allows you to jump up in

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.640 
kind of just allows you to jump up in
the<00:04:20.060> air<00:04:20.150> really<00:04:20.420> high<00:04:22.240> although<00:04:23.240> it<00:04:23.600> I<00:04:24.020> was

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
the air really high although it I was

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.710 
the air really high although it I was
getting<00:04:24.920> damaged<00:04:25.370> before<00:04:25.550> I<00:04:26.030> don't<00:04:26.419> know<00:04:26.510> why

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
getting damaged before I don't know why

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.890 
getting damaged before I don't know why
I'm<00:04:26.960> not<00:04:27.140> getting<00:04:27.440> hurt<00:04:27.710> now<00:04:28.010> I<00:04:28.480> don't<00:04:29.480> know<00:04:29.690> I

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
I'm not getting hurt now I don't know I

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.330 
I'm not getting hurt now I don't know I
have<00:04:30.140> no<00:04:30.260> clue<00:04:30.410> but<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:30.650> was<00:04:30.830> getting<00:04:31.070> damaged

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
have no clue but I was getting damaged

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.440 
have no clue but I was getting damaged
before<00:04:31.430> I<00:04:31.790> don't<00:04:32.060> know<00:04:32.390> who<00:04:32.660> I<00:04:32.810> just<00:04:33.080> stopped

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
before I don't know who I just stopped

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.510 
before I don't know who I just stopped
so<00:04:35.450> I<00:04:35.480> thought<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.930> maybe<00:04:36.260> that<00:04:36.860> this<00:04:37.280> might

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
so I thought the maybe that this might

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.909 
so I thought the maybe that this might
be<00:04:37.669> for<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:37.910> damage<00:04:38.390> but<00:04:39.050> yeah<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.560> doesn't<00:04:39.740> do

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
be for the damage but yeah it doesn't do

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.390 
be for the damage but yeah it doesn't do
that<00:04:40.070> um<00:04:41.060> so<00:04:41.330> yeah<00:04:41.690> that's<00:04:42.500> pretty<00:04:42.680> cool<00:04:43.340> i

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
that um so yeah that's pretty cool i

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.220 
that um so yeah that's pretty cool i
like<00:04:43.580> this<00:04:43.730> one<00:04:43.880> um<00:04:44.150> if<00:04:44.419> you're<00:04:44.660> wondering

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
like this one um if you're wondering

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.140 
like this one um if you're wondering
when<00:04:45.919> you<00:04:46.010> hit<00:04:46.220> it<00:04:46.310> up<00:04:46.430> in<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:46.640> air<00:04:46.669> it<00:04:46.910> doesn't

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
when you hit it up in the air it doesn't

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.640 
when you hit it up in the air it doesn't
do<00:04:47.210> anything<00:04:47.480> maybe<00:04:47.750> just<00:04:48.110> slows<00:04:48.380> down<00:04:48.410> your

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
do anything maybe just slows down your

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.430 
do anything maybe just slows down your
fall<00:04:49.100> doesn't<00:04:49.850> elevate<00:04:50.240> you<00:04:50.690> anymore<00:04:51.080> you

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
fall doesn't elevate you anymore you

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.780 
fall doesn't elevate you anymore you
have<00:04:51.560> to<00:04:51.680> be<00:04:51.770> standing<00:04:52.070> on<00:04:52.370> a<00:04:52.400> solid<00:04:52.669> surface

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
have to be standing on a solid surface

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.830 
have to be standing on a solid surface
in<00:04:53.360> order<00:04:53.450> for<00:04:53.960> it<00:04:53.990> to<00:04:54.230> launch<00:04:55.010> you<00:04:55.250> up<00:04:55.690> this<00:04:56.690> is

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
in order for it to launch you up this is

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.780 
in order for it to launch you up this is
the<00:04:56.930> earth<00:04:57.080> mod<00:04:57.410> this<00:04:57.770> is<00:04:57.919> a<00:04:57.950> very<00:04:58.070> cool<00:04:58.580> one

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
the earth mod this is a very cool one

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.630 
the earth mod this is a very cool one
actually<00:04:59.410> might<00:05:00.410> be<00:05:00.560> bugged<00:05:00.740> also<00:05:01.220> i<00:05:01.250> don't

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
actually might be bugged also i don't

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.220 
actually might be bugged also i don't
really<00:05:01.790> know<00:05:01.910> it's<00:05:02.330> kind<00:05:02.540> of<00:05:02.600> it<00:05:02.810> kind<00:05:03.050> of<00:05:03.110> acts

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
really know it's kind of it kind of acts

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.740 
really know it's kind of it kind of acts
weird<00:05:03.500> thus<00:05:04.070> and<00:05:04.370> it<00:05:04.550> deletes<00:05:04.910> blocks<00:05:05.360> under

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
weird thus and it deletes blocks under

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.510 
weird thus and it deletes blocks under
the<00:05:05.930> exact<00:05:06.230> amount<00:05:06.410> that<00:05:06.710> it<00:05:06.800> moves<00:05:07.010> up<00:05:07.280> i

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
the exact amount that it moves up i

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.040 
the exact amount that it moves up i
guess<00:05:07.850> it's<00:05:08.030> just<00:05:08.090> moving<00:05:08.419> the<00:05:08.630> earth<00:05:08.780> or

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
guess it's just moving the earth or

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.320 
guess it's just moving the earth or
something<00:05:09.370> I've<00:05:10.370> no<00:05:10.580> clue<00:05:10.700> why<00:05:10.880> sandstone

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
something I've no clue why sandstone

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.710 
something I've no clue why sandstone
just<00:05:11.510> got<00:05:11.630> created<00:05:12.050> that<00:05:12.260> was<00:05:12.350> weird<00:05:12.560> I<00:05:13.720> don't

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
just got created that was weird I don't

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.210 
just got created that was weird I don't
know<00:05:14.780> it's<00:05:14.960> kind<00:05:15.110> of<00:05:15.320> glitchy<00:05:15.560> like<00:05:15.800> that<00:05:16.010> I

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
know it's kind of glitchy like that I

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.140 
know it's kind of glitchy like that I
guess<00:05:17.180> it's<00:05:17.360> just<00:05:17.450> I<00:05:17.870> don't<00:05:18.740> really<00:05:19.220> know

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
guess it's just I don't really know

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.450 
guess it's just I don't really know
but<00:05:20.900> anyways<00:05:21.260> it<00:05:21.530> just<00:05:21.560> creates<00:05:22.040> what<00:05:22.220> I<00:05:22.250> hit

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
but anyways it just creates what I hit

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.550 
but anyways it just creates what I hit
its<00:05:22.610> own<00:05:22.730> when<00:05:22.940> I<00:05:22.970> headed<00:05:23.210> here<00:05:23.540> it<00:05:24.080> creates

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
its own when I headed here it creates

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.100 
its own when I headed here it creates
this<00:05:24.740> but<00:05:25.100> if<00:05:25.340> you<00:05:25.520> look<00:05:25.640> under<00:05:26.060> it<00:05:26.120> it<00:05:26.390> deletes

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
this but if you look under it it deletes

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.130 
this but if you look under it it deletes
that's<00:05:27.380> that<00:05:28.130> so<00:05:28.610> you<00:05:28.700> can<00:05:28.940> create<00:05:29.420> walls<00:05:29.720> but

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
that's that so you can create walls but

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.500 
that's that so you can create walls but
at<00:05:30.440> the<00:05:30.650> expense<00:05:30.740> of<00:05:31.280> losing<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.820> walls<00:05:32.000> and

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
at the expense of losing the walls and

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.790 
at the expense of losing the walls and
as<00:05:32.720> you<00:05:32.810> can<00:05:32.930> see<00:05:32.960> it's<00:05:33.170> kind<00:05:33.350> of<00:05:33.380> glitching

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
as you can see it's kind of glitching

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.890 
as you can see it's kind of glitching
out<00:05:33.860> for<00:05:34.130> me<00:05:34.220> I<00:05:34.490> don't<00:05:35.300> know<00:05:35.420> why<00:05:35.570> it's<00:05:35.810> doing

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
out for me I don't know why it's doing

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.100 
out for me I don't know why it's doing
that<00:05:36.700> but<00:05:37.700> yeah<00:05:38.030> you<00:05:38.090> can<00:05:38.270> do<00:05:38.510> this<00:05:38.630> with<00:05:38.690> every

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
that but yeah you can do this with every

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.490 
that but yeah you can do this with every
single<00:05:39.260> block<00:05:40.810> admit<00:05:41.810> oh<00:05:41.840> I<00:05:42.020> think<00:05:42.200> it<00:05:42.470> needs

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
single block admit oh I think it needs

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.680 
single block admit oh I think it needs
the<00:05:43.100> blocks<00:05:43.430> need<00:05:43.700> to<00:05:43.790> be<00:05:43.880> under<00:05:44.240> it<00:05:44.360> I<00:05:44.510> don't

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
the blocks need to be under it I don't

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.960 
the blocks need to be under it I don't
know<00:05:44.720> them<00:05:45.020> we<00:05:45.650> will<00:05:45.890> once<00:05:46.130> again<00:05:46.220> try<00:05:46.640> admin

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
know them we will once again try admin

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.060 
know them we will once again try admin
IAM<00:05:47.150> and<00:05:47.300> bedrock<00:05:47.920> probably<00:05:48.920> should<00:05:49.040> just

IAM and bedrock probably should just

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.300 
IAM and bedrock probably should just

yes it moves it up huh you can just keep
moving<00:05:55.970> it<00:05:56.150> up<00:05:57.220> that's<00:05:58.220> pretty<00:05:58.460> cool<00:05:58.660> and<00:06:00.220> then

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
you could get on the surface up there

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.830 
you could get on the surface up there
too<00:06:04.300> yeah<00:06:05.300> it's<00:06:05.630> too<00:06:05.840> high<00:06:06.370> anyways<00:06:07.810> so<00:06:08.810> yeah

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
there's not too much more for this mod I

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.270 
there's not too much more for this mod I
was<00:06:12.140> supposed<00:06:12.500> to<00:06:12.590> do<00:06:12.740> like<00:06:12.920> an<00:06:13.040> industrial

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100 
craft and like plastic crap I kind of

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.340 
craft and like plastic crap I kind of
need<00:06:16.250> a<00:06:16.280> break<00:06:16.520> from<00:06:16.700> the<00:06:16.880> bigger<00:06:17.030> mods<00:06:17.360> they

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
need a break from the bigger mods they

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.490 
need a break from the bigger mods they
are<00:06:18.500> very<00:06:19.100> they<00:06:19.490> take<00:06:20.060> a<00:06:20.270> long<00:06:20.630> time<00:06:20.930> to<00:06:20.990> do<00:06:21.260> it

getting to the longer one so I'm gonna
end<00:06:27.020> it<00:06:27.500> not<00:06:27.890> end<00:06:28.100> it<00:06:28.220> but<00:06:28.430> I'm<00:06:28.640> going<00:06:28.850> to<00:06:28.910> go

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
end it not end it but I'm going to go

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.760 
end it not end it but I'm going to go
into<00:06:29.240> the<00:06:29.630> part<00:06:29.960> that<00:06:30.110> I<00:06:30.140> said<00:06:30.380> I<00:06:30.410> was<00:06:30.590> going<00:06:30.680> to

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
into the part that I said I was going to

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.370 
into the part that I said I was going to
do<00:06:30.830> and<00:06:31.300> oh<00:06:32.300> I'm<00:06:32.900> just<00:06:33.440> going<00:06:33.650> to<00:06:33.710> spawn<00:06:34.250> a

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
do and oh I'm just going to spawn a

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.020 
do and oh I'm just going to spawn a
thousand<00:06:36.380> creepers<00:06:36.710> and<00:06:36.740> see<00:06:37.220> what<00:06:37.490> happens

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
thousand creepers and see what happens

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.370 
thousand creepers and see what happens
let's<00:06:38.330> see<00:06:38.450> how<00:06:38.510> much<00:06:38.600> sulfur<00:06:38.870> you<00:06:39.140> can<00:06:39.260> get

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
let's see how much sulfur you can get

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.100 
let's see how much sulfur you can get
from<00:06:39.710> a<00:06:39.890> thousand<00:06:40.580> creepers<00:06:40.910> I<00:06:41.120> just<00:06:41.840> want<00:06:42.020> to

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
from a thousand creepers I just want to

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.680 
from a thousand creepers I just want to
try<00:06:42.230> this<00:06:42.350> it<00:06:42.710> hopefully<00:06:43.520> won't<00:06:44.030> crash<00:06:44.480> my

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
try this it hopefully won't crash my

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.700 
try this it hopefully won't crash my
game<00:06:44.840> I<00:06:45.050> don't<00:06:45.260> think<00:06:45.410> it<00:06:45.800> will<00:06:46.720> so<00:06:47.720> I<00:06:48.260> don't

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
game I don't think it will so I don't

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.170 
game I don't think it will so I don't
think<00:06:48.800> so<00:06:49.010> it's<00:06:49.370> that<00:06:49.460> fairly<00:06:49.760> good<00:06:49.880> computer

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
think so it's that fairly good computer

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.060 
think so it's that fairly good computer
but<00:06:50.810> it<00:06:50.960> doesn't<00:06:51.200> always<00:06:51.350> depend<00:06:51.890> on<00:06:51.980> the

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.070 
but it doesn't always depend on the

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.830 
but it doesn't always depend on the
computer<00:06:52.430> it<00:06:52.520> depends<00:06:52.850> on<00:06:52.910> the<00:06:53.000> program<00:06:53.270> so

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
computer it depends on the program so

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.220 
computer it depends on the program so
we'll<00:06:54.350> see<00:06:54.500> I<00:06:54.740> think<00:06:55.040> it's<00:06:55.160> 50<00:06:55.690> yeah<00:06:56.690> it<00:06:56.750> is<00:06:57.020> it

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:57.230 
we'll see I think it's 50 yeah it is it

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.970 
we'll see I think it's 50 yeah it is it
especially<00:06:58.120> as<00:06:59.120> thousand<00:06:59.660> and<00:06:59.930> i'm<00:07:00.680> getting<00:07:00.920> a

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:00.980 
especially as thousand and i'm getting a

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.790 
especially as thousand and i'm getting a
shitload<00:07:01.190> of<00:07:01.430> leg<00:07:02.470> obviously<00:07:03.470> right<00:07:03.620> off<00:07:03.710> the

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 
there's tons of sulfur everywhere and as

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.060 
there's tons of sulfur everywhere and as
you<00:07:27.050> can<00:07:27.170> see<00:07:27.200> the<00:07:27.440> only<00:07:27.680> one<00:07:27.800> there's<00:07:27.950> like<00:07:28.040> a
