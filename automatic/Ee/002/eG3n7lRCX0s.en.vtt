00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.009
 Welcome to another video and today 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.030
 People are here with gta5 online to 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.560
 you 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.169
 and today I win I'm going to teach here 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.149
 very bizarre limit for you I do not even 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:24.359
 I know if this can be considered a 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:27.149
 bit or not but it is the following personal I 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.939
 I'll teach you how to walk there. 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:34.219
 skateboard in the personal game is not a skateboard 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.890
 true but let's just say it can be 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:41.640
 thus considered a supposed one board 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.239
 that you can ride a snowboard or 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.480
 skateboard can slide this board right 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.170
 It's like there's something like that. 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.800
 with skateboard beauty skateboard noubar riddle 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.230
 Borge, I think this is how it is spoken and 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.269
 way you want to talk 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.699
 first of all staff do not need to 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.759
 one of a titan airplane and the same as if from here 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.439
 that there is only one model said here will go 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.659
 need a personal titan plane has 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.110
 available here at the airport on this floor 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.780
 here having this personal titan plane will 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.140
 catch demolish it simple so or equal 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.780
 doing here demolished it personal you 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.119
 will see that you will pass a board 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.790
 so it just seems a surfboard 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.360
 understood then you will get a gun and 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.899
 go well here o well on top of it lets 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.329
 take the personal police out of the 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:42.780
 police here or I've already seen the bag 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:45.780
 Here you know I blew it, take you away. 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.560
 staff will think these apart from the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.229
 airplane 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.450
 You'll see up so the staff goes. 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.759
 get a gun and start to take 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.330
 people look lonely 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:02:01.310
 Look what a crazy thing to load. 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.710
 You throw it here you walk there it 's 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.910
 very crazy guy looks just left back 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.479
 what to show you 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.180
 I'll try to take it, I'll try to leave here. 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.880
 My little board went away 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:19.140
 Look, just leave it here again and you will. 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.500
 sliding from the simple area so it goes 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:26.610
 slipping here as if it were good 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.300
 a skateboard or snowboard and then the staff 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.820
 this is what it would be mass assumed right 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.340
 there comes an hour that only the 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.860
 it would be because the plane there disappeared 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.500
 but what would be more people to us 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.170
 get these pieces and type 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.360
 a mountain somewhere and so and 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.040
 people climb and start sliding in the 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.560
 Like a mountain, something like that. 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.420
 and gets very top link here disappeared because 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.230
 I should have stayed on top of him. 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:59.160
 shooting and before the plane out of here 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.790
 spawn it but then people from it 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.830
 here is a very bizarre trick for you there 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.769
 that you will be able to slide in the 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.150
 game here in gta using this method that 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.280
 I taught you 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.239
 so let me see if what I can get 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.670
 I do with jet fuel sometimes I can 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.100
 pooping already had a jet 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:25.440
 O there in front I will launch a 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:27.170
 bazooka each in him the lame so tendency is 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.790
 that the titan 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.320
 who knows with the jet also works 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.840
 because it will also release your 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.040
 parts ne 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.900
 the flight with the police even though we teach 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.090
 take this part here the bad is that well 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.150
 these very small matches then 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.980
 almost o works only that is the very part 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.450
 Little understood then there's no way you 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:55.470
 they will do with the wing that old will not and 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.510
 No fucking is not going on that shit. 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.160
 but then continues to work well serves 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.830
 so this is it, guys, I hope you have 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.440
 I liked this very fast video for you guys. 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.500
 teaching there just the way you want it 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.690
 talk skate or snowboard and slide 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.830
 with a board understood with the part of the 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.600
 airplane 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.430
 Hey guys let me tell you 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.320
