off<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:52.680> odd<00:00:55.610> USB<00:00:58.879> assuming<00:00:59.879> an<00:01:00.030> audio

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
off the odd USB assuming an audio

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:12.910 
off the odd USB assuming an audio
adapter<00:01:00.900> of<00:01:00.930> some<00:01:01.050> sort<00:01:05.270> headphones<00:01:08.810> remote

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.210 

power<00:01:13.920> cord<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:15.440> surprisingly<00:01:16.440> they<00:01:16.680> sent<00:01:17.040> me

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
power cord and surprisingly they sent me

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.219 
power cord and surprisingly they sent me
I<00:01:17.490> mean<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.210> knew<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.360> was<00:01:18.540> getting<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.840> European

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
I mean I knew I was getting the European

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.359 
I mean I knew I was getting the European
versions<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:19.680> actually<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.040> don't<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.280> an

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
versions but actually I don't have an

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.999 
versions but actually I don't have an
adapter<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:22.020> I'm<00:01:22.080> going<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.440> to<00:01:22.470> somehow

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
adapter so I'm going to have to somehow

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.160 
adapter so I'm going to have to somehow
score<00:01:23.729> one<00:01:23.940> because<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.660> just<00:01:24.810> charge<00:01:24.990> it

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
score one because I can just charge it

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.359 
score one because I can just charge it
off<00:01:25.290> my<00:01:25.560> computer<00:01:26.270> since<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.450> probably<00:01:28.369> USB

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
off my computer since it's probably USB

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.359 
off my computer since it's probably USB
I<00:01:32.540> guess<00:01:33.540> what<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.899> probably<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.380> carrying<00:01:35.220> case

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
I guess what is probably a carrying case

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.260 
I guess what is probably a carrying case
a<00:01:35.430> rag<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:36.270> keeping<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.660> nice<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.050> shiny<00:01:37.410> and

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
a rag for keeping it nice and shiny and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.050 
a rag for keeping it nice and shiny and
then<00:01:39.270> probably<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:40.729> software<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.970> I'll

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
then probably what software that I'll

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:53.859 
then probably what software that I'll
never<00:01:42.270> use<00:01:47.540> and<00:01:48.540> then<00:01:50.330> there<00:01:51.330> you<00:01:51.420> have<00:01:51.630> it

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.980 

nokia<00:01:54.869> n97<00:01:55.799> oh<00:01:59.060> this<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.210> most<00:02:00.450> satisfying

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
nokia n97 oh this is the most satisfying

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.610
