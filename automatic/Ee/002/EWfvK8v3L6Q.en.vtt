00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
do this on so I will do the tracing and

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.530 
do this on so I will do the tracing and
everything<00:03:25.750> using<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:27.109> cardboard<00:03:27.739> box<00:03:28.540> be

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
everything using a cardboard box be

careful with tracing on cardboard

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.349 
careful with tracing on cardboard
because<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:32.209> has<00:03:32.389> the<00:03:32.599> ridges<00:03:32.959> and<00:03:34.359> quite

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
because it has the ridges and quite

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:36.939 
because it has the ridges and quite
naturally<00:03:35.540> if<00:03:36.049> you're<00:03:36.260> not<00:03:36.409> careful<00:03:36.620> you'll

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:36.949 
naturally if you're not careful you'll

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:40.420 
naturally if you're not careful you'll
have<00:03:37.099> ridges<00:03:37.519> and<00:03:38.209> your<00:03:38.419> stencil<00:03:38.900> but<00:03:39.470> to<00:03:40.250> me

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
have ridges and your stencil but to me

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.770 
have ridges and your stencil but to me
it<00:03:40.549> doesn't<00:03:40.579> really<00:03:40.879> matter<00:03:41.209> because<00:03:41.449> it<00:03:41.750> is

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
it doesn't really matter because it is

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.189 
it doesn't really matter because it is
just<00:03:42.349> tracing<00:03:43.010> a<00:03:43.129> stencil<00:03:44.049> once<00:03:45.049> you're

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
just tracing a stencil once you're

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:46.780 
just tracing a stencil once you're
painting<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:45.769> everything<00:03:45.859> you<00:03:46.459> should<00:03:46.519> be

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
painting and everything you should be

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.449 
painting and everything you should be
fine<00:03:47.590> but<00:03:48.590> that's<00:03:48.799> one<00:03:48.919> of<00:03:48.979> the<00:03:49.099> things<00:03:49.310> I'll

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
fine but that's one of the things I'll

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.719 
fine but that's one of the things I'll
let<00:03:49.669> you<00:03:49.790> know<00:03:49.819> how<00:03:50.180> it<00:03:50.329> turns<00:03:50.510> out<00:03:51.310> my<00:03:52.310> stencil

letters out from the paper and tape them

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.460 
letters out from the paper and tape them
together<00:04:33.130> to<00:04:33.550> create<00:04:33.580> a<00:04:33.849> stencil<00:04:34.349> there<00:04:35.349> is<00:04:35.440> a

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
together to create a stencil there is a

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.559 
together to create a stencil there is a
easier<00:04:35.860> way<00:04:35.919> to<00:04:36.009> do<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:36.550> can<00:04:36.759> upload<00:04:37.180> it<00:04:37.419> I

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:37.569 
easier way to do it you can upload it I

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.020 
easier way to do it you can upload it I
think<00:04:37.780> to<00:04:37.930> FedEx<00:04:38.740> Kinkos<00:04:38.949> but<00:04:39.789> there's<00:04:39.970> a

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
think to FedEx Kinkos but there's a

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.969 
think to FedEx Kinkos but there's a
price<00:04:40.240> associated<00:04:40.630> with<00:04:41.050> that<00:04:41.199> this<00:04:41.500> was<00:04:41.710> free

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
price associated with that this was free

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.610
