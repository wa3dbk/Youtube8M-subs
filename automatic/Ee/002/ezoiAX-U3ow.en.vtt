in the comments section as well before I
get<00:00:18.060> started<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.660> want<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.020> say<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.410> i<00:00:19.439> have

get started I want to say that i have

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.410 
get started I want to say that i have
really<00:00:19.740> liked<00:00:20.220> what<00:00:20.609> sledgehammer<00:00:21.090> has<00:00:21.240> done

really liked what sledgehammer has done
so<00:00:21.570> far<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.900> think<00:00:22.020> advanced<00:00:22.439> warfare<00:00:22.830> looks

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
so far I think advanced warfare looks

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.620 
so far I think advanced warfare looks
really<00:00:23.279> good<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.640> I'm<00:00:24.150> thrilled<00:00:24.449> that

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
really good and I'm thrilled that

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.420 
really good and I'm thrilled that
sledgehammer<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.500> point<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:25.980> listened

this list I'm starting off at number 5 I
don't<00:00:33.840> want<00:00:34.079> advanced<00:00:34.500> warfare<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.040> turn<00:00:35.309> into

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
don't want advanced warfare to turn into

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.580 
don't want advanced warfare to turn into
a<00:00:35.640> pay<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> win<00:00:36.450> game<00:00:36.809> what<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.050> mean<00:00:37.260> by<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.440> is

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
a pay to win game what I mean by this is

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.590 
a pay to win game what I mean by this is
I<00:00:37.860> don't<00:00:37.920> want<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.399> new<00:00:38.550> supply<00:00:38.790> drops<00:00:39.300> to

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
I don't want the new supply drops to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.750 
I don't want the new supply drops to
become<00:00:39.989> monetized<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.770> DLC<00:00:41.250> or<00:00:41.280> micro

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
become monetized as DLC or micro

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.389 
become monetized as DLC or micro
transactions<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.840> reward<00:00:43.829> players<00:00:44.040> with

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
transactions and reward players with

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.279 
transactions and reward players with
much<00:00:44.610> better<00:00:44.820> weapons<00:00:45.300> now<00:00:45.750> I'm<00:00:45.870> not<00:00:45.899> sure<00:00:46.020> if

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
much better weapons now I'm not sure if

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.959 
much better weapons now I'm not sure if
this<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.559> even<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.160> happen<00:00:47.460> or<00:00:47.640> if<00:00:47.820> it

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
this is even going to happen or if it

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.790 
this is even going to happen or if it
did<00:00:48.180> happen<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.870> would<00:00:48.989> actually<00:00:49.200> ruin

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
did happen that it would actually ruin

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.860 
did happen that it would actually ruin
the<00:00:49.890> balance<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> game<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.629> did

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the balance of the game but if it did

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.990 
the balance of the game but if it did
turn<00:00:52.110> into<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> paid<00:00:52.739> win<00:00:53.010> system<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.550> think<00:00:53.760> that

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
turn into a paid win system I think that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.639 
turn into a paid win system I think that
would<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.390> horrible<00:00:54.690> for<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.350> call<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.620> duty

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
would be horrible for the call of duty

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.099 
would be horrible for the call of duty
franchise<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.550> bit<00:00:57.239> more<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.510> say<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
franchise a bit more to say on the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.660 
franchise a bit more to say on the
subject<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.739> some<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.980> my<00:00:59.039> predictions<00:00:59.520> about

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
subject and some of my predictions about

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.939 
subject and some of my predictions about
what<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.180> might<00:01:00.780> happen<00:01:01.050> with<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
what I think might happen with the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.250 
what I think might happen with the
supply<00:01:02.219> Jobson<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:03.030> them<00:01:03.690> possibly

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
supply Jobson in them possibly

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.859 
supply Jobson in them possibly
monetizing<00:01:04.860> them<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.280> what<00:01:05.820> monetizing<00:01:06.450> them

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
monetizing them and what monetizing them

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.560 
monetizing them and what monetizing them
might<00:01:07.229> even<00:01:07.500> imply<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.030> stay<00:01:09.210> tuned<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:09.420> that

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
might even imply so stay tuned for that

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.270 
might even imply so stay tuned for that

now<00:03:34.440> sledgehammer<00:03:34.890> will<00:03:35.160> say<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.640> they<00:03:35.700> have

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
now sledgehammer will say and they have

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.610 
now sledgehammer will say and they have
said<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:36.329> with<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.630> new<00:03:36.750> XO<00:03:37.140> movement<00:03:37.530> you

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
said that with the new XO movement you

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.440 
said that with the new XO movement you
can<00:03:37.799> now<00:03:37.920> get<00:03:38.100> out<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.519> way<00:03:38.670> of<00:03:38.819> explosives

can now get out of the way of explosives

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.690 
can now get out of the way of explosives
easier<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.470> that's<00:03:40.680> why<00:03:40.829> I<00:03:40.859> danger-close<00:03:41.250> is

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
easier so that's why I danger-close is

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.509 
easier so that's why I danger-close is
not<00:03:41.940> going<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.180> be<00:03:42.329> overpowered<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:44.280> me<00:03:44.430> it
